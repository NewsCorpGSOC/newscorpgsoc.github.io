Ukraine authorities report 8 killed, 49 injured in Russian attacks		https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-authorities-report-8-killed-49-injured-in-russian-attacks/7801903.html	2024-09-27T08:58:53-07:00	
Ethnic Chin refugees in Malaysia accuse UN agency of mistreatment	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — Ethnic Chin refugees from Myanmar in Malaysia are accusing the United Nations refugee agency UNHCR of abuse and of not providing necessary protection, potentially putting lives at risk. Hundreds of members of the Alliance of Chin Refugees held a demonstration Thursday outside the UNHCR office in Malaysia’s capital, Kuala Lumpur. Chins, most of whom are Christians, are an ethnic and religious minority in Buddhist-majority Myanmar who face repression that has led to violent conflicts there. In recent decades, waves of ethnic Chins have fled the country, many to Malaysia. U.N. figures from last month show there are about 27,250 ethnic Chin refugees and asylum-seekers in Malaysia registered with UNHCR. But James Bawl Thang Bik, chairman of the Alliance of Chin Refugees, told VOA on Thursday there are tens of thousands more who are not registered. He also said the UNHCR takes too long to make decisions for asylum-seekers who have applied for refugee status. 'The process can take years,' he said. VOA asked UNHCR Malaysia how long it typically takes for an applicant to get a decision on their case but did not receive an immediate answer. Further complicating matters, Malaysia has not signed the United Nations refugee convention and does not officially recognize refugees, viewing them as illegal immigrants. UNHCR registration provides some protection that typically prevents arrest, but the refugees are still not allowed to attend government schools or work legally — although many take off-the-books jobs, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by employers, according to migrant rights groups. James Bawl Thang Bik said that after Myanmar’s 2021 coup approximately 50 ethnic Chin Myanmar soldiers and police officers fled to Malaysia because they refused to fight for Myanmar's military. He said some of them have been arrested and are in detention in Malaysia because they lack UNHCR documentation. 'If these former soldiers and policemen get sent back to Myanmar their lives could be in danger,' he said. 'UNHCR needs to prioritize these types of cases and register them quickly.' UNHCR documentation also gives refugees access to medical care at public hospitals for lower prices than what foreigners typically pay but the Alliance of Chin Refugees said asylum-seekers without UNHCR documentation frequently need medical treatment but cannot get it. 'The UNHCR needs to meet with these people immediately and give them the necessary status and documentation,' Bik said, mentioning cases of people with broken bones and serious infections. Responding to media inquiries after Thursday’s demonstration, the United Nations refugee agency released a written statement that said: 'UNHCR wishes to emphasize that we recognize the frustration felt by many refugee communities living in the complex protection environment in Malaysia where they lack legal status, are unable to access legal work or formal education. … UNHCR is doing its utmost to protect and assist refugees. This includes prioritizing protection and assistance interventions for highly vulnerable refugees.' Additionally, Bik said he has received reports about security guards outside the UNHCR office punching and kicking ethnic Chins trying to get in without appointments. UNHCR responded in its written statement saying it has 'zero tolerance' for this type of treatment but also said: 'At this time, we have not received any reports of abuse by security personnel from any individual refugee from the Chin Community.' The alliance chairman dismissed the UNHCR’s response as false. 'We have told them about mistreatment many times,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethnic-chin-refugees-in-malaysia-accuse-un-agency-of-mistreatment/7801860.html	2024-09-27T08:43:40-07:00	
Trump to meet Zelenskyy amid tension, Republican criticism of Ukraine	Washington — Former President Donald Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in New York on Friday, amid increased skepticism of U.S. support for Ukraine’s war efforts from the Republican presidential nominee and lawmakers loyal to him. Trump announced the meeting at a press conference Thursday, which was confirmed for VOA by Zelenskyy’s team. The meeting comes a day after the Ukrainian leader met with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris Thursday to discuss U.S. support for the war in Ukraine. Tension has been brewing between the two leaders. Trump is known for his skeptical remarks on U.S. involvement in Ukraine and claims that he can quickly end the conflict by making a deal between Ukraine and Russia, if elected. During a campaign event on Wednesday, Trump slammed Zelenskyy for making 'little, nasty aspersions' toward him. He appeared to be referring to Zelenskyy’s comments in a recent New Yorker magazine article that Trump 'doesn’t really know how to stop the war even if he might think he knows how.' Trump suggested the Ukrainian leader together with the Biden administration are at fault for prolonging the war that followed Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 'Biden and Kamala allowed this to happen by feeding Zelenskyy money and munitions like no country has ever seen before,' Trump said in North Carolina. He argued that Kyiv should have made concessions to Moscow before Russian troops attacked, asserting that Ukraine is now 'in rubble' and in no position to negotiate the war’s end. 'Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,' said Trump. The former U.S. president has repeatedly said he wants the Russia-Ukraine war to end but has not stated whether he wants Kyiv to win or keep all its territories. His position stands in contrast with that of Biden and Harris, who have championed American aid and military support for the embattled country. 'Ukraine will prevail, and we'll continue to stand by you every step of the way,' Biden said Thursday as he met with Zelenskyy at the White House. During her meeting with Zelenskyy, Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, reiterated the administration’s support for Kyiv’s war efforts and underscored that it is up to Ukraine to decide how the war will end. Without mentioning his name, Harris criticized Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance, whose proposal to end the war would mean Ukraine had less territory and would not join NATO. 'These proposals are the same of those of Putin, and let us be clear, they are not proposals for peace,' she said. 'Instead, they are proposals for surrender, which is dangerous and unacceptable.' Vance suggested in a recent interview that Ukraine and Russia halt fighting and create a demilitarized zone at the current battle lines. Kyiv would need to adhere to a neutral status and stop its bid to join NATO. Zelenskyy, in the same New Yorker interview, said that Vance’s plan would 'give up' Ukrainian territory, calling Trump’s running mate 'too radical.' 'His message seems to be that Ukraine must make a sacrifice,' he said. 'The idea that the world should end this war at Ukraine’s expense is unacceptable.' Zelenskyy, who has been in the United States since Sunday to attend the United Nations General Assembly in New York, was scheduled to depart Thursday but extended his visit as Trump announced the meeting. Partisan politics On Wednesday, congressional Republicans loyal to Trump demanded that the Ukrainian leader fire his ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova, for organizing Zelenskyy's visit earlier this week to an ammunition factory in Pennsylvania, a hotly contested battleground state in the November U.S. presidential election. Zelenskyy met with the Democratic governor of the state, Josh Shapiro. In a letter to Zelenskyy, Republican House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson said the visit to the factory that made munitions for Ukraine was a 'partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats' that amounts to 'election interference.' The White House called Johnson’s letter a 'political stunt' and pointed out that Zelenskyy recently met the Republican governor of Utah, Spencer Cox, in a 'similar event.' Ahead of Zelenskyy’s visit, the U.S. administration announced $8 billion in new aid for Ukraine. In a statement, Biden said the aid includes a Patriot missile battery and missiles, as well as air-to-ground munitions and a precision-guided glide bomb with a range of up to 130 kilometers. The White House said no announcement was imminent regarding Ukraine’s request for weapons donors to allow Ukrainian forces to use the weapons to strike targets deeper inside Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-meet-zelenskyy-amid-tension-republican-criticism-of-ukraine/7801726.html	2024-09-27T07:05:19-07:00

As Ukraine war enters a critical period, the EU moves ahead without the US	BRUSSELS — s the war in Ukraine enters a critical period, the European Union has decided that it must take responsibility for what it sees as an existential threat to security in its own neighborhood and is preparing to tackle some of the financial burden, perhaps even without the United States. EU envoys have been working in Brussels this week on a proposal to provide Ukraine with a hefty loan package worth up to $39 billion. It was announced by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen during a trip to Kyiv last Friday. 'Crucially, this loan will flow straight into your national budget,' she told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. 'It will provide you with significant and much-needed fiscal space. You will decide how best to use the funds, giving you maximum flexibility to meet your needs.' Zelenskyy wants to buy weapons and bomb shelters and rebuild Ukraine's shattered energy network as winter draws near. In international matters, particularly involving major conflicts, the EU rarely moves ahead without the U.S., but it hopes this decision will encourage others to come forward. Russian troops and an election close in Almost 1,000 days since their full-scale invasion, Russian forces are making advances in the east. Ukraine’s army has a shaky hold on part of the Kursk region in Russia, which has provided a temporary morale boost, but as casualties mount it remains outmanned and outgunned. On the political front, Zelenskyy hopes to secure support for a 'victory plan' that might force Russian President Vladimir Putin to the negotiating table. He’s trying to persuade U.S. President Joe Biden and other allies to help strengthen Ukraine’s hand in any future talks. But a U.S. election looms, and polls suggest that Donald Trump might return to the White House in January. Trump has been critical of U.S. aid to Ukraine. On Wednesday, he said Zelenskyy should have made concessions to Putin before the invasion began in February 2022. Most of the 27-nation EU fears that a Putin victory would lead to deep uncertainty. Russia’s armed forces are depleted and currently incapable of another war, but the prospect of a future land grab in Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania or Poland remains. Reworking a G7 loan plan The EU loans are part of a plan by the Group of Seven major industrialized nations to take advantage of interest earned on about $250 billion worth of frozen Russian assets, most of them held in Europe. These windfall profits are estimated at around $5 billion to $6 billion a year. The profits underpin the G7 plan. The EU would stump up $20 billion, the U.S. $20 billion, and Canada, Japan and the U.K. $10 billion together, for a combined total of $50 billion. The scheme expires at the end of the year, before the next U.S. president takes office. Now, amid differences over how long the Russian asset freeze should be guaranteed, the EU has decided to go it alone. Its offer of up to $39 billion in loans accounts for almost the entirety of the U.S. share as well. The U.S. wants to ensure that the assets are locked away for at least three years to guarantee the income. But EU member Hungary insists this should only happen in 6-month increments. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán styles himself as a peacemaker and is too close to Putin for many of his partners' comfort. The other 26 EU countries feel they must move now because time is running out. Evolving alliance with the United States The U.S. election is just weeks away. The Europeans are wary of Trump’s unpredictability and are testing scenarios to help protect themselves from the kind of battering, like tariff hikes, their economies received during his past presidency. But they also see the Democrats as more inward looking these days. Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act left European leaders fuming over rules that favored American products. China and war in the Middle East are the foreign policy priorities of Democrat or Republican candidates alike, and for now the U.S. is in the grip of election campaign fever. The EU hopes that Vice President Kamala Harris, if she is elected president, would enter the loan program as previously planned and reduce the EU's financial burden. But that remains an open question for now, and EU members say Ukraine’s position is too precarious to hesitate. Political delays in the U.S. Congress last year over a $60 billion support package starved Ukrainian troops of weapons and ammunition for months, resulting in 'real consequences on the battlefield,' in the words of NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg. Pressing ahead on pressing needs Helping Ukraine in military terms is a challenge for the Europeans. They could not do it alone, and cannot match the U.S. transport, logistics and equipment superiority, despite progress in ramping up their defense industries to supply arms and ammunition. But the world’s biggest trading bloc does wield economic might. It has already given Ukraine about $132 billion since the full-scale invasion started. Within weeks it appears ready to provide tens of billions more, even though going it alone is not in the EU's DNA. 'I do not know what the Americans, the United States with the new presidency, will do or not,' EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said on Tuesday. But, he said, 'as long as the Ukrainians want to resist, we have to support them. Otherwise, we will make a historical mistake.' The Biden administration did announce Wednesday that the U.S. will send Ukraine a major military aid package, including cluster bombs and an array of rockets, artillery and armored vehicles. A U.S. official also said billions of dollars more in assistance would arrive over the coming months. Meanwhile, deliberations on the EU's share of the G7 loan package will be high on the agenda of a summit of the bloc's leaders in Brussels on October 17-18.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-ukraine-war-enters-a-critical-period-the-eu-moves-ahead-without-the-us-/7801558.html	2024-09-27T04:56:58-07:00	
Israel to continue cease-fire discussions for Lebanon, Netanyahu says	JERUSALEM/BEIRUT — Israel will continue to discuss cease-fire proposals for Lebanon in the days ahead, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said on Friday, as Washington warned that further escalation would only make it harder for civilians on both sides to return home. Israel's foreign minister on Thursday rejected global calls for a cease-fire with the Iran-backed Hezbollah group and pressed ahead with airstrikes that have killed hundreds in Lebanon and heightened fears of a regional war. An Israeli strike on Friday killed nine members of a family, including four children, in the Lebanese border town of Shebaa, mayor Mohammad Saab told Reuters. Israeli attacks have killed more than 600 people in Lebanon since Monday, the health ministry says. Hezbollah said it had fired rockets into Israel on Friday at Kiryat Ata near the city of Haifa some 30 kilometers from the border, and the city of Tiberias, declaring the attacks a response to Israel strikes on villages, cities and civilians. Though Israeli air defenses have shot down many of Hezbollah's rockets, limiting the damage they've done, the group's attacks have shut down normal life across much of northern Israel as more areas fall into its crosshairs. The Israeli military said it had intercepted four unmanned aircraft that crossed from Lebanese territory into the maritime space off the coast of Rosh Hanikra at the Lebanese border. The conflict between Israel and the heavily armed Hezbollah is their worst in more than 18 years and part of the spillover that has swept through the Middle East as a result of the Gaza War. Syrian state media reported that an Israeli airstrike on Friday killed five soldiers in Syria, where Israel has intensified a years-long campaign aimed at rolling back the influence of Iran and Hezbollah. The United States and France proposed on Wednesday an immediate 21-day truce across the Lebanese-Israeli border, and said negotiations continued, including on the sidelines of a United Nations meeting in New York. Netanyahu said on Friday that Israeli teams had meetings to discuss the U.S. ceasefire proposals on Thursday and would continue discussions in the days ahead, adding that he appreciated the U.S. efforts. 'Our teams met [September 26] to discuss the U.S. initiative and how we can advance the shared goal of returning people safely to their homes. We will continue those discussions in the coming days,' he said in a statement. On Thursday, after Netanyahu left for New York where he is attending the United Nations General Assembly, his office issued a statement saying the prime minister had ordered Israeli troops to continue fighting with full force in Lebanon. His statement made no reference to the comments of Foreign Minister Israel Katz, who on Thursday rejected ceasefire proposals, or other Israeli politicians who have echoed that position, saying only that there had been 'a lot of misreporting around the U.S.-led ceasefire initiative.' Blinken stresses importance of cease-fire Israel says its campaign aims to secure the return home of tens of thousands of Israelis who have been forced to evacuate areas near the Lebanese border over the last year of hostilities. Hezbollah began firing at Israel on October 8 as the Gaza war began, declaring solidarity with the Palestinians. Hezbollah has said it will only cease fire when Israel's Gaza offensive ends. In Lebanon, more than 90,000 people have been reported as newly displaced this week, according to the U.N. International Organization for Migration, or IOM, adding to more than 111,000 already uprooted by the conflict. The U.N. refugee agency UNHCR said 30,000 people had crossed from Lebanon into Syria in the last few days, 80% of them Syrians. Well over a million Syrians fled to Lebanon during the Syrian civil war that erupted in 2011. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Israel further escalation would only make it harder for civilians to return home on both sides of the border, the State Department said. 'The Secretary discussed the importance of reaching an agreement on the 21-day cease-fire across the Israel-Lebanon border,' the State Department said in a statement on Thursday, referring to talks between Blinken and Israeli Minister for Strategic Affairs Ron Dermer. 'He underscored that further escalation of the conflict will only make that objective [of civilian return] more difficult.' The State Department added that Blinken also discussed efforts to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and steps that Israel needs to take to improve delivery of humanitarian assistance in the enclave where nearly the entire 2.3 million population is displaced and faces a hunger crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-to-continue-cease-fire-discussions-for-lebanon-netanyahu-says-/7801552.html	2024-09-27T04:40:28-07:00	
Trump and Zelenskyy will meet as tensions rise over US backing for Ukraine	NEW YORK — Donald Trump is set to meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy as public tensions have been rising between the two over Ukraine's defense against Russia's invasion. Trump said Zelenskyy asked for the meeting. The visit is set for about 9:45 a.m. Eastern Time at Trump Tower in New York, less than a day after Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent, met with the Ukrainian leader and expressed unwavering support. 'I look forward to seeing him tomorrow,' Trump said in a press conference Thursday. 'I believe I will be able to make a deal between President [Vladimir] Putin and President Zelenskyy, quite quickly.' The meeting is highly anticipated and comes as Election Day nears, with Trump and Harris taking sharply different positions on backing Ukraine in the third year of its war with Russia. Trump argues Putin would never have invaded had he been president while derisively calling Zelenskyy a 'salesman' for getting U.S. assistance for Ukraine. Trump has in recent days praised Russia’s historic military victories and insisted the U.S. needs 'to get out' and end its involvement with Ukraine. Friday's meeting almost wasn't scheduled despite Zelenskyy’s office saying something had been planned during the Ukrainian leader’s visit to the U.N. General Assembly, during which he is making his endgame pitch to allies. In an interview with The New Yorker magazine that was published earlier this week, Zelenskyy implied Trump does not understand and oversimplifies the conflict. The Ukrainian leader said Trump's running mate JD Vance was 'too radical' and had essentially advocated for Ukraine to 'make a sacrifice' by 'giving up its territories.' Trump ripped Zelenskyy and Ukraine on two separate occasions this week. Speaking Wednesday in North Carolina, Trump referred to Ukraine as 'demolished' and its people as 'dead.' 'Any deal — the worst deal — would’ve been better than what we have now,' Trump said. 'If they made a bad deal, it would’ve been much better. They would’ve given up a little bit and everybody would be living, and every building would be built and every tower would be aging for another 2,000 years.' Meanwhile, Harris on Thursday stood alongside Zelenskyy and said Trump's push for Ukraine to quickly cut a deal to end the war were 'not proposals for peace,' but 'proposals for surrender.' Trump on Thursday said he was not advocating for a surrender. While Trump and Vance have long been skeptics of U.S. backing for Ukraine, other Republican allies of the former president have backed Kyiv's defense against Moscow's invasion and argue supporting Ukraine is in America's interest. One ally of both Ukraine and Trump is Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. At a closed-door meeting Zelenskyy had with senators on Capitol Hill, also on Thursday, Graham stood up and said he had been talking to Trump about the Ukrainian president, according to a person familiar with the situation and granted anonymity to discuss the private meeting. Graham told those in the room he would talk to Zelenskyy privately about his conversations with Trump, the person said. As the meeting came to a close, Graham pulled Zelenskyy aside and the two had a private conversation. Graham is close to the former president, despite an on-again-off-again relationship, and has often played a role as an intermediary on various subjects. He did not respond to a message seeking comment Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-and-zelenskyy-will-meet-as-tensions-rise-over-us-backing-for-ukraine-/7801544.html	2024-09-27T04:23:53-07:00	
Is China-US competition driving the Africa proposal in the UN?	Johannesburg — This week at U.N. meetings in New York, the United States said that two African countries should have permanent seats on one of the world’s major decision-making bodies, the United Nations Security Council. For years, numerous African leaders have called for the continent to have representation on the U.N. Security Council, which since World War II has had just five permanent members: the U.S., France, the UK, Russia and China. This week, the top representative of one of those permanent seats, U.S. President Joe Biden, threw his weight behind the idea. However, there was one major caveat, which Kenyan analyst Cliff Mboya said is not going over well on the continent. The new African members would not have veto power on decisions. 'We’ve already seeing a lot of backlash… like this is a big joke, the question is what is the point in joining the Security Council if you don’t have veto powers, what are you going to do there?' asked Mboya. That could play in China’s favor, as it has long positioned itself as a fellow developing country and leader of what’s become known as the Global South, while disparaging the West for its colonial past, said Mboya, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg. 'So I don’t think this helps the U.S. and the West in terms of perception and narratives, and it will only embolden African countries to lean more to the East because it just speaks to the hypocrisy,' he said. 'China’s been able to, you know, build this coalition of emerging and developing countries against the U.S. and Western-led world order.' But Paul Nantulya, a research associate with the Africa Center for Strategic Studies, said he thought the announcement was a 'win’’ for U.S. diplomacy and would mostly be welcomed by African nations as it opens the door to further negotiations. 'Regarding China, China has been very, you know, kind of like sitting on the fence. So rhetorically China has said all the right things, supporting Africa’s, what it calls Africa’s legitimate interests in the United Nations, including the United Nations Security Council,' he said. But its plan for that has been hazy, he added. 'When it comes to specific details, in terms of whether China supports permanent African representation on the council with veto power, when it comes to that China has not articulated a position.' Among those in New York this week calling for U.N. reform was South African President Cyril Ramaphosa. He said, quote: 'Africa and its 1.4 billion people remain excluded from its key decision-making structures.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also called for reform, saying the UNSC hasn’t kept up with a changing world and Africa is underrepresented. Some African countries want veto power in the Security Council dispensed with entirely. If there is reform, and Africa gets the two seats on the Security Council that the U.S. proposes, key contenders could include the continent’s largest economy, South Africa; most populous country, Nigeria; or North African heavyweight Egypt, Nantulya told VOA. However, analysts say any future process of adding African countries as permanent members is likely to face hurdles, as there will be problems reaching consensus. Nantulya said some African politicians think it could even drive a wedge between countries on the continent. There are also concerns the U.S. statement could just be rhetoric — and so far no timeline has been given regarding the next steps. Under U.N. rules, any change to Security Council membership would need approval from two-thirds of the General Assembly, including all five permanent members.	https://www.voanews.com/a/is-china-us-competition-driving-the-africa-proposal-in-the-un-/7801507.html	2024-09-27T04:04:26-07:00	
Veteran lawmaker Ishiba set to become Japan PM	TOKYO — Former Defense Minister Shigeru Ishiba was set on Friday to become Japan's next prime minister after winning a closely fought contest in his fifth and final attempt to lead the ruling Liberal Democratic Party. The 67-year-old prevailed over hardline nationalist Sanae Takaichi in a run-off vote in what was one of the most unpredictable leadership elections in decades with a record nine candidates in the field. The leader of the LDP, which has ruled Japan for almost all of the post-war era, is essentially assured of becoming the next premier because of its majority in parliament. The scramble to replace current premier Fumio Kishida was sparked in August when he announced his intention to step down over a series of scandals that plunged the LDP's ratings to record lows. 'We must believe in the people, speak the truth with courage and sincerity, and work together to make Japan a safe and secure country where everyone can live with a smile once again,' an emotional Ishiba said in a brief speech to lawmakers after the result. Ishiba must quell anger at home over rising living costs and navigate a volatile security environment in East Asia fueled by an increasingly assertive China and nuclear-armed North Korea. His approach to diplomacy with Japan's closest ally, the United States, will be in focus given he has repeatedly called for a more balanced relationship. In his campaign, he also called for the creation of an Asian NATO, an idea that could draw ire from Beijing and has already been dismissed by a senior U.S. official as hasty. U.S. ambassador to Japan, Rahm Emanuel, congratulated Ishiba in a post on X saying he looked forward to working with him to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance. Ishiba entered parliament in 1986 after a short banking career, but his outspoken views have earned him enemies in the LDP. He was sidelined by outgoing prime minister Kishida, instead becoming a dissenting voice in the party who enjoyed broad support from the public and rank-and-file members. He has rebelled on policies including the increased use of nuclear energy and has criticized his party for not allowing married couples to use separate surnames. His contrarian views and spats with colleagues contributed to four previous failed leadership bids. He has said this was his 'final battle.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/veteran-lawmaker-ishiba-set-to-become-japan-pm/7801443.html	2024-09-27T01:00:54-07:00	
Dozens of children drown while bathing during 3-day Hindu festival in eastern India	PATNA, India — Dozens of children drowned while bathing in rivers and ponds in rituals that were part of a three-day Hindu festival in eastern India's Bihar state, officials said. Heavy monsoon rains recently had raised the levels of waterways across the state. At least 46 people, including 37 children, drowned in separate incidents across the state's 15 districts, a statement from Bihar's disaster management department said. Authorities have recovered 43 bodies so far, and the three missing people are presumed to be dead. During the annual festival, mothers fast for 24 hours for the well-being of their children. The women are sometimes accompanied by their children when they visit rivers and ponds for cleansing rituals. The festival concluded Thursday. The state government has announced a compensation of 400,000 rupees ($4,784) for the families of each of the dead. Deadly accidents like drownings and stampedes during religious festivals are common in India. In July, at least 121 people were killed after severe overcrowding and a lack of exits contributed to a stampede at a religious festival in northern India.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-children-drown-while-bathing-during-3-day-hindu-festival-in-eastern-india/7801431.html	2024-09-27T00:19:22-07:00

Sudan’s army chief: RSF must withdraw before peace	United Nations — Sudan’s de facto ruler said Thursday that he wants to end the war in his country, but he said he will not sit with his rival general unless he withdraws his fighters. 'We are keen on stopping the war and restoring peace and security, without any pre-conditions,' Army Chief Abdel-Fattah al Burhan told reporters in New York, where he was attending U.N. General Assembly meetings. However, he stated several conditions for talks to start. 'We will never sit with Hemedti unless his forces pull out, and unless they implement what we agreed to,' he said referring to his rival, the head of the Rapid Support Forces, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, known as 'Hemedti.' Once allies in Sudan's transitional government following a 2021 coup, the two generals have turned into bitter rivals for power. On April 15, 2023, fighting erupted between their forces in the capital, Khartoum. It has since spread across Sudan, resulting in widespread atrocities and killing. Burhan was asked about new fighting that erupted between his forces and the RSF in Khartoum on Thursday, but did not offer any new details. Earlier Thursday, Burhan addressed the U.N. General Assembly annual debate. He used most of his speech to talk about the war in his country. Not to be outdone, his rival, Hemedti, issued a 'General Assembly speech' of his own, on the social media platform X. Ten million people have been displaced and half of Sudan’s population, 26 million people, are struggling with crisis levels of food insecurity. Famine was confirmed in August in Sudan’s Darfur region, which has seen heavy fighting. At least 14 other areas of Sudan are considered at risk of famine in the coming months. 'The food gap is there, but it hasn’t reached the level of famine yet,' Burhan told reporters. Regarding efforts by the United States and Saudi Arabia to bring the parties to the negotiating table in Switzerland in August, the army chief said it didn’t happen because 'external parties interfered' with the process. The Sudanese military accuses the United Arab Emirates of arming and equipping the RSF. The UAE was invited to a meeting in Switzerland in August and Burhan did not attend. He said he was also not happy with how the invitation was sent to him – in his personal capacity, not as head of state. He added that any peace process should be purely Sudanese-led. Asked about a July phone call he had with the leader of the UAE, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed, Burhan said he told the Emirati that the RSF has received either direct or indirect assistance from the UAE in the forms of weapons and training. He said MBZ, as the UAE leader is known, 'promised to reconsider the situation.' A report by a U.N. panel of experts earlier this year said there was substance to media reports that cargo planes originating in the UAE capital had landed in eastern Chad with arms, ammunition and medical equipment destined for the RSF. Publicly, the UAE denies that it arms the RSF and says it has only sent humanitarian aid to Sudan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-s-army-chief-rsf-must-withdraw-before-peace/7801390.html	2024-09-26T21:34:23-07:00	
Migrant crossings through Panama's Darien Gap down 35% so far in 2024	METETI, Panama — Migrant crossings through the treacherous Darien Gap that connects Panama to Colombia are down by over a third in the year's first nine months, a Panamanian border official said on Thursday, crediting heightened security by the new government. Between January and September 25, 259,712 migrants arrived in Panama through the Darien, a 35% decrease compared with the same period in 2023, said Alexis de Gracia, head of the National Border Service's eastern brigade, citing official data. Panamanian authorities attribute the drop to stricter security measures implemented by the government of President Jose Raul Mulino since he took office on July 1. The new government's efforts include the closing of some routes through the jungle passage and increasing deportations with U.S. support. The data also come nearly four months after U.S. President Joe Biden instituted a broad asylum ban on migrants caught illegally crossing the U.S.-Mexico border. Panama has become a transit route for hundreds of thousands of migrants, most of them seeking to reach the United States. Last year, a record 520,000 migrants - most of them Venezuelans -- crossed the Darien in search of better opportunities in the north. In July, Mulino's first month in office, 20,519 migrants crossed the Darien, down 34% from June and less than half of the number of migrants who crossed in the same month last year. In August there were 19% fewer crossings compared with the previous month and five times fewer compared with the same month in 2023, according to official data. Some analysts are skeptical the government's measures will succeed in the medium term without addressing the root causes of migration, while some also fear the measures could make travel even more dangerous for migrants. Further, 'there is the possibility that they use other routes,' De Gracia said, and the government's measures could have pushed migrants to use routes from Colombia through the Caribbean in lieu of the Darien Gap.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrant-crossings-through-panama-s-darien-gap-down-35-so-far-in-2024/7801388.html	2024-09-26T21:20:29-07:00

Blinken to meet Chinese counterpart amid concerns over China's drone supply to Russia	New York — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is scheduled to meet with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi on Friday, on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. This meeting between the countries’ top diplomats comes amid growing U.S. concerns over Chinese firms supplying chips and drones to Moscow, which have significantly bolstered Russia's battlefield capabilities in its war against Ukraine. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell has told the Congress that China's material support for Russia's war effort 'comes from the very top.' Blinken’s talks with Wang will take place ahead of a call between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping, expected later this fall. Earlier this week, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told the U.N. General Assembly that Ukraine would never accept a deal imposed by other nations to end Russia’s 31-month invasion, questioning the motives of China and Brazil in pushing for negotiations with Moscow. For months, U.S. officials have accused China of actively aiding Russia's war effort. Washington has sanctioned Chinese firms providing crucial components to Russia's defense industry. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller recently told VOA that the U.S. openly discusses its 'differences' with China to ensure that both countries 'at least understand where the other is coming from, even if we can’t reach an agreement.' He added that Washington is managing its relationship with China to prevent it from 'veering from competition into conflict.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-to-meet-chinese-counterpart-amid-concerns-over-china-s-drone-supply-to-russia/7801376.html	2024-09-26T20:43:44-07:00

US offers $20M for details about Iranian allegedly behind plot to kill official	Washington — The U.S. State Department announced a $20 million reward on Thursday for information leading to the arrest of the alleged Iranian mastermind behind a plot to assassinate former White House official John Bolton. U.S. officials said in August 2022 that they had uncovered a plot by Shahram Poursafi, a member of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), to kill Bolton, who served as national security adviser to former President Donald Trump. The State Department's Rewards for Justice program 'is offering a reward of up to $20 million for information leading to the arrest or conviction' of Poursafi, a notice said Thursday. The move came as Trump, 78, who is running for a new White House term, claimed there were 'big threats' on his life by Iran. Bolton, considered a foreign policy hawk, is a fierce critic of Iran and advocated that Trump unilaterally withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal in 2018. Poursafi allegedly offered an unidentified person inside the United States $300,000 to kill Bolton in the capital area. The plan was likely set in motion after the U.S. killing of top IRGC commander Qassem Soleimani in Iraq in January 2020, the Justice Department said at the time. But it never made headway because the ostensible assassin became an informant of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Iranian authorities have dismissed the allegations as 'fiction.' The United States designated the entire IRGC a 'foreign terrorist organization' in 2019, after previously designating its external operation, the Quds Force.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-offers-20m-for-details-about-iranian-allegedly-behind-plot-to-kill-official-/7800969.html	2024-09-26T16:29:23-07:00

US port employers file labor practice complaint against union	LOS ANGELES / WASHINGTON — Employers negotiating a labor contract at U.S. East Coast and Gulf Coast ports on Thursday filed an unfair labor practice complaint against the longshoremen's union, saying its leaders refuse to resume talks ahead of a threatened Tuesday strike. The United States Maritime Alliance said it filed the complaint with the National Labor Relations Board because of the repeated refusal of the International Longshoremen's Association to return to the bargaining table. The six-year master contract between USMX and the ILA expires Monday, and the two sides appear to be deadlocked on wage issues. The employer group said it requested immediate injunctive relief requiring the union to resume bargaining so a deal could be finalized. It is uncommon, but not unheard of, for employers to make such complaints to the NLRB, an independent agency of the federal government that enforces U.S. labor law, particularly with regard to collective bargaining and unfair labor practices. In rare cases, the NLRB will go to court and ask for an injunction pending the outcome of a board case, but that can take weeks to play out. The ILA on Thursday responded, calling the USMX a poor negotiating partner. Earlier this week, ILA leader and chief negotiator Harold Daggett said he had rebuffed USMX approaches. 'They call me several times each week trying to get the ILA to accept a lowball wage package,' Daggett said. Sources close to the talks said the ILA asked for a wage increase of 77%, a percentage the union called exaggerated. Industry experts predict that the increase will be higher than the 32% raise won by the West Coast longshoremen's union last year. Companies that rely on ocean shipping are increasingly worried that the ILA's 45,000 members will strike and close 36 ports that handle more than half of U.S. ocean trade of products such as bananas, meat, prescription drugs, auto parts, construction materials and apparel. If that happens, delays and costs could quickly cascade, threatening the U.S. economy in the weeks ahead of the U.S. presidential election, burdening already taxed global ocean shipping networks and over time foisting higher prices on consumers. Economists at Oxford Economics estimated that the impending strike would reduce U.S. gross domestic product by $4.5 billion to $7.5 billion, or 0.1% annualized, for every week it continues. A strike has the potential to weigh on the October employment report at a time when the Federal Reserve is highly attuned to signs of weakness in the labor market, they said. The timing is politically sensitive because Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris is facing former Republican President Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election on November 5. A White House official on Thursday reiterated that President Joe Biden does not intend to invoke a federal law known as the Taft-Hartley Act to prevent a strike. 'We encourage all parties to come to the bargaining table and negotiate in good faith,' the official said. 'Senior officials from the White House, Labor Department and Department of Transportation are in touch with the parties and delivering the message to them directly.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-port-employers-file-labor-practice-complaint-against-union-/7800902.html	2024-09-26T14:52:14-07:00

X asks to be reinstated in Brazil after following court's orders, source says	SAO PAULO — In the high-stakes showdown between the world's richest man and a Brazilian Supreme Court justice, Elon Musk blinked. Musk's social media site X has complied with Alexandre de Moraes' orders and requested its service be reestablished in the country, a source said Thursday. X complied with orders to block certain accounts from the platform, name an official legal representative in the country and pay fines imposed for not complying with earlier court orders, his lawyers said in a petition filed Thursday, according to the source, who is familiar with the document. The source spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly about the matter. On Saturday, de Moraes ordered the platform to submit additional documentation about its legal representative for court review, which the source said has been done. X was blocked in the highly online country of 213 million people on August 30. De Moraes ordered the shutdown after sparring with Musk for months over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. The company said at the time that de Moraes' efforts to block certain accounts were illegal moves to censor 'political opponents' and that it would not comply. Musk called the judge an enemy of free speech and a criminal. In a twist, X's new representative is the same person who held the position before X shuttered its office in Brazil. That happened after de Moraes threatened to arrest the person, Rachel de Oliveira Villa Nova Conceicao, if X did not comply with orders to block accounts. Brazil is not the first country to ban X, but such a drastic step has generally been limited to authoritarian regimes. The platform and its former incarnation, Twitter, have been banned in Russia, China, Iran, Myanmar, North Korea, Venezuela and Turkmenistan. Other countries, including Pakistan, Turkey and Egypt, have previously temporarily suspended X, usually to quell dissent and unrest. In an unusual move for a democratic country, de Moraes also set exorbitant daily fines for anyone using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access the platform. The fines have been questioned by legal experts and challenged by the nation's bar association, although it does not appear that any Brazilian has yet been punished. Local media have reported that the Federal Police are evaluating how to enforce violations. X named Villa Nova as its representative on Friday and registered her with Sao Paulo's commercial registry. To avoid her getting blamed for potential violations of Brazilian law — and risk arrest — a clause has been written into the representation agreement that any action on the part of X that will result in obligations for her requires prior instruction in writing from the company, according to the company's public filing with the registry. X's dustup with Brazil has some parallels to the company's dealings with the Indian government three years ago, back when it was still called Twitter and before Musk purchased it for $44 billion. In 2021, India threatened to arrest employees of Twitter (as well as Meta's Facebook and WhatsApp) for not complying with the government's requests to take down posts related to farmers' protests that rocked the country. Unlike in the United States, where free speech is baked into the constitution, in Brazil speech is more limited, with restrictions on homophobia and racism, for example, and judges can order sites to remove content. Many of de Moraes' decisions are sealed from the public and neither he nor X has disclosed the full list of accounts he has ordered blocked. Prominent supporters of former President Jair Bolsonaro and far-right activists were among those that X earlier removed from the platform. Musk accused de Moraes of suppressing free speech and violating Brazil's constitution, and he noted on X that users could seek to bypass any shutdown of the social media platform by using VPNs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/x-asks-to-be-reinstated-in-brazil-after-following-court-s-orders-source-says/7800849.html	2024-09-26T13:29:33-07:00

Groups call to protect women, children working in Africa's mines	nairobi, kenya — As the global race to acquire economically vital minerals unfolds, those working in Africa’s mining sector are calling for the protection of women and children laborers who keep it running. Women in Mining Africa, an advocacy group that aims to mitigate harsh working conditions in rural communities, organized a virtual meeting this week with organizations and experts. They are working to promote gender equity and social justice in the mining sector as demand for African resources continues. 'We seek to empower women in mining by advocating for equal access to resources, opportunities, and leadership roles across the continent,' said Comfort Asokoro Ogaji founded Women in Mining Africa, which works in 36 African countries. 'We also work to promote responsible mining and advocate for sustainable, ethical, and socially inclusive mining practices,' Ogaji said. 'Child protection in mining communities is at the core of our mission and also capacity building and collaboration across the continent.' Challenges women face in industry The World Bank says women represent 30% of the industry known as Artisanal and Small-scale Mining, or ASM. However, women are often barred from entering the mines and relegated to lower-paying jobs. According to the International Institute for Sustainable Development, women's contributions are overshadowed by the historically dominant role of men, hindering women's meaningful participation and resulting in unequal pay. Women, unlike their male counterparts, also face gender inequality, violence and harassment. Jose Diemel works as a senior adviser at Levin Sources, a consulting firm that drives the transition to just and sustainable minerals value chains. Diemal has worked with artisanal and small-scale miners in the Democratic Republic of Congo. She said the management of mining fields has improved over the years. 'I've seen the mentality change towards artisanal mining, and we slowly started to talk about artisanal management plans around the possibility of peaceful coexistence,' said Diemel. 'And now we're working at 11 sources, we very regularly receive a request from large-scale mining companies, industrial mining companies, to help them set up ASM management plans that range from peaceful coexistence to collaboration.' Mining experts say miners are being empowered, receiving different ways to sustain their livelihood and undergoing safety training. The small-scale miners also have been able to obtain loans to purchase equipment that ease their work, increase their product, and their income. Call to get more women into sector Thokozile Budaza advocates for women's rights in South Africa, the largest platinum and manganese producer in the world. She said the voices of the resource owners and those working on them must be included in decision-making. 'African leaders can better anticipate the ripple effects of their policies and decisions and the lack of decisions ensuring that the benefits of mining are equitably distributed and the voices of the stakeholders, especially those marginalized, are heard and respected while dealing with investors coming into Africa to source critical materials for development,' said Budaza. A World Bank report released at the 2024 Mining Indaba Conference urges implementation of gender-focused legislation to improve mining rules and regulations and promote greater participation of women in the sector. The report also calls for changing property laws and land tenure agreements that restrict women's ability to own land and access mineral resources.	https://www.voanews.com/a/empowering-african-women-miners-path-to-sustainable-trade-economic-growth-/7800674.html	2024-09-26T12:18:14-07:00	
US Congress passes security pact with Pacific Island allies	Washington — Buried in the hundreds of pages of the continuing resolution passed Wednesday by U.S. lawmakers to prevent a government shutdown are Washington’s final steps to implement a 20-year security pact with Pacific Island allies, cementing a U.S. commitment to the region in the face of an increasingly assertive China. The Compacts of Free Association, or COFA, provide economic support for Palau, the Marshall Islands and the Federated States of Micronesia. In exchange, the nations will allow the U.S. military exclusive access to their land, water and airspace and the right to deny Beijing access to their ports and expansive territorial waters. But six months after the compacts were passed, extending $7 billion in economic aid over 20 years to the three Pacific Island nations, key provisions still languished. Palau’s access to postal service, aviation security, national weather service and federal banking insurance was set to run out on September 30. The temporary spending package finalized Wednesday contained an extension of those services, Representative Ed Case, a Democrat, said in a statement to VOA. In doing so, said Case, 'The U.S. restates its commitment to the people of Palau as a full partner in a shared future and to assisting Palau in resisting the dependence upon and coercion by the PRC that has marked the PRC’s efforts to dominate the countries of the Pacific.' PRC is an abbreviation for the People’s Republic of China. 'Reassuring the people of Palau that they [the services] will continue is an important message from the people of the United States to the people of Palau,' Palauan President Surangel Whipps Jr. said in an interview with VOA on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. Cleo Paskal, a nonresident senior fellow for the Indo-Pacific at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, argues that the extension of these services also sends a message to Beijing. Palau is just one of three remaining Pacific Island nations who still recognize Taiwan diplomatically over Beijing. Paskal said that a gap in these basic services could have left Whipps — who is running for reelection in November — vulnerable to 'those wanting to undermine the relationship with the U.S., possibly feeding into the narrative that the U.S. isn’t helping' its Pacific partners. But U.S. lawmakers of both parties coalesced around closing the loophole for Palau, said Whipps. The agreement for Palau 'represents a significant milestone in the process of affirming our countries’ partnership for another 20 years,' U.S. Senator Mazie Hirono of Hawaii, a Democrat, said in a statement to VOA. 'This relationship is vital to the security and stability' of the U.S. 'as we work to promote democracy and our shared values throughout the Pacific.' U.S. Representative Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen, a Republican who represents the U.S. territory of American Samoa, led a hearing earlier this month that exposed gaps in COFA implementation, including the Palau federal services expiration. 'It’s extremely important to the entirety of the Pacific region for our allies, and any nation at all, to see the U.S. following through with its commitments to our closest friends in the region,' Coleman Radewagen said in a statement to VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-congress-passes-security-pact-with-pacific-island-allies/7800734.html	2024-09-26T12:16:39-07:00	
Kurdistan Region set to hold long-delayed parliamentary election	Washington — The semi-autonomous Kurdistan Region of Iraq on Wednesday officially began a campaign phase for its parliamentary elections scheduled for October 20. The vote, which was rescheduled five times due to political disagreements over the election system, comes at a time when the region is still suffering from a financial crisis related to disagreements with the Iraqi government. 'Everyone is free to propagate their policies and programs, to criticize, but no one must allow themselves to spread hatred,' said Kurdish President Nechirvan Barzani. The region was supposed to hold the election by the end of 2022, but the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP) and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) were not able to reach an agreement about amending the region’s electoral system, particularly minority quota seats. Consequently, the Kurdish parliament was suspended in May 2023. Relations with Baghdad At the center of the election is the debate over the Kurdistan Regional Government’s (KRG) prolonged financial crisis due to the lack of cash flow from Baghdad. The region’s public sector employees continue to suffer from unpaid and delayed salaries, as Irbil and Baghdad continue their painstaking talks on the KRG internal revenues, employee list and oil contracts. The crisis goes back to February 2014, when Iraq’s then-Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki cut the Kurdish share of the Iraqi budget to protest the KRG’s independent oil exports via Turkey. It was worsened by an Islamic State attack in August 2014, the Iraqi and Iranian pushback against the October 2017 Kurdish referendum for independence, and Turkey’s decision to halt oil exports from KRG in March 2023. While the KDP officials accuse the Iraqi central government of keeping the KRG budget 'hostage' to weaken Kurdish autonomy, the opposition parties blame, at least in part, the lack of transparency of KRG internal revenues and oil contracts with foreign companies. During his first campaign appearance, which was held in the Kurdistan Region capital, Irbil, on Wednesday, KDP head Masoud Barzani began his speech to zealous supporters acknowledging the Kurdish independence referendum anniversary, congratulating people 'on this sacred day, when the nation of Kurdistan did not allow its will to be broken and did not bow itself.' Barzani noted restored relations with the current Iraqi government led by Mohammed Shia’ Al Sudani but warned his supporters against 'a chauvinistic mindset' targeting the Kurdish people in Iraq. Barzani also recognized shortcomings in governance but asked voters to 'put criticism aside for now' and vowed reform 'from the top' after the elections. Governance and corruption While the KDP appeals to the nationalist sentiment of voters in the region, its main competitor, PUK, is focused on countering the KDP’s 'self-imposition' and offering itself as a better alternative to rule the region. 'Only the PUK can readjust this crippled governance,' PUK leader Bafel Talabani said in a televised address on Wednesday. Talabani accused the KDP of abusing the region’s revenues for its own benefit and failing to defend Kurdish rights in Baghdad. He presented 'a new PUK,' which he said will act upon its promises of fighting corruption and mismanagement. Talabani counted the appointment of a Kurdish governor for Kirkuk from his party and his pressure to change the KRG electoral system as proof for a stronger comeback of the PUK, which has been riddled with separation and internal divisions, particularly after the death of his father and the PUK’s founding leader and former Iraqi president Jalal Talabani. In 2013 the Change Movement, one of the key offshoots of the PUK, won 24 seats out of the region’s then 111 parliament seats, leading the PUK by six seats. Divided opposition But the Change Movement over the years has suffered a significant setback among voters who are seeking an alternative to the KDP-PUK ruling system. Additionally, the appearance of more opposition groups, such as the New Generation, is expected to further divide the opposition votes to the benefit of the KDP and PUK, experts say. Renowned Kurdish politician Mahmoud Osman told VOA from Irbil, 'Whether the elections are held or not, there will be no change in Kurdistan's governance, because the KDP rules one zone and the PUK rules another.' He added, 'The newly established parties are minor to the KDP and the PUK, which control the armed forces.' The outbreak of civil war in 1994 split the Kurdistan Region into two zones, with the KDP controlling the yellow zone in Irbil and Duhok provinces, and the PUK in charge of the green zone in Sulaimaniyah and Halabja provinces. In 2006, both parties signed an agreement to create a joint administration, but division, especially in the Peshmerga forces, continues to hold back the region from its aspirations for stronger government institutions. 'The will for change is present among the people of Kurdistan but not in the political parties,' Luqman Ali, a political observer from Sulaimaniyah, told VOA. He charged that political parties in the region used parliament members as 'employees' to implement their agendas. 'So long as the government is not institutionalized to prioritize people over parties and political individuals, these elections will not bring about any considerable change,' he said. About 2.9 million people from the region’s four provinces are eligible to vote in the October 20 election, which is organized by Iraq’s Independent High Electoral Commission (IHEC). IHEC spokeswoman Jumana al-Ghalai on Tuesday told VOA Kurdish Service that her commission is taking various steps to ensure a transparent process. 'The vote-counting process will be conducted both manually and electronically. If the difference between them is 5%, manual counting will be used,' she said. According to Aram Jamal, head of the Kurdish Institute for Elections, despite challenges in the system, the vote is an important step for the region’s democratic process. The participation of more than 1,190 candidates in the election will ensure an intense campaign, he said. 'What is important is to have a calm and civilized competition away from violence,' Jamal told VOA. 'The chances for fraud have been eliminated to a great extent and therefore, a new voting phase has started.'

US, Vietnamese leaders meet, seek deeper ties	Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden says Washington is committed to a strong, prosperous, resilient, and independent Vietnam and discussed a broad range of ways the two countries can cooperate during a meeting with this Vietnamese counterpart, To Lam. Since coming to office in May, Vietnam’s new president has been actively reaching out, meeting with the leaders of China and Russia. Washington is seeking to counter those advances and strengthen ties with Hanoi as well. Lam, who is also head of the ruling Communist Party, met with Biden on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York Wednesday. According to a White House statement, the two talked about 'building secure and resilient semiconductor supply chains' and strengthening their tech relationship as well as progress in cybersecurity cooperation and Vietnam’s efforts to increase its digital connectivity. Vietnam is looking to the United States and China to triple its number of subsea cables by 2030. Biden and Lam also focused on ways the two could deepen a comprehensive strategic partnership they entered last year. Biden said Washington wants to cooperate with Vietnam to uphold a free and open Indo-Pacific and discussed the importance of maintaining peace and stability — especially in the South China Sea, according to the White House statement. During the meeting, which lasted a little more than an hour, Lam assured Biden that the United States is 'a partner of strategic importance,' while Biden told Lam that Vietnam is 'a top partner of the U.S. in the region,' Vietnam News Agency reported. Analysts say that while the meeting did not take place in the White House, it did highlight the high level of trust between Hanoi and Washington and the growing importance of bilateral ties. Nguyen Hong Hai, a lecturer of international relations at Hanoi-based VinUni, told VOA in an email that the way Washington and Hanoi are talking about one another and the high importance they attach to bilateral relations is significant. It is also a sign of deepening trust, Hai added. 'Vietnam falls short of a U.S. ally. But as a partner, it is a top of its kind,' Hai said. Hai said that Hanoi fits perfectly into Washington’s Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy since it supports the rules-based order and is playing an increasingly bigger role in the U.S.-led global supply chain. On the other hand, Hanoi needs Washington as a regional security guarantor while its goal of becoming a developed economy with high income by 2045 is contingent on access to the U.S. market as well as its capital and technology. Ha Hoang Hop, chair of the Hanoi-based Think Tank Viet Know, said it was significant that both leaders reaffirmed the importance of their comprehensive strategic partnership. So, too, was Biden’s commitment to support Vietnam’s tech-driven growth and encouragement for Hanoi to play an active role in regional security. 'The momentum of U.S.-Vietnam comprehensive strategic partnership will be maintained far beyond Biden’s and To Lam’s presidencies no matter who will succeed Biden next year or who will take the helm of the Vietnamese Communist Party in 2026,' Hop told VOA in an email. The two countries recently marked the first anniversary of the comprehensive strategic partnership Biden signed with Nguyen Phu Trong, Lam’s predecessor, during a visit to Hanoi last year. At that time, Lam was the country’s security czar. He became president following the forced resignation of President Vo Van Thuong in March and replaced Nguyen Phu Trong as party chief after Trong unexpectedly died in late July. Lam’s first foreign trip after becoming Vietnam’s top leader took him to Beijing in August, when he and Chinese President Xi Jinping reaffirmed their commitment to bilateral ties. He also hosted Russia’s Vladimir Putin in Hanoi in late June. Although readouts of Wednesday’s meeting gave no indication that China was discussed, Beijing was watching the meeting closely, Hai said. China became Vietnam’s first comprehensive strategic partner in 2008, and the two countries agreed late last year to build what they call a 'community of shared future' following the upgrade in U.S.-Vietnam ties. 'Any progress in U.S.-Vietnam ties is unwelcome in Beijing. However, Bejing should understand that Hanoi’s deepening ties with the U.S. is not targeted at any country but just serves its own security,' Hai said. Think Tank Viet Know’s Ha Hoang Hop said that Beijing is 'fully aware of Hanoi’s strategic position in the Free and Open Indo-Pacific strategy' and is trying to capitalize on this to serve its interests. 'For its part, Hanoi is proactively navigating between the two superpowers,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-vietnamese-leaders-meet-seek-deeper-ties/7800641.html	2024-09-26T11:23:02-07:00

Cryptocurrency exchange network accused of helping Russia hit with sanctions	WASHINGTON — A network of people and virtual currency exchanges associated with harboring Russian cybercrime were hit with sanctions on Thursday, in a government-wide crackdown on cybercrime that could assist Russia ahead of President Joe Biden's meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. U.S. Treasury sanctioned alleged Russian hacker Sergey Ivanov and Cryptex — a St. Vincent and Grenadines registered virtual currency exchange operating in Russia. Virtual currency exchanges allow people and businesses to trade cryptocurrencies for other assets, such as conventional dollars or other digital currencies. Treasury alleges that Ivanov has laundered hundreds of millions of dollars worth of virtual currency for cyber criminals and darknet marketplace vendors for the last 20 years, including for Timur Shakhmametov, who allegedly created an online marketplace for stolen credit card data and compromised IDs called Joker's Stash. Ivanov laundered the proceeds from Joker's Stash, Treasury says. The State Department is offering a $10 million reward for information that would lead to the arrest and possible conviction of the two men, and the U.S. Attorney's Office in Virginia has unsealed an indictment against them. Biden said in a statement announcing the sanctions Thursday that the U.S. 'will continue to raise the costs on Russia for its war in Ukraine and to deprive the Russian defense industrial base of resources.' He meets with Zelenskyy Thursday to announce a surge in security assistance for Ukraine and other actions meant to assist the war-torn country as Russia continues to invade. State Department Spokesman Matthew Miller said, 'We will continue to use all our tools and authorities to deter and expose these money laundering networks and impose cost on the cyber criminals and support networks. We reiterate our call that Russia must take concrete steps to prevent cyber criminals from freely operating in its jurisdiction.' U.S officials have taken several actions against Russian cybercriminals since the start of the invasion in February 2022. Earlier this year, Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control sanctioned 13 firms — five of which are owned by an already sanctioned person — and two people who have all either helped build or operate blockchain-based services for, or enabled virtual currency payments in, the Russian financial sector, 'thus enabling potential sanctions evasion,' according to U.S. Treasury.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cryptocurrency-exchange-network-accused-of-helping-russia-hit-with-sanctions-/7800550.html	2024-09-26T10:03:42-07:00

US gun owners’ views unchanged by Trump assassination attempts	U.S. presidential candidate Donald Trump has been the target of two assassination attempts during this campaign.

Hearing on Trump assassination attempts suggests failure was with Secret Service, not local police	WASHINGTON — Members of a bipartisan House panel investigating the Trump assassination attempts suggested during its first hearing Thursday that the failures that led to a gunman being able to open fire on former President Donald Trump were with the U.S. Secret Service, not local police. In his opening statement, the Republican co-chair of the committee, Rep. Mike Kelly from Pennsylvania, blamed a cascade of failures by the Secret Service that allowed the gunman, Thomas Michael Crooks, to gain access to the roof of a nearby building and open fire on Trump. Trump was wounded and a man attending the rally with his family was killed. 'In the days leading up to the rally, it was not a single mistake that allowed Crooks to outmaneuver one of our country's most elite group of security professionals. There were security failures on multiple fronts,' said Kelly. The panel — composed of seven Republicans and six Democrats — has spent the last two months analyzing the security failures that allowed a gunman to scale a roof and open fire at the former president during a July 13 campaign rally in Pennsylvania. Now they are also investigating this month's Secret Service arrest of a man with a rifle on Trump's Florida golf course who sought to assassinate the Republican presidential nominee. The suspect in the second assassination attempt, Ryan Wesley Routh, was allegedly aiming a rifle through the shrubbery surrounding Trump's West Palm Beach golf course when he was detected by a Secret Service agent. The agent opened fire and Routh fled before being apprehended by local authorities. The hearing Thursday is the first time the task force presents its findings to the public after spending weeks conducting nearly two dozen interviews with law enforcement and receiving more than 2,800 pages of documents from the Secret Service. It focuses on the use of local law enforcement by the Secret Service, featuring testimony from Pennsylvania and Butler County police officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hearing-on-trump-assassination-attempts-suggests-failure-was-with-secret-service-not-local-police/7800315.html	2024-09-26T07:37:57-07:00	
FBI seizes New York City mayor's phone ahead of expected unsealing of indictment	New York — FBI agents entered the official residence of New York City Mayor Eric Adams and seized his phone early Thursday morning, hours before an indictment detailing criminal charges against the Democrat was expected to be made public. Adams was indicted by a grand jury on federal criminal charges that remain sealed, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke with The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the matter publicly. 'Federal agents appeared this morning at Gracie Mansion in an effort to create a spectacle (again) and take Mayor Adams phone (again),' Adams' lawyer, Alex Spiro, said in a statement, adding that the mayor had not been arrested. 'They send a dozen agents to pick up a phone when we would have happily turned it in.' Federal law enforcement agents were seen entering the mayor's Manhattan residence at dawn Wednesday, with several vehicles bearing federal law enforcement placards parked outside. The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan has declined to comment on the investigation. An FBI spokesperson declined to comment. A spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately respond to questions Thursday morning. In a video speech released Wednesday night, Adams vowed to fight any charges against him, claiming he had been made a 'target' in a case 'based on lies.' 'I will fight these injustices with every ounce of my strength and my spirit,' he said. It was not immediately clear what laws Adams is accused of breaking or when he might have to appear in court. The indictment caps off an extraordinary few weeks in New York City, as federal investigators have homed in on members of Adams' inner circle, producing a drumbeat of raids, subpoenas and high-level resignations. Federal prosecutors are believed to be leading multiple, separate inquiries involving Adams and his senior aides, relatives of those aides, campaign fundraising and possible influence peddling of the police and fire departments. In the last two weeks alone, the city's police commissioner and head of the school's system have announced their resignations. FBI agents had seized Adams' electronic devices nearly a year ago as part of an investigation focused, at least partly, on campaign contributions and Adams' interactions with the Turkish government. Because the charges were sealed, it was unknown whether they dealt with those same matters. In early September, federal investigators seized devices from his police commissioner, schools chancellor, two deputy mayors and other trusted confidantes both in and out of City Hall. All have denied wrongdoing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-seizes-new-york-city-mayor-s-phone-ahead-of-expected-unsealing-of-indictment/7800234.html	2024-09-26T06:33:22-07:00

Hong Kong court jails former editor, releases another on health grounds	HONG KONG — A Hong Kong court on Thursday night sentenced a former editor to jail for 21 months and immediately released another after both had earlier been found guilty of conspiring to publish seditious articles. In a landmark case about media freedom, Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam of the now-defunct Stand News media outlet were convicted last month — the first time journalists have been found guilty of sedition since the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997. Chung was sentenced to 21 months while Lam was given a sentence that allowed him to be released immediately on health grounds. District Court Judge Kwok Wai-kin noted evidence from Lam's lawyer on Thursday that he had serious autoimmune and advanced kidney disease and that prison could further endanger him. Chung smiled as the judge said his colleague Lam would be released, and Lam's wife wept. Chung would have to serve around 10 months in jail given earlier remand custody. Stand News, once Hong Kong's leading online media outlet, was known for its hard-hitting reports about the city's 2019 pro-democracy protests and later the national security crackdown. Under the colonial-era sedition law, the maximum sentencing is two years imprisonment and a fine of HKD5,000 ($642). Western diplomats that included representatives from the United States, the European Union, France, Britain, Canada and Ireland witnessed the sentencing. Liz Throssell, a spokesperson for the United Nations Human Rights Office, said earlier that the office was calling on Hong Kong authorities to review the court's decision in line with obligations under international human rights law. Twenty-three member states of the Media Freedom Coalition, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada, have similarly signed a statement, urging 'Hong Kong and China authorities to abide by their international human rights commitments and legal obligations, and to respect freedom of the press and freedom of speech in Hong Kong.' A spokesperson for Hong Kong's government said in a statement that the government 'strongly disapproved of and rejected the fact-twisting remarks and baseless smears' by the coalition. Hong Kong and Chinese officials have said the security clampdown was needed to maintain stability after the pro-democracy protests. Judge Kwok wrote in a verdict in August that 'the political ideology of Stand News was localism' and 'the line it took was to support and promote Hong Kong local autonomy.' Hong Kong's mostly youthful localist movement emerged in the 2010s amid political tensions with Beijing, emphasizing local identity and culture, as well as greater autonomy. Some supporters called for Hong Kong independence. 'I believe that during the offense period, the ... defendants did not carry out real media work but participated in the so-called struggle at that time,' the judge said on Thursday. In August, Chung wrote in a mitigation letter to the court that some Hong Kongers 'care about the freedom and dignity of everyone in the community and are willing to pay the price of losing their own freedom.' Lam wrote that 'the only way for journalists to defend press freedom is to report.' Stand News was raided by police in December 2021, and its assets were frozen, leading to its closure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-court-jails-former-editor-releases-another-on-health-grounds/7800221.html	2024-09-26T06:28:58-07:00	
Indian-ruled Kashmir election officials report over 50% turnout	Srinagar, Indian-administered Kashmir — Voter turnout of just over 56% was reported Wednesday in Jammu and Kashmir, the disputed, Indian-controlled territory holding its first legislative elections in ten years. Two hundred thirty-nine candidates ran for 26 assembly constituencies in Wednesday’s voting, part two of the three-phase elections. More than 2.5 million adults were eligible to cast ballots. The elections took place under tight security arrangements to ensure smooth conduct of the polls. 'The polls ended peacefully in all the six districts. However, some stray incidents like arguments et cetera occurred at a few places but there is no need for re-poll anywhere,' Pandurang Kondbarao Pole, J&K Chief Electoral Officer, told reporters in a press conference. Jammu and Kashmir is experiencing its first elections since the government of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his ruling Bharatiya Janata Party revoked its limited autonomy in 2019, downgrading its status to that of a union territory. Some locals see the elections as a battle between the BJP and the people of Kashmir, saying the government has systematically snatched away their rights over the last decade. 'Desperate times call for desperate measures. I have boycotted elections ever since I became eligible to vote. Today I feel it’s necessary to cast a vote and send a message to New Delhi,' Ikhlaq Shah, a resident of Qamarwari, told VOA. 'If we fail to act now, I believe the BJP government will impose its hazardous agenda against us.' India, he said, is more interested in exploiting Jammu and Kashmir’s resources than caring for its people. Shah expressed disappointment that regional political parties, particularly the National Conference and Peoples Democratic Party, are competing against each other in the elections despite sharing the common goal of throwing BJP out of J&K. Muzamil Maqbool, a political analyst, told VOA that the parties have fragmented because their leaders are prioritizing personal interests. 'Most of these mainstream parties were once colleagues of each other in the past. Now they have sprouted and formed their own separated parties to fight under different names and banners,' Maqbool said. The result, he predicted, is that none of them will win a majority in the J&K legislature. 'It’s too early to say, but J&K may see a large coalition formed to govern after the October 2024 elections,' he said. Shameem Ahmad Baba, a resident of old Srinagar, said voters are confused about the parties, who are accusing each other of being hidden allies of the BJP. 'There is a mass confusion among the people about who supports us and who stands with the government, as so many candidates are running this time,' Baba told VOA. 'I wish the regional political parties had agreed on seat-sharing, as this would have helped keep New Delhi’s influence at bay.' Muzaffar Shah, vice president of the Awami National Conference, or ANC, said that if all regional parties worked together under the banner of the now-dissolved Peoples Alliance for Gupkar Declaration, PAGD, it would have strengthened the movement of the local population. PAGD was a coalition of major parties created to press the demand that India revive J&K’s special status. 'PAGD was recognized almost throughout diaspora of Kashmir and throughout the world,' Shah said. 'Unfortunately, political parties in the alliance, they gave much more weightage to their organizational matters and power politics than the interests of people of region. That fact unfortunately led to the breakup.' Meanwhile, a 16-member delegation of foreign diplomats from countries like the U.S., Mexico, Singapore and Norway visited Kashmir at the invitation of the Indian government. Former Chief Minister of J&K, Omar Abdullah, lashed out at the central government for inviting foreign diplomats to observe the elections. 'If these diplomats comment on J&K the Government of India immediately says it’s an internal matter and they don’t want outside interference. If that’s the case, why are they inviting them now?' Abdullah said. The third phase of the J&K elections takes place October 1.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-ruled-kashmir-election-officials-report-over-50-turnout/7800201.html	2024-09-26T06:11:11-07:00

Oxfam: 'Oligarchy' of super-rich undermining cooperation to tackle poverty, climate change	London — As world leaders gather for the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York this week, the charity Oxfam says they are being undermined by what it calls a 'global oligarchy' of the super-rich who exert considerable control over the global economy – and who it blames for exacerbating problems like extreme inequality and climate change. 'Today, the world’s richest 1% own more wealth than 95% of humanity. The immense concentration of wealth, driven significantly by increased monopolistic corporate power, has allowed large corporations and the ultrarich who exercise control over them to use their vast resources to shape global rules in their favor, often at the expense of everyone else,' the Oxfam report says. The charity says international cooperation on issues like climate change and poverty is failing due to extreme economic inequality. 'The wealth of the world's five richest men has doubled since the start of this decade. And nearly five billion people have got poorer,' said Nabil Ahmed, the director of economic and racial justice at Oxfam America, in an interview with VOA. Fair taxes The report urges fairer taxation of large corporations and the ultra-wealthy. 'We live in a world in which mega-corporations… are paying next to or little to no tax basically. Not like the small businesses, not like the rest of us,' Ahmed said. 'It's such a phenomenal lost opportunity because we know governments, rich and poor, across the world need to claw back these revenues to be able to invest in their people, to be able to meet their rights,' he added. Oxfam praises a campaign led by Brazil, which currently holds the presidency of the G20, to impose a 2% minimum tax on the world’s richest billionaires. Brazil’s government claims it would raise up to $250 billion from about 3,000 individuals, to pay for healthcare, education and tackling climate change. A report by the French economist Gabriel Zucman, commissioned by Brazil, suggests billionaires currently pay the equivalent of 0.3% of their wealth in taxes. The plan is backed by other members including South Africa, Spain and France. However, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen spoke against the move at a G20 meeting in July. 'Tax policy is very difficult to coordinate globally and we don't see a need or really think it's desirable to try to negotiate a global agreement on that. We think that all countries should make sure that their taxation systems are fair and progressive,' Yellen told reporters. Private debt Oxfam says tax revenues in the global south meanwhile are increasingly spent on servicing debt to private creditors like banks and hedge funds. 'This shift has exacerbated the debt crisis, further entrenching 'debtocracy.' Compared with official creditors, private entities issue debt with shorter maturities and higher, more volatile interest rates,' the Oxfam report says. Vaccines The charity also accuses large pharmaceutical companies of shaping rules over intellectual property rights to benefit their shareholders. Oxfam says that during the COVID-19 pandemic, this meant poorer nations struggled to access coronavirus vaccines, such as the mRNA vaccine made by Pfizer. 'Its negative impacts are most harshly felt by countries in the Global South, which bear the brunt of 'artificial rationing,' where pharmaceutical corporations keep drug costs — and thus profits — high by limiting generic manufacturing, while simultaneously failing to invest in research and development for priority diseases in the Global South deemed less profitable,' Oxfam said. Responding to VOA, Pfizer highlighted an open letter written by the company’s chairman Albert Bourla in 2021, in which he said the company had created a tiered pricing structure and had offered its mRNA coronavirus vaccine at cost price or for free to poorer nations. However, Bourla said that many richer countries moved faster to purchase the available doses. 'When we developed our tiered pricing policy, we reached out to all nations asking them to place orders so we could allocate doses for them. In reality, the high-income countries reserved most of the doses,' Bourla wrote. Pfizer’s chairman also warned that losing intellectual property rights could 'disincentivize' anyone else from taking a big financial risk in developing such vaccines, a view echoed by other large pharmaceutical giants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oxfam-oligarchy-of-super-rich-undermining-cooperation-to-tackle-poverty-climate-change/7800166.html	2024-09-26T05:26:53-07:00

What's behind China's launch of an intercontinental ballistic missile	TAIPEI, Taiwan — China test-fired an intercontinental ballistic missile into the Pacific Ocean on Wednesday in a rare occurrence, adding to tensions in the region where multiple countries have overlapping territorial claims and both Beijing and Washington seek to project their influence. The launch was part of routine training by the People's Liberation Army's Rocket Force, which is in charge of conventional and nuclear missile operations, and was not aimed at any country or target, the Defense Ministry said in a statement. The ICBM, carrying a dummy warhead, landed in a designated area in the sea, the ministry said, without specifying where exactly. China rarely tests ICBMs out in international waters, with some experts tracing the last such deployment back to May 1980, when Beijing launched a DF-5 missile into the South Pacific. Usually, the PLA test-fires ballistic missiles in China's remote Xinjiang region or in the Bohai Sea. Why the Pacific, why now? China choosing the Pacific Ocean as the location for test-firing its missile comes across as both a display of its increased nuclear capabilities and as a warning to the United States and its allies in the region, experts say. 'There is no other potential audience, as China does not expect to have to confront the EU or the U.K. militarily,' said Steve Tsang, director of the SOAS China Institute in London. The test also comes weeks ahead of an expected call between Chinese leader Xi Jinping and U.S. President Joe Biden. It marks an increase in regional security tensions with U.S. allies Japan and the Philippines, and a continuation of frictions with the self-ruled island of Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its own territory. Taiwan's Defense Ministry said Wednesday it was monitoring the missile launch, along with other military exercises by China in the region. The launch, coinciding with the U.N. General Assembly meeting in New York, 'is a pretty blunt signal' to the international order, said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former U.S. defense official. 'China is signaling that its forbearance has limits, that it is prepared to use its most powerful weapons to deter adversaries or punish them if needed, if deterrence fails,' he said. Wednesday's launch also follows a series of corruption arrests this year that ensnared several leading officers in its rocket corps on allegations of misconduct. Its aim could be to both provide assurances at home and signal to the world that the issues have been resolved. How strong is China's military? China boasts the world's largest standing army and the biggest navy. Its military budget is the second highest in the world, after that of the U.S. According to the U.S., China also has the largest air force in the Indo-Pacific, with more than half of its fighter planes consisting of fourth or fifth generation models. China also boasts a massive stockpile of missiles, along with stealth aircraft, bombers capable of delivering nuclear weapons, advanced surface ships and nuclear-powered submarines. In his more than a decade in power, Xi, who is also chairman of the Central Military Commission, has spearheaded the armed forces' modernization, with investments in high-tech military technologies from stealth fighters to aircraft carriers and a growing arsenal of nuclear weapons. China's defense budget has more than doubled since 2015, even as the country's economic growth rate has slowed considerably. A U.S. Department of Defense report last year said China has continued to strengthen the PLA's ability to 'fight and win wars against a strong enemy.' How do China's missiles compare to those of others? The U.S. report also estimated China had more than 500 operational nuclear warheads as of May 2023 and was on track to accumulate more than 1,000 operational nuclear warheads by 2030. China has not revealed the size of its nuclear arsenal. In comparison, Russia is believed to have a total inventory of more than 5,580 warheads — including 4,380 stockpiled warheads for operational forces, as well as an additional 1,200 retired warheads awaiting dismantlement — according to a report this year by the Federation of American Scientists. The same report put the U.S. nuclear warheads at 5,044. How common are missile tests in the region? Few countries have ICBMs in their arsenal, and testing is usually restricted to their own territory. North Korea has carried out multiple ICBM tests since 2017, including firing a developmental solid-fueled missile in December that came down in the waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The U.S. earlier this year fired two unarmed ICBMs equipped with reentry vehicles from California and brought them down on an American test site in the Marshall Islands.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-s-behind-china-s-launch-of-an-intercontinental-ballistic-missile/7800052.html	2024-09-26T03:02:28-07:00

AFRICOM, African militaries unite to combat gender-based violence	Gaborone, Botswana — U.S. Africa Command, or AFRICOM, is working with southern African countries to combat gender-based violence in the military. This week, AFRICOM and regional military officials are holding a series of workshops in Zambia to strengthen regional collaboration in the fight against workplace harassment. AFRICOM and its component, the U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Air Forces Africa, or USAFE-AFAFRICA, have united with the Zambia Defense Force to foster strategies to tackle gender-based violence in the region. Botswana and Zambia are participating in efforts to strengthen regional initiatives against sexual assault. Lieutenant Colonel Linda Jones, USAFE-AFAFRICA chief for African health engagements, said it is imperative to come up with strategies to fight gender-based violence in the armed forces. 'It is the responsibility of leaders that all of us set the tone, including an environment where everyone is valued and empowered to speak up against misconduct,' she said. 'This involves not only enforcing policies but also modeling respect for behavior and actively supporting those who report incidents.' In 2021, U.S. Defense Department officials reported sexual violence had reached the highest level ever reported, with 8.4% of women assaulted on duty. U.S. Air Force Tech Sergeant Samara Brown said if left unchecked, gender-based violence can affect execution of military tasks. 'Gender-based violence undermines the core values of any military organization,' Brown said. 'It erodes trust, disrupts unity, cohesion and ultimately compromises mission readiness. We must take a firm stand against it, not just as a matter of policy but a commitment to uphold the principles of honor, integrity and respect that define our service.' Retired U.S. Air Force official and workplace development consultant Keith Castille facilitated the Lusaka workshop. He said such collaborations with the Zambia Defense Force can ensure gender-based violence is addressed within regional militaries. 'No military can tackle this issue alone,' he said. 'By sharing knowledge and collaborating across branches and communities, we can develop more effective strategies to combat gender-based violence. Engaging in open dialogue, facilitating workshops and creating joint initiatives will enable us to learn from one another and strengthen our collective efforts.' Attending the workshop in Lusaka, Zambian Defense Force Major Stephen Muleya said the military workplace must be free of gender-based harassment. 'When individuals know that they can perform their duties without the threat of harassment or violence, they are more likely to focus fully on their missions,' he said. 'We must actively cultivate an atmosphere where everyone can thrive free from fear and intimidation.' Zambian officials said they’re planning to open a regional office for innovative gender-based violence solutions. Zambian air force legal adviser Major Glory Musonda said collaboration with U.S. partners should result in solutions to gender-based violence within the force. 'We all have a responsibility to build military environments where respect and dignity are upheld,' Musonda said. 'It’s not enough to simply acknowledge the issue, we must actively work toward solutions that ensure the safety and well-being of every service member.' Meanwhile, officials representing the U.S. Army War College are in Lusaka for discussions on women, peace and security, which aligns with efforts to address gender-based violence in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africom-african-militaries-unite-to-combat-gender-based-violence/7800014.html	2024-09-26T01:00:47-07:00	
South Korea publishes compensation plan for dog meat farmers ahead of 2027 ban	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea announced plans Thursday to compensate famers and others in the country's dwindling dog meat industry before a formal ban goes effect in 2027, a move that is drawing opposition from both farmers and animal rights activists. South Korea's parliament passed a landmark bill in January that will ban slaughtering, breeding or selling dog meat for human consumption after a three-year grace period. It will be punishable by 2-3 years in prison. The Agriculture Ministry said that farmers would receive compensation starting from 225,000 won ($170), and rising up to 600,000 won ($450) per dog if they agree to shut down their business early. It's likely that farmers won't accept the offer, as they earlier called for 2 million won ($1,505) per dog. They've said the ban infringes on their freedom and will aggravate their economic difficulties. In a statement Tuesday, an association of dog farmers called for the law to be amended to extend the grace period and add appropriate compensation plans. Sangkyung Lee, a campaign manager at the Korean office of the anti-animal cruelty group Humane Society International, called the South Korean announcement 'an important milestone in this historic ban that will see the ban through to completion and end our country's dog meat era for good.' But Lee said his office is 'disappointed' at the South Korean plan because it would pay farmers based on the number of dogs they have, 'potentially increasing dog breeding to get more money from the scheme and more puppies being born into suffering.' Dog meat consumption is a centuries-old practice on the Korean Peninsula. Dog meat is eaten in China, Vietnam, Indonesia and some African countries. But South Korea's dog meat industry has drawn more attention because of the country's reputation as a cultural and economic powerhouse. It's also the only nation with industrial-scale dog farms. South Korea's anti-dog meat campaign received a big boost from the country's first lady, Kim Keon Hee, who repeatedly expressed her support for a prohibition. She was subjected to withering criticism and crude insults during demonstrations by farmers. Surveys have found that that around one in three South Koreans opposes the ban, though most people now don't eat dog meat and favor a ban. Vice Agriculture Minster Park Beomsu told reporters that government studies found that about 466,000 dogs are currently being raised for food across South Korea. He said officials will try to convince farmers to voluntarily phase out dog breeding ahead of the ban. After the ban comes into force, Park said, the government plans to facilitate adoptions for the remaining dogs or move them to care facilities rather than euthanize them. The agriculture ministry said butchers will also be compensated, while local authorities will be responsible for dismantling dog farms and slaughterhouses. Former farmers and butchers will also get low-interest loans if they pivot to other agricultural businesses. The ministry said authorities will also offer financial assistance to traders and restaurant owners to shut down their businesses and find new jobs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-publishes-compensation-plan-for-dog-meat-farmers-ahead-of-2027-ban/7800001.html	2024-09-26T00:08:06-07:00	
Pope Francis heads for Luxembourg and Belgium on a trip to a dwindling flock	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis is traveling to once-strong bastions of Christianity in the heart of Europe to try to reinvigorate a Catholic flock that is dwindling in the face of secular trends and abuse scandals that have largely emptied the continent's magnificent cathedrals and village churches. Francis stops first Thursday in Luxembourg, the European Union's second-smallest country, with a population of some 650,000 people, and its richest per capita. Torrential downpours are expected, days after the 87-year-old pope canceled his audiences because of a slight flu. He seemed in fine form at the Vatican on Wednesday, during his general audience on the eve of the trip, but his respiratory health is a constant concern and his medical team will be on hand. After meeting with Luxembourg's political leaders, Francis will speak to the country's Catholic priests and nuns. The venue is the late-Gothic Cathedral of Notre Dame, which was built in the early 1600s by Francis' own Jesuit order and stands as a monument to Christianity's long and central place in European history. Francis is likely to dwell on Europe's role past, present and future — particularly as war rages on European soil — during his visits to Luxembourg and Belgium, where he arrives later Thursday and stays through the weekend. The trip is a much-truncated version of the 10-day, 1985 tour St. John Paul II made through Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands, during which the Polish pope delivered 59 speeches or homilies and was greeted by hundreds of thousands of adoring faithful. In Luxembourg alone, John Paul drew a crowd of some 45,000 people to his Mass, or some 10% of the then-population, and officials had predicted a million people would welcome him in Belgium, according to news reports at the time. But then as now, the head of the Catholic Church faced indifference and even hostility to core Vatican teachings on contraception and sexual morals, opposition that has only increased in the ensuing generation. Those secular trends and the crisis over clergy abuse have helped lead to the decline of the church in the region, with monthly Mass attendance in the single digits and plummeting ordinations of new priests. Vatican spokesman Matteo Bruni said that by traveling to the two countries, Francis will likely want to offer 'a word to the heart of Europe, of its history, the role it wants to play in the world in the future.' Immigration, climate change and peace are likely to be themes during the four-day visit, which was organized primarily to mark the 600th anniversary of the founding of Belgium's two main Catholic universities. In Luxembourg, Francis has a top ally and friend in the lone cardinal from the country, Jean-Claude Hollerich, a Jesuit like the Argentine pope. Hollerich, whom Francis made a cardinal in 2019, has taken on a leading role in the pope's multi-year church reform effort as the 'general rapporteur' of his big synod, or meeting, on the future of the Catholic Church. In that capacity, Hollerich has helped oversee local, national and continental-wide consultations of rank-and-file Catholics and synthesized their views into working papers for bishops and other delegates to discuss at their Vatican meetings, the second session of which opens next week. Last year, in another sign of his esteem for the progressive cardinal, Francis appointed Hollerich to serve on his kitchen cabinet, known as the Council of Cardinals. The group of nine prelates from around the globe meet several times a year at the Vatican to help Francis govern.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-heads-for-luxembourg-and-belgium-on-a-trip-to-a-dwindling-flock/7800000.html	2024-09-25T23:48:27-07:00	
Japanese court acquits former boxer in a 1966 murder retrial	TOKYO — A Japanese court ruled Thursday that an 88-year-old former boxer was not guilty in a retrial for a 1966 quadruple murder, reversing an earlier wrongful conviction after decades on death row. Iwao Hakamada's acquittal by the Shizuoka District Court makes him the fifth death-row convict to be found not guilty in a retrial in postwar Japanese criminal justice. The case could rekindle a debate around abolishing the death penalty in Japan. The court's presiding judge, Koshi Kunii, said the court acknowledged multiple fabrications of evidence and that Hakamada was not the culprit, NHK said. Hakamada was convicted of murder in the 1966 killing of a company manager and three of his family members and setting a fire to their central Japan home. He was sentenced to death in 1968 but was not executed due to lengthy appeals and the retrial process. He spent 48 years behind bars — most of them on death row — making him the world's longest-serving death row inmate. It took 27 years for the top court to deny his first appeal for retrial. His second appeal for a retrial was filed in 2008 by his sister Hideko Hakamada, now 91, and the court finally ruled in his favor in 2023, paving the way for the latest retrial that began in October. Hakamada was released from prison in 2014 when a court ordered a retrial based on new evidence suggesting his conviction may have been based on fabricated accusations by investigators but was not cleared of the conviction. After his release, Hakamada served his sentence at home because his frail health and age made him a low risk for escape. At a final hearing at the Shizuoka court in May before Thursday's decision, prosecutors again demanded the death penalty, triggering criticism from rights groups that prosecutors were trying to prolong the trial. The extremely high hurdles for retrials have also prompted legal experts to call for a revision to the system. During the investigation that followed his arrest, Hakamada initially denied the accusations, then confessed. He later said he was forced to confess under violent interrogation by police. A major point of contention was five pieces of blood-stained clothing that investigators claimed Hakamada wore during the crime and hid in a tank of fermented soybean paste, or miso. The clothes were found more than a year after his arrest. A Tokyo High Court ruling in 2023 acknowledged scientific experiments that clothing soaked in miso for more than a year turns too dark for bloodstains to be spotted, noting a possible fabrication by investigators. Defense lawyers and earlier retrial decisions said the blood samples did not match Hakamada's DNA, and trousers that prosecutors submitted as evidence were too small for Hakamada and did not fit when he tried them on. Japan and the United States are the only two countries in the Group of Seven advanced nations that retain capital punishment. A survey by the Japanese government showed an overwhelming majority of the public support executions. Executions are carried out in secrecy in Japan and prisoners are not informed of their fate until the morning they are hanged. In 2007, Japan began disclosing the names of those executed and some details of their crimes, but disclosures are still limited. Supporters say Hakamada's nearly half-century detention has taken a toll on his mental health. Most of his time behind bars was spent in solitary confinement, in fear of execution. He spent a total of 48 years in prison, more than 45 of them on death row. His sister Hideko Hakamada has devoted around half of her life to win his innocence. Before Thursday's ruling, she said she was in a never-ending battle. 'It is so difficult to get a retrial started,' she told reporters in Tokyo. 'Not just Iwao, but I'm sure there are other people who have been wrongly accused and crying. … I want the criminal law revised so that retrials are more easily available.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/japanese-court-acquits-former-boxer-in-a-1966-murder-retrial/7799995.html	2024-09-25T23:46:21-07:00	
Hong Kong welcomes new giant pandas gifted by Beijing	HONG KONG — Hong Kong welcomed a new pair of giant pandas gifted by Beijing on Thursday with a lavish ceremony, raising hopes for a boost to the city's tourism. An An and Ke Ke are the third pair of giant pandas to be sent to the city from mainland China since the former British colony returned to Chinese rule in 1997. Their arrival came after their new neighbor, Ying Ying, gave birth to twins last month and became the world's oldest first-time panda mother on record. With the addition of the new bears, the twins, and their father, Le Le, Hong Kong now houses six pandas. Chief Executive John Lee on Tuesday said An An is a 5-year-old male panda who is agile, intelligent and active, while Ke Ke, a 5-year-old female, is good at climbing, cute and has a gentle temperament. The new arrivals will undergo two months of quarantine and adapt to their new home at Ocean Park, a zoo and aquarium that has long been a favorite of residents and tourists. Lee expressed hope that the public could meet the new bears in mid-December. In October, the government will invite residents to propose new names that showcase the pandas' characteristics. Tourism industry representatives are optimistic about the potential impact of housing six pandas, hoping it will boost visitor numbers in Hong Kong. Officials have encouraged businesses to capitalize on the popularity of the new bears and newborn cubs to seize opportunities in what some lawmakers have dubbed the 'panda economy.' Pandas are widely considered China's unofficial national mascot. The country's giant panda loan program with overseas zoos has long been seen as a tool of Beijing's soft-power diplomacy. Giant pandas are only found in China's southwest and their population is under threat from development. But caring for pandas in captivity is expensive. A zoo in Finland agreed with Chinese authorities to return two loaned giant pandas to China more than eight years ahead of schedule because they were too costly for the facility to maintain amid declining visitors. Hong Kong's Ocean Park has been hosting pandas since 1999, when the first pair, An An and Jia Jia, arrived in the financial hub shortly after it was handed back to China. Jia Jia, who died at 38 in 2016, is the world's oldest-ever panda to have lived in captivity. The average lifespan for a panda in the wild is 18 to 20 years, while in captivity it's 30 years, according to the Guinness World Records.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-welcomes-new-giant-pandas-gifted-by-beijing/7799992.html	2024-09-25T23:31:12-07:00	
Deadly Thai floods intensified by climate change, La Niña displace 150,000 families	CHIANG RAI, Thailand — The severe and prolonged flooding that has deluged Thailand is devastating hundreds of thousands of residents and prompting calls for long-term solutions, including measures to mitigate the long-term impact of climate change. Thailand suffers from an annual monsoon season from July to October. Although floods are common nationwide, authorities say this year has been the worst in decades. Thanapon Piman, senior research fellow, SEI Asia Center, says climate change has contributed to the flooding. 'Climate change and La Niña ... cause heavy rainfall over the region more than normal condition. For example, the monthly rainfall in Chiang Rai in August is higher [than] normal [by] 40% to 50%. Mae Sai has faced flooding six times in a month, which never happened before,' he told VOA. The La Niña phenomenon is the natural cooling of the water in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean. It occurs every few years and affects weather worldwide. Thanapon said authorities knew La Niña would make this season wetter than normal, but not that it would be so extreme. 'This is certainly caused by climate changes.' The floods were exacerbated by Typhoon Yagi, which rampaged through Thailand and other Southeast Asian countries in mid-September. Upwards of 150,000 families have been affected by the floods in Thailand, with 46 killed, according to Disaster Prevention and Mitigation Department. 'It triggered severe flash floods and mudslides over the north region. As the result of heavy rainfall since August, land turned into saturated soil. Thus, when the heavy rainfall from the Yagi Typhoon hit the region, it caused the extreme flooding,' Thanapon said. 'Flooding and extreme events happen [not] only [in] Thailand but also happen in Vietnam, the Philippines, Laos and Myanmar.' In Chiang Mai, the second largest city in Thailand, floods have intensified in recent days. Direct daily train service between Bangkok and Chiang Mai was temporarily affected by a landslide, while roads were flooded. In Chiang Rai itself, the flooding has been a problem for weeks, with at least 1,268 families affected. Residents told VOA that the floods were waist-deep and even though they have subsided, foot-deep water remains in the streets while buildings are clogged with sludgy mud. Chalermpon 'Por' Thungkham owns a congee restaurant in Chiang Rai with his mother and father. He says the floods have ruined his home and business. 'The stuff for the food to prepare got damaged, the electricity got cut, everything is ruined inside. It was like this for three days until it got back to ‘normal,’ but then there was the mud. We wanted to clean the mud, but we didn’t have the water supply,' he told VOA. He said his breakfast shop usually brings in around $30 per day, but the damage to his facilities is equal to a year’s worth of income. His family has been relying on aid trucks to bring everyday supplies. 'The flooding has caused more than maybe 300,000 THB ($9,168) of damage. The car, the furniture we need to fix. It will take one month to clean and re-open the restaurant,' he added. Fifty miles north in Mae Sai, on the border with Myanmar, relatives of the city’s residents have come from around the country to help repair and clean up ruined homes. One of those is Sky, a hairdresser who works in Bangkok. 'I came back to Chiang Rai because I was worried about my mother and child who were trapped in our house for three days during the flooding,' she told VOA. 'We still have mud on both sides of the house, and there is still mud in the kitchen and bathroom that needs to be cleaned. We have to wait for clean water.' The Wat Tham Pha Chom Buddhist Temple has become a makeshift shelter for hundreds of residents in Mae Sai. Situated on a hill, the religious sanctuary has been largely unaffected by the floods. 'After the big flooding, the people came to stay here,' said Phra Manatcha Pothisam, a monk and acting director of Wat Tham Pha Chom, who spoke to VOA amid stacked water containers and piles of second-hand clothes for those in need. 'There was around 300 people, men and women are separated, but we provide food for meals, drinking water, and some clothes. This is from donations and government subsidies. Right now there are 150 people live here,' he said. 'Many of the villagers were very scared. This temple is the place for meditation [and] has been supported by the people, so we need to give back.' Paetongtarn Shinawatra, who became Thailand’s 31st prime minister in August, has said the government’s top priority is addressing the flooding, and called for the mud to be cleared in Chiang Rai promptly. Economically, the floods could cause Thailand up to $176 million in damages, Thailand’s Chamber of Commerce has estimated. But Arisara Lekkham, a lecturer at the School of Law at the Mae Fah Luang University in Chiang Rai insists Thailand needs a long-term plan to combat the flooding. 'Flood management should become a regular, year-round effort rather than a reactive, seasonal approach,' she told VOA. 'Many houses are damaged, and it will take months before people can return to their homes. It is proposed that the government implement additional relief measures for the affected people. The lessons learned from the Chiang Rai floods should be applied to other areas currently facing flood problems, especially regarding early warning systems,' she added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-thai-floods-intensified-by-climate-change-la-ni%c3%b1a-displace-150-000-families/7799976.html	2024-09-25T22:31:07-07:00

UK foreign secretary: ‘We stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the Ukrainians’	NEW YORK — Among the issues on the agenda for world leaders who gathered this week for the United Nations General Assembly is Russia’s war against Ukraine. In an interview in New York with VOA’s Ukrainian Service, U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy said his nation stands 'shoulder-to-shoulder with the Ukrainians' and will provide Ukraine with military aid for 'as long as it takes' to help it 'stand off this aggression.' He also cited intelligence findings that Russian President Vladimir Putin is facing mounting problems, with a deteriorating economy and mounting battlefield losses. The following has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: Have you had the chance to discuss with your counterparts in other countries, including U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the issue of lifting restrictions on Ukraine using long-range Western missiles against targets inside Russia? U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy: It was very important for me to be with Secretary Blinken in Ukraine just two weeks ago to see for ourselves, to discuss with [Ukrainian] President [Volodymyr] Zelenskyy ... also to discuss Ukraine’s needs as they head out of the autumn into the winter, and that we continue as allies to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position to stand off this aggression that we're seeing from Vladimir Putin. That was why I also went to the White House with [U.K.] Prime Minister [Keir] Starmer. We remain in the U.K. absolutely clear that we stand shoulder to shoulder with the Ukrainians. It's important that Ukraine has the finances and the money, the military aid, as well as the political, diplomatic and humanitarian aid, to get through 2025. And of course, here at the U.N. General Assembly, I will meet with Zelenskyy once again today. But, also, it's hugely important that we rally the Global South to ensure that they're not falling into the trap of Russian propaganda … and efforts to destabilize [and distract] the international community … when in fact what they are doing is taking ballistic missiles from Iran to use against [Ukrainian] men, women and children. VOA: You’ve already mentioned this meeting between Prime Minister Keir Starmer and U.S. President Joe Biden in Washington. Can you share the details of the conversation? Lammy: I do think it is very important for us in the U.K. and Europe, and of course in the United States, to understand more the details of President Zelenskyy’s 'victory plan.' And over the coming days, he will present that in detail to close allies. And of course, I’m not going to speculate what’s in the papers … because I don’t want to give any advantage to Vladimir Putin. But I am really clear that this is a time for Western allies to show nerve and guts, because Vladimir Putin thinks that we’ll get distracted. He thinks that we haven’t got the attention span to stand with our Ukrainian friends. That’s why we in the U.K. have found 3 billion pounds for Ukraine to buy and have the military equipment it needs, not just this year, [but] for every year as long as it takes. And that’s what I said to my G7 allies last night when I met with them. That’s the position we’ve got to ensure Ukraine is in. VOA: When do you think this crucial decision could be made? Lammy: We meet here in the U.N. General Assembly. I know that President Zelenskyy is meeting with President Biden a little bit later in the week also in Washington. We will head on to the G20 [summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, November 18-19, 2024] as well. So, over the coming days and weeks, I expect us to be in a very strong position to ensure that Ukraine is in the best position it can be as we head into that tough winter in 2025. And let's just be clear about what I mean by that. All of our intelligence actually suggests things are going to get a lot tougher for Vladimir Putin as he comes out of next year. His economy is in trouble. He's going to find it very problematic with the amount of losses and casualties that he's taking. And actually, when you look at what Ukraine is doing — their ability to take back half the ground that's been lost, their ability to repel him from the Black Sea, their ability to advance in Kursk and hopefully keep the ground — this is a time for Western countries to show their nerve and to be absolutely committed as we head out of the autumn into the winter period. VOA: What do you say to people, including leaders, who warn that allowing Ukraine to use long-range weapons to strike inside Russia could lead to a third world war? Lammy: Well, we’re really clear that under the U.N. Charter and under Article 51, Ukraine has the right to defend itself, to defend itself against the horrendous attacks that are coming from Russia, and we will do all we can within international law and the rules of engagement to support Ukraine to defend itself. VOA: You said that the war between Russia and Ukraine is likely to continue for at least another two years. Will Ukraine and the West will have enough to stand so long? Lammy: Let’s be clear: The war could end tomorrow if Putin left. That’s how it ends: Leave Ukraine. But in the absence of Putin showing any desire to negotiate, we have to continue to stand with Ukraine, because the cost of not standing with Ukraine would actually be financially far greater. You know, defense spending would rise substantially across all Western allies, and indeed, there will be a very vulnerable Baltic frontier in relation to Putin's threats. So, that is why we stand with Ukraine for as long as it takes. And I'm quite sure that ... this war will only be settled in the end politically, of course. That also gets into the security guarantees that Ukraine needs. And we've always believed in the U.K. that that path to Ukraine joining NATO is a very important dimension of that security guarantee.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-foreign-secretary-we-stand-shoulder-to-shoulder-with-the-ukrainians-/7799955.html	2024-09-25T20:56:03-07:00

Harris promises tax breaks, investments for US manufacturers	PITTSBURGH — U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris said on Wednesday she would offer tax credits to domestic manufacturers and invest in sectors that will 'define the next century,' as she detailed her economic plan to boost the U.S. middle class. Speaking at the Economic Club of Pittsburgh in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, the Democratic candidate in the November 5 presidential election said she would give tax credits to U.S. manufacturers for retooling or rebuilding existing factories and expanding 'good union jobs,' and double the number of registered apprenticeships during her first term. Harris also promised new investments in industries like bio-manufacturing, aerospace, artificial intelligence and clean energy. Harris' speech, which lasted just under 40 minutes, did not detail how these policies would work. She highlighted her upbringing by a single mother, in contrast with former President Donald Trump, the wealthy son of a New York real estate developer. 'I have pledged that building a strong middle class will be the defining goal of my presidency,' Harris said, adding that she sees the election as a moment of choice between two 'fundamentally different' visions of the U.S. economy held by her and her Republican opponent, Trump. The vice president and Trump are focusing their campaign messaging on the economy, which Reuters/Ipsos polling shows is voters' top concern, as the election approaches. The divide between rich and poor has grown in recent decades. The share of American households in the middle class, defined as those with two-thirds to double that of median household income, has dropped from around 62% in 1970 to 51% in 2023, Pew Research shows. These households' income has also not grown as fast as those in the top tier. Harris said she was committed to working with the private sector and entrepreneurs to help grow the middle class. She told the audience that she is 'a capitalist' who believes in 'free and fair markets,' and described her policies as pragmatic rather than rooted in ideology. Harris in recent months has blunted Trump's advantage on the economy, with a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday showing the Republican candidate with a marginal advantage of 2 percentage points on 'the economy, unemployment and jobs,' down from an 11-point lead in late July. Trump discussed his economic plan in North Carolina on Wednesday and said Harris' role as vice president gave her the chance now to improve the economic record of the Biden administration. 'Families are suffering now. So if she has a plan, she should stop grandstanding and do it,' he said. While Trump has proposed across-the-board tariffs on foreign-made goods -- a proposal backed by a slim majority of voters -- Harris is focusing on providing incentives for businesses to keep their operations in the U.S. Boosting American manufacturing in industries such as semiconductors and bringing back jobs that have moved overseas in recent decades have also been major goals for Biden. The Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, and the Inflation Reduction Act -- all passed in 2021 and 2022 -- fund a range of subsidies and tax incentives that encourage companies to place projects in disadvantaged regions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harris-promises-tax-breaks-investments-for-us-manufacturers/7799930.html	2024-09-25T19:53:41-07:00	
Hurricane Helene is expected to hit Florida as a major storm, strike far inland	TALLAHASSEE, Florida — An enormous Hurricane Helene swamped parts of Mexico on Wednesday as it churned on a path forecasters said would take it to Florida as a potentially catastrophic storm with a surge that could swallow entire homes, a chilling warning that sent residents scrambling for higher ground, closed schools, and led to states of emergency throughout the Southeast. Helene's center was about 735 kilometers southwest of Tampa, Florida, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said, and the hurricane was expected to intensify and accelerate as it crosses the Gulf of Mexico toward the Big Bend area of Florida's northwestern coast. Landfall was expected sometime Thursday evening, and the hurricane center said by then it could be a major Category 4 storm with winds above 208 kph. Tropical storm conditions were expected in southern Florida on Wednesday night, spreading northward and encompassing the rest of Florida as well as Georgia and South Carolina through Thursday night. The storm was moving north at 19 kph with top sustained winds of 140 kph Wednesday evening. Helene could create a life-threatening storm surge as high as 6.1 meters in parts of the Big Bend region, forecasters said. Its tropical storm-force winds extended as far as 555 kilometers from its center. The fast-moving storm's wind and rain also could penetrate far inland: The hurricane center posted hurricane warnings well into Georgia and tropical storm warnings as far north as North Carolina, and it warned that much of the Southeast could experience prolonged power outages, toppled trees and dangerous flooding. 'Just hope and pray that everybody's safe,' said Connie Dillard, of Tallahassee, as she shopped at a grocery store with thinning shelves of water and bread before hitting the highway out of town. 'That's all you can do.' One insurance firm, Gallagher Re, is expecting billions of dollars in damage in the U.S. Around 18,000 linemen from out of state staged in Florida, ready to help restore power. Airports in St. Petersburg, Tallahassee and Tampa were planning to close on Thursday, and 62 hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living facilities evacuated their residents Wednesday. Georgia activated 250 National Guard soldiers for rapid deployment. State game wardens, foresters and Department of Correction teams will help provide swift-water rescues and other emergency responses. State meteorologist Will Lanxton said tropical storm-force winds are expected throughout Georgia. Lanxton said metro Atlanta hasn't seen sustained tropical storm winds since Hurricane Irma in 2017. 'I think we're going to see some significant power outages, probably nothing like we've seen, because it's 159 counties wide,' said James Stallings, director of the Georgia Emergency Management and Homeland Security Agency. In Tallahassee, where stations started to run out of gas, 19-year-old Florida A&M student Kameron Benjamin filled sandbags with his roommate to protect their apartment before evacuating. Their school and Florida State shut down. 'This hurricane is heading straight to Tallahassee, so I really don't know what to expect,' Benjamin said. As Big Bend residents battened down their homes, many saw the ghost of 2018's Hurricane Michael. That storm rapidly intensified and crashed ashore as a Category 5 that laid waste to Panama City and parts of the rural Panhandle. On Wednesday, the National Weather Service posted an urgent warning for residents along Apalachee Bay: 'There is a danger of catastrophic and unsurvivable storm surge for Apalachee Bay,' it said. 'Storm surge may begin to arrive as early as late Wednesday night ahead of the winds. This forecast, if realized, is a nightmare surge scenario for Apalachee Bay. Please, please, please take any evacuation orders seriously!' 'People are taking heed and hightailing it out of there for higher ground,' said Kristin Korinko, a Tallahassee resident who serves as the commodore of the Shell Point Sailboard Club, on the Gulf Coast about 48 kilometers south of Tallahassee. For toughened Floridians who are used to hurricanes, Robbie Berg, a national warning coordinator for the hurricane center, advised: 'Please do not compare it to other storms you may have experienced over the past year or two.' Helene is forecast to be one of the largest storms in breadth in years to hit the region, said Colorado State University hurricane researcher Phil Klotzbach. He said since 1988, only three Gulf hurricanes were bigger than Helene's predicted size: 2017's Irma, 2005's Wilma and 1995's Opal. Areas 160 kilometers north of the Georgia-Florida line can expect hurricane conditions. More than half of Georgia's public school districts and several universities canceled classes. And for Atlanta, which is under a tropical storm watch, Helene could be the worst strike on a major Southern inland city in 35 years, said University of Georgia meteorology professor Marshall Shepherd. 'It's going to be a lot like Hugo in Charlotte,' Shepherd said of the 1989 storm that struck the North Carolina city, knocking out power to 85% of customers as winds gusted above hurricane force. Landslides were possible in southern Appalachia, with catastrophic flooding predicted in the Carolinas and Georgia, where all three governors declared emergencies. Rainfall is possible as far away as Tennessee, Kentucky and Indiana. Parts of Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula were under hurricane warnings as Helene wound between it and the western tip of Cuba and into the Gulf of Mexico. The storm formed Tuesday in the Caribbean, and it flooded streets and toppled trees as it passed offshore and brushed the resort city of Cancun. In Cuba, authorities moved cattle to higher ground and medical brigades went to communities often cut off by storms. The government preventively shut off power in some communities as waves as high as 5 meters slammed Cortes Bay. In the Cayman Islands, schools remained closed as residents pumped water from flooded homes. In the U.S., federal authorities positioned generators, food and water, along with search-and-rescue and power restoration teams. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis warned that Helene could be as strong as a Category 4 hurricane when it makes landfall. The state was providing buses to evacuate people in the Big Bend region and taking them to shelters in Tallahassee. But near Florida's center, outside Orlando, Walt Disney World said its only closures Thursday would be the Typhoon Lagoon water park and its miniature golf courses. Helene is the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season, which began June 1. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. In the Pacific, former Hurricane John reformed Wednesday as a tropical storm and was strengthening as it threatened areas of Mexico's western coast. Officials posted hurricane warnings for southwestern Mexico. John hit the country's southern Pacific coast late Monday, killing at least two people, triggering mudslides, and damaging homes and trees. It grew into a Category 3 hurricane in a matter of hours and made landfall east of Acapulco. It reemerged over the ocean after weakening inland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hurricane-helene-is-expected-to-hit-florida-as-a-major-storm-strike-far-inland/7799918.html	2024-09-25T19:32:42-07:00

Tunisia presidential candidate sentenced to six months in prison	tunis, tunisia — A Tunisian court sentenced presidential candidate Ayachi Zammel to six months in prison on Wednesday on charges of falsifying documents, his lawyer told Reuters, the second prison sentence against him in a week, days before the presidential election. The verdict highlights rising tensions ahead of the election, amid opposition and civil society groups' fears of a rigged election aimed at keeping President Kais Saied in power. Zammel was sentenced to 20 months in prison last week on charges of falsifying popular endorsements. 'It is another unjust ruling and a farce that clearly aims to weaken him in the election race, but we will defend his right to the last minute,' Zammel attorney Abdessattar Massoudi told Reuters. Zammel was among only three admitted candidates competing for the position of president alongside incumbent Saied and Zouhair Magzhaoui. Political tensions in the North African country have risen ahead of the October 6 election since an electoral commission named by Saied disqualified three prominent candidates this month amid protests by opposition and civil society groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-presidential-candidate-sentenced-to-six-months-in-prison/7799885.html	2024-09-25T18:23:39-07:00

Hong Kong court to sentence 2 former editors found guilty of sedition in landmark case	HONG KONG — A Hong Kong court is due to sentence two former editors on Thursday who have been found guilty of sedition after publishing articles about the national security crackdown in the city under China — a ruling that has prompted an international outcry. In a landmark case about media freedom, Chung Pui-kuen and Patrick Lam of the now-defunct Stand News media outlet were convicted last month — the first time that journalists have been found guilty of sedition since the handover of Hong Kong from Britain to China in 1997. Chung, 55, and Lam, 36, had pleaded not guilty. Stand News, once Hong Kong's leading online media outlet, was known for its hard-hitting reports about the city's 2019 pro-democracy protests and later the national security crackdown. Under Hong Kong law, they could be jailed for up to two years. Liz Throssell, a spokesperson for the U.N. Human Rights Office, said the office was calling on Hong Kong authorities to review the court's decision in line with obligations under international human rights law. Twenty-three member states of the Media Freedom Coalition, including the U.S., U.K. and Canada, have similarly signed a statement, urging 'Hong Kong and China authorities to abide by their international human rights commitments and legal obligations, and to respect freedom of the press and freedom of speech in Hong Kong.' A spokesperson for Hong Kong's government said in a statement that the government 'strongly disapproved of and rejected the fact-twisting remarks and baseless smears' by the coalition. Hong Kong and Chinese officials have said the security clampdown —which has included tighter laws — has been needed to maintain stability after the pro-democracy protests. During the 57-day trial, the prosecution argued that Stand News had acted as a political platform to promote 'illegal' ideologies and incited readers' hatred against the Chinese and Hong Kong governments. Chung wrote in a letter to the court that some Hong Kongers 'care about the freedom and dignity of everyone in the community and are willing to pay the price of losing their own freedom.' 'Recording and reporting their stories and thoughts truthfully is an unavoidable responsibility for journalists,' Chung wrote. Lam wrote that 'the only way for journalists to defend press freedom is to report.' Stand News was raided by police in December 2021 and its assets were frozen, leading to its closure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-court-to-sentence-2-former-editors-found-guilty-of-sedition-in-landmark-case/7799855.html	2024-09-25T17:40:05-07:00	
Pakistan's PM Sharif hails IMF's $7B loan approval	islamabad — Pakistan reported Wednesday that the International Monetary Fund, or IMF, had approved a crucial $7 billion loan for the cash-strapped nation struggling to meet its external financing needs. In a statement issued by his office, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 'expressed satisfaction' and hailed the IMF's approval of the much-needed loan. He also thanked Kristalina Georgieva, the IMF chief, and his own economic team for successfully negotiating the agreement, the statement said. The Washington-based global lender was expected to release a separate statement. Pakistani media reports said the IMF had agreed to the 37-month loan agreement for the South Asian nation under the Extended Fund Facility and authorized the immediate release of the first tranche of nearly $1.1 billion. Sharif, who is in New York for the U.N. General Assembly session, told Pakistani media representatives before Wednesday's approval that his government had met all of the lender's conditions. He stated that the lender had 'set stringent conditions' for the loan program preliminarily agreed to in July. The prime minister credited Pakistan's longtime allies, China, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, with helping Islamabad finalize the IMF deal, but he did not elaborate. Pakistan was required to seek an extension on existing $5 billion, $4 billion and $3 billion cash loan agreements from Riyadh, Beijing and Abu Dhabi to fulfill a critical IMF condition. Islamabad reportedly has committed not to repay more than $12 billion in debt to three allied nations and Kuwait during the 37-month IMF program period. The new $7 billion loan is Pakistan's 25th IMF program since it gained independence in 1947 — the highest number acquired by any country. 'We are committed to ensuring this is the last time we seek such financial support from the IMF,' Sharif reiterated while speaking to Pakistani media in New York. However, critics remain skeptical about his assertions. Experts blame chronic economic mismanagement, corruption, repeated dictatorial military regimes, and the failure of successive elected governments to introduce much-needed reforms for the financial troubles facing Pakistan, a nuclear-armed country of more than 240 million people. Islamabad has managed its external funding needs in the past with loans, economic support from its long-standing allies and IMF financial assistance. Historic inflation Experts describe Pakistan's latest economic crisis as the most prolonged. Inflation reached historic levels, pushing the country to the brink of default on its external payments before an IMF bailout helped avert the crisis last summer. Inflation has since eased, and credit ratings agency Moody's has upgraded Pakistan's local and foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings, citing improved macroeconomic conditions and moderately better government liquidity and external positions. The Sharif administration also has ramped up efforts to increase its tax intake in line with the IMF requirements, despite protests by traders and opposition parties over the new tax scheme and high energy rates. The Asian Development Bank, or ADB, said in a Wednesday report that Pakistan's economic outlook hinges on continued and effective economic reform. It expected the IMF loan program to enhance the country's macroeconomic stability, consolidate public finances, expand social spending and protection, and rebuild foreign exchange, among other things. 'The new government has committed to the necessary stabilization and structural reforms but faces challenges owing to elevated political and institutional tensions and the prospects of social unrest from a steep drop in real incomes,' the ADB warned. Pakistan's economic troubles have deepened because of the political turmoil that hit the country in April 2022 when then-Prime Minister Imran Khan was removed from office through a controversial opposition-led parliamentary vote of no confidence. Khan, who has been imprisoned for more than a year on contentious charges, is the most popular politician in Pakistan. His Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf Party has been organizing anti-government protests. The party alleges that election authorities rigged the February 8 parliamentary polls to hinder Khan-backed candidates from winning and helped military-backed parties' allies to form a coalition government, charges Sharif and army officials deny. Some information for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-s-pm-sharif-hails-imf-s-7b-loan-approval/7799560.html	2024-09-25T17:13:28-07:00

Biden reaches out to Africa at UN General Assembly	new york — President Joe Biden is turning to Africa in the sunset of his presidency. In the space of one day, in front of world leaders, he elevated Sudan's conflict to a priority, announced he would travel to Angola and endorsed adding two seats for African countries to the U.N. Security Council. In his valedictory speech to the U.N. General Assembly on Tuesday, Biden made several brief overtures to the African continent — reminding world leaders of the evils of South Africa’s apartheid regime, calling for an end to Sudan’s grueling conflict and citing urgency in combating an mpox outbreak in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. But these two short lines may have the most weight: 'The U.N. needs to adapt to bring in new voices and new perspectives,' he said. 'That’s why we support reforming and expanding the membership of the U.N. Security Council.' For years, African leaders have called for a seat at this table. But critics point out that Washington does not support a critical privilege enjoyed by the current permanent members of the Security Council: veto power. Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow in the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, says African nations are puzzled by Biden’s position. 'This is really, I think, an unfinished project of his, probably more words than reality,' he told VOA. The fact that Biden supported council membership for them but not veto power 'has left Africans scratching their heads.' John Fortier, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said it mattered that Biden used this platform to call for an end to Sudan’s raging 17-month conflict, but he doubted whether that call would provoke action. Trying to elevate issue 'This is one of the conflicts that is serious but has not been getting world attention, and I think his pointing to it is really to elevate it in world consciousness but not yet to really know how we're going to see an end to this,' Fortier said. This conflict has displaced millions of people and sparked a near-famine. And so, analysts say, it matters that the American president is putting pressure on the warring parties. 'I think Biden genuinely wants to alleviate the humanitarian crisis and resolve the conflict in Sudan,' said Daniel Volman, director of the African Security Research Project, in an email to VOA. 'But I think he is reluctant to press countries like Egypt and the [United Arab] Emirates that are arming the generals, because they are key allies during the Gaza war. 'Also, Biden is being driven by pressure from some members of Congress to take stronger and more effective action. I think he will take some limited action, like the new funds for humanitarian aid just announced, but I don't think this will yield significant results.' And finally, Biden’s off-camera announcement that he will visit Angola next month allows him to keep his promise to visit the continent. But again, Hudson wondered how this long-delayed visit would land. 'Coming, as it does, at the very tail end of his administration, without much to, I think, really celebrate in terms of his involvement in Africa, I think the visit will ring rather hollow,' Hudson said. Biden has four months left in his presidency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-reaches-out-to-africa-at-un-general-assembly/7799553.html	2024-09-25T16:45:28-07:00	
Sudan's jailed former strongman Omar al-Bashir moved to better-equipped hospital	cairo — Sudan's former autocratic President Omar al-Bashir, who ruled for 30 years before he was toppled in a popular uprising and then jailed by the country's military rulers, has been transferred to a medical facility in northern Sudan, his lawyer said Wednesday. Since war broke out in April last year between the Sudanese military and its rival, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), the 80-year-old al-Bashir has been held at a military facility on the outskirts of the Sudanese capital, Khartoum. His lawyer, Mohamed al-Hassan al-Amin, told The Associated Press that al-Bashir was transferred on Tuesday and would get proper care at a better-equipped hospital in the town of Merowe, about 330 kilometers north of Khartoum. Al-Bashir's health had deteriorated recently, the lawyer said, adding that the former strongman suffers from age-related complications and high blood pressure. 'He needs regular checks and follow-ups,' al-Amin said over the phone, 'but his condition is not critical.' Al-Amin said that Sudan's former Defense Minister Abdel-Rahim Muhammad Hussein — who was also arrested soon after al-Bashir — also was transferred to the same facility. He suffers from heart-related problems, the lawyer said. The office of Sudan's military spokesman declined to comment when contacted by the AP. Al-Bashir ruled Sudan for three decades, despite wars and sanctions, before he was overthrown during a popular uprising in 2019. He is wanted by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for genocide and other crimes committed during the conflict in Sudan's western Darfur region in the 2000s. The ICC has indicted both al-Bashir and Hussein on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes committed in Darfur, where the government's campaign was marked by mass killings, rape, torture and persecution. Some 300,000 people were killed and 2.7 million were driven from their homes. Sudan's military rulers — now themselves fighting to stay in power in a bitter conflict with the rival RSF — declined ICC requests that al-Bashir and others wanted by the world court be handed over for trial. Al-Bashir, Hussein and others were held in a Khartoum prison before being taken to a fortified military base after the prison was attacked by the RSF in April last year. Another former official, Ahmed Harun, who is also wanted by the ICC, walked away after the prison was attacked. His whereabouts are unknown. The latest war in Sudan has devastated Khartoum and many other urban areas and also has been marked by atrocities, such as mass rape and ethnically motivated killings. The United Nations and international rights groups say these acts also amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in Darfur, which has been facing a bitter onslaught by the RSF. The war has killed at least 20,000 people and left tens of thousands wounded, according to the United Nations. Rights groups and activists say the toll is much higher. The conflict has also forced some 10 million people to flee their homes in Sudan — about a quarter of the country's population, according to the International Organization for Migration. Of them, more than 2 million have been driven abroad, mostly to neighboring Chad, South Sudan and Egypt, the IOM said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-jailed-former-strongman-omar-al-bashir-taken-to-hospital-in-north-for-better-care-/7799517.html	2024-09-25T16:27:40-07:00

A decade after Uyghur scholar's life sentencing, calls for action grow	washington — This week marks 10 years since Ilham Tohti, a 54-year-old Uyghur economist and human rights advocate, was sentenced to life in prison by Chinese authorities. For some, like Enver Can, a 75-year-old German-based Uyghur rights activist who leads an organization advocating for Tohti's release, the fight for his release continues to this day. 'South Africa had Nelson Mandela, India had Mahatma Gandhi, and we Uyghurs have Ilham Tohti,' Can tells VOA. Tohti, a former professor at Minzu University in Beijing, was sentenced to life imprisonment in September 2014 on charges of separatism. He is widely recognized for promoting dialogue between Uyghurs and Han Chinese. In 2019, he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought by the European Parliament. Like Tohti, Can was born in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region where the Uyghur remains imprisoned. At the age of 12, Can fled Xinjiang with his family. In the 1970s, he moved to Germany and worked as a journalist for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty until the early 1990s. In 2016, two years after Tohti's life sentence, Can founded the 'Ilham Tohti Initiative' to campaign for his release. Earlier this month, Can was particularly busy meeting European parliamentarians and other groups to push for Tohti's release from Chinese detention. 'To my knowledge, Ilham Tohti is one of the very few Uyghurs who dared to speak up for Uyghur rights while living under the Chinese regime. He articulated his demands eloquently and clearly, framing them within both international norms and Chinese law,' Can told VOA in a phone interview. EU pressure continues In a statement released on Monday, the European Union reiterated its call for the 'immediate and unconditional release' of Ilham Tohti and other human rights defenders, lawyers, and intellectuals 'arbitrarily detained' in China. 'The imprisonment of Ilham Tohti is representative of the deeply worrying human rights situation in Xinjiang,' the EU said, citing reports from U.N. bodies and the 2022 assessment by the U.N. Human Rights Office. Since Tohti's arrest in 2014, concerns about human rights abuses in Xinjiang have worsened with significant attention drawn to the issue around the beginning of 2017, when reports of mass detentions of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities in the region started to emerge. Advocacy organizations such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have been vocal about the situation in Xinjiang, with notable reports and statements escalating around 2018. In particular, the U.N. Human Rights Office has issued assessments and reports highlighting the situation, including a U.N. rights report released in August 2022 that detailed human rights violations in Xinjiang. China's response has consistently been to deny these allegations, labeling them as part of a Western agenda to undermine its sovereignty and stability in the region. Can told VOA that the time for mere statements is over. 'Just calling for Ilham Tohti's release is not enough,' he said. 'There have been countless petitions and open letters over the past decade. We need concrete actions.' Can urged tougher measures against China, including sanctions on officials, visa restrictions, and re-negotiating trade terms. China's defense In an email to VOA, Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, defended the sentencing of Ilham Tohti, asserting that he is guilty of 'splitting the country' and that the evidence against him is 'conclusive.' 'As a teacher, Ilham Tohti once publicly called terrorist extremists 'heroes', incited, lured and coerced some people to go abroad to participate in the activities of the 'East Turkestan' separatist forces, and planned, organized and carried out a series of criminal activities to split the country,' Liu said. He insisted that China's judicial system acted strictly in accordance with Chinese law and that 'China's internal affairs and judicial sovereignty must not be interfered with.' Jewher Ilham, the daughter of Ilham Tohti and a human rights activist in the U.S., disputed the Chinese government's portrayal of her father's case, asserting that his imprisonment resulted from his peaceful advocacy for marginalized Uyghurs rather than any legal violations. 'A normal and healthy society allows for more than one voice or opinion,' Ilham told VOA. 'The Chinese government did not tolerate different opinions 10 years ago, and it is clear they still do not.' Family's heartbreak Jewher Ilham last saw her father on February 2, 2013, in a Beijing airport interrogation room, where they shared their final goodbye. During that encounter, Ilham urged her to leave China for the U.S., despite the presence of Chinese authorities. 'Look at them, look at how they treat you and me. Do you still want to stay in this country? I would rather you sweep the streets in America than be treated like this here,' Ilham recalled her father's words. At the time, Ilham Tohti was prevented from departing for a year-long visiting scholar position at Indiana University, and those parting words continue to resonate with his daughter to this day. After 11 months of house arrest, Chinese authorities arrested Tohti on January 15, 2014, while Jewher was in the United States. 'On January 15, 2014, over 20 police officers came to arrest my father. My youngest brother was three-and-a-half years old, and the oldest was seven. They were napping when the police broke in and aggressively took him away,' Ilham told VOA in a phone interview. She kept in touch with her family and friends until early 2017, and that's how she learned what had happened. 'My stepmother wasn't home because she was working away. My grandmother found out about my father's arrest later, and she became very sick. I recently heard that my grandmother passed away two years ago,' she said. Eight months later, on September 23, 2014, Chinese authorities sentenced Tohti to life imprisonment on alleged charges of 'splitting the country.' 'September 23 is a devastating date for my family. My father Ilham Tohti was sentenced to life on this date 10 years ago,' Jewher told VOA. 'Just like my father never stopped advocating for the voiceless, I will not stop, no matter what.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-decade-after-uyghur-scholar-s-life-sentencing-calls-for-action-grow/7799489.html	2024-09-25T15:52:07-07:00	
Thousands pour into Syria, fleeing worsening conflict in Lebanon	JDEIDET YABOUS, Syria — Families fleeing the escalating conflict in Lebanon poured into Syria in growing numbers on Wednesday, waiting for hours in heavy traffic to reach the relative safety of another war-torn country. U.N. officials estimated that thousands of Lebanese and Syrian families had already made the journey. Those numbers are expected to grow as Israel targets southern and eastern Lebanon in an aerial bombardment that local officials say has killed more than 600 people this week, at least a quarter of them women and children. Israel says it is targeting Hezbollah fighters and weapons. Lines of buses and cars extended for several kilometers from the Syria border beginning on Monday, and some families were seen making the journey on foot. Once in Syria, people waited hours more to be processed by overwhelmed border officials, and relief workers handed out food, water, mattresses and blankets. 'Many will have to spend the night outdoors waiting their turn,' Rula Amin, a spokesperson for the U.N.'s refugee agency, said in a statement. Amin said some of the people arriving from Lebanon had visible injuries suffered from recent attacks. The cross-border flow was a striking reversal in fortunes given that Lebanon is still hosting more than 1 million Syrian refugees who fled the war in their country that began in 2011. That's when an initially peaceful anti-government uprising was met by a brutal government crackdown and spiraled into an ongoing civil war. In the Syrian border town of Jdeidet Yabous, some families sat glumly on the side of the road when Associated Press journalists visited the area. Some used their bags as seats, waiting for taxis, buses or relatives to pick them up. Many said they had spent eight or nine hours in traffic just to get into Syria. Before crossing the border, crowds packed into a government office to be processed by immigration officers and, in the case of Syrian citizens, to change $100 to Syrian pounds before entering — a measure imposed in an attempt to prop up the local currency by bringing more dollars into the country. Because of the sudden spike in demand, the supply of Syrian pounds at the border ran short. Some were returning refugees, like Emad al-Salim, who had fled Aleppo in 2014. He was living in the southern coastal city of Tyre when Monday's bombardment began. He gathered his wife and six children and fled again. 'There were houses destroyed in front of me as we were coming out,' he said. 'It took us three days to get here.' Nada Hamid al-Lajji returned with her family after seven years in Lebanon with her husband. They are from eastern Syria, but al-Lajji said she doesn't know if they will return there. 'Where am I going to go?' she said. 'I don't even have a house anymore. I don't know where I will go.' Many Lebanese families were also fleeing. Mahmoud Ahmad Tawbeh from the village of Arnoun in the country's south had come with an extended family of 35 people, planning to stay in a rented house in a Damascus suburb. 'We left with difficulty. There were a lot of bombs dropping above our heads,' he said. Five or six houses in the village were destroyed and several neighbors were killed, he said. For many in Lebanon, particularly those living in the Bekaa Valley in the east, Syria appeared to be the quickest route to safety. Israeli strikes across the country this week have wounded more than 2,000. Many of the Lebanese arriving at the border refused to speak to journalists or would not give their full names because of the sensitivity of the situation. One woman from the town of Harouf in southern Lebanon, who gave her family name, Matouk, said she had come with her brother's wife, who is Syrian, to stay with in-laws. Several families near where they lived were killed, she said, and she was worried about her father and siblings who she had left behind. While the war in Syria is ongoing, active fighting has long been frozen in much of the country. Lebanese citizens, who can cross the border without a visa, regularly visit Damascus. And renting an apartment is significantly cheaper in Syria than in Lebanon. Even before the latest escalation, some Lebanese had rented in Syria as a Plan B in case they needed to flee. Apart from those who fled the war, many Syrians come to Lebanon for work or family reasons, and regularly cross the border. However, many of those who came as refugees have been reluctant to return out of fear they could be arrested for real or perceived ties to the opposition to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad or forcibly conscripted to the army. If they leave Lebanon, they could also lose their refugee status. Earlier this week, Assad issued an amnesty for crimes committed before September 22, including for those who dodged compulsory military service. He had issued similar amnesties over the past years, but they largely failed to convince refugees to return, as have efforts by Lebanese authorities to organize 'voluntary return' trips.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-pour-into-syria-fleeing-worsening-conflict-in-lebanon/7799491.html	2024-09-25T15:22:02-07:00	
Mice killing off rare seabirds on remote South African island	johannesburg — South Africa is planning a massive mouse eradication project on a sub-Antarctic island to try to stop the invasive species from wiping out the precious seabirds that nest there. Marion Island, in the southern Indian Ocean almost 2,000 kilometers from Cape Town, is a remote and windswept South African territory that’s home to extensive bird life, including the wandering albatross. But those birds face an unusual threat: predatory mice that have been feasting on their chicks. The mice are an accident of history, but their population has been increased by climate change. 'The mice were introduced accidentally in the early 1800s,' said Anton Wolfaardt, a conservationist who is leading the program to eradicate the mice. 'They came ashore - they were essentially stowaways on the vessels of the early seal hunters that visited the island.' Huge jump in population As the island has grown warmer and drier because of climate change, it has also grown more favorable for the mice. Now, by the end of the summer, the mouse population will have increased by 500 percent, he said. It was only fairly recently that researchers on Marion observed the mice preying on chicks, but the phenomenon has increased. The rodents are such a threat now, Wolfaardt said, 'that experts predict that 19 of the 29 bird species on Marion Island face local extinction in the presence of mice.' Elsa van Ginkel, a researcher who was employed by the University of Pretoria to collect data on the island last year, said the island region was 'truly out of this world. Walking among wandering albatross chicks every day and watching them grow into fledglings - wow, just wow, it’s an absolute privilege.' But they are slowly being wiped out. 'These fledglings have no means of defending themselves from a mouse that actually starts eating it alive,' van Ginkel said. 'It’s quite horrific.' So Birdlife South Africa, a nongovernmental organization, and South Africa’s forest, fisheries and environment department are planning a major intervention to try to save the seabirds and restore the island to its natural state. Wolfaardt is heading the initiative, which is still seeking funding and is scheduled to take place in a few years. 'Very simply, the operation involves broadcasting a specialized rodenticide bait, from bait spreader buckets that are slung beneath helicopters that are guided by GPS technology,' he said. The pellets of rodent poison won’t negatively affect the rest of the flora and fauna on the island, experts say. A similar project has been undertaken before. In the 1940s, feral cats were introduced to Marion Island to try to control the mice, but then the felines started preying on the seabirds. The cats were successfully eradicated in the early 1990s, although that, of course, left the mice to flourish.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mice-killing-off-rare-seabirds-on-remote-south-african-island/7799474.html	2024-09-25T15:04:46-07:00	
Mexico excludes Spanish king from president's swearing-in	Madrid — Mexican president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum angered Spain on Wednesday by barring its King Felipe VI from her swearing-in ceremony, accusing him of failing to acknowledge harm caused by his country's conquest of Mexico five centuries ago. The decision prompted Spain to boycott the event altogether, with its Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez calling the Mexican decision 'inexplicable' and 'totally unacceptable.' Mexico's outgoing President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador in 2019 sent a letter to the king asking that he 'publicly and officially' acknowledge the 'damage' caused by the 1519-1521 conquest, which resulted in the death of a large part of the country's pre-Hispanic population. 'Unfortunately, this letter was never replied to directly, as should have been the best practice in bilateral relations,' Sheinbaum said in a statement. Mexico had in July invited just Sanchez to the swearing-in ceremony on October 1, the statement added. The Spanish foreign ministry said in a statement that the government 'has decided not to participate in the inauguration at any level.' 'Spain and Mexico are brotherly peoples. We cannot therefore accept being excluded like this,' Sanchez said later in a news conference on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York. 'That is why we have made it known to the Mexican government that there will be no diplomatic representative from the Spanish government, as a sign of protest.' Mexico published the guest list a week ago for the inauguration of Sheinbaum, who will be the country's first woman president following her left-wing ruling party's landslide June election victory. King Felipe VI was not on the list, which includes regional leftist leaders, as well as U.S. first lady Jill Biden. Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles told journalists in Madrid on Wednesday: 'The head of state, the king of Spain, always attends all swearing-in ceremonies and therefore we cannot accept that in this case he should be excluded.' While Mexico and Spain have close historical and economic links, relations between the Latin American nation and its former colonial ruler have been strained since Lopez Obrador — an ally of Sheinbaum took office in 2018. He has frequently complained about Spanish companies operating in Mexico and twice declared during his mandate that his country's relations with Spain were 'on pause'. Madrid has rejected his demand for an apology for the events of the Spanish conquest five centuries ago. Sanchez said on Wednesday, without elaborating, that Spain had 'already explained its position on the subject.' The socialist premier expressed 'great frustration' at Sheinbaum's decision, saying that he considered Mexico's leaders to be 'progressive' like his government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-excludes-spanish-king-from-president-swearing-in/7799477.html	2024-09-25T15:04:20-07:00	
Norway arrests Cameroonian 'separatist leader' for crimes against humanity	Oslo, Norway — Norwegian police on Wednesday said they had arrested a man on suspicion of incitement to commit crimes against humanity in Cameroon, where a radio station identified him as 'separatist leader' Lucas Cho Ayaba. The Kripos police unit that deals with war crimes and crimes against humanity said in a statement that it had arrested 'a man in his 50s' on Tuesday, but did not name him. 'Norwegian police have arrested the separatist leader Lucas Cho Ayaba. He is implicated in atrocities committed in the northwest and southwest,' said CRTV radio station. Two sources had earlier told AFP that Ayaba, 52, was the man arrested. Cameroon has been gripped since 2016 by a bloody conflict in its two anglophone regions, in the northwest and southwest, between separatists and state forces. The conflict was sparked by the brutal suppression of peaceful protests in the anglophone regions by long-time President Paul Biya. 'Kripos considers that the suspect is playing a central role in the ongoing armed conflict in Cameroon,' the Norwegian police statement said. The anglophone community, which has long complained of marginalization and discrimination, makes up about 20% of the largely francophone central African country. Ayaba is the leader of the Ambazonia Defense Forces, one of the main armed groups operating in the anglophone areas. International NGOs accuse both the armed separatists and government forces of abuses. More than 6,000 people have been killed and at least a million displaced during the conflict, the International Crisis Group has said. A lawyer representing victims of the conflict filed a complaint in the United States against Ayaba and the Norwegian state. In February, the lawyer, Emmanuel Nsahlai, also petitioned the International Criminal Court to launch an investigation. Ayaba was a former student union activist in the 1990s and holds German nationality. It was the first time that Norway had arrested someone on suspicion of inciting crimes against humanity. If convicted, he could face 30 years in prison.	https://www.voanews.com/a/norway-arrests-cameroonian-separatist-leader-for-crimes-against-humanity-/7799479.html	2024-09-25T15:03:20-07:00	
US House Speaker wants Ukraine's ambassador fired over Zelenskyy ammunition plant visit	Washington — The Republican Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives demanded on Wednesday that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy fire his ambassador to the United States over Zelenskyy's trip this week to a factory in Pennsylvania. 'I demand that you immediately fire Ukraine’s Ambassador to the United States, Oksana Markarova,' Speaker Mike Johnson wrote in a letter to Zelenskyy. Johnson released the letter a day before Zelenskyy was due to visit the U.S. Capitol in Washington for meetings with lawmakers. Johnson was not expected to meet with the Ukrainian leader. The Ukrainian Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Some Republicans have been fuming over Zelenskyy's visit earlier in his weeklong trip to the United States to an ammunition plant in President Joe Biden's hometown of Scranton, Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania is one of the swing states seen as crucial to victory in the November 5 presidential election. During the trip, Zelenskyy also met with Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, Senator Bob Casey and U.S. Representative Matt Cartwright, who are all Democrats. Biden's vice president, Kamala Harris, is the Democratic candidate running against Republican former President Donald Trump in the race for the White House. 'The facility was in a politically contested battleground state, was led by a top political surrogate for Kamala Harris, and failed to include a single Republican because — on purpose — no Republicans were invited,' Johnson wrote. 'The tour was clearly a partisan campaign event designed to help Democrats and is clearly election interference,' he said. The Republican-led House Oversight Committee had already announced that it would investigate whether Zelenskyy's trip was an attempt to use a foreign leader to benefit Harris' campaign. It is common practice for governors to meet with foreign leaders who travel to their states. In July, Zelenskyy visited a factory in Utah and was hosted by that state's Republican governor, Spencer Cox.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-speaker-wants-ukraine-ambassador-fired-over-zelenskyy-ammunition-plant-visit/7799471.html	2024-09-25T14:46:47-07:00	
Namibia begins restorative justice for descendants of genocide	Windhoek, Namibia — The Namibian government is welcoming back nearly 100 Batswana of Herero descent to their ancestral land, marking a significant moment in the ongoing process of restorative justice for the descendants of those who fled German South West Africa — now Namibia — during the 1904-1908 genocide. Fleeing German aggression, many sought refuge in then Bechuanaland — what's now known as Botswana. As part of this effort, Namibia has made five commercial farms available for their resettlement, a step toward reconciliation and healing. John Kandjii and other elders of his clan have gathered at the Dobe Border Post, a transit area for immigration between Botswana and Namibia. His role today is the lighting of the 'Holy Fire,' where he calls upon the elders who have already departed the earthly realm to guide and protect them at this significant occasion which marks the return of the descendants of the Ovaherero who fled their ancestral land more than 120 years ago. 'They were one — I am sure that they were one at that time — but now we are having borders, there is a difference,' said Kandjii. 'This is a different country; Namibia is alone, but communication they are together, those countries … you understand what I am saying.' Kandjii explained to VOA how the formation of the Nation State and the Berlin Conference separated the Ovaherero from each other which could have been a good thing because the Ovaherero from Namibia had somewhere to flee to during the 1904-1908 genocide which decreased their population by an estimated 80%. Although Namibia was prepared to receive 98 returnees, only 50 crossed the border on Friday. Some are still waiting for the quarantine clearance for their livestock before they can cross the border. James Uerikua is the governor of the region where the returnees were received and where some will be relocated. 'They will be settled in Otjozondjupa region, in Omaheke region and in the Hardap region because the government of the Republic of Namibia in preparation to receiving you brothers and sisters efforts were made at high level and a reception area was created at Gam measuring about 20 hectares,' he said. The 20 hectares at Gam will be treated as a transit camp for returnees to adapt to life in Namibia before moving to the commercial farms they have been allocated by the government. At the settlement in Gam, the returnees will be issued hospital cards and proper identification documents. Their children will be placed into Namibian schools. Officials have promised that potable water, sewage and electricity will be available in Gam as soon as possible.

US House passes temporary bill to avoid government shutdown	Washington — The House has passed a temporary measure that would keep federal agencies funded when the new fiscal year begins next Tuesday while punting final spending decisions for the next budget year until after the Nov. 5 election. The stopgap measure, approved Wednesday by a 341-82 vote, generally funds agencies at current levels through Dec. 20. But an additional $231 million was included to bolster the Secret Service after the two assassination attempts against Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. Money was also added to aid with the presidential transition, among other things. The bill will next move to the Senate for final approval. Senate Democratic Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, said that he had reached agreement ensuring passage will happen quickly. 'This is how things should be done,' Schumer said. 'Without brinkmanship, without delay.' House Speaker Mike Johnson, billed the measure as doing 'only what's absolutely necessary,' a statement directed at members of his own conference concerned about spending levels. Still, it's a no-go for some Republicans, which forced House Republican leadership to rely on Democratic votes to pass the bill through a process that requires at least two-thirds support from voting members. Johnson said the only alternative to the continuing resolution at this stage would have been a government shutdown. 'It would be political malpractice to shut the government down,' Johnson said. 'I think everyone understands that.' The House floor was largely empty during debate on the measure. Lawmakers in both chambers are anxious to return to their home states and districts to campaign, smoothing the path for passage of a temporary funding fix. But more arduous fiscal negotiations await them at the end of the year. Under terms of a previous deal to avoid a federal default and allow the government to continue paying its bills, spending for defense and nondefense programs would rise 1% next year. The Senate has been charting a course to go above that level, while House Republicans have been voting for steep cuts to many nondefense programs, and they have attached policy mandates to the spending bills that Democrats overwhelmingly oppose. So a final agreement will be difficult to reach. In the meantime, the temporary bill will mostly fund the government at current levels, with a few exceptions like the funding infusion for the Secret Service. The $231 million for the Secret Service does come with strings attached. It's contingent upon the agency complying with congressional oversight. The bill also allows the Secret Service to spend its allocations faster if needed. 'Everybody understands that's critically important right now,' Johnson said of the Secret Service money. Trump thanked lawmakers for the extra Secret Service funding at a campaign event Wednesday. He had earlier called on Republicans not to move forward on a spending bill without also including a requirement that people provide proof of citizenship when registering to vote. That legislation failed in the House last week. In a recent letter, the Secret Service told lawmakers that a funding shortfall was not the reason for lapses in Trump's security when a gunman climbed onto an unsecured roof on July 13 at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, and opened fire. But acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe Jr., also made clear the agency had 'immediate needs' and that he's talking to Congress. The continuing resolution is needed because Congress is nowhere close to completing work on the dozen annual appropriations bills that fund much of the federal government. The House has passed five of the 12 bills, mostly along party lines. The Senate has passed zero. Republicans blame the current impasse on Senate Democrats for not putting the dozen appropriations bills on the Senate floor for a vote, where they then could be reconciled with the House bills during negotiations. But Democrats counter that House Republicans are acting in bad faith, bogging the process down by undercutting an agreement that former Speaker Kevin McCarthy negotiated with the White House over spending caps for the 2024 and 2025 budget years. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, the top Democratic member of the House Appropriations Committee, said her party will accept nothing less than the 1% increase specified in that agreement. Also, if Republicans seek more than that for defense, there must be 'dollar for dollar parity for nondefense,' she said. 'We know where we have to end up. And it is my hope that this bill will provide the bipartisan momentum needed to get there,' DeLauro said. The White House called on both chambers to pass the stopgap bill, while cautioning that it did not provide adequate funding to help communities recover from natural disasters and failed to include enough funding for health care provided through the Department of Veterans Affairs. Still, the administration called for swift passage to 'avoid a costly, unnecessary Government shutdown' and to ensure adequate time for passing the full-year spending package. Johnson warned that when the new extension expires in December, he will not support a massive, catchall bill to fund the government, referred to as an omnibus, so another stopgap may be needed that would allow the new president and Congress to have the final say on fiscal year 2025 spending levels. 'I have no intention of going back to that terrible tradition,' Johnson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-passes-temporary-bill-to-avoid-government-shutdown/7799439.html	2024-09-25T14:28:59-07:00

Haiti's leader says nation far from winning gang war as UN deadline looms	NEW YORK — Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille said on Wednesday that the Caribbean country was a long way from winning its war against armed gangs that control most of the capital, as a United Nations deadline for long-delayed support fast approaches. 'We are nowhere near winning this, and the simple reality is that we won't without your help,' Conille said at an event on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly. 'There is a sense of urgency because the Haitian people are watching with cautious optimism, they're really hoping to see clear results,' he said. Haiti is currently facing a gang attack at the capital's main port, Conille said, the key entry point for funding and goods. A shipping official told Reuters this week that ships were being shot at, preventing them from docking and unloading containers, while authorities have reported the kidnapping of two Filipino crew members from a cargo vessel in the port. Haiti's main seaports and international airport closed for nearly three months earlier this year after violence escalated at the end of February, an outbreak that saw thousands broken out of prison and the last prime minister resign. 'We worry that without the urgent implication of everyone to support this effort, we will lose the little success that we've been able to obtain at a very large price,' Conille said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken earlier announced sanctions against former deputy Prophane Victor and gang leader Luckson Elan for their role in human rights abuses, as well as $160 million in assistance for Haiti, and called for further support of the U.N.-backed international security mission. About 10 countries have together pledged over 3,100 troops, but only around 400 have deployed. The U.N.'s one-year mandate expires in early October and the U.N. Security Council is set to vote on Sept. 30 on whether to renew it. While countries have pledged hundreds of millions of dollars, both the U.N. mission trust fund and humanitarian plan remain drastically underfunded. Musalia Mudavadi, an official from Kenya, which is leading the mission, said the current funds were not enough to sustain the current deployment, let alone the thousands of troops that were promised. 'We encourage all the countries that have pledged troops to move with speed,' he said. The number of people internally displaced has nearly doubled in the last six months, according to U.N. estimates, now surpassing 700,000. Around half the country is going hungry. Conille's government is also tasked with arranging the first elections since 2016. His predecessor repeatedly delayed a vote, saying a free and fair process could not take place under the existing insecurity. The United States, the mission's top financial backer, has pushed for elections by next year. Conille said that while far more security was needed, Haiti is already investing half of an estimated $140 million needed to hold a referendum on the Constitution in February and elections in November 2025. Conille said he was 'quite confident' that they would be able to hold the votes despite the insecurity but warned that this would not be possible if commitments enabling the mission's full deployment are not kept.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-s-leader-says-nation-far-from-winning-gang-war-as-un-deadline-looms/7799444.html	2024-09-25T14:26:35-07:00	
Report: Increasing women’s participation in workforce could boost Africa's GDP	nairobi, kenya — A report commissioned by the Mastercard Foundation says that increasing women's participation in Africa's formal workforce could boost the continent's economy by approximately $287 billion by 2030, boosting GDP by 5 percent. The report, Young Women in Africa: Agents of Economic Growth and Transformation by 2030, was conducted in collaboration with the McKinsey & Company consulting firm. Released last week, it examines the impact, challenges and contributions of women in the African labor force. The report says young women are important contributors to the African economy, yet their role has been trending downward. Women's contribution to Africa's GDP declined from 18 percent in 2000 to just 11 percent in 2022, the report says. Marguerita Bagulo is one of the millions of women employed in and contributing to the growth of African economies. She works as a customer service representative for a company in Ghana. She says her company promotes gender equality and that women fight for their jobs. 'I was lucky to be in a place where your gender is not really a problem,' Bagulo said. 'And it’s great, because we are given the same opportunity that our male counterparts are being given, and that, in turn, gives us the opportunity to stand up for ourselves and better ourselves in order to compete on the same level as our male counterparts.' In Namibia, despite government policies aimed at increasing women's participation in the economic sector, their participation rate has risen only 2 percentage points, to 42 percent, over five years, according to the report. The report notes 10 countries, most from eastern and western Africa, have the potential to achieve faster economic growth if they prioritize gender equality. However, persistent obstacles continue to keep many women out of the labor force. Wacu Mureithi, an entrepreneur in Kenya, says she could not continue with her hair product business because of family commitments. 'Business is hard for everyone, man and woman, but I think a woman has a bigger challenge, because sometimes, looking for business opportunities, you are trading for sexual favors instead of doing the work,' Mureithi says. 'But my biggest problem has been balancing trying to be mum and dad and at the same time being an entrepreneur. I felt I was losing on parenting, because I was busy with meetings all the time.' Mureithi has returned to a university to pursue further studies to better her life and that of her family. Samuel Nyandemo, a lecturer on economics at the University of Nairobi, says more girls and women are enrolling in universities to increase their chances of joining the labor force, which is dominated by men. 'What they are mostly doing, they are in the hospitality industry, and some are in the managerial sector,' he says. 'In any case, you can see now when it comes to enrollment in universities, the number is now increasing, which means that in terms of job skills, they are acquiring a lot of job skills that are empowering them to spearhead most of the management positions within African economies.' The Mastercard Foundation says private sector-led approaches, such as investing in after-school care led by young women, could create 3.2 million jobs. The researchers say women also need government-funded initiatives to expand centers to improve child care initiatives, while the private sector can help by offering technical support, resources and low-interest loans. At least 26 percent of girls complete their secondary education, but unpaid care work keeps 35 percent to 40 percent of women from employment, the report notes. It says that in 2021, 66 percent of women lacked access to a bank account, while 13 percent had access to formal credit, versus 16 percent for men. Lower access to financial services for women is blamed on the types of businesses run by women, which are seen as paying less and lacking income stability. Nyandemo says governments need to create programs that make it easier for women to participate in the economic sector. 'There should be affirmative action that spearheads the aspect of gender equality,' he says. 'Create more opportunities for women and empower them both economically and politically, and more so, invest heavily in training them in various small-scale business enterprises. Equip them with entrepreneurial skills and management skills.' The Mastercard Foundation plans to invest $360 million to help more than 70,000 young women and girls complete their education, start businesses and find job opportunities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-increasing-women-s-participation-in-workforce-could-boost-africa-s-gdp-/7799423.html	2024-09-25T14:06:04-07:00	
Zoo in Finland with financial woes to return giant pandas to China	HELSINKI — A zoo in Finland has agreed with Chinese authorities to return two loaned giant pandas to China more than eight years ahead of schedule because they have become too expensive for the facility to maintain as the number of visitors has declined. The private Ahtari Zoo in central Finland some 330 kilometers north of Helsinki said Wednesday on its Facebook page that the female panda Lumi, Finnish for 'snow,' and the male panda Pyry, meaning 'snowfall,' will return 'prematurely' to China later this year. The panda pair was China's gift to mark the Nordic nation's 100 years of independence in 2017, and they were supposed to be on loan until 2033. But since then, the zoo has experienced several challenges, including a decline in visitors due to the 2020 coronavirus pandemic and Russia's war against Ukraine, as well as an increase in inflation and interest rates, the facility said in a statement. The panda deal between Helsinki and Beijing, a 15-year loan agreement, had been finalized in April 2017 when Chinese President Xi Jinping visited Finland for talks with then-Finnish President Sauli Niinisto. The pandas arrived in Finland in January 2018. The Ahtari Zoo, which specializes in typical northern European animals such as bears, lynxes and wolverines, built a special annex at a cost of about $9 million in hopes of luring more tourists to the remote nature reserve. The upkeep of Lumi and Pyry, including a preservation fee to China, cost the zoo $1.7 million annually. The bamboo that giant pandas eat was flown in from the Netherlands. The Chinese Embassy in Helsinki noted to Finnish media that Beijing had tried to help Ahtari solve its financial difficulties by urging Chinese companies operating in Finland to make donations to the zoo and supporting its debt arrangements. However, declining visitor numbers combined with drastic changes in the economic environment proved too high a burden for the smallish Finnish zoo. The panda pair will enter a monthlong quarantine in late October before being shipped back to China. Finland, a country of 5.6 million people, was among the first Western nations to establish political ties with China, doing so in 1950. China has presented giant pandas to countries as a sign of goodwill and closer political ties, and Finland was the first Nordic nation to receive them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zoo-in-finland-with-financial-woes-to-return-giant-pandas-to-china/7799373.html	2024-09-25T13:08:32-07:00	
Pope expels bishop, 9 others from Peru movement over 'sadistic' abuses	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis took the unusual decision Wednesday to expel 10 people — a bishop, priests and laypeople — from a troubled Catholic movement in Peru after a Vatican investigation uncovered 'sadistic' abuses of power, authority and spirituality. The move against the leadership of the Sodalitium Christianae Vitae, or Sodalitium of Christian Life, followed Francis' decision last month to expel the group's founder, Luis Figari, after he was found to have sodomized his recruits. The decision was announced by the Peruvian Bishops Conference, which posted a statement from the Vatican embassy on its website. The statement was astonishing because it listed the abuses uncovered by the Vatican investigation that have rarely been punished canonically with such measures, and the people responsible. According to the statement, the Vatican investigators uncovered physical abuses 'including with sadism and violence,' sect-like abuses of conscience, spiritual abuse, abuses of authority, economic abuses in administering church money and the 'abuse in the exercise of the apostolate of journalism.' The latter was presumably aimed at a Sodalitium-linked journalist who has attacked critics of the movement on social media. Figari founded the movement in 1971 as a lay community to recruit 'soldiers for God,' one of several Catholic societies born as a conservative reaction to the left-leaning liberation theology movement that swept through Latin America, starting in the 1960s. At its height, the group counted about 20,000 members across South America and the United States. It was enormously influential in Peru. Victims of Figari's abuses complained to the Lima archdiocese in 2011, although other claims against him reportedly date to 2000. But neither the local church nor the Holy See took concrete action until one of the victims, Pedro Salinas, wrote a book along with journalist Paola Ugaz detailing the twisted practices of the Sodalitium in 2015, entitled 'Half Monks, Half Soldiers.' An outside investigation ordered by Sodalitium determined that Figari was 'narcissistic, paranoid, demeaning, vulgar, vindictive, manipulative, racist, sexist, elitist and obsessed with sexual issues and the sexual orientation' of Sodalitium's members. The investigation, published in 2017, found that Figari sodomized his recruits and forced them to fondle him and one another. He liked to watch them 'experience pain, discomfort and fear' and humiliated them in front of others to enhance his control over them, the report found. Still, the Holy See declined to expel Figari from the movement in 2017 and merely ordered him to live apart from the Sodalitium community in Rome and cease all contact with it. The Vatican was seemingly tied in knots by canon law that did not foresee such punishments for founders of religious communities who weren't priests. But according to the findings of the latest Vatican investigation, the abuses went beyond Figari and included harassing and hacking the communications of their victims all the while covering up crimes committed as part of their official duties. The highest-ranking person ordered expelled was Archbishop Jose Antonio Eguren, whom Francis already forced to resign as bishop of Piura in April over his record, after he sued Salinas and Ugaz for their reporting. The Vatican, in the statement, said the Peruvian bishops join Pope Francis in 'seeking the forgiveness of the victims' while calling on the troubled movement to initiate a journey of justice and reparation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-expels-bishop-9-others-from-peru-movement-over-sadistic-abuses/7799119.html	2024-09-25T10:34:00-07:00

CrowdStrike executive apologizes to Congress for July global tech outage	WASHINGTON — An executive at cybersecurity company CrowdStrike apologized in testimony to Congress for sparking a global technology outage over the summer. 'We let our customers down,' said Adam Meyers, who leads CrowdStrike's threat intelligence division, in a hearing before a U.S. House cybersecurity subcommittee Tuesday. Austin, Texas-based CrowdStrike has blamed a bug in an update that allowed its cybersecurity systems to push bad data out to millions of customer computers, setting off a global tech outage in July that grounded flights, took TV broadcasts off air and disrupted banks, hospitals and retailers. 'Everywhere Americans turned, basic societal functions were unavailable,' House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Mark Green said. 'We cannot allow a mistake of this magnitude to happen again.' The Tennessee Republican likened the impact of the outage to an attack 'we would expect to be carefully executed by a malicious and sophisticated nation-state actor.' 'We're deeply sorry and we are determined to prevent this from ever happening again,' Meyers told lawmakers while laying out the technical missteps that led to the outage of about 8.5 million computers running Microsoft's Windows operating system. Meyers said he wanted to 'underscore that this was not a cyberattack' but was, instead, caused by a faulty 'rapid-response content update' focused on addressing new threats. The company has since bolstered its content update procedures, he said. The company still faces a number of lawsuits from people and businesses that were caught up in July's mass outage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crowdstrike-executive-apologizes-to-congress-for-july-global-tech-outage/7799074.html	2024-09-25T09:57:21-07:00	
Journalists flee Venezuela as Maduro threatens media freedom	MADRID — Jesus Medina used a fake identity to flee from Venezuela to Colombia by walking across the border like thousands of compatriots. A journalist for Dolar Today, an independent online publication in Venezuela, Medina said he was persecuted by the government of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro for six years. He was imprisoned for nearly three years between 2017 and 2020 in a high-security military jail awaiting trial. Last year, a court absolved Medina of charges of inciting hate, a charge that is often leveled at journalists. However, after Medina was cleared, he said the government ordered that he face a retrial. He denied all charges. At this point, he decided he had to leave his country, his girlfriend and family behind. Medina arrived in Bogota, Colombia, on September 15 to begin a new life. He currently is searching for work and a permanent place to live. His story is typical of other journalists who have left Venezuela in the wake of a crackdown by the Maduro government against the media and political activists after disputed presidential elections on July 28. Several journalists have been detained, while others face travel bans. Reporters covering politics are looking for innovative ways to stay under the radar and keep covering the news. Two AI journalists, called La Chama or 'The Girl,' and El Pana (Venezuelan slang for 'friend'), were created as part of Operation Retweet by Colombian organization Connectas, Reuters reported. The initiative aims to publish news from a dozen independent Venezuelan media outlets and to help protect reporters amid a government crackdown on journalists and protesters. Electoral officials and Venezuela’s top court declared Maduro the winner of the election with 52% of the vote, Reuters reported. But the opposition says voting machine receipts show a landslide victory for their candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, who fled to exile in Spain. Some Western governments, including the United States, have alleged electoral fraud. A United Nations report last week alleged escalating government repression since the election, including the arrest of minors. The Venezuelan government rejected the claims. The Venezuelan government in Caracas and its embassy in Madrid did not respond to VOA requests for comment on Medina’s case nor on repression of the independent media. 'Repression has gotten worse’ Medina, 42, who works for Dolar Today, an online independent newspaper that reports on national and international news and sports, has been a reporter for 14 years. 'The repression has gotten worse since the election in July,’’ he told VOA by telephone from Bogota. ‘’It has been brutal. They are arresting more people. They [the government] cannot bear that the opposition won the election. It is a dictatorship.' Luis Gonzalo Perez, a Venezuelan journalist who was part of the press team covering opposition leader Maria Corina Machado during the election campaign, went into exile recently after what he claimed were 'repeated threats' from the Venezuelan government and its secret services. 'Hello to my family, friends, followers who have been paying attention to my work in the last few months in Venezuela,' Perez said in a message posted on Instagram. 'I had to make the decision to leave Venezuela. I find myself in exile like millions of Venezuelans. This was never in my life plans, personal or work plans, to have to leave under force, against my will.' Clavel Rangel, a Venezuelan journalist, went into exile in Miami in 2020 when she was accused of libel over articles she wrote with another journalist about the metal sector in southern Venezuela. She said the latest crackdown against the media marks a new level of repression against independent journalists on the part of the government. 'For the first time, Maduro’s government decided to steal a competitive election, and this was marked by a new level of repression at all levels, where the media did not escape the crackdown,' Rangel told VOA. 'They entered a new era of totalitarianism after years of autocracy because it is the only way to maintain power.' Rangel said 16 journalists currently were under arrest in Venezuela, with nine detentions coming after the election. 'The moment marks a clear ‘before and after’ in the timeline in the repression against the press,' she said. Rangel noted research by the Instituto Prensa y Sociedad, a nongovernmental organization that monitors the media in Venezuela, that showed about 350 journalists had left the country in recent years. ‘Constant and ruthless attacks’ Carleth Morales, founder of the association of Venezuelan journalists in Spain, Espana Venezuelan Press, told VOA that journalists had been leaving the country since Maduro’s predecessor, Hugo Chavez, came to power in 1999. 'We have undergone about 25 years of constant and ruthless attacks on media freedom. The Venezuelan Nacional College of Journalists said more than 400 media have closed in the past two decades,' Morales said. 'We don’t have a free press or jobs in the sector. The online media, which are a reference in journalism, are led by exiled journalists.' In 2000, Morales said, Chavez first started threatening the media, marking 'a macabre line of self-censorship' and leading to the first wave of exiles. In 2004-2005, with the government’s passing of the Law of Social Responsibility in Radio and Television, a large number of reporters left the country because of the censorship and the threats of jail, she said. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights and the Inter-American Press Association considered the legislation to be a 'gag law' that violated the freedom of the media. In 2007, Morales said another wave of journalists went into exile after the government tightened control of television channels. When the media covered 2014 citizens’ protests, several journalists were arrested and foreign journalists were expelled, she said. In Spain, the largest wave of Venezuelan journalists arrived in 2015, and this rose again in 2017, Morales said, after further waves of repression against the media following their reports about opposition protests and interviews with government critics and independent analysts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalists-flee-venezuela-as-maduro-threatens-media-freedom/7799012.html	2024-09-25T09:57:13-07:00	
UN: Russia muzzling dissent amid climate of fear, repression	Geneva — As Vladimir Putin’s war against Ukraine grinds on for a third year, a United Nations report says all dissenting voices in the Russian Federation have been muzzled, civic and political rights have been shut down, and the human rights situation in the country 'has significantly worsened.' 'The country is now governed by a state-sponsored system of fear and punishment including the use of torture, with absolute impunity,' Mariana Katzarova, who monitors rights in Russia under a mandate from the U.N.-backed Human Rights Council, said Tuesday. Katzarova said civil and political freedoms in Russia have become further restricted since she submitted her first report to the council more than a year ago. 'The severity of the government’s human rights violations has escalated, and its tools expanded to suppress dissent against its repressive domestic policy and war-driven foreign policy,' she said. As with last year’s report, Katzarova noted that she was obliged to gather information for this year’s 23-page report from a range of sources inside and outside the Russian Federation. Despite repeated requests, she said she was not granted access to Russia, 'which would have allowed a dialogue with the government and other stakeholders and enabled the reflection of their position in this report.' The report paints a chilling picture of a dystopian society in which Russian citizens are not free to express their views, state-driven human rights violations are legalized by new or amended legislation, public anti-war expression or dissent of any kind is criminalized, the use of violence by law enforcement is condoned, and 'an environment of absolute impunity has been created.' 'War censorship' Under Russia’s so-called 'war censorship' legislation, Katzarova noted that hundreds of people who 'dare to speak the truth' about what is happening in the war against Ukraine have been prosecuted, given long prison sentences and subjected to the 'crippling financial punishment' of having property and assets confiscated. The report says at least 1,372 human rights defenders, journalists and anti-war critics have been detained on politically motivated charges and sentenced 'in sham trials to lengthy imprisonment, often with treatment amounting to torture.' While Russian authorities have intensified their crackdown on these 'traditional sources of opposition,' Katzarova said poets, playwrights, artists, religious figures, indigenous groups, migrants, and those who’ve fled abroad are often targeted with 'harsh censorship, intimidation and prosecution for any perceived transgression.' 'Of particular concern is the evidence of state-condoned violence and torture against civilians arrested for peacefully exercising their human rights,' she said. 'Brutal assaults of detainees by law enforcement officials go unpunished; there is increased use of solitary confinement in prisons and other deliberate ill-treatment amounting to torture.' The report spells out in searing detail the many human rights violations and state-condoned discriminatory policies used by the state to intimidate, harass and punish vulnerable groups, including women and girls, LGBTQ persons, indigenous peoples, minorities and migrants. 'The risk of severe punishment for any form of public dissent is very high, particularly for individuals and groups vulnerable to discrimination based on gender, sexual orientation, political opinion, religion, indigenous status or minority background,' says the report, which devotes a long section to the wide range of violations of international human rights and humanitarian law precipitated by the ongoing war against Ukraine. Ukraine-related violations It expresses particular concern about Ukrainian civilians held in arbitrary detention because 'Russian authorities do not provide information about their number, fate or whereabouts, and many are subjected to enforced disappearance.' The report says at least 1,672 Ukrainian civilians are known to have been arbitrarily detained by Russian authorities and kept 'in penal colonies, pretrial detention centers and temporary makeshift tent camps' located throughout Russian-occupied parts of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus. It also says an estimated 14,000 Ukrainian civilians are missing. The report documents the plight of captured military and civilian Ukrainians, including children, who have been forcibly transferred or deported to the Russian Federation. According to the Ukrainian government, 19,546 children were forcibly transferred to Russian-occupied Crimea or deported to Russia or Belarus as of the end of July 2024; 388 have been returned. The whereabouts and fate of the thousands of other children remains unknown, though some are believed to have been given up for adoption by Russian families. The report notes that some of the returned children who were interviewed said they 'were subjected to sexual violence during their time in Russian institutions and some experienced or witnessed physical violence and threats against children by the staff.' Last year, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Russian President Vladimir Putin and Commissioner for Children’s Rights Maria Lvova-Belova for 'the war crimes of unlawful deportation and unlawful transfer of children from occupied areas of Ukraine to the Russian Federation.' Katzarova told council members that 'The Russian authorities must bring to justice all those responsible for this torture and ill-treatment and immediately and unconditionally release all Ukrainian detainees, ensuring their safe return, especially of children. 'As special rapporteur on the Situation of Human Rights in the Russian Federation, I will continue to call for accountability for these crimes,' she said. It is a call likely to be ignored by Russia, which boycotted the meeting and did not respond as a concerned country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-russia-muzzling-dissent-amid-climate-of-fear-repression/7799059.html	2024-09-25T09:41:51-07:00	
Taliban formally seek invitation to Russia’s BRICS summit	ISLAMABAD — Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban confirmed Wednesday that they have formally sought to join the upcoming Russia-hosted summit of the BRICS intergovernmental group of major emerging economies. The leaders of the 10 members of BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa, are set to convene October 22-24 in the southwestern Russian city of Kazan for the meeting. Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates joined the bloc this year. 'BRICS is an important economic forum, and as a developing economy, Afghanistan needs to join such economic gatherings,' Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy Taliban spokesperson, stated in a video message aired by their official broadcaster. 'The Islamic Emirate is seeking a presence at the upcoming BRICS forum, and the request has been formally communicated to the host nation,' Fitrat stated, using the official title of their government in Kabul, which is officially not recognized by any country. He shared no further details. There has been no immediate Russian response to the Taliban’s assertion. Moscow has developed close informal ties with the de facto Afghan leaders since they retook control of the conflict-ravaged nation three years ago, when the United States-led Western countries withdrew their troops after almost two decades of war with the then-insurgent Taliban. However, Russia has not recognized the Taliban as a legitimate government in alignment with the global consensus on the issue of recognition. Taliban delegations have repeatedly visited Moscow in recent months for bilateral economic and trade discussions. The Russian foreign and justice ministries submitted a proposal to President Vladimir Putin in June to remove the radical Afghan group from Russia’s list of designated terrorist organizations. The move prompted speculations that Moscow has come closer to officially recognizing the de facto Kabul authorities. The Taliban have been on Russia’s list of transnational militant groups, which includes al-Qaida, since 2003. The de facto Afghan leaders have implemented their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as sharia, in the impoverished South Asian nation, prohibiting Afghan girls from attending schools beyond the sixth grade, suspending female students from universities, barring women from most workplaces, and banning music. The Taliban also have introduced stoning and public executions of women for crimes such as adultery. The U.N. and other nations The international community, including the United Nations, has consistently called for the urgent reversal of restrictions on women before considering granting diplomatic legitimacy to the Taliban regime. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a meeting on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly this week that the Taliban's treatment of women can be compared to 'some of the most egregious systems of oppression in recent history.' 'We will continue to amplify the voices of Afghan women and call for them to play a full role in the country's life, both inside its borders and on the global stage,' he said. U.N. officials maintain that last month’s enactment of a morality law by the Taliban has made it even more challenging to recognize Kabul rulers. Taliban leaders reject criticism of their governance, saying it is aligned with local culture and sharia. 'It means that one of the major obstacles to Afghanistan’s full reintegration into the international community cannot be part of a necessary dialogue,' Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, told a Security Council meeting last week. China and the Taliban China has also ramped up its political and economic ties with Kabul and is one of two countries, along with the United Arab Emirates, that have formally accepted a Taliban-appointed ambassador. On Monday, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told a news conference that Beijing expects the Taliban to 'look at the legitimate concerns' of the global community. 'That said, women’s rights and interests are not the entirety of the Afghan issue, nor the core or root cause of the issue,' Lin said. He referenced the U.N. estimates stating that almost 24 million people in Afghanistan need humanitarian assistance, with more than half of them battling severe food insecurity. 'The international community needs to focus on the most pressing difficulties Afghanistan faces, promote the rebuilding and development in Afghanistan … and at the same time encourage, in the spirit of equality and respect, the governing authorities of Afghanistan to improve and strengthen protection of women and children’s rights,' Lin stated. Chinese companies have signed several agreements with the Taliban to enhance economic and trade cooperation, focusing mainly on the Afghan mining sector. Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi told a news conference in Kabul last week that his government controlled about 40 Afghan embassies and consulates worldwide, and that its diplomatic relations with the international community were improving. He stated that the Taliban are keen to develop 'friendly' ties with Western nations. The U.S. and the West at large insist that formal recognition of the Taliban depends on their actions regarding women's rights, education for girls and women and freedom of movement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-formally-seek-invitation-to-russia-s-brics-summit/7798954.html	2024-09-25T08:47:09-07:00	
Mpox cases continue to rise in Africa	Nairobi — As cases of mpox rise across the African continent, public health experts and world leaders are sounding the alarm, saying more needs to be done to contain the viral outbreak. Fifteen countries in Africa are assessed as having active outbreaks, with Morocco being the latest to report a case. Samuel Boland, mpox incident manager for the World Health Organization regional office for Africa, said that while the Democratic Republic of Congo and Burundi account for almost 90 percent of confirmed cases, more instances are popping up in other countries. 'DRC, Burundi [are] especially affected but also Cameroon, Central African Republic, Nigeria, Cote D'Ivoire, Republic of Congo, Liberia, Uganda, Kenya, Gabon, Rwanda, South Africa and Guinea,' he told VOA, speaking from Brazzaville in the Republic of Congo. The WHO says two distinct clades, or strains, have been identified. Clade I was formerly known as the Congo Basin clade, and Clade II was formerly West African clade. Previously known as monkeypox, the viral disease can spread through close contact between people, according to the World Health Organization, and occasionally via objects and areas touched by a person with mpox. Signs and symptoms include fever, rash, and swollen lymph nodes. Boland said there have been 6,580 confirmed cases so far this year, but there's a bigger number of suspected cases. Suspected cases are clinically compatible with mpox but may not have been tested due to various limitations in several countries. That number has climbed to nearly 32,000. 'Now amongst that large number of suspected cases, 844 people have died. But when focusing on the confirmed cases this year as in from the first of January, 32 people have, unfortunately, passed away,' Boland said. In a virtual briefing last week, Jean Kaseya, director-general of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, said mpox is not under control in Africa. He said that while vaccine donations are trickling in, the amount is insufficient to contain the outbreak. 'Today, we have almost around 4 million commitments of doses, but we say we need more,' Kaseya said. U.S. President Joe Biden, in an address to world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly on Sept. 24, 2024, highlighted the need to 'move quickly' to confront the mpox outbreak in Africa. 'We're prepared to commit $500 million to help African countries prevent and respond to mpox and to donate 1 million doses of mpox vaccine now,' he said. No specific date was given as to when the vaccines will arrive in Africa, but Biden said the investments will be delivered bilaterally, through existing relationships with partner countries, as well as through multilateral institutions. In addition to vaccines, Boland said this mpox outbreak requires interventions across the full spectrum of the public health sector. He said the world needs to scale up and make sure it can deliver in several areas. 'Things like surveillance, which will include case investigation and contact tracing — both going out into communities and looking for cases,' he said. 'Also engaging and encouraging communities to report cases when people become unwell.' He said this approach includes infection prevention and control, case management and vaccination.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mpox-cases-continue-to-rise-in-africa-/7798946.html	2024-09-25T08:33:46-07:00	
China 'firmly opposes' proposed ban on connected vehicles	Washington — On Wednesday, China’s commerce ministry said it 'firmly opposes' the United States’ proposed ban on the sale of connected vehicles that use Chinese or Russian software and hardware technology. Most new vehicles are considered to be 'connected' because they can share data with other vehicles and infrastructure with the help of onboard software, hardware and internet access. The U.S. warns that data collected by Chinese or Russian software in connected and autonomous vehicles could pose a threat to national security. A spokesperson from China’s Ministry of Commerce said the proposed U.S. ban has no 'factual basis, violates the principles of market economy and fair competition, and is a typical protectionist act.' 'China urges the United States to stop its wrong practice of generalizing national security, immediately revoke the relevant restrictions, and stop its unreasonable suppression of Chinese companies,' according to a ministry statement. The proposed rule is the latest example of the deteriorating relationship between Washington and Beijing. In February, the Biden Administration said it would probe Chinese cars that pose a risk to national security. The U.S. Department of Commerce said it opened the probe because vehicles 'collect large amounts of sensitive data on their drivers and passengers (and) regularly use their cameras and sensors to record detailed information on U.S. infrastructure.' The Biden Administration also implemented a 100% tariff on Chinese-made EVs earlier this month, citing unfair business practices and the potential for Chinese EVs to flood international markets. The new proposed prohibition on connected vehicles applies both to the software and hardware that link vehicles to the outside world. It did not specify which manufacturers are likely to be impacted by the rule, which will be finalized after a 30-day period for public comment. In a press release Tuesday, the Coalition for a Prosperous America, or CPA, voiced its support for the proposed ban. 'For years, the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] has aggressively pursued global dominance in the automotive industry building tremendous overcapacity to dominate their home market and to displace auto manufacturing worldwide,' said the CEO of CPA, Michael Stumo. 'The Commerce Department’s proposed ban on this technology is an important measure to protect our automotive sector and secure Americans’ sensitive information,' he added. China’s commerce ministry also condemned the U.S. on Wednesday for its newly proposed ban and tariffs implemented earlier this month, saying Washington placed 'high tariffs on Chinese cars, restricted participation in government procurement, and introduced discriminatory subsidy policies.' 'Now, on the grounds of so-called national security, it [Washington] has slandered Chinese connected car software, hardware and complete vehicles as 'unsafe' and restricted their use in the United States,' a ministry statement said. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-firmly-opposes-proposed-ban-on-connected-vehicles/7798881.html	2024-09-25T07:51:40-07:00

Finland zoo returns giant pandas to China over cost	HELSINKI — Finland will return two giant pandas to China in November, more than eight years ahead of time, as the zoo where they live can no longer afford their upkeep, the chair of the zoo's board told Reuters on Tuesday. The pandas, named Lumi and Pyry, were brought to Finland in January 2018, months after Chinese President Xi Jinping visited the Nordic country and signed a joint agreement on protecting the animals. Since its founding in 1949, the People's Republic of China has sent pandas to foreign zoos to strengthen trading ties, cement foreign relations and boost its international image. The Finnish agreement was for a stay of 15 years, but instead the pandas will soon go into a month-long quarantine before they are shipped back to China, according to Ahtari Zoo, the pandas' current home. The zoo, a private company, had invested over 8 million euros ($8.92 million) in the facility where the animals live and faced annual costs of 1.5 million euros for their upkeep, including a preservation fee paid to China, Ahtari Chair Risto Sivonen said. The zoo had hoped the pandas would attract visitors to the central Finland location but last year said it had instead accumulated mounting debts as the pandemic curbed travel, and that it was discussing a return. Rising inflation had added to the costs, the zoo said, and Finland's government in 2023 rejected pleas for state funding. In all, negotiations to return the animals had lasted three years, Sivonen said. 'Now we reached a point where the Chinese said it could be done,' Sivonen said. The return of the pandas was a business decision made by the zoo which did not involve Finland's government and should not impact relations between the two countries, a spokesperson for Finland's foreign ministry said. Despite efforts by China to aid the zoo, the two countries in the end jointly concluded after friendly consultations to return the pandas, the Chinese embassy in Helsinki said in a statement to Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-zoo-returns-giant-pandas-to-china-over-cost-/7798696.html	2024-09-25T06:47:36-07:00	
Secret Service failures before Trump rally shooting were 'preventable,' Senate panel finds	Washington — Multiple Secret Service failures ahead of the July rally for former President Donald Trump where a gunman opened fire were 'foreseeable, preventable, and directly related to the events resulting in the assassination attempt that day,' according to a bipartisan Senate investigation released Wednesday. Similar to the agency's own internal investigation and an ongoing bipartisan House probe, the interim report from the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee found multiple failures on almost every level ahead of the Butler, Pennsylvania shooting, including in planning, communications, security and allocation of resources. 'The consequences of those failures were dire,' said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, the Democratic chairman of the Homeland panel. Investigators found that there was no clear chain of command among the Secret Service and other security agencies and no plan for coverage of the building where the shooter climbed up to fire the shots. Officials were operating on multiple, separate radio channels, leading to missed communications, and an inexperienced drone operator was stuck on a help line after his equipment wasn't working correctly. Communications among security officials were a 'multi-step game of telephone,' Peters said. The report found the Secret Service was notified about an individual on the roof of the building approximately two minutes before shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks opened fire, firing eight rounds in Trump's direction less than 150 yards from where the former president was speaking. Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, was struck in the ear by a bullet or a bullet fragment in the assassination attempt, one rallygoer was killed and two others were injured before the gunman was killed by a Secret Service counter-sniper. Approximately 22 seconds before Crooks fired, the report found, a local officer sent a radio alert that there was an armed individual on the building. But that information was not relayed to key Secret Service personnel who were interviewed by Senate investigators. The panel also interviewed a Secret Service counter-sniper who reported seeing officers with their guns drawn running toward the building where the shooter was perched, but the person said they did not think to notify anyone to get Trump off the stage. The Senate report comes just days after the Secret Service released a five-page document summarizing the key conclusions of a yet-to-be finalized Secret Service report on what went wrong, and ahead of a Thursday hearing that will be held by a bipartisan House task force investigating the shooting. The House panel is also investigating a second assassination attempt on Trump earlier this month when Secret Service agents arrested a man with a rifle hiding on the golf course at Trump's Florida club. Each investigation has found new details that reflect a massive breakdown in the former president's security, and lawmakers say there is much more they want to find out as they try to prevent it from happening again. 'This was the result of multiple human failures of the Secret Service,' said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, the top Republican on the panel. The senators recommended that the Secret Service better define roles and responsibilities before any protective event, including by designating a single individual in charge of approving all the security plans. Investigators found that many of the people in charge denied that they had responsibility for planning or security failures, and deflected blame. Advance agents interviewed by the committee said 'that planning and security decisions were made jointly, with no specific individual responsible for approval,' the report said. Communication with local authorities was also poor. Local law enforcement had raised concern two days earlier about security coverage of the building where the shooter perched, telling Secret Service agents during a walk through that they did not have the manpower to lock it down. Secret Service agents then gave investigators conflicting accounts about who was responsible for that security coverage, the report said. The internal review released last week by the Secret Service also detailed multiple communications breakdowns, including an absence of clear guidance to local law enforcement and the failure to fix line-of-sight vulnerabilities at the rally grounds that left Trump open to sniper fire and 'complacency' among some agents. 'This was a failure on the part of the United States Secret Service. It's important that we hold ourselves to account for the failures of July 13th and that we use the lessons learned to make sure that we do not have another failure like this again,' said Ronald Rowe Jr., the agency's acting director, after the report was released. In addition to better defining responsibility for events, the senators recommended that the agency completely overhaul its communications operations at protective events and improve intelligence sharing. They also recommended that Congress evaluate whether more resources are needed. Democrats and Republicans have disagreed on whether to give the Secret Service more money in the wake of its failures. A spending bill on track to pass before the end of the month includes an additional $231 million for the agency, but many Republicans have said that an internal overhaul is needed first. 'This is a management problem plain and simple,' said Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, the top Republican on the Homeland panel's investigations subcommittee.	https://www.voanews.com/a/secret-service-failures-before-trump-rally-shooting-were-preventable-senate-panel-finds-/7798657.html	2024-09-25T04:37:10-07:00	
Greece and Turkey explore holding talks on maritime zones	Athens. — Greece and Turkey will explore whether they can start talks aimed at demarcating their maritime zones, Greece's foreign ministry said on Wednesday. Neighbors Greece and Turkey, both NATO allies but historic foes, have been at odds for decades over a range of issues from airspace to maritime jurisdiction in the eastern Mediterranean and ethnically split Cyprus. An agreement on where their maritime zones begin and end is important for determining rights over possible gas reserves and power infrastructure schemes. Tensions have eased in recent years and both countries agreed last year to reboot their relations, pledging to keep open channels of communication and work on the issues that have kept them apart. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis and Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan met on the sidelines of the annual United Nations General Assembly in New York on Tuesday and discussed bilateral ties, according to statements from the Turkish presidency and the Greek foreign ministry. 'The two leaders tasked the foreign ministers to explore whether conditions are favorable to initiate discussions on the demarcation of the continental shelf and exclusive economic zone,' Greek Foreign Minister George Gerapetritis said. Foreign ministers from the two countries will start preparations for a high-level meeting to take place in Ankara in January, the Greek prime minister's office said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greece-and-turkey-explore-holding-talks-on-maritime-zones-/7798640.html	2024-09-25T04:25:21-07:00

Environmentalists value peat, smear Finland's parliament in red paint	Helsinki — Environmental activists sprayed red paint on Finland's parliament building on Wednesday to protest against the peat industry, sparking strong criticism from politicians. Activists from Extinction Rebellion Finland and Swedish organization Aterstall Vatmarker (Restore Wetlands) smeared several granite columns at the building's main entrance in red paint resembling blood. They told AFP they were protesting against the Finnish state-owned company Neova mining peat in Swedish wetlands. Peat extracted from wetlands is often used as an energy source or for farming purposes, emitting large amounts of carbon dioxide. In their natural state, peatlands store large amounts of carbon dioxide. 'We have painted the columns with this easily washable paint to show that Finland is actively involved in accelerating the climate crisis,' said Valpuri Nykanen, an activist from Extinction Rebellion Finland standing outside the building. 'Finland is mining peat in Sweden, while we know that we must phase out oil, gas and all fossil fuels and peat is very fossil,' added Lior Tell-Stefansson from Aterstall Vatmarker. Police arrived at the scene after 8:00 am (0500 GMT) and removed 10 protesters sitting on the stairs with signs in their hands. The incident was investigated as aggravated damage to property, the police said in a statement. Several Finnish politicians immediately condemned the act. Newspaper Helsingin Sanomat quoted Prime Minister Petteri Orpo as saying it was 'completely incomprehensible and unacceptable vandalism.' 'Finland is a free democracy. We have the right to demonstrate and influence things, but we have civilized ways of doing it,' Orpo said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/environmentalists-value-peat-smear-finland-s-parliament-in-red-paint-/7798596.html	2024-09-25T03:37:08-07:00	
Thai exports rise in Aug, ministry says will meet 2024 forecast	BANGKOK — Thailand's exports rose for a second straight month in August, the commerce ministry said on Wednesday as it maintained its forecast of 1% to 2% growth this year despite the baht strengthening to 30-month highs against the U.S. dollar. With demand picking up in key markets, further export growth was expected this year and it could even come in above forecast, although the baht's rise would impact Q4 shipments, said Poonpong Naiyanapakorn, head of the ministry's Trade Policy and Strategy Office. Exports, a key driver of Southeast Asia's second-largest economy, rose 7% in August from a year earlier, and followed July's 15.2% rise, which was the fastest growth in 28 months. Economists in a Reuters poll had expected a rise of 5.8% Imports rose 8.9% in August from a year earlier, compared with a forecast rise of 7.30% in the poll. That led to a trade surplus of $0.26 billion in August, compared with a forecast deficit of $0.07 billion. In the first 8 months of 2024, exports rose 4.2% from a year earlier, while imports rose 5.2%, with the cumulative trade deficit at $6.35 billion. The baht has risen 4.6% since the beginning of the year, with large gains seen in the past month, to be the region's second-strongest performing currency after Malaysia's ringgit. 'The stronger baht is impacting liquidity and profits, especially for agricultural goods,' said Chaichan Chareonsuk, chairman of the Thai National Shippers' Council. 'Some business could take a loss when negotiating new orders or not get orders,' he said. The Finance Ministry and central bank are due to meet next week to discuss currency appreciation and inflation target. The Bank of Thailand said it was closely monitoring the currency and was ready to reduce volatility. For August, shipments to the United States rose 3% from a year earlier, while exports to China was up 6.7% but those to Japan were down 11.3%. Last month, rice exports rose 39.5% from a year earlier to 885,387 metric tons, and were up 46.6% in value terms to $562 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-exports-rise-in-aug-ministry-says-will-meet-2024-forecast/7798547.html	2024-09-25T02:49:15-07:00

Some analysts say China's plan to boost housing market is 'too little, too late'	Taipei, Taiwan — China's central bank has released a series of economic stimulus plans, including cuts to mortgage interest rates and the required cash reserve ratio — the latter of which will allow commercial banks to inject $140 billion into the market — among other monetary policies aimed at reviving the housing market and stimulating economic growth. Many Chinese internet users applauded this initiative, but few expressed immediate willingness to buy a house. Analysts said the policies are 'too late and too few,' since housing prices in China have fallen by half in some areas, leaving people wary of purchasing homes that could further decline in value. The heads of China's three major financial institutions — including Pan Gongsheng, the governor of the People's Bank of China; Li Yunze, the director of the National Financial Regulatory Administration; and Wu Qing, the chairman of the China Securities Regulatory Commission — on Tuesday unveiled the country’s most powerful economic rescue effort since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pan said that soon, commercial banks will be advised to reduce the interest rate of existing mortgages by about 0.5 percentage points on average, and the minimum down payment ratio for second homes will be reduced from the current 25% to the same 15% as the first home. He said this policy is expected to benefit 50 million households and 150 million people by reducing the nation’s total interest bill by about 150 billion yuan, or $21.3 billion, annually. Pan said that depending on market conditions, the central bank may consider cutting the required cash reserve on commercial banks by another 0.25 to 0.5 percentage points before the year’s end. Most Chinese internet users lauded the mortgage rate cuts. But no one answered affirmatively when a user under the name 'Mushroom's Second Sister' in Zhejiang asked on Weibo, 'Will everyone be more willing to buy a house?' A Weibo user from Guangdong under the name 'Chun Sheng Qi' said flatly, 'No.' Another Weibo user in Zhejiang under the name 'Little Lazy Pig Little Lin Lin' said, 'Is there a possibility they cut the interest rate to entice you to buy homes, and then they will increase the interest rate after a few years? They have the final say on the interest rate increase and reduction anyway.' A real estate analyst in Taipei told VOA on the condition of anonymity due to the issue's sensitivity that the new policy may not help restore confidence for Chinese home-buyers, who will be less inclined to spend lifetime savings on properties amid China’s sluggish economy, which has been hard-hit in recent years by the pandemic, the U.S.-China trade war and the global economic recession. She said that while governments around the world have been easing monetary policies to stimulate post-pandemic economic recovery in the past two years, the Chinese government has not taken action, allowing the economy to deteriorate. It is 'too late' to introduce the stimulus package, she said. She added that China’s policymakers are still holding onto an old development model and counting on the property market to drive the economy. But China’s housing market is taking a hit from the country’s declining birthrate. Young people who will inherit a house from elders will not invest in the housing market. Those whose families own no properties may not be able to afford one because of their financial obligations to support elders or children. Francis Lun, CEO of Geo Securities in Hong Kong, said the policies are 'too late and too few' but are better than nothing. He said that the People's Bank of China should have launched them a year ago, and the scale of 1 trillion yuan is not enough because developer Evergrande alone has $300 billion in debt. Other Chinese real estate companies also sit on billions in debt, so Lun expects China’s central bank to ease the monetary policy again in coming months. Lun told VOA by phone that to advance structural reform, China should also 'replace land sales with property tax revenue as local governments’ source of incomes… Or property prices won’t be stabilized, which will only worsen the local economy.'

Sri Lanka’s new president’s faces uphill task in push for change	New Delhi — Catapulted to power on an anti-corruption platform, Sri Lanka’s new Marxist-leaning president, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, faces an uphill task in meeting his commitments to clean up the country’s political culture and improving lives for millions mired in poverty since the country’s economic collapse two years ago, say analysts. With his party having only three lawmakers in the 225-member parliament, Dissanayake has called for fresh elections a year ahead of schedule to choose a new house that could give him wider support for the sweeping reforms that he has promised. 'Dissanayake’s hope would be to secure a comfortable majority in parliament,' according to Jayadeva Uyangoda, a political analyst in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, told VOA. 'In the past, it was customary for mainstream parties to bribe opposition lawmakers to join them, but his main plank is clean governance, so he will need to win the numbers.' In a country that rejected mainstream parties in the presidential polls, there is what Uyangoda calls a 'very good chance' that he will be able to substantially improve his party’s parliamentary tally. Elections will be held on Nov. 14. Currently, Dissanayake has the smallest cabinet in the country’s history as he lacks the numbers for a full-fledged cabinet. He has named a new prime minister, Harini Amarasuriya, and two ministers -- in Sri Lanka, only lawmakers can be appointed as ministers. Winning wider support will be crucial. 'Otherwise attempts to deliver on his election promises can be blocked by knee-jerk opposition, due to differences in ideology or political opportunism,' Rajni Gamage, a research fellow at the Institute of South Asian Studies at the National University of Singapore, told VOA. Meeting expectations of relief from the punishing austerity measures imposed by a $ 2.9 billion bailout deal with the International Monetary Fund is the first big test Dissanayake faces. He will handle the key finance portfolio. His pledge to renegotiate Sri Lanka’s deal with the IMF – which he says is not favorable to working class citizens — will not be easy at a time when the country is still heavily debt-ridden and has limited room to expand welfare measures. The package has helped steer the economy back to a nascent growth path, but the government will need to stick to the program’s criteria of keeping the budget deficit in check. An IMF spokesman in Washington said on Monday that it looked forward to working with President Dissanayake 'towards building on the hard-won gains that have helped put Sri Lanka on a path to economic recovery.' While options for providing relief may be limited, analysts said Dissanayake is expected to reduce income taxes for lower income groups and lower taxes on food and medicine. There is also concern among the business community about the position the Marxist leader, the son of a laborer, will take on free market policies. The policies of his Marxist party, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, are aligned with protectionism, according to Gamage. 'Their party’s economic growth policy is woven around prioritizing industrialization and domestic manufacturing, supporting local businesses and agriculture.' However, Dissanayake now heads a coalition, the National People’s Power, an umbrella group of small political parties, youth, civil society and women’s groups and trade unions. In recent years he has also moderated his party’s hard-left stance and said he believes in an open economy. 'The business class is uneasy because of the Marxist tradition to which he belongs. But my sense is that Dissanayake is a very pragmatic and rational man,' Jehan Perera, who heads the National Peace Council in Colombo, told VOA. 'And the coalition the president heads is not a Marxist group.' Delivering on the clean governance he has promised could also face a pushback. 'Corruption is very deep-seated in the system. It is endemic in society and goes from top to bottom, so rooting it out is very tough,' said Perera. 'He will face strong vested interests to rebuild a system that has broken down. But on the positive side, he has the support of the people.' After taking the oath of office, Dissanayake sounded a note of caution amid the widespread optimism raised by his victory among millions of Sri Lankans, saying he is not a 'magician' but an 'ordinary citizen.' 'There are things I know and don’t know. My aim is to gather those with the knowledge and skills to help lift this country,' he said on Monday. The coming months will be crucial for a country that is navigating a vastly altered political landscape. 'The management of the economic crisis and management of public expectations will be his biggest challenge, otherwise discontent will grow again,' said analyst Uyangoda. 'Past leaders have all belonged to the political elite. This is the first time there is a president who belongs to the working class, so the hopes of the ordinary people are very, very high.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-s-new-president-s-faces-uphill-task-in-push-for-change/7798495.html	2024-09-24T23:50:20-07:00

ADB maintains growth forecast for Asia, more stimulus expected in China	MANILA, Philippines — Developing Asia is on track to grow 5% this year, supported by strong consumption and high demand for tech exports, the Asian Development Bank forecast on Wednesday, and said China was expected to roll out more economic support measures. In an update to its Asian Development Outlook report, the ADB left most growth projections for economies in the region unchanged from its July report, maintaining its growth outlook for developing Asia at 5.0% this year and 4.9% next year. It revised down its inflation forecasts for developing Asia, which groups 46 countries in the Asia-Pacific, to 2.8% for this year and 2.9% for next year from previous forecasts of 2.9% and 3.0%, respectively. The Manila-based lender highlighted some downside risks to its outlook, including rising protectionism, escalating geopolitical tensions, adverse weather conditions, and a deterioration in China's property market. China, the world's second-largest economy, is battling deflationary pressures, and struggling to lift growth despite a series of policy measures aimed at spurring domestic spending. On Tuesday, China's central bank announced broad monetary stimulus and property market support measures as authorities look to restore confidence in the economy. 'Whether that will work remains to be seen because a lot of the structural problems in the property sector remain persistent,' ADB Chief Economist Albert Park said at a briefing. 'It may take more effort and work by their government' to alleviate concerns of consumers and investors, Park said, adding 'more proactive government policy would be helpful.' Park also said the ADB was not so concerned about deflation in China as it sees prices recovering. Last week, the U.S. Federal Reserve kicked off its own easing cycle with a hefty half-percentage-point rate cut. 'With the Fed's 50 basis point rate cut, central banks have more space to ease, and we expect more of them to do so,' Park said. The ADB kept its 2024 growth forecast for China at 4.8%, below the government's official target of about 5%. Growth for 2025 is still forecast at 4.5%. 'The PRC (People's Republic of China) growth forecast is retained despite the prolonged downturn in the property sector, on the assumption that further fiscal and monetary easing will help sustain the economy,' Park said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/adb-maintains-growth-forecast-for-asia-more-stimulus-expected-in-china/7798467.html	2024-09-24T22:31:46-07:00	
Global plan for early ditch of coal power hits Indonesia hurdle	CIREBON, Indonesia — A G7-backed push to close coal power plants in emerging markets is facing further delays after a July deadline passed without a deal on the early closure of an Indonesian power plant that would be the first to shut under the initiative. The push against coal comes under the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) with Indonesia, Senegal, South Africa and Vietnam that call for billions of dollars in investments, grants and loans from G7 members, multilateral banks and private lenders to help them transition to low-carbon economies. Cutting emissions from coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, is seen as a crucial element of the JETPs if the world is to stave off the worst impacts of climate change. But a deal on the early shutdown of coal power plants in South Africa remains elusive amid its struggles with rolling blackouts, and hope for proof of concept has turned to Indonesia's 660 megawatt Cirebon-1 plant in West Java province, 220 km east of capital Jakarta. The legal and financial implications of closing Cirebon-1 are a stumbling block though. Jakarta is worried, too, that costs for replacing it with renewable energy could reach $1.3 billion, mostly in subsidies to cover more expensive renewable power generation, according to the finance ministry. A new government is taking office in October as well and that could further dent the chance of a deal on Cirebon, said Fabby Tumiwa, a renewables expert and member of the technical team advising Indonesia on its JETP. 'If this is not signed before Oct. 20, I am worried that this matter will be overlooked,' Fabby said, citing calls by President-elect Prabowo Subianto for self-sufficiency and energy security that suggest a commitment to coal, which generates two-thirds of Indonesia's electricity. Prabowo, who takes office on that date, has not commented on Cirebon and has rarely discussed his energy policy, though the retirement of coal power is mentioned in his campaign pledges. Prabowo's team has not responded to requests for comment. Under Indonesia's JETP, richer nations have pledged $20 billion to help the Southeast Asian nation with its energy transition, although little of that money has been disbursed. Legal concerns Earlier this month, Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said the outgoing government was trying to close the Cirebon deal as soon as possible, without giving details. David Elzinga, team leader for the Asian Development Bank's regional Energy Transition Mechanism program that is working on the early shutdown scheme, said his group was seeking a binding deal on Cirebon acceptable to both the outgoing and incoming administrations. 'Indonesia has positioned itself to be a leader ... It's really important now that we get the deal done,' Elzinga said. A deal on Cirebon is crucial for the ADB's regional ETM program as it plans similar deals in countries including Vietnam and the Philippines, as well as for other plants in Indonesia. To get there, state utility Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN) and plant operator PT Cirebon Electric Power (CEP) need to reach a new power purchase agreement, which they failed to do by July, CEP Director Joseph Pangalila told Reuters. The need for stronger legal protections and a clear road map for retiring coal plants was the main problem, PLN said, given that power generation costs could rise by nearly 90%. PLN directors also fear a deal could expose them to future criminal charges if anti-graft investigators see the transaction as burdening the state with losses, JETP advisor Fabby said. Rachmat Kaimuddin, deputy minister overseeing power infrastructure, acknowledged this at a recent forum, saying stakeholders were considering the legal repercussions that might arise from any closures. 'If we're not careful, some people can get into trouble because it can create what they call state loss,' he said. In June, a former chief executive of state energy firm Pertamina was sentenced to nine years in jail for signing a long-term gas contract that a corruption court said caused state losses of $114 million. Others to follow 'We are anxious that it needs to get done, but at the same time what is important is that the first transaction be done in the best possible manner,' said Ramesh Subramaniam, ADB director general and head of the bank's sectors group. A number of private banks are lined up to invest and a series of new deals also could be started once Cirebon is done, with the ADB having already looked at about 30 other plants in Indonesia, he said. 'Although this has taken time, we have learnt a lot ... and our very clear feeling is the next ones to come will be considerably easier.' Cirebon-1 is a fairly new plant that started up in 2012. A deal would mean it stops operations in 2035 instead of 2042. Despite running cleaner than older plants, emissions from Cirebon and others around Jakarta are often blamed for Indonesia's chronic pollution, and some of the locals in neighboring fishing villages would be happy to see it go. Fisherman Amin, 64, blamed the plant and coal unloading at its jetty for pollution and a scarcity of fish in nearby waters. 'When they first opened, the water was fine, but it became increasingly murky. The green mussel farms here didn't have any harvest in the past two years,' he said. 'From the beginning of construction, I was against it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-plan-for-early-ditch-of-coal-power-hits-indonesia-hurdle/7798462.html	2024-09-24T22:18:19-07:00

US Congresswoman Kamlager-Dove condemns inaction on Sudan conflict	WASHINGTON — Fifty Democratic members of Congress sent a letter to President Joe Biden in late August requesting more humanitarian assistance for Sudan and calling on the U.S. to do more to help end the conflict. Leading the effort is U.S. Representative Sydney Kamlager-Dove of California, who told VOA in a recent interview that she is concerned that international partners aren’t doing enough to support humanitarian aid delivery to families affected by the conflict. 'Famine has erupted. Deaths are happening every day, and the warring parties are working together, in my opinion, to prevent the delivery of humanitarian aid,' she told VOA. 'It is unconscionable. And it is inhumane.' Without more aggressive leadership by the U.S., she said, the conflict risks international neglect amid the war Ukraine and an expanding conflict in the Middle East. The following has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: Your colleagues have joined you to raise awareness about Sudan. A lot of Sudanese who spoke to us say the world has forgotten them. How do you feel about their sentiments? U.S. Representative Sydney Kamlager-Dove: I am disheartened to hear that, but I understand why they would say it, and that is exactly why I wrote this letter and encouraged my colleagues to sign on. Fifty Democratic members of Congress signed with me, to ask this administration to do more. We want them to raise awareness of this war. Get [U.S.] Secretary [of State Anthony] Blinken out in front. We want to rally our international partners to also take this more seriously and pledge more dollars to help with the support around humanitarian aid delivery. Because if we are not taking the lead on this, then it will signal to the rest of the world that this is not important and of course it is. VOA: What about international attention? Are you getting that? Kamlager-Dove: No, we're not getting [international attention.] I have my own suspicions that people just don’t care, or don’t respect the continent of Africa. I think that is wildly ignorant. And we know with forces like China and Russia working to compete against us [the U.S.], and to dismantle democracies, we know that there are other agents and actors playing in this war as well. That is why it is incumbent upon us to take the lead and call for more aid and call for more discussions. VOA: What about America’s foreign policy and its resources? Where does it go? I mean, I know that the war in Ukraine and Gaza is shifting attention. Kamlager-Dove: Thankfully, we have an administration that is trying to engage. They finally got a special envoy, [Former U.S. Representative Tom Perriello], to Sudan. You know, a year too late, but he needs to be supported with more resources and more staff. It is very important that Secretary Blinken shows his face more on the continent and reminds folks that this administration cares. VOA: The U.N. made an appeal for humanitarian assistance. They were projecting $2.7 billion and only 37% of that was received. What should be done to get pledges from donor countries? Kamlager-Dove: Well, I do think we have to make a concerted effort to ask the international community to pledge more. It is important to give more, but if those resources are thwarted because you have bad actors keeping humanitarian aid from the people and the civilians that need it the most, then it doesn't matter. VOA: The U.S. government slapped sanctions on both sides in Sudan — the Rapid Support Forces [RSF] and some leaders of the Sudan Armed Forces [SAF]. And it appears like these sanctions are not biting hard because the two belligerent forces have decided not to sign any cease-fire. Are there other instruments of diplomacy in the toolbox that is yet to be used to bring pressure on these two groups? Kamlager-Dove: Well, it is certainly unfortunate that neither party wants to show up to the negotiating table. It's very hard to come to a resolution when you don't even sit at the table. The other thing that is unfortunate is even if you have sanctions, you know, if you’re still able to buy guns and get the weapons into the country, then obviously you need different kinds of teeth and authority. I think we should be looking at the folks who are supplying the arms to the forces, because that is as important as sanctioning both SAF and RSF. If you don’t stop the flow of arms, what are you really doing? VOA: When Perriello testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he mentioned that those aiding the war in Sudan must be held accountable, or the U.S.'s efforts will be in vain. How do you respond to that? Kamlager-Dove: I wholeheartedly agree. We have an obligation to focus on what is happening in the Sudan. But I want to say I'm grateful that he was actually able to show up. You know, we have not had a full committee hearing in the Foreign Affairs Committee on Africa since the beginning of this term. VOA: The last time we heard about funding [for Sudan] was 2017. And just a month ago, nongovernmental organizations, international aid agencies are saying Darfur is on the verge of famine, there's famine already there. … If you are given an opportunity to speak directly to the people who are making decisions on where aid money should go, what would you tell them? Kamlager-Dove: I would say the world is watching and the world is waiting. And every moment that you do not sit at the table and find a way, using any quiver that you have in your toolbox every day you wait is a day that someone dies in the Sudan. And this is not something that I am willing to keep in my heart. And this is not something that the United States should let happen. So, get off your tuchus (rear end) and find a way to bring about a cease-fire, and to make sure that humanitarian aid is able to get to the Sudan. This Q&A originated in VOA’s English to Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-congresswoman-kamlager-dove-condemns-inaction-on-sudan-conflict/7798455.html	2024-09-24T21:45:12-07:00	
Climate change doubles chance of floods like those in Central Europe, report says	WARSAW, Poland — Climate change has made downpours like the one that caused devastating floods in central Europe this month twice as likely to occur, a report said on Wednesday, as its scientific authors urged policymakers to act to stop global warming. The worst flooding to hit central Europe in at least two decades has left 24 people dead, with towns strewn with mud and debris, buildings damaged, bridges collapsed and authorities left with a bill for repairs that runs into billions of dollars. The report from World Weather Attribution, an international group of scientists that studies the effects of climate change on extreme weather events, found that the four days of rainfall brought by Storm Boris were the heaviest ever recorded in central Europe. It said that climate change had made such downpours at least twice as likely and 7% heavier. 'Yet again, these floods highlight the devastating results of fossil fuel-driven warming,' Joyce Kimutai, a researcher at Imperial College London's Grantham Institute and co-author of the study, said in a statement. 'Until oil, gas and coal are replaced with renewable energy, storms like Boris will unleash even heavier rainfall, driving economy-crippling floods.' The report said that while the combination of weather patterns that caused the storm - including cold air moving over the Alps and very warm air over the Mediterranean and the Black Seas - was unusual, climate change made such storms more intense and more likely. According to the report, such a storm is expected to occur on average about once every 100 to 300 years in today's climate with 1.3 degrees Celsius of warming from pre-industrial levels. However, it said that such storms will result in at least 5% more rain and occur about 50% more frequently than now if warming from pre-industrial levels reaches 2 C, which is expected to happen in the 2050s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/climate-change-doubles-chance-of-floods-like-those-in-central-europe-report-says/7798449.html	2024-09-24T20:52:09-07:00	
China’s youth unemployment fuels rise in postgraduate studies	Taipei, Taiwan — Youth unemployment in China climbed to nearly 19% in August, its highest level so far this year, according to official data. Analysts say that the higher level of youth unemployment is driving more college graduates to enroll in graduate schools to escape the job search as the world’s second-largest economy struggles. According to data released by the National Bureau of Statistics, or NBS, late last week, the unemployment rate among 16- to 24-year-olds rose from 17.1% in July to 18.8% in August. One big reason for the uptick in joblessness, the NBS said, is that nearly 12 million students graduated from Chinese universities this June, heightening competition in an already tough job market. Postgraduates overtake graduates 'The job market has shrunk, and at the same time there are still so many graduates. Too many people are idling every day,' said Lin Chan-Hui, an assistant professor of the General Education Center at Feng Chia University in Taiwan. 'Another way out is to return to school to study further and temporarily escape the competitive workplace.' Some Chinese universities say they are seeing more postgraduate students than undergraduates. According to the state-backed digital publication The Paper, the number of graduate students at Lanzhou University exceeded the total number of undergraduate students for the first time. Lanzhou University is located in the capital of northwestern China’s Gansu Province. In eastern China’s coastal Zhejiang Province, the Zhejiang University of Technology shows 5,382 new graduate students were admitted this year, beating out the number of new undergraduate students by 40. The trend was already picking up at more famous Chinese universities last year. Last December, Beijing’s Tsinghua University said the number of undergraduate freshmen in the previous academic year was 3,760, while the number of master's and doctoral students was 12,069. Shanghai’s Fudan University in October 2023 reported 15,000 undergraduate students and nearly 37,000 graduate students. China's Ministry of Education said that last year there were more than 47 million people enrolled in higher education institutes, 1.3 million were graduate students, according to the official Xinhua News Agency. Lei, a higher education consultant in Shenzhen, who due to the sensitivity of the subject only gave his surname, told VOA the trend of higher education is moving toward 'college graduates who don’t go to graduate school would immediately become unemployed' amid China's economic slowdown. 'On one hand, studying in graduate school can really help you find a job. On the other hand, it’s also an avoidance mentality,' Lei said. Wandering masters and doctors Feng Chia University’s Lin said that having an undergraduate degree is not enough in fields like technological innovation and scientific research, so it is still necessary to get a postgraduate degree in certain fields. On the other hand, he said, China has too many people getting doctorates and master’s degrees and not enough technical and vocational education so there will be 'fierce competition for upper-level work, but no one does the lower-level work.' Highly educated young people are not willing to engage in grassroots work, Lin said, so there will be more and more 'wandering masters and doctors.' Lin said the geopolitical tension between China and the U.S. has also made studying abroad for a postgraduate degree harder, so more students choose a domestic one instead. Chinese netizens seem to agree that waiting for the job market to improve is their best hope. A Hunan netizen on China’s Weibo social media platform under the name 'Da Ke Ya Tang' said: 'The market will not be able to provide so many jobs in the foreseeable future, so we have to leave the problem to the future.' 'If colleges and universities cannot adapt to the country's demand for innovative and pioneering talents and reform the way students are trained, more employment pressure may accumulate in society in a few years,' writer Wang Guojin said in a post on Weibo. COVID students coping? A PhD student in Shanghai who, due to the sensitivity of the subject, only gave his surname Zeng, told VOA the increase in master's and doctoral students is also because many graduate students went to college during the COVID-19 pandemic and are struggling to adapt. Zeng blames remote learning for their struggles with social interaction and the skills needed to compete in the job market. 'This group of college students obviously lacks some socialization skills, at least in recruitment interviews,' Zeng said. 'They can't reach the same level as the previous students.' Zeng adds that monthly stipends for master's and doctoral students ranges from roughly $143 to $700 and Chinese universities encourage entrepreneurship by providing funds to start small projects through competitions. 'Who wouldn’t want to continue their studies and earn money at the same time?' she asked.

Trump pledges sweeping tariffs, says they will keep jobs in US	SAVANNAH, Ga. — Donald Trump on Tuesday pledged to stop U.S. businesses from shipping jobs overseas and to take other countries' jobs and factories by relying heavily on sweeping tariffs to boost auto manufacturing — despite warnings that domestic consumers would pay more and a lack of specifics about how his plans would work. 'I want German car companies to become American car companies. I want them to build their plants here,' Trump declared during a speech in Savannah, Georgia. Trump added that, if elected, he'd put a 100% tariff on every car imported from Mexico and that the only way to avoid those charges would be for an automaker to build the cars in the U.S. His ideas, if enacted, could cause a huge upheaval in the American auto industry. Many automakers now build smaller, lower-priced vehicles in Mexico — facilitated by a trade agreement Trump negotiated while president — or in other countries because their profit margins are slim. The lower labor costs help the companies make money on those vehicles. German and other foreign automakers already have extensive manufacturing operations in the U.S., and many now build more vehicles here than they send. BMW, for instance, has an 8 million-square-foot campus in South Carolina that employs 11,000 people building more than 1,500 SUVs per day for the U.S. and 120 export markets. Mercedes and Volkswagen also have large factories here. If German automakers were to increase production here, they likely would have to take it from factories in Germany, which then would run below their capacity and be less efficient, said Sam Abuelsamid, principal research analyst for Guidehouse Insights. 'It makes no sense,' he said. Trump proposes 'new American industrialism' — without specifics Trump has proposed using tariffs on imports and other measures to boost American industry — even as economists have cautioned that U.S. consumers would bear the costs of tariffs and other Trump proposals like staging the largest deportation operation in U.S. history. The former president laid out a broad array of economic proposals during a speech in the key swing state of Georgia, promising to create a special ambassador to help lure foreign manufacturers to the U.S. and further entice them by offering access to federal land. Additionally, he called for lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, but only for companies that produce in the U.S. Harris, the Democratic nominee, wants to raise the corporate tax rate to 28%. It had been 35% when Trump became president in 2017, and he later signed legislation lowering it. 'We're putting America first,' Trump said. 'This new American industrialism will create millions and millions of jobs.' Trump also suggested wiping away some environmental regulations to boost energy production, saying America has 'got the oil, it's got the gas. We have everything. The only thing we don't have is smart people leading our country.' Tuesday's series of economic proposals raised a lot of questions, but the former president hasn't given specific answers on his ideas, which could substantially affect their impact and how much they cost. He has not specified, for example, whether his U.S.-focused corporate tax cuts would apply to companies that assemble their products domestically out of imports. Trump also suggested he would use a newly created envoy, and his own personal efforts, to recruit foreign companies. But he had a spotty record in the White House of attracting foreign investment. In one infamous case, Trump promised a $10 billion investment by Taiwan-based electronics giant Foxconn in Wisconsin, creating potentially 13,000 new jobs, that the company never delivered. His calls to offer federal land, meanwhile, might clash with Bureau of Land Management restrictions on foreign entities looking to lease lands. It also wasn't clear whether companies from China would be excluded, given Trump's longtime accusations that China is hurting American business.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pledges-sweeping-tariffs-says-they-will-keep-jobs-in-us/7798426.html	2024-09-24T19:52:49-07:00

Man who staked out Trump at golf course charged with attempted assassination	washington — A man who authorities say staked out Donald Trump for 12 hours on his golf course in Florida and wrote of his desire to kill him was indicted Tuesday on an attempted assassination charge. Ryan Wesley Routh had been initially charged with two federal firearms offenses. The upgraded charges contained in a five-count indictment reflect the Justice Department's assessment that he methodically plotted to kill the Republican nominee, aiming a rifle through the shrubbery surrounding Trump's West Palm Beach golf course on an afternoon Trump was playing on it. Routh left behind a note in which he described his intention, prosecutors said. Court records show the case has been assigned to Aileen Cannon, a Trump-appointed federal judge who generated intense scrutiny for her handling of a criminal case charging Trump with illegally hoarding classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida. She dismissed that case in July, a decision now being appealed by special counsel Jack Smith's team. The attempted assassination indictment had been foreshadowed during a court hearing Monday in which prosecutors successfully argued for the 58-year-old Routh to remain behind bars as a flight risk and a threat to public safety. They alleged that he had written of his plans to kill Trump in a handwritten note months before his September 15 arrest in which he referred to his actions as a failed 'assassination attempt on Donald Trump' and offered $150,000 for anyone who could 'finish the job.' That note was in a box that Routh had apparently dropped off at the home of an unidentified witness months before his arrest. The person opened the letter, took a photograph of the front page of the letter, addressed 'Dear World,' and contacted law enforcement after the attempted assassination. Prosecutors also said Routh kept in his car a handwritten list of venues in August, September and October at which Trump had appeared or was expected to be present. The charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence in the event of a conviction. The potential shooting was thwarted when a member of Trump's Secret Service protective detail spotted a partially obscured man's face and a rifle barrel protruding through the golf course fence line, ahead of where Trump was playing. The arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service has acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said that security worked as it should have to thwart the potential attack in Florida. The initial charges Routh faced in a criminal complaint accused him of illegally possessing his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions and with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. It is common for prosecutors to bring preliminary and easily provable charges upon an arrest and then add more serious offenses later as the investigation develops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-who-staked-out-trump-at-golf-course-charged-with-attempted-assassination-/7798402.html	2024-09-24T18:35:39-07:00	
IAEA chief sees willingness from Iran to engage on nuclear issues	UNITED NATIONS — U.N. nuclear watchdog chief Rafael Grossi said on Tuesday he had sensed a greater willingness by Iranian officials to engage with the agency in a more meaningful way after talks in New York, and that he hoped to travel to Tehran in October. Several long-standing issues have dogged relations between Iran and the International Atomic Energy Agency, including Tehran's barring of uranium-enrichment experts on the inspection team and its failure for years to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites. Grossi held talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, one of the key architects to the 2015 accord that limited Iran's ability to enrich uranium in return for a lifting of Western sanctions, on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly. 'What I see is an expressed willingness to reengage with us in a more meaningful fashion,' Grossi told Reuters in an interview. With nuclear diplomacy largely stalled between the Iranian presidential election and the U.S. one on Nov. 5, Iranian and European officials have met in New York to test their mutual willingness to reduce tensions amid Tehran's disputed nuclear program, its role in Ukraine and mounting regional tensions. Grossi said he wanted to make real progress in restoring proper technical discussions with Iran quickly and was aiming to travel to Tehran in October to meet with Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. 'Of course, now we have to give content and substance to this because we are not starting from zero. We have had [a] relatively protracted process without replies to some of the questions we have,' he said. 'We also need to calibrate together with them how we go through this period where they are waiting to see what is going to happen with their other partners, starting with the United States.' IAEA board resolutions ordering Iran to cooperate urgently with the investigation into the uranium traces and calling on it to reverse its barring of inspectors have brought little change, and quarterly IAEA reports seen by Reuters on Aug. 29 showed no progress. Development of Iran's nuclear program has also advanced. By the end of the quarter, the latest IAEA reports showed Iran had completed installation of eight new cascades at Fordow but had not brought them online. At its larger underground site at Natanz, which is enriching up to 5% purity, it had brought 15 new cascades of other advanced models online. 'Iran has kept a regular pace without accelerating too much, but it continues,' Grossi said, adding that the Fordow cascades remained offline. Iran has stepped up nuclear work since 2019, after then-U.S. President Donald Trump abandoned an agreement reached under his predecessor, Barack Obama. When asked about the prospects of a revival of nuclear talks, Grossi said the preparatory work needed to start now, notably for the IAEA to get the necessary clarity on Iran's activities since it reduced cooperation with the agency. 'I think we need to, or the ambition should be to get results in a different way, because the old way is simply not going to be possible anymore,' he said, adding that he foresaw a more active role for the agency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-chief-sees-willingness-from-iran-to-engage-on-nuclear-issues/7798407.html	2024-09-24T18:35:26-07:00

China pressures Myanmar ethnic groups to cut ties from forces perceived as close to US	Washington — China, which has long influenced Myanmar’s ethnic armed groups, is pressuring the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or MNDAA — part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance that includes the Ta’ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) and the Arakan Army (AA) — to avoid aligning with other opposition forces that China perceives as Western-backed, experts say. The MNDAA, also known as the Kokang ethnic armed group, whose members are Mandarin-speaking Han Chinese native to Kokang, reposted a statement on social media confirming their alliance with China. 'Our political red line is not to form alliances or work together with those who are against China,' read the statement, which was briefly posted Sept. 4 and reposted on Sept. 19. Analysts say that Beijing’s pressure on ethnic armed groups, especially the MNDAA, reflects its strategic interests in maintaining control over Myanmar’s political landscape. Strategically located along Myanmar’s northeastern border with China, the MNDAA is being pushed to sever ties with opposition forces that Beijing views as having U.S. support. China used its economic and political leverage when it reportedly cut off trade and supplies to Laukkai, the capital of the Kokang region, to create distance between the MNDAA and the National Unity Government (NUG) — the pro-democracy shadow government leading the fight against the ruling junta. 'The MNDAA’s statement is a follow-up to China’s warning that the ‘three bottom lines’ must not be crossed,' said Than Soe Naing, a veteran political analyst based in Myanmar. The 'three bottom lines,' articulated by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi in August, call for Myanmar to avoid civil strife, remain part of ASEAN, and prevent external interference. According to a political analyst based in Yangon who spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, there is a perception in China that the National Unity Government and certain resistance forces, as well as some ethnic armed organizations, are close to the United States and are receiving U.S. support. 'This policy reflects China’s emphasis on preventing external forces from interfering in Burma's affairs, which Beijing views as critical to its regional strategy,' said political analyst Than Soe Naing, using an alternative name for Myanmar. So far, Beijing has not commented on the MNDAA’s statement, despite the group’s request for China’s help to resolve the conflict and its willingness to cease fighting and cooperate with Beijing to negotiate a solution to Myanmar’s crisis. Myanmar also has not commented on the MNDAA’s statement. Meanwhile, Myanmar’s military continues airstrikes in northern Shan State. According to a Sept. 24 MNDAA social media post,a recent strike killed one civilian and injured 16 in Lashio, former headquarters of the junta’s Northeastern Command. Beijing’s interests in Myanmar Frequent visits by Chinese officials to Myanmar have reinforced perceptions that Beijing is siding with Myanmar’s military because it perceives the opposition groups to be in alignment with the United States, observers say. 'China sees the NUG and the People’s Defense Forces as Western-backed entities, and for China, that is a red line,' said Thomas Kean, senior consultant for Myanmar at the International Crisis Group. According to Hla Kyaw Zaw, a China-based expert on China-Myanmar relations, Myanmar offers China a valuable connection to the Indian Ocean, providing an essential trade route that would allow Beijing to compete more effectively in the region with the United States. 'If Myanmar is stable, China’s southwestern land-locked provinces will have a safe and secure outlet to the sea,' Hla Kyaw Zaw explained. 'Beijing wants these initiatives to move forward quickly.' China is the largest investor in Myanmar, and the internal conflict is 'not conducive to foreign investment and trade,' according to a Stimson Center report. That said, Kean told VOA that despite MNDAA’s public stance on China, the group may still maintain limited cooperation with resistance forces to secure its territorial interests. Nan Lwin, head of the Myanmar China studies program at the Institute for Strategy and Policy - Myanmar, said, 'If China is to be credible for the Myanmar peace process, it will need to have a multi-country approach.' Balancing act for opposition Earlier this year, the National Unity Government, or NUG, issued its first formal policy statement on Beijing, pledging to safeguard Chinese investments and enterprise as resistance forces continue to gain ground in areas near the Chinese border. However, the Yangon-based analyst who spoke on the condition of anonymity said this policy is insufficient to win over China, which seeks complete control in the region and wants to prevent any outside influence, particularly from the United States, near its strategic access point to the Indian Ocean. 'The more the conflict escalates on its border, the greater the risk of disagreements between China and the U.S. on Myanmar,' Kean said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-pressures-myanmar-ethnic-groups-to-cut-ties-from-forces-perceived-as-close-to-us/7797362.html	2024-09-24T18:13:46-07:00	
Academic freedom declines under Hong Kong's national security regime, report finds	Taipei, Taiwan — A report released on Wednesday finds that Hong Kong's national security law, enacted in July 2020, has eroded academic freedom in the former British colony. The report, co-authored by Human Rights Watch, and the Washington-based advocacy organization Hong Kong Democracy Council, said university authorities have imposed greater control and limitations on student activities and that students and faculty members are increasingly exercising self-censorship to avoid getting into trouble. 'Students, academics, and administrators, especially those from Hong Kong studying contemporary socio-political issues, feel as if they are living under a microscope,' the report says. Some analysts say the opaque definition of what constitutes a violation of the security law has created a chilling effect among students and faculty members at Hong Kong universities. 'When the red line isn't clear, there will be a pervasive sense of fear, and students and faculty members will try to make adjustments to ensure they don't get into trouble,' Maya Wang, the associate China director at Human Rights Watch, told VOA by phone. The report said Hong Kong's eight public universities have been managed by people who hold views favored by Beijing following the imposition of the law in 2020. Since then, university officials have increased crackdowns on student unions and banned symbols or events viewed as promoting pro-democracy values. 'University officials have punished students for holding peaceful protests and gatherings, and have broadly censored student publications, communications, and events,' the report reads. Wang at Human Rights Watch said since many college students and academics were involved in 2019 protests over an extradition bill, one of the Chinese government's priorities following the implementation of the law is to 'impose ideological control' over universities. 'The decline of academic freedom in Hong Kong's universities is part of Beijing's attempt to impose ideological control over the entire city,' she told VOA. Exercising self-censorship Most of the 33 students and academics interviewed for the report said self-censorship is a common practice at universities in Hong Kong, especially on socio-political topics related to China and Hong Kong. 'They do this when expressing themselves in classrooms, when writing and researching academic articles, and when inviting speakers for academic conferences,' the report says, adding that academics teaching Hong Kong and China current affairs feel 'especially vulnerable.' In some cases, university officials have asked academics in the social science field to stop offering courses on topics that Beijing considers sensitive. Others face censorship imposed by university administrators or academic publishers. Some academics said the prevalence of self-censorship at universities in Hong Kong will reduce international understanding of the dynamics in China. 'Hong Kong was always an important space that gives the international community some insight into what's happening in Hong Kong and the broader China, but that space is now rapidly disappearing,' Lokman Tsui, a research fellow at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab and a former journalism professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, told VOA by phone. The law's negative impact on academic freedom in Hong Kong seems to differ between academics in different fields. 'Some said [the NSL] affected everything they do; others said it has very little impact,' the report says. Since university management is stacked with supporters of the Chinese government's position, the report says university administrators have worked with Chinese and Hong Kong authorities to harass, intimidate or even remove academics voicing different opinions. 'The government does that by defaming and intimidating those academics perceived to hold liberal or pro-democracy views in the state-owned media and denying or not issuing visas to foreign academics expressing such opinions,' the report says, adding that universities would then fire, let go or deny tenure to these academics. Human Rights Watch and Hong Kong Democracy Council said the Chinese government's efforts to 'cleanse' universities in Hong Kong have led to a 'harmonization' of opinion in academia in Hong Kong. They also help amplify Chinese and Hong Kong authorities' claim that pro-democracy voices are now 'in the minority.' 'The Chinese government's overall intention has been to 'cleanse' the universities [and] the result is a sanitized version of higher education compliant with the Party's views, which so far continues to deliver a high-caliber education,' the report says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/academic-freedom-declines-under-hong-kong-s-national-security-regime-report-finds-/7797384.html	2024-09-24T17:49:32-07:00

Former executive gets 2 years in prison for role in FTX fraud	new york — Caroline Ellison, a former top executive in Sam Bankman-Fried's fallen FTX cryptocurrency empire, was sentenced to two years in prison on Tuesday after she apologized repeatedly to everyone hurt by a fraud that stole billions of dollars from investors, lenders and customers. U.S. District Judge Lewis A. Kaplan said Ellison's cooperation was 'very, very substantial' and 'remarkable.' But he said a prison sentence was necessary because she had participated in what might be the 'greatest financial fraud ever perpetrated in this country and probably anywhere else' or at least close to it. He said in such a serious case, he could not let cooperation be a get-out-of-jail-free card, even when it was clear that Bankman-Fried had become 'your kryptonite.' 'I've seen a lot of cooperators in 30 years here,' he said. 'I've never seen one quite like Ms. Ellison.' She was ordered to report to prison on November 7. Ellison, 29, pleaded guilty nearly two years ago and testified against Bankman-Fried for nearly three days at a trial last November. At sentencing, she emotionally apologized to anyone hurt by the fraud that stretched from 2017 through 2022. 'I'm deeply ashamed with what I've done,' she said, fighting through tears to say she was 'so so sorry' to everyone she had harmed directly or indirectly. She did not speak as she left Manhattan federal court, surrounded by lawyers. In a court filing, prosecutors had called her testimony the 'cornerstone of the trial' against Bankman-Fried, 32, who was found guilty of fraud and sentenced to 25 years in prison. In court Tuesday, Assistant U.S. Attorney Danielle Sassoon called for leniency, saying her testimony was 'devastating and powerful proof' against Bankman-Fried. The prosecutor said Ellison's time on the witness stand was very different from Bankman-Fried, who she said was 'evasive, even contemptuous, and unable to answer questions directly' when he testified. Attorney Anjan Sahni asked the judge to spare his client from prison, citing 'unusual circumstances,' including her off-and-on romantic relationship with Bankman-Fried and the damage caused when her 'whole professional and personal life came to revolve' around him. FTX was one of the world's most popular cryptocurrency exchanges, known for its Superbowl TV ad and its extensive lobbying campaign in Washington before it collapsed in 2022. U.S. prosecutors accused Bankman-Fried and other executives of looting customer accounts on the exchange to make risky investments, make millions of dollars of illegal political donations, bribe Chinese officials, and buy luxury real estate in the Caribbean. Ellison was chief executive at Alameda Research, a cryptocurrency hedge fund controlled by Bankman-Fried that was used to process some customer funds from FTX. As the business began to falter, Ellison divulged the massive fraud to employees who worked for her even before FTX filed for bankruptcy, trial evidence showed. Ultimately, she also spoke extensively with criminal and civil U.S. investigators. Sassoon said prosecutors were impressed that Ellison did not 'jump into the lifeboat' to escape her crimes but instead spent nearly two years fully cooperating. Since testifying at Bankman-Fried's trial, Ellison has engaged in extensive charity work, written a novel, and worked with her parents on a math enrichment textbook for advanced high school students, according to her lawyers. They said she also now has a healthy romantic relationship and has reconnected with high school friends she had lost touch with while she worked for and sometimes dated Bankman-Fried from 2017 until late 2022.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-executive-gets-2-years-in-prison-for-role-in-ftx-fraud-/7797349.html	2024-09-24T17:16:11-07:00

Women's rights activists at UN call for inclusion in negotiations with Taliban	washington — Afghan women and their international supporters are calling for the inclusion of women in any negotiations on the future of Afghanistan amid the Taliban's increasing restrictions on women in the country. In a side event on the eve of the United Nations General Assembly, co-hosted by Ireland, Indonesia, Switzerland and Qatar together with the Women's Forum on Afghanistan, women's activists called on the international community to stand with Afghan women in the face of the Taliban's repressive measures. Academy Award-winning actress Meryl Streep, who participated in the meeting, said Afghan women have been stripped of their rights under the Taliban. 'A bird may sing in Kabul but a girl may not, and a woman may not in public,' she said. 'This is extraordinary. This is a suppression of the natural law. This is odd.' Streep was referring to the Taliban's newly imposed morality law that prohibits women from speaking aloud in public. 'Whenever an adult woman leaves her home out of necessity, she is obliged to conceal her voice, face, and body,' the new law states. U.N. human rights experts say the Taliban's law issued last month would further restrict women's rights. 'It reinforces and expands existing discriminatory policies, such as mandatory dress codes, the requirement for women to have a male guardian [mahram], and the segregation of men and women in public spaces,' the U.N. human rights experts said in an August 30 news release. Since returning to power in 2021, the Taliban have imposed repressive measures on women in Afghanistan, including banning them from getting secondary and university education, and barring them from working with government and nongovernmental organizations. Under the Taliban, girls and women are not allowed to travel long distances without a male relative and may not go to parks, public baths and gyms. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told a side meeting at UNGA that the Taliban's treatment of women can be compared to 'some of the most egregious systems of oppression in recent history.' 'We will continue to amplify the voices of Afghan women and call for them to play a full role in the country's life, both inside its borders and on the global stage,' he said. Yousafzai demands end to discrimination Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai said at the UNGA that discrimination against women should stop in Afghanistan. 'A threat to girls rights in Afghanistan is a threat to girls everywhere,' Yousafzai said in a Facebook post. 'I want us to push our leaders to hold the Taliban accountable for their crimes against humanity. Let's act for our common future.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/women-s-rights-activists-at-un-call-for-inclusion-in-negotiations-with-taliban/7797046.html	2024-09-24T16:39:02-07:00

Statue of American music legend Johnny Cash unveiled at US Capitol	Washington — Johnny Cash now stands among the most famous politicians, trailblazers and activists of American history as he became the first professional musician to be honored with a statue in the U.S. Capitol. Congressional leaders from both parties and members of the Cash family were among the several hundred guests who gathered Tuesday for the unveiling of the statue. They shared their memories of a man who grew up on an Arkansas cotton farm and turned a love of music into a decades-long career that gave voice to the struggles and triumphs of everyday Americans. 'Some may ask: Why should a musician have a statue here in the halls of the great American republic?' House Speaker Mike Johnson said at the unveiling ceremony. 'The answer is pretty simple. It’s because America is about more than laws and politics.' Each state selects two statues to place within the Capitol. The Cash statue is the second new figure Arkansas has sent to replace two existing images that had represented the state at the U.S. Capitol for more than 100 years. Another statue depicting civil rights leader Daisy Bates was unveiled at the Capitol earlier this year. Bates mentored the nine Black children who desegregated Little Rock Central High School in 1957. The state’s legislature in 2019 voted to replace Arkansas’ two prior statues, which depicted little-known figures from the 18th and 19th centuries, with Bates and Cash. Known as the 'The Man in Black,' Cash was a vivid storyteller who sang with a deep voice songs like 'I Walk The Line,' 'Ring of Fire,' 'Jackson' and 'A Boy Named Sue.' The statue depicts the singer with a guitar slung across his back and a Bible in his hand. Little Rock sculptor Kevin Kresse created the statue. Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said artistic creativity is an important part of the country's growth, and Cash's 'substance' and 'swagger' inspired generations of artists from every genre imaginable. He quoted singers such as Bob Dylan and Snoop Dogg about Cash's impact. 'He called Johnny Cash a real American gangster. That a compliment from Snoop Doggy Dogg,' Jeffries said as the audience laughed. 'What a life, what a legend, what a legacy.' Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders led a group of Arkansas lawmakers at the ceremony. She said she grew up in a musical family where 'after God and country, came Johnny Cash.' She noted how Cash struggled with addiction but went on to perform for prisoners and held a deep religious faith. She described him as a 'hymn-singing Christian' who also experienced difficult times. 'When so much in today's world is fake, Johnny Cash was very real,' Sanders said. Cash's daughter, Rosanne Cash, said her father would have viewed the statue 'as the ultimate' honor in his life. She said her father's hard upbringing instilled in him a strong work ethic and that he loved the idea of America as a place of dreams and refuge. 'This man was a living redemption story,' Rosanne Cash said. 'He encountered darkness and met it with love.' Cash was born in Kingsland, a tiny town about 100 kilometers south of Little Rock. He died in 2003 at age 71. His achievements include 90 million records sold worldwide spanning country, rock, blues, folk and gospel.

At UN, Africa renews calls for Security Council seats	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigeria has joined the growing calls by Africans leaders for permanent representation on the United Nations Security Council. On the sidelines of the 79th U.N. General Assembly in New York on Tuesday, Nigerian Defense Minister Mohammed Badaru said such a change would promote fairness and inclusivity. 'We have been in 41 different United Nations’ missions to provide security across the world,' Badaru said. 'Based on that background and the effort of Africa, we also call on the United Nations to reform the Security Council so that Africa can have a permanent seat. It is time. We deserve it for justice and for equity.' Other African nations also are clamoring for change. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday said, 'Placing the fate of the world’s security in the hands of a select few when it is the vast majority who bear the brunt of these threats is unjust, unfair and unsustainable.' Similarly, Kenyan President William Ruto criticized the multilateral system, saying, 'It has proven inadequate.' Many African countries were still under colonial rule at the time the Security Council was established. In 2005, the African Union adopted the so-called Ezulwini Consensus in Ethiopia for Africa to have at least two permanent and five nonpermanent seats at the U.N. council. To date, though, the U.N. General Assembly elects five new members from different geographical zones for two-year terms on the council. Africa has three rotational seats on the 15-member council. The founder of Security Watch Africa Initiative, Patrick Agbambu, said Africa needs to be united to make a good representation. 'The biggest threat to Africa getting that seat is Africa itself,' Agbambu said. 'Africa does not have a united front; they do not have a common voice to be able to push two countries or one country forward. You can't go for such with a divided house. 'As it stands, the various blocs in the African Union seem very divided, with each having a very strong opposition to the other. So, the world is just watching Africa,' he said. Last week, the United States, one of five permanent members of the U.N. Security Council, said it is open to having two African seats on the council but without the veto power of the original permanent members: Britain, China, France, Russia and the U.S. Security analyst Senator Iroegbu said African representation on the Security Council is the right call but warned that it wouldn’t solve all problems. 'Nigeria stands in the right mix because it's one of the most important countries in Africa and it's the most populous nation in Africa, with huge economic potential,' he said. 'But just being a member of [the] U.N. Security Council doesn't guarantee stability at home if all the factors causing insecurity are not well addressed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-africa-renews-calls-for-security-council-seats/7796868.html	2024-09-24T13:33:45-07:00	
Qataris can travel to US without visa; first Gulf nation to meet requirements	new york — The Gulf nation of Qatar on Tuesday became just the second Muslim-majority country to be admitted into a program that allows its citizens to travel to the United States without first obtaining a U.S. visa. The departments of State and Homeland Security jointly announced that Qatar had met stringent eligibility requirements to join the visa waiver program. Those requirements include a low visa refusal rate, a low rate of visa overstays and a demand of reciprocal treatment of American travelers, who are already allowed to visit Qatar without a visa for up to 30 days. 'Qatar has been an exceptional partner for the United States, and our strategic relationship has only grown stronger over the past few years,' the departments said in a statement. 'This is further evidence of our strategic partnership and our shared commitment to security and stability.' Qatar, which has played a key role in trying to negotiate a cease-fire deal in Gaza and was an instrumental U.S. partner before and during the American withdrawal from Afghanistan, is the 42nd country to be admitted to the program. Most countries whose citizens can visit the U.S. without a visa are longstanding allies in Europe and Asia. The only other Muslim-majority country in the program is the tiny Southeast Asian nation of Brunei. Although Qatar's population is just over 3 million people, only a small percentage of those — about 320,000 — are actually Qataris who would be eligible for the program if they hold valid passports. The vast majority of people who live in Qatar are foreign workers and other expatriates who do not hold Qatari passports. The program allows citizens of qualifying nations to enter the U.S. for business or tourism without a visa for up to 90 days, although they must still obtain approval through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, which is done online and doesn't require an in-person interview as visa applications do. After Oct. 1, U.S. citizens will be allowed to stay in Qatar without a visa for 90 days. Israel was the last country admitted to the program in 2023, and it was allowed in despite significant concerns that it does not treat Palestinian Americans, Arab Americans or Muslim Americans the same as other U.S. passport holders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/qataris-can-travel-to-us-without-visa-first-gulf-nation-to-meet-requirements-/7796871.html	2024-09-24T13:33:24-07:00	
Delegates from African countries meet to discuss trade in live elephants	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana is hosting delegates from 33 African elephant range states for talks on the trade in live elephants. They are also seeking a common position as Africa battles increasing elephant populations in some areas, while the numbers decline elsewhere on the continent. Botswana’s environment and tourism minister, Nnaniki Makwinja, said Africa must speak with one voice despite the peculiar challenges each region faces. 'We are cognizant that the challenges that we face are diverse and there is no silver bullet to address these challenges,' Makwinja said Monday during the opening of the four-day meeting. 'We call upon these countries to engage with us before they adopt measures that may undermine our efforts to conserve our wildlife heritage and sustainable development goals.' In 2022, delegates from Africa attended talks in Panama on the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, or CITES. They were divided over elephant management. Southern African nations want CITES to relax measures on elephant trade, but some parts of the continent, particularly the eastern and western areas, want stricter controls. Dan Challender, a conservation scientist on the wildlife trade based at the University of Oxford, said this week’s meeting in Botswana might not address all concerns given the uneven distribution of the animals across the continent. 'The meeting provides an opportunity for African countries to come together and discuss trade in African elephants. I would expect them to find common ground on some issues but not all, recognizing the different status of the species and policy environments across the continent,' Challender said. The meeting is open to governments, but non-profit conservation organizations are not invited. Local conservationist Isaac Theophilus of the Botswana Wildlife Producers Association said delegates from countries that oppose trade in elephants should get a chance to see the impact of human-wildlife conflict. 'We have two opposing blocks that will be seated around the same table to look at issues relating to elephant management,' Theophilus said. 'My hope and wish is that those states attending would have an opportunity to interact with people in the (wildlife) area and get firsthand information relating to problems associated with living with an increasing elephant population.' Veterinarian and wildlife management expert Dr. Eric Verreynne said trade in live elephants poses logistical challenges. 'Transporting elephants from one country to another brings with it some challenges. Most of these challenges relate to logistics,' Verreynne said. 'They are bulk animals; it's very, very expensive to transport. When you talk about females and calves, you have to take your family groups in one. The capacity to transport large numbers of elephants is limited.' Africa’s elephant population is estimated at 415,000, with more than half of the number living in southern Africa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/delegates-from-african-countries-meet-to-discuss-trade-in-live-elephants-/7796861.html	2024-09-24T13:09:36-07:00

Iran believes all remaining workers have died in coal mine explosion	TEHRAN, Iran — Iran said Tuesday it believes the remaining workers trapped by an explosion at a coal mine in the country's east have died, bringing the death toll in one of its worst industrial disasters to at least 49. A provincial emergency official, Mohammad Ali Akhoundi, gave the death toll in a report carried by Iranian state television from the mine in Tabas. Figures for the numbers of miners inside the mine at the time have fluctuated since a methane gas leak on Saturday sparked an explosion at the coal mine in Tabas, about 540 kilometers southeast of the capital, Tehran. Around 70 people had been working at the time of the blast. Bodies recovered so far showed no signs of blast injuries, suggesting many of the workers died from the gas before the blast. Such gases are common in mining, although modern safety measures call for ventilation and other measures to protect workers. It wasn't immediately clear what safety procedures were in place at the privately owned Tabas Parvadeh 5 mine, operated by Mandanjoo Company. The firm could not be reached for comment. On Tuesday, a lawmaker and member of parliament's mine committee said the safety system of the mine was not working and 'even the central alarm system was broken or did not exist.' Lawmaker Zahra Saeedi added that workers learned of the safety issue just before the disaster but couldn't leave in time. Two of the dead were health and safety experts at the mine, she said. Iran's new reformist president, Masoud Pezeshkian, in New York for the U.N. General Assembly, has said he ordered all efforts be made to rescue those trapped and aid their families. He also said an investigation into the explosion was underway. Iran's mining industry has been struck by disasters before. In 2017, a coal mine explosion killed at least 42 people. Then-President Hassan Rouhani, campaigning ahead of winning reelection, visited the site in Iran's northern Golestan province and angry miners besieged the SUV he rode in, kicking and beating the armored vehicle in a rage. In 2013, 11 workers were killed in two separate mining incidents. In 2009, 20 workers were killed in several incidents. Lax safety standards and inadequate emergency services in mining areas were often blamed for the fatalities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-believes-all-remaining-workers-have-died-in-coal-mine-explosion/7796786.html	2024-09-24T12:28:06-07:00	
US Justice Department sues Visa, saying it monopolizes debit card markets	NEW YORK — The U.S. Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit against Visa on Tuesday, alleging that the financial services behemoth uses its size and dominance to stifle competition in the debit card market, costing consumers and businesses billions of dollars. The complaint says Visa penalizes merchants and banks who don't use Visa's own payment processing technology to process debit transactions, even though alternatives exist. Visa earns an incremental fee from every transaction processed on its network. According to the DOJ's complaint, 60% of debit transactions in the United States run on Visa's debit network, allowing it to charge over $7 billion in fees each year for processing those transactions. 'We allege that Visa has unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market,' said Attorney General Merrick Garland in a statement. 'Merchants and banks pass along those costs to consumers, either by raising prices or reducing quality or service. As a result, Visa's unlawful conduct affects not just the price of one thing — but the price of nearly everything.' The Biden administration has aggressively gone after U.S. companies that it says act like middlemen, such as Ticketmaster parent Live Nation and the real estate software company RealPage, accusing them of burdening Americans with nonsensical fees and anticompetitive behavior. The administration has also brought charges of monopolistic behavior against technology giants such as Apple and Google. According to the DOJ complaint, filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, Visa leverages the vast number of transactions on its network to impose volume commitments on merchants and their banks, as well as on financial institutions that issue debit cards. That makes it difficult for merchants to use alternatives, such as lower-cost or smaller payment processors, instead of Visa's payment processing technology, without incurring what DOJ described as 'disloyalty penalties' from Visa. The DOJ said Visa also stifled competition by paying to enter into partnership agreements with potential competitors. In 2020, the DOJ sued to block the company's $5.3 billion purchase of financial technology startup Plaid, calling it a monopolistic takeover of a potential competitor to Visa's ubiquitous payments network. That acquisition was later called off. Visa previously disclosed the Justice Department was investigating the company in 2021, saying in a regulatory filing it was cooperating with a DOJ investigation into its debit practices. Since the pandemic, more consumers globally have been shopping online for goods and services, which has translated into more revenue for Visa in the form of fees. Even traditionally cash-heavy businesses such as bars, barbers and coffee shops have started accepting credit or debit cards as a form of payment, often via smartphones. Visa processed $3.325 trillion in transactions on its network during the quarter ended June 30, up 7.4% from a year earlier. U.S. payments grew by 5.1%, which is faster than U.S. economic growth. Visa, based in San Francisco, did not immediately have a comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7796751.html	2024-09-24T11:53:44-07:00

Swiss police detain several people in connection with 'suicide capsule'	GENEVA — Police in northern Switzerland said Tuesday that several people have been detained and a criminal case opened in connection with the suspected death of a person in a 'suicide capsule.' The 'Sarco' capsule is presumably designed to allow a person sitting in a reclining seat inside to push a button that injects nitrogen gas into the sealed chamber. The person is then supposed to fall asleep and die by suffocation in a few minutes. Exit International, an assisted suicide group based in the Netherlands, said it is behind the 3D-printed device that cost over $1 million to develop. Swiss law allows assisted suicide so long as the person takes his or her life with no 'external assistance' and those who help the person die do not do so for 'any self-serving motive,' according to a government website. A law firm informed prosecutors in Schaffhausen canton that an assisted suicide involving the Sarco had taken place Monday near a forest cabin in Merishausen, regional police said in a statement. They said that 'several people' were taken into custody and that prosecutors opened an investigation on suspicion of incitement and accessory to suicide. Dutch newspaper Volkskrant reported Tuesday that police had detained one of its photographers who wanted to take pictures of the use of the Sarco. It said Schaffhausen police had indicated the photographer was being held at a police station but declined to give a further explanation. The newspaper declined to comment further when contacted by the Associated Press. In an email, the Dutch Foreign Ministry told the AP that it was in contact with the newspaper and Swiss officials. 'As always, we cannot interfere in the legal process of another country. At the same time, the Netherlands stands firmly for press freedom. It is very important that journalists worldwide can do their work freely,' it said. Exit International, the group behind the Sarco, said in a statement a 64-year-old woman from the U.S. Midwest — it did not specify further — who had suffered from 'severe immune compromise' had died Monday afternoon near the German border using the Sarco device. It said Florian Willet, co-president of The Last Resort, a Swiss affiliate of Exit International, was the only person present and described her death as 'peaceful, fast and dignified.' Dr. Philip Nitschke, an Australian-born trained doctor behind Exit International, has previously told the AP that his organization received advice from lawyers in Switzerland that the use of the Sarco would be legal in the country. In the Exit International statement on Tuesday, Nitschke said he was 'pleased that the Sarco had performed exactly as it had been designed ... to provide an elective, non-drug, peaceful death at the time of the person's choosing.' The claims of Nitschke and Exit International could not be independently verified. On Monday, Health Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider was asked in Swiss parliament about the legal conditions for the use of the Sarco capsule. She suggested its use would not be legal. 'On one hand, it does not fulfill the demands of the product safety law, and as such, must not be brought into circulation,' she said. 'On the other hand, the corresponding use of nitrogen is not compatible with the article on purpose in the chemicals law.' In July, Swiss newspaper Blick reported that Peter Sticher, a state prosecutor in Schaffhausen, wrote to Exit International's lawyers saying any operator of the suicide capsule could face criminal proceedings if it was used there — and any conviction could bring up to five years in prison. Prosecutors in other Swiss regions have also indicated that the use of the suicide capsule could lead to prosecution. Over the summer, a 54-year-old U.S. woman with multiple health ailments had planned to be the first person to use the device, but those plans were abandoned. Switzerland is among the only countries in the world where foreigners can travel to legally end their lives and has organizations that are dedicated to helping people kill themselves. But unlike others, including the Netherlands, Switzerland does not allow euthanasia, which involves health care practitioners killing patients with a lethal injection at their request and in specific circumstances. Some lawmakers in Switzerland have argued that the law is unclear and have sought to close what they call legal loopholes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swiss-police-detain-several-people-in-connection-with-suicide-capsule-/7796700.html	2024-09-24T11:24:22-07:00	
Pope Francis takes on Belgium, Luxembourg and perhaps euthanasia, too	rome — Despite suffering a mild flu Monday, Pope Francis still plans to travel later this week to Luxembourg and Belgium to visit a once-solid bastion of Roman Catholic culture that now has decreasing church attendance and increasing use of euthanasia. Michele Dillon is a sociologist and the dean of the University of New Hampshire’s College of Liberal Arts. She is also the author of the book, Postsecular Catholicism: Relevance and Renewal. Dillon told VOA that while Pope Francis engages in interreligious dialogue in Asia, Europe and places like Belgium and Luxembourg remain very important to him and the Roman Catholic Church. 'Secularization has sort of really accelerated certainly in the last 20 years. Euthanasia legislation is a good example of that,' she said. Both countries have legalized euthanasia, ending the life of a patient suffering a serious physical or mental illness. 'They have a lot of sex abuse issues there [meaning Belgium] at the highest level to the Church hierarchy. It’s his commitment to really go to where the people are. He is very clear-eyed about what the problems are, the problems within the Church, what the problems of society at large are.' Veteran Vatican observers in Rome, like Francis X. Rocca, formerly of The Wall Street Journal, point out that Belgium was the second country to legalize euthanasia, after the neighboring Netherlands, in 2002. Twelve years later, it legalized euthanasia for minors, with no minimum age specified. Rocca told VOA that Belgium, once historically staunchly Catholic, is seeing a drop in church attendance, while putting in place laws like euthanasia, against its teaching. 'After 22 years of legalization of euthanasia in Belgium, the practices increased steeply, and it’s become much more popular and that’s in direct contradiction with the teachings of the Catholic Church,' Rocca said. 'So, there is a broader question of how welcome his message will be, his presence. There have been some complaints by people in the media there. 'But the question of euthanasia is probably the starkest one because the Church itself has had to figure out ways of ministering to people who have chosen euthanasia.' Rocca added that there are people in the church who approve of euthanasia or think at least it can be justified. He said that includes at least one bishop, the bishop of Antwerp, Johan Bonny. Rocca said that even some Catholic institutions in Belgium, including hospitals, have accommodated the use of euthanasia. But he questions whether the pope will address concerns over euthanasia explicitly or only allude to it. 'He’s condemned euthanasia as being part of what he calls a ‘throwaway’ culture,' Rocca said. 'It’s a question whether he will speak about this when he goes on his trip because Francis doesn’t generally confront these controversial or cultural questions head on when he’s in a country.' The University of New Hampshire’s Dillon said Francis is 'not necessarily going to change things in Belgium and Luxembourg.' 'I think it’s important to what he would call evangelization — being with the people, whether they are first world or third world,' she said. 'He wants to go to countries and show people that he wants to engage with them, talk with them about the challenges and the circumstances of their lives.' Still, Rocca says the sight of 87-year-old Pope Francis in a wheelchair, defying his infirmities, while taking his mission to the world, speaks volumes about his commitment to life.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7796680.html	2024-09-24T11:12:49-07:00

FBI: Son of suspect in Trump assassination attempt arrested on child sexual abuse images charges	WASHINGTON — The son of the man suspected in the assassination attempt in Florida against former President Donald Trump has been arrested on federal charges of possessing child sexual abuse images. Oran Alexander Routh was arrested this week after authorities searched his Greensboro, North Carolina, home 'in connection with an investigation unrelated to child exploitation,' and found hundreds of files depicting child sexual abuse, an FBI agent said in court papers. Investigators who seized multiple electronic devices found videos sent to Oran Routh in July as well as chats from a messaging application commonly used by people who share child sexual abuse material, the FBI agent said. He faces two charges of possessing and receiving child sexual abuse material and is expected to appear later Tuesday in federal court in North Carolina. There was no attorney listed for Oran Routh in court papers. Phone messages left for relatives of Oran Routh were not immediately returned. Oran Routh's father, Ryan Wesley Routh, has been charged with federal gun offenses in connection to the attempted assassination at Trump's Florida golf course earlier this month. Prosecutors have indicated much more serious attempted assassination charges are coming. Oran Routh's arrest was first reported Tuesday by ABC News. A federal judge on Monday agreed with Justice Department prosecutors that Ryan Routh should remain locked up while he awaits trial in his case. Prosecutors have said Ryan Routh left behind a note detailing his plans to kill the former president and kept in his car a handwritten list of dates and venues where Trump was to appear. The note describing Routh's plans was placed in a box that he dropped off months earlier at the home of an unidentified person who did not open it until after Ryan Routh's arrest, prosecutors said. Ryan Routh is currently charged with illegally possessing his gun in spite of multiple felony convictions, including two charges of possessing stolen goods in 2002 in North Carolina, and with possessing a firearm with an obliterated serial number. But a prosecutor said in court Monday that they would pursue additional charges before a grand jury, accusing him of having tried to 'assassinate a major political candidate' — charges that would warrant life in prison in the event of a conviction. It is common for prosecutors to file more easily provable charges as an immediate placeholder before adding more significant allegations as the case proceeds. Ryan Routh was arrested September 15 after a Secret Service agent who was scoping the Trump International Golf Club for potential security threats saw a partially obscured man's face and the barrel of a semiautomatic rifle, aimed directly at the former president. The agent fired at Routh, who sped away before being stopped by officials in a neighboring county, leaving behind a loaded rifle, digital camera, a backpack and a reusable shopping bag that was hanging from a chain-link fence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-son-of-suspect-in-trump-assassination-attempt-arrested-on-child-sexual-abuse-images-charges-/7796556.html	2024-09-24T10:08:28-07:00

Same-sex couples in Thailand to legally wed starting January	Bangkok — Thailand's landmark marriage equality bill was officially written into law Tuesday, allowing same-sex couples to legally wed. The law was published in the Royal Gazette after endorsement by King Maha Vajiralongkorn, and will come into effect in 120 days. This means LGBTQ+ couples will be able to register their marriage in January next year, making Thailand the third place in Asia, after Taiwan and Nepal, to allow same-sex marriage. The bill, which grants full legal, financial and medical rights for marriage partners of any gender, sailed through both the House of Representatives and the Senate in April and June respectively. 'Congratulations to everyone's love,' Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra wrote on X, adding the hashtag #Love Wins. Thailand has a reputation for acceptance and inclusivity but struggled for decades to pass a marriage equality law. Thai society largely holds conservative values, and members of the LGBTQ+ community say they face discrimination in everyday life. The government and state agencies are also historically conservative, and advocates for gender equality had a hard time pushing lawmakers and civil servants to accept change. Bangkok Deputy Governor Sanon Wangsrangboon said last week that the city officials will be ready to register same-sex marriages as soon as the law gets enacted. The legislation amended the country's Civil and Commercial Code to replace gender-specific words such as 'men and women' with gender-neutral words such as 'individual.' The government led by the Pheu Thai party has made marriage equality one of its main goals. It made a major effort to identify itself with the annual Bangkok Pride parade in June, in which thousands of people celebrated in one of Bangkok's busiest commercial districts. The organizers of Bangkok Pride announced on Facebook that it will organize a wedding for couples who wish to register their marriage on the very first day that the law becomes effective.	https://www.voanews.com/a/same-sex-couples-in-thailand-to-legally-wed-starting-january/7796439.html	2024-09-24T08:47:22-07:00

UN accuses Russia of systematic torture of Ukrainian civilians, prisoners	GENEVA — Investigators at the United Nations accuse Russia of using torture and sexual violence with impunity against Ukrainian citizens and prisoners of war in occupied Ukrainian territories and in the Russian Federation. The Independent International Commission of Inquiry on Ukraine submitted its latest update on the situation in Ukraine on Monday to the U.N. Human Rights Council, which continued a review of its findings during an interactive dialogue on Tuesday. In his oral presentation, commission chair Erik Mose told the council that men were most of the victims subjected to torture, and that new evidence shows that sexual violence is used as a means of torture 'mainly against male victims in detention, and of rapes targeting women in villages under Russian control.' 'The wide geographic spread of locations where torture was committed, and the prevalence of shared patterns, demonstrate that torture has been used as a common and acceptable practice by Russian authorities, with a sense of impunity,' Mose said, adding that the latest findings reaffirm previous reports that torture committed by Russian authorities has been 'widespread and systematic.' 'Our recent investigations show that Russian authorities have committed torture in Ukrainian regions where they have taken control of territories. This reinforces the finding that torture has been widespread,' Mose said. The commission has identified several common elements in the use of torture by Russian authorities, 'reinforcing its earlier finding that this was systematic.' It notes that similar forms of torture were practiced in detention centers where detainees from Ukraine have been held in the Russian Federation, as well as in large penitentiary centers in occupied areas of Ukraine. Another common element emerging from the evidence points toward a coordinated use of personnel from specific services of the Russian Federation 'who are involved in torture in all the detention facilities' investigated by the commission. 'A further common feature is the recurrent use of sexual violence as a form of torture in almost all these detention centers,' Mose said. Russia boycotted the meeting, refusing to respond to the commission’s report as a concerned country. Russia had its supporters, however, several of whom disproved of the report. Belarus called the commission’s accusations 'false and unsubstatiated by facts' and invited specialized national organizations 'to study the situation on the ground for themselves.' Eritrea, Syria and Venezuela echoed these sentiments, as did the representative of North Korea, who described 'the Ukraine incident' as one of the big geopolitical crises facing the world today and 'a direct product of the confrontation of the West against the Russian Federation.' Most of the other countries participating in the interactive dialogue condemned Russia’s blatant defiance of the U.N. Charter and international law. They demanded that Russia 'cease its illegal, unprovoked and unjustified war of aggression,' including the relentless airstrikes against Ukrainian civilians and critical infrastructure. Michele Taylor, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, thanked the commission for its detailed work in 'documenting Russia’s violations of international law in Ukraine.' 'Since Russia’s brutal, full-scale invasion of Ukraine, we have seen over and over again credible reports that Russia targets civilian objects in violation of international humanitarian law. 'The effects of Russia’s brutal attacks in Putin’s war of choice are severe,' she said, adding that more must be done 'to hold those who commit any such acts accountable and ensure justice for the victims.' Ukrainians personally involved in Putin’s 'war of choice' welcomed the commission’s findings. Ukraine’s prosecutor general, Andriy Kostin, underscored the importance of ensuring justice and accountability for torture, sexual violence and other 'atrocities that Russia has brought to Ukraine’s soil' 10 years after Russia invaded Ukraine, and over two years after its full-scale aggression on Ukraine. 'Thousands of Ukrainian captives, including civilians and particularly children, are forcibly detained by Russia in the temporarily occupied territories of Ukraine and in Russia in particular,' Kostin said. 'I am grateful to the U.N. Commission of Inquiry for maintaining an investigative focus on the systematic torture of Ukrainian prisoners of war in Russian captivity and increasing reports of their summary execution,' which he said 'amount to war crimes and potentially other crimes under international law.' Dmytro Lubinets, Ukrainian parliament commissioner for human rights, also expressed his gratitude to the commission for its work in preparing evidence for international judicial bodies and paving the way 'for bringing the perpetrators' of crimes against his people to justice. 'Unfortunately, due to the unprovoked Russian invasion, Ukraine has become a country where brutal crimes continue to be committed,' including the murder of civilians, deportation of children, executions of prisoners of war and massive missile attacks and destruction of civilian infrastructure. 'I urge you to continue your work despite all the difficulties,' Lubinets said, noting that the documentation of crimes, victims’ testimonies and facts are the basis 'for ensuring the proper international justice that Ukraine needs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-accuses-russia-of-systematic-torture-of-ukrainian-civilians-prisoners/7796351.html	2024-09-24T07:49:51-07:00	
Ancient coastal city in Egypt feels impact of changing climate	Egypt’s second-largest city, Alexandria, lies in the Eastern Mediterranean, a top climate change hotspot that has dealt with record global air and ocean temperatures this year.

Heavy rains lash Cayman Islands as southeast US prepares for major hurricane	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Heavy rains lashed the Cayman Islands on Tuesday as forecasters warned that a nearby cluster of thunderstorms could soon become a major hurricane en route to the southeast U.S. Hurricane watches were in effect for Florida's Tampa Bay and from Englewood to Indian Pass, as well as for eastern Mexico from Cabo Catoche to Tulum and for Cuba's Pinar del Rio province. Hurricane conditions could be possible in parts of Cuba and Mexico early Wednesday and in parts of Florida late Wednesday and early Thursday, according to the National Hurricane Center. The disturbance would then move 'over extremely deep and warm waters' that would fuel its intensification. 'Conditions look quite favorable for strengthening over the eastern Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday and Thursday,' the center said. 'This system will become quite large and powerful before landfall.' The disturbance is expected to become Tropical Storm Helene on Tuesday and then strengthen into a Category 3 hurricane before approaching the northeast Gulf Coast. Since 2000, eight major hurricanes have made landfall in Florida, according to Philip Klotzbach, a Colorado State University hurricane researcher. Given the anticipated large size, storm surge, wind and rain will extend far from the center of the expected storm, especially on the east side. The center warned of 'inland penetration of strong winds over parts of the southeastern United States after landfall.' A tropical storm warning was in effect for Grand Cayman; for eastern Mexico from Rio Lagartos to Tulum; and for Cuba's Artemisa, Pinar del Rio and the Isle of Youth. Meanwhile, a storm surge watch was in effect for Florida's Tampa Bay, Charlotte Harbor and from Indian Pass south to Flamingo. A tropical storm watch was issued for Dry Tortugas, the Lower Keys west of the Seven Mile Bridge, Flamingo to the south of Englewood and from west of Indian Pass to the Walton Bay county line. The National Weather Service in Tallahassee, Florida, urged people to take potential evacuations seriously. '10-15ft of surge is NOT survivable,' it wrote on the social media platform X. On Monday, Gov. Ron DeSantis declared a state of emergency in 41 counties. The disturbance was expected to strengthen into a major hurricane as it approaches the northeast Gulf Coast on Thursday. It was located about 150 miles (240 kilometers) west of Grand Cayman. It had maximum sustained winds of 35 mph (55 kph) and was moving northwest at 9 mph (15 kph). Officials in the Cayman Islands shuttered schools and airports as forecasters warned of heavy wind and rain and waves of up to 10 feet (3 meters). 'The current conditions present significant risk, and we must prioritize our safety,' said Ian Yearwood with the Royal Cayman Islands Police Service. Meanwhile, many in Cuba worried about the disturbance, whose tentacles are expected to reach the capital of Havana, which is struggling with a severe shortage of water and piles of uncollected garbage. Overall, roughly 600,000 people in Cuba are experiencing water shortages, including more than 130,000 in Havana alone. Chronic power outages also persist. The disturbance is expected to slip through waters separating Cuba from Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula late Tuesday and then head north to the Gulf Coast. Up to 8 inches of rain is forecast for western Cuba and the Cayman Islands with isolated total of some 12 inches (30 centimeters). Up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain is expected for the eastern Yucatán Peninsula, with isolated total of more than 6 inches (15 centimeters) inches. Heavy rainfall also is forecast for the southeast U.S. starting on Wednesday, threatening flash and river flooding, according to the National Hurricane Center. Up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain was forecast for the region, with isolated totals of 10 inches (25 centimeters). A storm surge of up to 15 feet (5 meters) was forecast from Ochlockonee River, Florida, to Chassahowitzka, and up to 10 feet (3 meters) from Chassahowitzka to Anclote River and from Indian Pass to Ochlockonee River. Helene would be the eighth named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season that runs from June 1 to Nov. 30. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted an above-average Atlantic hurricane season this year because of record-warm ocean temperatures. It forecast 17 to 25 named storms, with four to seven major hurricanes of Category 3 or higher.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-rains-lash-cayman-islands-as-southeast-us-prepares-for-major-hurricane-/7796274.html	2024-09-24T06:51:26-07:00	
US Navy ship operating in Mideast damaged in incident, officials say	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A U.S. Navy replenishment ship operating in the Middle East sustained damage in an incident which is under investigation, officials said Tuesday. The damage to the USNS Big Horn comes after the oiler had supplied the USS Abraham Lincoln strike group and remained in the region amid heightened tensions over the Israel-Hamas war and Israel's ongoing strikes targeting Hezbollah in Lebanon. A U.S. Navy official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss matters yet to be made public, said the damage happened in the Mideast, but declined to elaborate on its location. 'All crew members are safe, and we’re assessing the situation, and we’ll provide additional information at a later time,' the official said. There was no sign of an oil leak from the vessel. Another U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity for the same reason, said the vessel was being supported by private tugboats and an assessment was still ongoing for the vessel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-navy-ship-operating-in-mideast-damaged-in-incident-officials-say/7796235.html	2024-09-24T06:22:51-07:00	
To preserve sea power, US looks to Japan for help	Tokyo — U.S. naval dominance, unchallenged for decades, is now coming under strain as China’s state-backed shipbuilding industry rapidly expands, while the U.S. Navy faces severe maintenance delays. The impact is being felt across the Navy. While some ships and submarines are stuck waiting for repairs at overcrowded U.S. shipyards, others are forced into extended deployments, pushing crews and vessels to their limits. Analysts say the delays undermine the U.S. ability to project strength and deter conflict, especially in key areas like the Taiwan Strait and South China Sea, where China is upsetting the status quo. To help fix the problem, the U.S. is turning to its allies — particularly Japan, one of the world’s largest shipbuilders. Earlier this year, U.S. and Japanese officials began negotiating a plan to expand Japan’s role in performing major repairs on U.S. Navy vessels at its shipyards. Rahm Emanuel, U.S. ambassador to Japan, sees the proposal as crucial for keeping U.S. ships in the region. 'The Indo-Pacific is an away game for us…but with allies, it’s closer to a home game,' Emanuel told VOA. The discussions underscore Japan’s broader shift toward a more active regional security role, as it steps away from decades of pacifism. It’s also part of a strategy by the U.S. to encourage its Asian allies to take on greater security responsibilities in the face of China’s rising influence. However, the proposal faces major hurdles. In the U.S., legal changes would be needed to allow foreign shipyards to overhaul Navy vessels. In Japan, there are concerns about becoming a bigger target for China. Severe backlog But for the U.S. Navy, the challenge is severe. According to the Congressional Research Service (CRS), about a third of the U.S. attack submarine fleet is currently out of service, either undergoing maintenance or awaiting repairs. Fewer than 40% of the Navy’s scheduled ship repairs are completed on time, according to recent congressional testimony. By some estimates, the Navy is 20 years behind in maintenance work. A wide range of key shipbuilding projects are also running years behind schedule — an 'extraordinary situation' in the post-World War II history of the Navy, according to CRS. Emanuel argues this reflects a broader decline in the U.S. defense industrial base, which has been hollowed out since the 1990s and is 'not ready' to meet U.S. security needs. 'Every weapon that we’ve agreed to here, I’ve had to renegotiate the contract once it’s signed because we can’t meet the budget at the timeline,' Emanuel said. 'It's really bad planning [and] really bad preparation.' According to a recent CRS report, the Navy's repair backlog is caused by a shortage of skilled workers and limited capacity at the four U.S. government-run naval shipyards. China challenge Meanwhile, China boasts 20 large shipyards, which it is using to quickly build up what is already the world's largest navy in terms of overall vessels. According to a recent unclassified slide released by U.S. naval intelligence, China’s shipbuilding capacity is over 200 times that of the United States, fueled by generous government subsidies. Even though the U.S. still maintains significant naval advantages — such as 11 aircraft carriers compared to China’s three and an unrivaled network of global alliances — some observers believe that China’s ability to dwarf U.S. shipbuilding represents a fundamental shift in the regional balance of power. 'We’ve let that underlying capacity atrophy to the point where we’re behind the eight ball at the moment, and that’s a big, thorny problem,' said Sam Byers, the senior national security advisor at the Washington D.C.-based Center for Maritime Strategy. Benefits and drawbacks In Emanuel’s estimation, the U.S.-Japan ship repair proposal could alleviate the U.S. Navy’s maintenance backlog, freeing U.S. shipyards to focus on meeting their construction goals. It would also allow U.S. ships to stay for longer in Asia, he said. But not everyone agrees. Bryan Clark, a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute, argues that the problem isn’t a lack of shipyard capacity but rather their inconsistent use, due to fluctuating demand from the Navy. He suggests that repairing more ships overseas could help manage these fluctuations and minimize disruptions for Japan-based crews. 'And repair yards in Japan could gain experience working on U.S. ships, which could be beneficial in a conflict,' he added. However, he cautioned that shifting work overseas wouldn’t solve the underlying issues of funding and planning that contribute to the Navy’s repair delays. 'Of course, the Japanese ship repair yards may do a better job or be more efficient than their American counterparts. If that is the argument, then U.S. officials should make that clear,' Clark said. Others in the shipbuilding industry have argued against what they see as outsourcing U.S. Navy shipbuilding and repairs, a step they characterize as 'kicking American shipyard workers to the curb.' Japan risks There are also barriers in Japan, where public opinion doesn’t always align with the government’s more assertive security stance. While certain segments of the Japanese public appear more supportive of increased military involvement after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, it’s unclear how deep or lasting this shift is, warned Misato Matsuoka, an associate professor at Teikyo University. 'There is this gap of understanding when it comes to what is going on in the security area,' Matsuoka said. 'I don’t see a lot of Japanese who are even aware of these changes.' Matsuoka also warned that the U.S.-Japan ship repair proposal could eventually be seen as one of many factors escalating U.S.-China tensions, potentially impacting Japan negatively. 'All the things Japan is doing makes it more important within the U.S. alliance but that also increases the risk of something happening to Japanese territory,' said Robert Ward, Japan Chair at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. While Japan deepens ties with the U.S., it is careful not to provoke China, Ward noted. Nonetheless, Japan, like many countries, remains wary of what it sees as China’s destabilizing behavior in the region. 'This isn’t happening in a vacuum,' Ward said, referring to Japan's changing security posture. 'There are very good reasons why all this is happening.' When it comes to the U.S.-Japan ship repair deal, the choices are also complex for the United States, Emanuel acknowledged. However, he argued, sometimes 'you’ve got to choose between what’s bad and what’s worse.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/to-preserve-sea-power-us-looks-to-japan-for-help-/7796121.html	2024-09-24T05:57:14-07:00

Sri Lanka's new leader appoints cabinet ahead of expected snap polls	Colombo, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka's new leftist president appointed his Cabinet Tuesday ahead of an expected snap parliamentary election as he prepares to renegotiate the bankrupt island nation's unpopular International Monetary Fund bailout program. Self-avowed Marxist Dissanayake of the People's Liberation Front (JVP) was sworn into office on Monday after a landslide win in weekend presidential polls. His once-marginal party currently has just three lawmakers in Sri Lanka's 225-member parliament. But support for the 55-year-old surged after a 2022 economic meltdown that immiserated millions of ordinary Sri Lankans and the painful implementation of the IMF rescue plan. On Tuesday his office announced the appointment of lawmaker Harini Amarasuriya, 54, as premier with the additional portfolios of justice, education, health and labor. The sociology lecturer, who was first elected to parliament four years ago, is known for her activism on gender equality and minority rights issues. She and the remaining two JVP-aligned lawmakers will share all ministerial responsibilities between them, and also act as caretaker ministers after parliament is dissolved. 'We will have the smallest Cabinet in the history of Sri Lanka,' party member Namal Karunaratne told reporters on Tuesday. 'Parliament dissolution will happen thereafter. It could be within the next 24 hours.' Sri Lanka's crisis proved an opportunity for Dissanayake, who saw his popularity rise after pledging to change the island's 'corrupt' political culture. He beat 38 other candidates to win Saturday's presidential vote, taking more than 1.2 million more votes than his nearest rival. His predecessor Ranil Wickremesinghe, who had imposed steep tax hikes and other unpopular austerity measures under the terms of the $2.9 billion IMF bailout, came a distant third. The IMF offered its congratulations to Dissanayake on Monday, saying it was ready to discuss the future of the rescue plan. 'We look forward to working together with President Dissanayake... towards building on the hard-won gains that have helped put Sri Lanka on a path to economic recovery,' a spokesman from the lender of last resort said. 'Not a magician' A senior aide of the new president told AFP on the weekend that Dissayanake's party would not repudiate the IMF deal. 'Our plan is to engage with the IMF and introduce certain amendments,' Bimal Ratnayake said. 'We will not tear up the IMF program. It is a binding document, but there is a provision to renegotiate.' In his first address after his inauguration, Dissayanake sought to lower expectations of a quick fix for the country's economic woes. 'I am not a conjuror, I am not a magician, I am a common citizen,' he said. 'I have strengths and limitations, things I know and things I don't,' he added. 'My responsibility is to be part of a collective effort to end this crisis.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-s-new-leader-appoints-cabinet-ahead-of-expected-snap-polls-/7796113.html	2024-09-24T04:45:36-07:00	
German economy expected to contract again in 2024, say sources	Berlin — Germany's leading economic institutes have downgraded their forecast for 2024 and now see Europe's largest economy shrinking by 0.1%, people familiar with the figures from the autumn joint economic forecast told Reuters on Tuesday. Germany's economy was the weakest among its large euro zone peers last year with a 0.3% contraction. Even with inflation on a downward trend, consumption remains weak and high energy costs, feeble global orders and high interest rates are still taking their toll. The latest economic data paint a gloomy picture. German business morale fell for a fourth straight month in September and by more than expected, a survey showed on Tuesday. Data earlier this week showed German business activity contracted in September at the sharpest pace in seven months, putting the economy on track to notch up a second consecutive quarter of falling output. The economic institutes have also slashed their forecasts for the coming years, according to the sources. The growth forecast for 2025 has been cut to 0.8% from 1.4%, and for 2026, the institutes envisage growth of 1.3%, the sources said. The institutes' joint economic forecast is due to be published on Thursday, meaning the figures could still change slightly before then. The economy ministry incorporates the combined estimates from the institutes — Ifo, DIW, IWH, IfW and RWI — into its own predictions. According to its latest forecast, the German government expects the economy to grow 0.3% this year. An update is due in October.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-economy-expected-to-contract-again-in-2024-say-sources-/7796098.html	2024-09-24T04:26:07-07:00	
New global poll finds South Africans feel among least safe	Johannesburg — A new global Gallup poll released Tuesday shows South Africa is one of the countries where citizens feel the least safe walking alone. Bartender Gugu Xakaza, 32, was mugged by two men while walking home from the grocery store one day. She said that was the last time she risked walking anywhere alone. 'I’d never walk around these streets, firstly you know because South Africa’s crime status is very high, and also it’s not just safe for a woman to be walking alone at night, because obviously we might be taken advantage of…. so rather be safe than sorry,' she said. She is not alone. Karabo Faith, 23, said she no longer walks anywhere by herself. 'I almost, almost got mugged at night… we were walking, going home,' she said. 'So, this other guy was like, ‘Hey, give us your phone.’ Then luckily these police officers came through, so they never took our phones. But we were scared.' The latest Gallup poll on global safety asked people in 140 countries how safe they felt walking alone. Some 70% of South Africans responded that they did not feel safe, ranking in the bottom three countries, which also included Ecuador and Liberia. Gallup is a global analytics and advisory firm. Gallup’s Julie Ray said sub-Saharan Africa has had low rankings in the annual poll for years. And feelings of safety have declined more here than in any other region. 'The region has ranked amongst the least safe in terms of people’s perceptions for almost two decades,' Ray said. By contrast, citizens in Kuwait, Singapore and Norway said they felt the safest, with between only 8% and 1% feeling unsafe. Women in South Africa typically feel less safe than men, Ray said. Confidence in police in sub-Saharan Africa is also lower than average, she said. Asked for comment on the report, Athlenda Mathe, spokesperson for the South African Police Services, said they were working on heightening police visibility. 'We are making inroads in clamping down on all forms of criminality and the main goal is to ensure that we make South Africa a much better and safer place to live in, so that people can walk freely,' Mathe said. South Africa has notoriously high crime rates. According to the latest police statistics, between April and June alone more than 6,000 murders and 9,000 rapes were recorded, for rates of 10 per 100,000 population and 15 per 100,000, respectively.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-global-poll-finds-south-africans-feel-among-least-safe-/7796025.html	2024-09-24T03:27:44-07:00	
Sweden accuses Iran of hacking messaging service after Koran burnings	STOCKHOLM — Swedish authorities said on Tuesday that Iran hacked into a text messaging service last year and sent thousands of messages urging Swedes to take revenge against Koran burners. In 2023, individuals in Sweden on several occasions set fire to Islam's holy book in public, prompting outrage in the Muslim world and raising fears of attacks by jihadists. 'The security police is able to establish that a cyber group acted on behalf of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard to carry out an influence campaign,' the Swedish Security Service said in a statement. 'The purpose was, among other things, to paint the image of Sweden as an Islamophobic country and create division in society,' it said. Sweden last year raised its terrorism alert following the Koran burnings. In a separate statement, the Swedish Prosecution Authority said the investigation showed it was the Iranian state via the Iranian Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that carried out the data breach. The Swedish agency said it had identified the individual hackers carrying out the breach but would not press charges. 'Since the perpetrators are acting for a foreign power, in this case Iran, we make the assessment that the conditions for prosecution abroad or extradition to Sweden are lacking,' it said. Iran's embassy in Stockholm could not immediately be reached for comment. Iran's foreign ministry had no immediate comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-accuses-iran-of-hacking-messaging-service-after-koran-burnings-/7796051.html	2024-09-24T03:21:54-07:00

Pope asks for liberation of Myanmar's detained ex-leader Suu Kyi	ROME — Pope Francis has called for the liberation of Myanmar's detained former leader and Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi and offered the Vatican as a safe haven, the pontiff said in a recent conversation with Jesuits in Asia. 'I asked for the Ms Aung San Suu Kyi's release and received her son in Rome. I offered the Vatican to receive her in our territory,' he said in a private conversation during a recent 12-day tour across Southeast Asia. The 87-year old pontiff visited Myanmar in December 2017. Italian daily Corriere della Sera published the comments on Tuesday in an article by Father Antonio Spadaro, a Rome-based Jesuit priest who attends the meetings and writes about them afterwards with the pope's permission. 'The future of the (Myanmar) must be peace based on respect for the dignity and rights of all, on respect for a democratic order that allows everyone to contribute to the common good,' Pope Francis added. Myanmar's military government has ramped up killings and arrests in an apparent bid to silence opponents and recruit soldiers in an escalating conflict, a U.N. report said last week. Suu Kyi, 78, has been detained by the military since it overthrew her government in a 2021 coup. She faces 27 years in prison for crimes ranging from treason and bribery to violations of the telecommunications law, charges she denies. In April she was moved from prison to house arrest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-asks-for-liberation-of-myanmar-s-detained-ex-leader-suu-kyi/7795996.html	2024-09-24T01:00:00-07:00	
Kmart closes its last full-scale US store	NEW YORK — Attention, Kmart shoppers, the end is near! The erstwhile retail giant renowned for its Blue Light Specials — featuring a flashing blue orb affixed to a pole enticing shoppers to a flash sale — is shuttering its last full-scale store in mainland United States. The store, located in swank Bridgehampton, New York, on Long Island, is slated to close Oct. 20, according to Denise Rivera, an employee who answered the phone at the store late Monday. The manager wasn't available, she said. That will leave only a small Kmart store in Miami. It has a handful of stores in Guam and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Transformco, the company that bought the assets of Sears and Kmart out of the bankruptcy of Sears Holdings in 2019, did not immediately respond to an email requesting comment. In its heyday, there were more than 2,000 Kmarts in the U.S. Struggling to compete with Walmart’s low prices and Target’s trendier offerings, Kmart filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early 2002 — becoming the largest U.S. retailer to take that step — and announced it would close more than 250 stores. A few years later, hedge fund executive Edward Lampert combined Sears and Kmart and pledged to return them to their former greatness. But the 2008 recession and the rising dominance of Amazon contributed in derailing that mission. Sears filed for Chapter 11 in 2018 and now has just a handful of stores left in the U.S., where it once had thousands.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kmart-closes-its-last-full-scale-us-store-/7795991.html	2024-09-24T00:45:43-07:00	
Some Japan PM hopefuls want to make hiring and firing workers easier	TOKYO — At least two candidates vying to become Japan's next prime minister are planning to tackle one of the country's most sacred political cows: labor market reforms that would make it easier for businesses to hire and fire workers. Shinjiro Koizumi, the 43-year-old son of former premier Junichiro Koizumi, and Taro Kono, who as digital minister is trying to promote more innovation, have both called for relaxing Japan's rigid labor rules. Those rules have been a feature of Japan's 'salary-man' corporate culture for decades, dating from when the country's post-war population was growing and its traditional labor model of lifetime employment was effective. But rigid labor rules have been more recently blamed for blocking the movement of labor from mature sectors into growing ones where employees are needed in a tight labor market. 'The ongoing labor market reform is missing the crux of the issue, and that's the revision to dismissal rules,' Koizumi said this month. 'An ultimate growth strategy is to create a system that fosters a labor shift to startups and small firms in growth sectors,' said Koizumi, who pledged to submit a labor reform bill next year if elected party leader. Kono specifically proposed establishing a monetary compensation framework for dismissed workers as a way to settle disputes, a step he said would allow more flexibility in the labor market. Overhauling dismissal rules is politically sensitive in Japan, having been repeatedly pushed back with little progress made in the past. International bodies such as the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) have also long blamed the lack of employment flexibility for Japan's low labor productivity, low rates of new business entries and income gap between regular and non-regular staff. On average, Japanese workers have been with their current employer for 12.3 years, compared to 4.1 years in the United States and 9.7 years in Germany. A Gallup poll found only 6% of Japanese workers engaged in their jobs compared to the 23% global average. The statutory law on dismissal is vague, but judicial precedents have established four criteria that have to be met, raising the bar high for layoffs, experts say. The rules, for example, require the company to prove that there is an economic need to decrease its workforce and all efforts have been made to avoid dismissals when firing employees. 'The biggest issue is that these rules are based on judicial precedents decades ago,' said Kotaro Kurashige, a lawyer who specializes in labor issues. Japan's Liberal Democratic Party, which has a parliamentary majority, will elect a new leader on Sept. 27, with the winner to replace outgoing Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. A record nine candidates are running in the race. As in the past, the policy pledges by Koizumi and Kono have sparked heavy backlash on social media and from labor unions, as well as from conservative lawmakers worried such changes could increase layoffs. 'I strongly object to any relaxation of rules that allow companies to freely fire workers,' Tomoko Yoshino, the president of Japan's largest labor organization Rengo, said in an emergency study session last week. Some also doubt the validity of the argument that relaxed dismissal rules would help rejuvenate the economy. 'It may not be true that relaxed rules would promote a shift of labor to growth sectors and overall wage growth, as dismissed workers may end up with low-paying jobs,' Takuya Hoshino, economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute, said. The negative reactions have forced Koizumi to water down his pledge and shift his focus more to increasing support for workers to acquire skills and find new jobs, initiatives already launched by the Kishida administration. Still, proponents say the opportunity for reform is now greater than in the past, as Japan exits years of deflation with companies delivering the biggest wage hikes in three decades this year and the jobless rate consistently below 3%. Suntory Holdings CEO Takeshi Niinami, one of the leading voices of corporate Japan, welcomed the issue coming up during the ruling party leadership race. 'Those rules were created during the manufacturing-centered postwar economic boom and must be reviewed,' said Niinami, who also serves as chair of the Keizai Doyukai business lobby. It's good timing for such discussion as labor shortages and tougher competition for talent have begun to push up wages, he said. 'I want new-generation leaders to discuss how to change all postwar frameworks without any taboo.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/some-japan-pm-hopefuls-want-to-make-hiring-and-firing-workers-easier/7795986.html	2024-09-24T00:26:35-07:00	
Rare graft case grips Singapore, ex-transport minister pleads guilty	SINGAPORE — Singapore's former Transport Minister S. Iswaran has pleaded guilty to receiving gifts while in office, local media reported, as proceedings began on Tuesday in a rare graft trial involving a state official in this Asian financial hub. The case, which charges Iswaran with receiving favors that includes tickets to English Premier League soccer matches and to the Singapore Formula 1 Grand Prix, has gripped the wealthy city-state which prides itself on having a well-paid and efficient bureaucracy as well as strong governance. Iswaran, who joined the cabinet in 2006, is the first Singaporean minister to be tried in court. The 62-year-old was arrested in July last year and was accused of taking kickbacks worth hundreds of thousands of dollars from property tycoon Ong Beng Seng. Iswaran was advisor to the Grand Prix's steering committee, while Ong owns the rights to the race. Ong has not been charged with any offense and Iswaran had previously rejected the allegations when he resigned from the cabinet. In court, he pleaded guilty to the charges of obstructing justice and of a public servant accepting anything of value without payment, or with inadequate payment, from a person with whom he is involved in an official capacity, Channel NewsAsia (CNA) reported, instead of the charges that include corruption. In a surprise move, prosecutors reduced the charges facing Iswaran to five from 35. The remaining 30 charges will be taken into consideration for sentencing, it added. The charge of accepting gifts carries a jail term of up to two years and a fine. For obstructing justice, Iswaran can be sentenced to jail of up to seven years and a fine. However, the prosecution asked for a much lighter sentence of six to seven months in jail, while the defense is asking for eight weeks, according to CNA. The prosecution said Iswaran had obtained, from two local businessmen, gifts worth a total value of $312,440. Iswaran has paid his financial gains of roughly $315,000 in full to the state, they added. 'The accused obtained all of the gifts for himself, some of which he then distributed to family, friends and others,' the prosecution said. The last corruption case involving a Singaporean minister was in 1986, when the national development minister was investigated for allegedly accepting bribes. He died before he could be charged in court. Singapore was among the world's top 5 least corrupt countries last year, according to Transparency International's corruption perception index.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rare-graft-case-grips-singapore-ex-transport-minister-pleads-guilty-/7795981.html	2024-09-24T00:07:39-07:00	
Climate goal to triple global renewable energy by 2030 within reach, IEA says	LONDON — A goal to triple global renewable energy capacity by 2030 and cut fossil fuel use is within reach, the International Energy Agency said in a report on Tuesday, but will require a huge push to unlock bottlenecks such as permitting and grid connections. The report comes as leaders from government and business come together at New York Climate week to try to drive forward action against climate change. Almost 200 countries at the COP 28 climate summit in Dubai last year agreed to reach net zero emissions from the energy sector by 2050 and pledged to triple renewable energy capacity like wind and solar. The IEA said the renewable energy goal 'is within reach thanks to favorable economics, ample manufacturing potential and strong policies,' but said more renewable capacity by itself would not slash fossil fuel use and reduce costs for consumers. 'To unlock the full benefits of the tripling goal, countries need to make a concerted push to build and modernize 25 million kilometers of electricity grids by 2030... The world would also need 1,500 gigawatts (GW) of energy storage capacity by 2030,' the IEA said. Countries at COP 28 also pledged to double energy efficiency measures to help curb power use, but this target will require governments to make efficiency much more of a policy priority. Countries must embed the renewable and energy efficiency goals in their national plans to meet goals set under the Paris climate agreement, the IEA said. Emissions from the global energy sector hit a record high last year. Tripling renewable energy capacity and doubling energy efficiency measures to reduce power use could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by 10 billion metric tons by the end of the decade compared with what is otherwise expected, the report said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/climate-goal-to-triple-global-renewable-energy-by-2030-within-reach-iea-says/7795977.html	2024-09-23T23:56:38-07:00

China unveils broad stimulus measures to revive sputtering economy	BEIJING — China's central bank on Tuesday announced broad monetary stimulus and property market support measures to revive an economy grappling with strong deflationary pressures and in danger of missing this year's growth target. The broader-than-expected package marks the latest attempt by Chinese officials to restore confidence in the world's second-largest economy after a slew of disappointing data in recent months. But analysts noted the absence of any policies aimed at supporting real economic activity. Given weak credit demand from businesses and consumers, more fiscal stimulus may be needed to complement the moves announced by the People's Bank of China for growth to return to a trajectory towards this year's roughly 5% target. 'This is the most significant PBOC stimulus package since the early days of the pandemic,' said Capital Economics analyst Julian Evans-Pritchard. 'But on its own, it may not be enough.' Chinese stocks and bonds rallied and Asian stocks hit 2-1/2 year highs as Governor Pan Gongsheng announced plans to lower borrowing costs and inject more liquidity into the economy, as well as to ease households' mortgage repayment burden. Pan told a news conference the central bank in the near future will cut the amount of cash that banks must hold as reserves - known as reserve requirement ratios (RRR) - by 50 basis points (bps). That would free up about $142 billion for new lending. Depending on the market liquidity situation later this year, the RRR may be further lowered by 0.25-0.5 percentage points, Pan said. The PBOC will also cut the seven-day repo rate, its new benchmark, by 0.2 percentage points to 1.5%. The interest rate on the medium-term lending facility will drop by about 30 basis points, and loan prime rates by 20-25 bps. 'The move probably comes a bit too late, but it is better late than never,' said Gary Ng, senior economist at Natixis. 'China needs a lower-rate environment to boost confidence.' Pan did not specify when the moves will come into effect. The property market support package included a 50 bps reduction on average interest rates for existing mortgages, and a reduction of the minimum downpayment requirement to 15% on all types of homes, among other measures. China's property market has been in a severe downturn since peaking in 2021. A string of developers have defaulted, leaving behind large inventories of unwanted apartments and a troubling list of uncompleted projects. Beijing has removed many home purchase restrictions and sharply lowered mortgage rates and downpayment requirements in response, but has so far failed to revive demand or arrest slumping home prices, which fell in August at the sharpest pace in more than nine years. The property crisis has weighed heavily on the economy and crippled consumer confidence, given that 70% of household savings are parked in real estate. The PBOC also introduced two new tools to boost the capital market. The first - a swap program sized at an initial $71 billion - allows funds, insurers and brokers easier access to funding in order to buy stocks; and the second provides up to $42.5 billion in cheap PBOC loans to commercial banks to help them fund other entities' share purchases and buybacks. August economic data broadly missed expectations, adding urgency for policymakers to roll out more support. On the fiscal side, local governments have been quickening bond issuance to help fund infrastructure projects, but analysts say more may be needed. 'An aggressive fiscal policy is required to inject genuine economic demand,' ANZ analysts said in a note on the PBOC moves, which they described as 'far from being a bazooka.' Investment banks including Goldman Sachs, Nomura, UBS and Bank of America have recently cut their 2024 growth forecasts. The latest Chinese measures come after the U.S. Federal Reserve last week delivered a hefty rate cut, allowing the PBOC to ease monetary conditions without putting too much pressure on the yuan. 'There is still room for further easing in the months ahead as most global central banks are now on a rate-cut trajectory,' said Lynn Song, chief economist for greater China at ING. 'If we see a large fiscal policy push as well, momentum could recover heading into the fourth quarter.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-unveils-broad-stimulus-measures-to-revive-sputtering-economy/7795961.html	2024-09-23T22:35:12-07:00

US commits to defense support for Taiwan as defense industry conference begins	state department — The United States has pledged to continue providing Taiwan with equipment and services essential for maintaining a self-defense capability in line with the threats it faces. This statement came as an annual U.S.-Taiwan defense industry conference kicked off Sunday in Philadelphia. In the lead-up to the event, the conference organizer — the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council (USTBC) — was targeted by a phishing cyberattack involving a forged registration form embedded with information-stealing malware. Despite the hackers' attempt, the council — a nonprofit trade association founded in 1976 to promote commerce between the U.S. and Taiwan — thwarted the attack. The identity of the attackers remains unknown. 'As the council has been targeted by similar attacks for more than 20 years, we realized quickly that the document was suspicious,' USTBC said in a statement. The statement added that the council submitted the document to an online virus scanner, confirmed it was malicious and deleted it. This year’s U.S.-Taiwan Defense Industry Conference, which ends Tuesday, is the 23rd annual event in a series of conferences addressing U.S. defense cooperation with Taiwan. 'There will be considerable focus on how Taiwan's efforts to deter a Chinese attack are progressing ... and how U.S. industry should support the U.S. and Taiwan government policy,' said Rupert Hammond-Chambers, president of the U.S.-Taiwan Business Council. 'This is the most important annual gathering of U.S. industry and policymakers on U.S.-Taiwan defense relations,' he added. Taiwan Relations Act The State Department said that American officials' participation in the annual conference aligns with long-standing U.S. policy. Swift provision of equipment and services 'is essential for Taiwan’s self-defense, and we will continue to work with industry to support that goal,' a State Department spokesperson told VOA. 'We continue to have an abiding interest in maintaining peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait. Our 'One China' policy has not changed and remains guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, three joint communiques and six assurances,' the spokesperson added. The 1979 U.S.-China Joint Communique shifted diplomatic recognition from the Republic of China (ROC), Taiwan’s formal name, to the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Relations between the U.S. and Taiwan have since been governed by the Taiwan Relations Act, passed by Congress in April 1979, under which the U.S. provides defense equipment to Taiwan. The act states that 'any effort to determine the future of Taiwan by other than peaceful means, including by boycotts or embargoes,' is a threat to the peace and security of the Western Pacific area and of 'grave concern to the United States.' For decades, the U.S. has been clear that its decision to establish diplomatic relations with China in 1979 rested on the expectation that 'the future of Taiwan will be determined by peaceful means,' as stipulated in the Taiwan Relations Act. China has objected to the Taiwan Relations Act — a U.S. public law — and deemed it invalid. In 2022, the U.S. Congress authorized the president to direct the drawdown of up to $1 billion per fiscal year in Defense Department equipment and services for Taiwan. Since 2010, the State Department has authorized more than $38 billion in foreign military sales to Taiwan. PRC sanctioned nine US firms Since its establishment in 1949, the People’s Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan, but it views the democratically governed island as its own territory and has vowed to bring Taiwan under its control, even by force. In recent years, the PRC has frequently sent military vessels near Taiwan and warplanes into its air defense identification zone to pressure the island to accept Chinese sovereignty. Last week, China announced sanctions against nine American companies in response to U.S. defense equipment sales to Taiwan. Beijing’s latest action aims to exert additional pressure on Washington to halt its arms sales to the Taipei government. The sanctions followed the U.S. approval of an estimated $228 million package of spare parts and other hardware for Taiwan's aging air force. In Beijing, officials asserted that U.S. weapons sales to Taiwan undermine China’s sovereignty and security interests. 'China urges the U.S. to earnestly abide by the one China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiques and immediately stop the dangerous trend of arming Taiwan,' said Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during a recent briefing. 'We will take strong and resolute measures to firmly defend our national sovereignty, security and territorial integrity,' Lin added. The United States does not subscribe to the PRC’s 'one China principle,' the U.S. State Department said. 'The PRC continues to publicly misrepresent U.S. policy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-commits-to-defense-support-for-taiwan-as-defense-industry-conference-begins/7795538.html	2024-09-23T18:01:54-07:00	
$375 million US military aid package for Ukraine expected as soon as Wednesday	Pentagon — The U.S. military is expected to announce a new military aid package for Ukraine this week valued at up to $375 million, the largest aid sent to Kyiv since May. According to several U.S. officials, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity to discuss the package ahead of the announcement, the aid for Kyiv is expected to be announced as soon as Wednesday. One official told VOA the package is likely to include air-to-ground munitions for F-16 fighter jets, which would allow Ukrainian pilots to operate away from the front lines and Russia’s air defenses. The package also includes ammunition for HIMARS, patrol boats and armored vehicles, along with 155mm rounds, 105 mm rounds and TOW missiles, the official added. The package, which is still being finalized and could change, according to the U.S. officials, is being sent under the presidential drawdown authority that allows the Pentagon to send Ukraine aid directly from its American military stockpiles. The Pentagon has more than $5 billion left of the $61 billion in funding for Ukraine that was signed into law by President Joe Biden in April and could expire at the end of this month. The Pentagon says it is working with Congress to roll the remaining funding over to the next U.S. fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. The officials tell VOA they are working on contingency plans should Congress not approve the extension before the end of the fiscal year. The package is expected to be announced as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is set to meet with President Biden and Vice President and Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris this Friday at the White House. Officials say Zelenskyy will lay out his plan to end the war with Russia and push for restrictions on U.S.-provided missiles to be lifted. U.S. policy does not allow Ukraine to use U.S.-supplied weapons to fire on targets deep within Russian territory. The White House has expressed concerns that these strikes could draw the United States into direct conflict with Russia. Earlier this month, Zelenskyy told military allies meeting in Germany that his country needs the long-range capability to strike deep inside Russian territory 'so that Russia is motivated to seek peace.' The U.S. says that Russia has moved most of its aircraft and weapons out of range of Ukraine’s weapons, but Ukrainian officials are still interested in targeting supply lines and command centers closer to its border. Air Force General James Hecker, the commander of U.S. Air Forces in Europe and Africa, warned reporters last week that Russia’s military is now bigger and stronger than it was before invading Ukraine in February 2022. Despite Russian improvements on the battlefield, Ukraine has continued to put chinks in Russia’s armor, shooting down more than 100 Russian aircraft, which is dozens more aircraft than Russia has been able to down on the Ukrainian side, according to Hecker. 'So what we see is the aircraft are kind of staying on their own side of the line, if you will, and when that happens, you have a war like we're seeing today, with massive attrition, cities just being demolished, a lot of civilian casualties,' he said. The U.S. and Denmark have been training a small number of Ukrainian pilots on the F-16, but qualified Ukrainian pilots and open training slots have been limited.	https://www.voanews.com/a/million-us-military-aid-package-for-ukraine-expected-as-soon-as-wednesday/7795886.html	2024-09-23T17:54:18-07:00	
AI not yet a 'revolutionary influence tool,' US says	washington — Russia, Iran and China are not giving up on the use of artificial intelligence to sway American voters ahead of November’s presidential election even though U.S. intelligence agencies assess the use of AI has so far failed to revolutionize the election influence efforts. The new appraisal released late Monday from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence comes just more than 40 days before U.S. voters head to the polls. It follows what officials describe as a 'steady state' of influence operations by Moscow, Tehran and Beijing aimed at impacting the race between former Republican President Donald Trump and current Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as other statewide and local elections. 'Foreign actors are using AI to more quickly and convincingly tailor synthetic content,' said a U.S. intelligence official, who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss the latest findings. 'AI is an enabler,' the official added. 'A malign influence accelerant, not yet a revolutionary influence tool.' It is not the first time U.S. officials have expressed caution about how AI could impact the November election. A top official at the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the U.S. agency charged with overseeing election security, told VOA earlier this month that to this point the malicious use of AI has not been able to live up to some of the hype. 'Generative AI is not going to fundamentally introduce new threats to this election cycle,' said CISA senior adviser Cait Conley. 'What we're seeing is consistent with what we expected to see.' That does not mean, however, that U.S. adversaries are not trying. The new U.S. intelligence assessment indicates Russia, Iran and China have used AI to generate text, images, audio and video and distribute them across all major social media platforms. Russia, Iran and China have yet to respond to requests for comment. All three have previously rejected U.S. allegations regarding election influence campaigns. While U.S. intelligence officials would not say how many U.S. voters have been exposed to such malign AI products, there is reason to think that some of the efforts are, at least for the moment, falling short. 'The quality is not as believable as you might expect,' said the U.S. intelligence official. One reason, the official said, is because Russia, Iran and China have struggled to overcome restrictions built into some of the more advanced AI tools while simultaneously encountering difficulties developing their own AI models. There are also indications that all three U.S. adversaries have to this point failed to find ways to more effectively use AI to find and target receptive audiences. 'To do scaled AI operations is not cheap,' according to Clint Watts, a former FBI special agent and counterterror consultant who heads up the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center (MTAC). 'Some of the infrastructure and the resources of it [AI], the models, the data it needs to be trained [on] – very challenging at the moment,' Watts told a cybersecurity summit in Washington earlier this month. 'You can make more of everything misinformation, disinformation, but it doesn't mean they'll be very good.' In some cases, U.S. adversaries see traditional tactics, which do not rely on AI, as equally effective. For instance, U.S. intelligence officials on Monday said a video claiming that Vice President Harris injured a girl in a 2011 hit-and-run accident was staged by Russian influence actors, confirming an assessment last week by Microsoft. The officials also said altered videos showing Harris speaking slowly, also the result of Russian influence actors, could have been done without relying on AI. For now, experts and intelligence officials agree that when it comes to AI, Russia, Iran and China have settled on quantity over quality. Microsoft has tracked hundreds of instances of AI use by Russia, Iran and China over the past 14 months. And while U.S. intelligence officials would not say how much AI-generated material has been disseminated, they agree Russian-linked actors, especially, have been leading the way. 'These items include AI-generated content of and about prominent U.S. figures … consistent with Russia's broader efforts to boost the former president's candidacy and denigrate the vice president and the Democratic Party,' the U.S. intelligence official said, calling Russia one of the most sophisticated actors in knowing how to target American voters. Those efforts included an AI-boosted effort to spread disinformation with a series of fake web domains masquerading as legitimate U.S. news sites, interrupted earlier this month by the U.S. Department of Justice. Iran, which has sought to hurt the re-election bid by former President Trump, has also copied the Russian playbook, according to the new U.S. assessment, seeking to sow discord among U.S. voters. Tehran has also been experimenting, using AI to help spread its influence campaign not just in English, but also in Spanish, especially when seeking to generate anger among voters over immigration. 'One of the benefits of generative AI models is to overcome various language barriers,' the U.S. intelligence official said. 'So Iran can use the tools to help do that,' the official added, calling immigration 'obviously an issue where Iran perceives they could stoke discord.' Beijing, in some ways, has opted for a more sophisticated use of AI, according to the U.S. assessment, using it to generate fake news anchors in addition to fake social media accounts. But independent analysts have questioned the reach of China’s efforts under its ongoing operation known as 'Spamouflage.' A recent report by the social media analytics firm Graphika found that, with few exceptions, the Chinese accounts 'failed to garner significant traction in authentic online communities discussing the election.' U.S. intelligence officials have also said the majority of the Chinese efforts have been aimed not at Trump or Harris, but at state and local candidates perceived as hostile to Beijing. U.S. intelligence officials on Monday refused to say how many other countries are using AI in an effort to influence the outcome of the U.S. presidential election. Earlier this month, U.S. Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco said Washington was 'seeing more actors in this space acting more aggressively in a more polarized environment and doing more with technologies, in particular AI.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-not-yet-a-revolutionary-influence-tool-us-says-/7795863.html	2024-09-23T17:35:28-07:00

At UN: calls to implement new pact to address global challenges	united nations — Leaders at the United Nations urged implementation of a newly adopted blueprint for addressing a wide range of global challenges on Monday, the second and final day of the Summit of the Future. 'We cannot afford to wait any longer,' said Indonesia’s Foreign Minister Retno Marsudi. 'We must push for true and real reform – reform that listens to the voices of developing countries and addresses their concerns.' She emphasized that the summit’s Pact of the Future must not become 'a set of empty promises without tangible results on the ground.' 'Success of humanity lies in our collective strength, not in the battlefield,' said Indian Prime Minster Narendra Modi. 'And for global peace and development, reforms in global institutions are essential. Reform is the key to relevance.' The pact includes frameworks for promoting peace and security, sustainable development, digital cooperation, human rights and gender equality. Iran’s new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, made his U.N. debut at the summit, pledging that his administration is seeking to reduce inequality and empower women and youth. The country saw a wave of protests in 2022 and 2023 after the death of a young woman who died in police custody after being detained for not properly covering her head. In New York, protesters gathered outside Pezeshkian’s hotel ahead of his speech. A large protest is planned on Tuesday before his address to the General Assembly’s annual debate. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy used his turn at the podium to highlight Russia’s obstruction during the negotiations on the Pact for the Future. 'Ukraine supports efforts to keep all nations united, safe, and strictly adhere to the U.N. Charter,' he said. 'And you all can see who stands against it, but also actively works to undermine global unity.' In the final week of negotiations, Russia raised at least 15 different objections to elements of the text. As the assembly gathered to adopt the document on Sunday morning, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Vershinin, backed by a handful of countries, tried to get an amendment added to the pact, but it was overwhelmingly rejected by other nations. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken is expected to address the summit late Monday. On Tuesday, the assembly’s annual debate kicks off. U.S. President Joe Biden will make his farewell U.N. address. The presidents of Brazil, South Africa, Iran and Nigeria will be among the speakers. Afghan women On the margins of the General Assembly meeting, Afghan women advocated for their rights at an event focused on the inclusion of women in the future of Afghanistan. Last month, the Afghan Taliban enacted a 'morality law' that further erodes the rights of women and girls. Its restrictions include a prohibition on Afghan women using their voices in public and orders them to completely cover their bodies and faces outdoors. Women are also forbidden from interacting with non-Muslims, using public transport alone, and looking at men who are not their husband or blood relative. 'To all male leaders, what if it were the reverse? How would you feel to be banned from existing in society?' asked Asila Wardak, the former director general of Human Rights and Women’s International Affairs in Afghanistan’s Foreign Ministry. Acclaimed American actor Meryl Streep participated in the panel. She noted that historically Afghanistan was ahead of even some Western nations in giving its women the right to vote, and it had many female civil servants, judges, lawyers, doctors and teachers. 'Today in Kabul a female cat has more freedoms than a woman,' she said. 'A cat may go sit on her front stoop and feel the sun on her face. She may chase a squirrel into the park. A squirrel has more rights than a girl in Afghanistan today, because public parks are closed to women and girls by the Taliban.' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres demanded that the Taliban immediately remove all the discriminatory restrictions against women and girls and reopen schools and universities to them. Currently, Afghan girls are only allowed to attend school until grade 6. 'We will never allow gender-based discrimination to become normalized anywhere in the world,' Guterres said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-calls-to-implement-new-pact-to-address-global-challenges-/7795557.html	2024-09-23T15:54:08-07:00	
John rapidly strengthens into hurricane off southern Mexico's Pacific coast	MEXICO CITY — A tropical storm over the eastern Pacific Ocean intensified into a hurricane and was ripping toward Mexico's southern coast on Monday. Originally forecast as a tropical storm, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said that John had 'rapidly strengthened' into a hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 155 kph (100 mph). The storm was located 90 kilometers (55 miles) south of Punta Maldonado. It was moving north at 9 kph (6 mph). John was barreling forward as a category 2 hurricane, but was forecast to continue strengthening, possibly into a major category 4 hurricane before making landfall Tuesday. John's forecast path continued shifting so the point of landfall remained uncertain. The center said it could result in dangerous winds and storm surges, as well as 'life-threatening' flash floods in the Pacific coast near Oaxaca, a hub of resort towns. Things were tense in Oaxaca's coastal cities on Monday shortly after the announcement as residents and businesses were bracing themselves. Laura Velázquez, the federal coordinator of civil protection, told residents of Pacific coastal cities they should evacuate their homes and head to shelters in order to 'protect their and their family's lives.' 'It's very important that all citizens in the coastal zone ... take preventive measures,' Velázquez said. Meanwhile, hotels in the tourist hub of Puerto Escondido were awaiting instructions from authorities to begin evacuating tourists to transfer them to safer areas. Ana Aldai, a 33-year-old employee of a restaurant located on the shores of Playa Escondida, said that businesses in the area began closing after authorities ordered the suspension of all work on the area's main beaches. Videos on social media from Puerto Escondido showed flip-flop-clad tourists walking through heavy rain and fishermen pulling their boats out of the water. Strong rains in previous days have already left some roads in the region in a precarious position. Aldai said she was 'a little bit distressed' because notice from authorities came quickly. 'There was no opportunity to make the necessary purchases. That also distresses us,' she said. Mexican authorities were meeting Monday afternoon to plan their response to the hurricane. Through Thursday, John is expected to produce 15 to 30 centimeters (6 to 12 inches) of rain across coastal areas of Chiapas state with more in isolated areas. In areas along and near the Oaxaca coast to southeast Guerrero, between 25 and 50 centimeters (10 and 20 inches) of rain with isolated higher totals can be expected through Thursday. The hurricane is bleak news for the region, which last year was walloped by a similar rapidly intensifying hurricane. Hurricane Otis devastated the resort city of Acapulco, where residents had little warning of the strength of what was about to hit them. One of the most rapidly intensifying hurricanes ever seen, scientists at the time said it was a product of changing climate conditions. Otis blew out power in the city for days, left bodies scattered on the coast and desperate family members searching for lost loved ones. Much of the city was left in a state of lawlessness, with thousands scavenging in stores and scrambling for food and water.	https://www.voanews.com/a/john-rapidly-strengthens-into-hurricane-off-southern-mexico-s-pacific-coast-/7795558.html	2024-09-23T15:52:00-07:00	
Gunman who killed 10 at Colorado supermarket found guilty of murder	BOULDER, Colorado — A mentally ill man who killed 10 people at a Colorado supermarket in 2021 was convicted Monday of murder and faces life in prison. Defense attorneys did not dispute that Ahmad Alissa, who has schizophrenia, fatally shot 10 people including a police officer in the city of Boulder. But he pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, with the defense arguing he couldn't tell right from wrong at the time of the attack. In addition to 10 counts of first-degree murder, the jury found Alissa guilty of 38 charges of attempted murder, one count of assault, and six counts of possessing illegal, large-capacity magazines. First-degree murder carries a mandatory life sentence in Colorado. Sentencing in the case was set for later Monday, during which the victims and family were expected to address the court. Alissa did not visibly react as the judge began reciting the guilty verdicts against him. He sat at a table with his attorneys and appeared to trade notes with members of the defense team, speaking quietly at times with one of his attorneys. Judge Ingrid Bakke had warned against any outbursts. There were some tears and restrained crying on the victims' side of the courtroom as the murder convictions were read. The courtroom was packed largely with victims' families and police officers, including those who were shot at by Alissa. Several members of Alissa's family sat just behind him. Alissa started shooting immediately after getting out of his car in a grocery store parking lot in March 2021. He killed most of the victims in just more than a minute and surrendered after an officer shot him in the leg. Prosecutors had to prove Alissa was sane. They argued he didn't fire randomly and showed an ability to make decisions by pursuing people who were running and trying to hide from him. He twice passed by a 91-year-old man who continued to shop, unaware of the shooting. He came armed with steel-piercing bullets and illegal magazines that can hold 30 rounds of ammunition, which prosecutors said showed he took deliberate steps to make the attack as deadly as possible. Several members of Alissa's family, who immigrated to the United States from Syria, testified that he had become withdrawn and spoke less a few years before the shooting. He later began acting paranoid and showed signs of hearing voices, they said, and his condition worsened after he got COVID-19 in late 2020. Alissa was diagnosed with schizophrenia after the attack and experts said the behaviors described by relatives are consistent with the onset of the disease.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunman-who-killed-10-at-colorado-supermarket-found-guilty-of-murder/7795539.html	2024-09-23T15:28:18-07:00	
Short corn' could replace the towering cornfields steamrolled by a changing climate	wyoming, iowa — Taking a late-summer country drive in the Midwest means venturing into the corn zone, snaking between 12-foot-tall green, leafy walls that seem to block out nearly everything other than the sun and an occasional water tower. The skyscraper-like corn is a part of rural America as much as cavernous red barns and placid cows. But soon, that towering corn might become a miniature of its former self, replaced by stalks only half as tall as the green giants that have dominated fields for so long. 'As you drive across the Midwest, maybe in the next seven, eight, 10 years, you're going to see a lot of this out there,' said Cameron Sorgenfrey, an eastern Iowa farmer who has been growing newly developed short corn for several years, sometimes prompting puzzled looks from neighboring farmers. 'I think this is going to change agriculture in the Midwest.' The short corn developed by Bayer Crop Science is being tested on about 30,000 acres (12,141 hectares) in the Midwest with the promise of offering farmers a variety that can withstand powerful windstorms that could become more frequent due to climate change. The corn's smaller stature and sturdier base enable it to withstand winds of up to 50 mph — researchers hover over fields with a helicopter to see how the plants handle the wind. The smaller plants also let farmers plant at greater density, so they can grow more corn on the same amount of land, increasing their profits. That is especially helpful as farmers have endured several years of low prices that are forecast to continue. The smaller stalks could also lead to less water use at a time of growing drought concerns. U.S. farmers grow corn on about 90 million acres (36 million hectares) each year, usually making it the nation's largest crop, so it's hard to overstate the importance of a potential large-scale shift to smaller-stature corn, said Dior Kelley, an assistant professor at Iowa State University who is researching different paths for growing shorter corn. Last year, U.S. farmers grew more than 400 tons (363 metric tons) of corn, most of which was used for animal feed, the fuel additive ethanol or exported to other countries. 'It is huge. It's a big, fundamental shift,' Kelley said. Researchers have long focused on developing plants that could grow the most corn but recently there has been equal emphasis on other traits, such as making the plant more drought-tolerant or able to withstand high temperatures. Although there already were efforts to grow shorter corn, the demand for innovations by private companies such as Bayer and academic scientists soared after an intense windstorm — called a derecho — plowed through the Midwest in August 2020. The storm killed four people and caused $11 billion in damage, with the greatest destruction in a wide strip of eastern Iowa, where winds exceeded 100 mph. In cities such as Cedar Rapids, the wind toppled thousands of trees but the damage to a corn crop only weeks from harvest was especially stunning. 'It looked like someone had come through with a machete and cut all of our corn down,' Kelley said. Or as Sorgenfrey, the Iowa farmer who endured the derecho put it, 'Most of my corn looked like it had been steamrolled.' Although Kelley is excited about the potential of short corn, she said farmers need to be aware that cobs that grow closer to the soil could be more vulnerable to diseases or mold. Short plants also could be susceptible to a problem called lodging, when the corn tilts over after something like a heavy rain and then grows along the ground, Kelley said. Brian Leake, a Bayer spokesman, said the company has been developing short corn for more than 20 years. Other companies such as Stine Seed and Corteva also have been working for a decade or longer to offer short-corn varieties. While the big goal has been developing corn that can withstand high winds, researchers also note that a shorter stalk makes it easier for farmers to get into fields with equipment for tasks such as spreading fungicide or seeding the ground with a future cover crop. Bayer expects to ramp up its production in 2027, and Leake said he hopes that by later in this decade, farmers will grow short corn everywhere. 'We see the opportunity of this being the new normal across both the U.S. and other parts of the world,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/short-corn-could-replace-the-towering-cornfields-steamrolled-by-a-changing-climate-/7795526.html	2024-09-23T15:17:31-07:00

France’s new government gets to work amid anger on left, right	paris — After more than two months without a functioning government, France’s new cabinet got to work Monday. How long it will remain in office is unclear. French politics have been in limbo since inconclusive snap legislative elections in late June and early July. The elections saw a leftist coalition win the most votes and the far-right National Rally emerging as the largest party. Only now, after the Paris Olympics, has a new center-right government been named, which doesn’t include either of these two blocs. On national TV Sunday night, conservative Prime Minister Michel Barnier outlined some broad priorities. He called for controlling and limiting immigration, saying the number of migrants arriving in France had become unbearable. His new interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, strongly advocates tighter migration controls. Barnier also called for what he described as a 'national effort,' including taxes on the rich to cut the country’s budget deficit, which is well over the European Union limit. But he said he would not touch social changes like gay marriage and a recent move to enshrine abortion freedoms in the French constitution. Barnier’s new government is already feeling pressure. Thousands demonstrated in Paris even before his cabinet was named. Far-left politician Jean-Luc Melenchon warned Barnier’s government had no future — a warning picked up by the far right. The left has vowed a no-confidence motion, but analysts say it isn’t likely to succeed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-new-government-gets-to-work-amid-anger-on-left-right-/7795513.html	2024-09-23T14:57:47-07:00	
Jill Biden reveals $500 million plan that focuses on women's health at Clinton Global Initiative	NEW YORK — First lady Jill Biden is unveiling a new set of actions to address health inequities faced by women in the United States, plans that include spending at least $500 million annually on women's health research. Biden was making the announcement Monday while closing out the first day of this year's Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting in New York. The additional government spending will mainly come from the Department of Defense, which provides medical care to more than 230,000 active-duty military women and nearly 2 million military retirees, as well as their family members. The research will focus on why these women experience endocrine, hematological and other immunity-related disorders twice as often as men. 'Our nation is home to the best health research in the world, yet women's health is understudied and research is underfunded,' Biden said at a separate event on Friday. 'And we still know too little about how to effectively prevent, diagnose, and treat a range of health conditions in women, from heart disease to cancers.' The commitment was among the largest of the more than 100 expected at the two-day meeting of political, business and philanthropic leaders gathering to address some of the world's most pressing issues. Former President Bill Clinton, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and Clinton Foundation Vice Chair Chelsea Clinton have set this year's theme as 'What's Working,' a way to look for potential solutions and effective programs in tumultuous times. 'You don't look at a problem and say, 'That's impossible,’' Bill Clinton said in his opening remarks. 'You don't just throw up your hands. You roll up your sleeves.' An example of that strategy came from the announcement that a wide-ranging group of 15 nonprofits, humanitarian aid organizations and other funders will join forces to address the humanitarian crisis in Sudan following more than a year of conflict. The Coalition for Mutual Aid in Sudan — which includes The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Giving, Global Fund for Women, and The Unitarian Universalist Service Committee — will donate at least $2 million to mutual aid groups in the country by the end of the year. It also pledged to raise another $4.5 million for those groups within the next two years. Patricia McIlreavy, president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, which has been representing the coalition, said that, while much more aid is needed, the collaboration and problem-solving of the group is an important step forward. 'It gets us started,' McIlreavy told The Associated Press. 'And it models the behavior you want to see from others. If you wait until it's the perfect opportunity, you've missed many of the opportunities that were good enough.' World Food Program director Cindy McCain said earlier this month that 'Sudan's nearly a forgotten crisis' and that 25 million people there already face acute hunger. Last week, the top United Nations humanitarian official said fighting is escalating in the conflict that began in April 2023 when long-simmering tensions between Sudan's military and paramilitary leaders broke out in the capital Khartoum and spread to other regions. The U.N. says more than 14,000 people have been killed and 33,000 injured. 'With ongoing impediments to a large-scale international aid response, Sudanese community groups have become the primary frontline responders and are currently the most effective means of reaching millions on the brink of starvation,' Patricia McIlreavy, president of the Center for Disaster Philanthropy, said in a prepared statement on behalf of the coalition. 'With so many lives on the line, the imperative to support local aid efforts in Sudan has never been more urgent.' The Center for Disaster Philanthropy says more than 12 million people have been forced from their homes in Sudan, creating what is now the world's largest displacement and hunger crisis. The danger from the conflict has prevented most international aid agencies from delivering supplies to those in need. Greg Milne, the Clinton Global Initiative CEO who convened a panel in April to raise awareness and support for the Sudanese people, said the new coalition is an example of what bringing organizations from varied sectors can do. 'We know strong, diverse partnerships can help address often overlooked and even dire challenges, and develop unexpected and innovative solutions,' he said. Philanthropic leaders, including Bill Gates, World Central Kitchen founder Jose Andres, Open Society Foundations President Binaifer Nowrojee, and Rockefeller Foundation President Raj Shah will share information about their work during CGI, as will Prince Harry, who will discuss the launch of The Archewell Foundation Parents' Network, which supports parents of children harmed online. In his Tuesday appearance, the Duke of Sussex will also address his work with the World Health Organization and others to reduce violence against children, an issue he and his wife Meghan outlined on a recent trip to Colombia. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Barbados Prime Minister Mia Mottley, Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani Sadriu, and Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics are set to address the conference, as are CEOs from Pfizer, Mastercard, IKEA, Pinterest, Sanofi and Chobani.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jill-biden-reveals-500-million-plan-that-focuses-on-women-s-health-at-clinton-global-initiative/7795502.html	2024-09-23T14:44:43-07:00	
Texas jury clears most 'Trump Train' drivers in civil trial over 2020 Biden-Harris bus encounter	AUSTIN, Texas — A federal jury in Texas on Monday cleared a group of former President Donald Trump supporters and found one driver liable in a civil trial over a so-called 'Trump Train' that surrounded a Biden-Harris campaign bus on a busy highway days before the 2020 election. The two-week trial in a federal courthouse in Austin centered on whether the actions of the 'Trump Train' participants amounted to political intimidation. Among those aboard the bus was former Democratic lawmaker Wendy Davis, who testified she feared for her life while a convoy of Trump supporters boxed in the bus along Interstate 35. The jury awarded $10,000 to the bus driver. No criminal charges were filed against the six Trump supporters who were sued by Davis and two others aboard the bus. Civil rights advocates hoped a guilty verdict would send a clear message about what constitutes political violence and intimidation. On Oct. 20, 2020, a Biden-Harris campaign bus was traveling from San Antonio to Austin for an event when a group of cars and trucks waving Trump flags surrounded the bus. Video that Davis recorded from the bus shows pickup trucks with large Trump flags slowing down to box in the bus as it tried to move away from the group of Trump supporters. One of the defendants hit a campaign volunteer's car while the trucks occupied all lanes of traffic, forcing the bus and everyone around it to a 15 mph crawl. It was the last day of early voting in Texas and the bus was scheduled to stop at San Marcos for an event at Texas State University. The event was canceled after Davis and others on the bus — a campaign staffer and the driver — made repeated calls to 911 asking for a police escort through San Marcos and no help arrived. Davis testified that she felt scared and anxious throughout the ordeal. 'I feel like they were enjoying making us afraid,' she testified. 'It's traumatic for all of us to revisit that day.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/texas-jury-clears-most-trump-train-drivers-in-civil-trial-over-2020-biden-harris-bus-encounter-/7795483.html	2024-09-23T14:15:16-07:00

Pentagon: Small number of additional US forces going to Middle East as risk of greater war increases	Pentagon — The United States is sending a small number of additional troops to the Middle East following a sharp spike in violence between Israel and Hezbollah forces in Lebanon, Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said on Monday. Ryder did not provide further details on the number of forces or what they would be doing. However, a senior U.S. official told VOA the number of troops would be in the dozens and their primary task would be preparing for a potential military-assisted departure of U.S. citizens, should a greater regional war break out. Another U.S. official stressed that the situation was not at a point yet where a military-assisted departure was needed. If an evacuation is needed, the U.S. military has Marines deployed nearby who could execute the mission, another official told VOA. All spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive national security issues. Ryder, in response to a VOA question on Monday, told reporters that the Pentagon was a 'planning organization' that was ready for a 'wide variety of contingencies,' should the U.S. military be called for assistance. 'We have more capability in the region today than we did on April 14, when Iran conducted its drone and missile attack against Israel,' he said. The announcement comes after several strikes by Israeli forces against Hezbollah targets inside Lebanon have killed hundreds of people. The State Department is warning Americans to leave Lebanon as the risk of a regional war escalates.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-small-number-of-additional-us-forces-going-to-middle-east-as-risk-of-greater-war-increases/7795446.html	2024-09-23T13:44:47-07:00	
California sues Exxon over global plastic pollution	NEW YORK — California and several environmental groups sued ExxonMobil on Monday and accused the oil giant of engaging in a decades-long campaign that helped fuel global plastic waste pollution. Speaking at an event during Climate Week in New York City, California Attorney General Rob Bonta said the state sued Exxon after concluding a nearly two-year investigation that he said showed Exxon was deliberately misleading the public about the limitations of recycling. 'Today's lawsuit shows the fullest picture to date of ExxonMobil's decades-long deception, and we are asking the court to hold ExxonMobil fully accountable for its role in actively creating and exacerbating the plastics pollution crisis through its campaign of deception,' Bonta said in a statement. The investigation mirrors California's previous probes into the oil industry's alleged efforts to mislead the public about climate change, which the state is also suing over, and continues a long-standing adversarial relationship between the state and Big Oil. Once a major crude supplier, California's oil production has been on a steady decline for almost four decades, with companies saying the regulatory environment there makes it a difficult place to invest. Exxon rival Chevron Corp., meanwhile, a strong critic of California’s policies, said this year it plans to move its headquarters from the state where it was born to oil-friendly Texas. A coalition of environmental groups including the Sierra Club appeared to join California's legal battle, filing a related lawsuit in the same state court in San Francisco, raising similar allegations against Exxon. Bonta, a Democrat, said his office specifically had sought information on Exxon's promotion of its 'advanced recycling' technology, which uses a process called pyrolysis to turn hard-to-recycle plastic into fuel. He had said the technology's slow progress was a sign of Exxon's ongoing deception. He said he wants to secure an abatement fund and civil penalties for the harm inflicted by plastics pollution on California. Exxon pushed back at the attorney general, arguing that solutions like advanced recycling work. 'Suing people makes headlines but doesn't solve the plastic waste problem. Advanced recycling is a real solution,' said a spokesperson for ExxonMobil, adding that California has done 'nothing to 'advance' recycling.' Notre Dame Law School Professor Bruce Huber, who specializes in environmental law, said California may face an 'uphill battle' with its lawsuit. 'The state's primary claim relies on public nuisance, a notoriously murky area of law. It could be difficult for a court to grant California relief here without opening a Pandora's box of other, similar claims,' he said. Exxon is the world's largest producer of resins used for single-use plastics, according to a report published last year by the Minderoo Foundation, with consultancies Wood Mackenzie and the Carbon Trust. Reuters has reported on the enormous obstacles facing advanced recycling that the plastics industry touts as an environmental savior. California's lawsuit comes ahead of a final round of global plastic treaty negotiations set to take place in Busan, South Korea, at the end of the year. In those talks, countries are split over whether the treaty should call for caps on plastic production, a position opposed by Exxon and the global petrochemical industry. The United States last month said it supports a treaty designed around global plastic production cuts. Environmental groups praised the lawsuit. Christy Leavitt, Oceana's plastics campaign director, said California's lawsuit will 'hold industry accountable and debunk the plastics recycling narrative that holds us back from real solutions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-sues-exxon-over-global-plastic-pollution/7795403.html	2024-09-23T13:09:26-07:00	
Iran’s exiled prince urges Israelis to act on regime change, clarifies stance on funding Iran protests	Washington — The son of Iran’s last monarch, exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi, used a speech to Israeli American activists in Washington on Friday to urge them to act in support of his campaign to oust Iran’s Islamist rulers. In an interview with VOA shortly after his speech at the Israeli-American Council national summit, Pahlavi answered a question about what kind of action he wants to see from Israelis by citing the concepts of 'maximum pressure' against the Islamic Republic and 'maximum support' for the Iranian people. He said that support includes fomenting 'civil disobedience movements' in Iran and said it is 'important to fund' them. After VOA published its initial story on Friday, highlighting Pahlavi’s reference to funding civil disobedience movements in Iran in his answer to the question about what he is urging Israelis to do, some of his supporters in the Iranian diaspora used the social media X platform to express doubt about Pahlavi’s stated position. Those supporters said they did not believe Pahlavi was calling on Israelis to provide financial support to dissidents in Iran. Rather, they said they believed he was referring to diaspora Iranians as the people who should do the funding. In a statement sent to VOA on Saturday, an aide to Pahlavi said the U.S.-based crown prince’s comment about funding civil disobedience movements such as protests and labor strikes in Iran had been misinterpreted in the initial VOA story. 'The crown prince has long been a strong advocate for the establishment of a labor strike fund, emphasizing its importance in empowering the Iranian people in their fight for freedom,' the aide said. 'He believes that such a fund could be financed using Iran's blocked assets, asserting that this money rightfully belongs to the Iranian people, not the regime.' The Washington event at which Pahlavi spoke is an annual gathering of Israeli American activists, their Jewish American allies and other Israel supporters. Pahlavi drew cheers and standing ovations from the audience for urging Israelis to work with Iranians to oust the radical clerics who have ruled Iran since overthrowing his father in 1979. The speech was his most high-profile outreach to Israelis since traveling to Israel in April 2023, when he became the most prominent Iranian opposition figure to make a public visit to the Jewish state. The following transcript of Pahlavi’s interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: In your IAC speech, you urged the audience to take action. What kinds of actions do you expect to see from Israeli Americans, Israelis in general and the Israeli government when it comes to achieving regime change? Reza Pahlavi, exiled Iranian crown prince: There are two major components in this campaign. On one hand, it is important to put maximum pressure on the regime. Parallel to that is maximum support for the people of Iran. We are trying to foment civil disobedience movements within Iran, ranging from protests to labor strikes. It is important to fund them. Many diaspora Iranians would like to help. But U.S. sanctions make it almost impossible for them to, for instance, transfer money back home. Many aspects of the sanctions rules have to change to facilitate that. It requires a new U.S. policy. There also needs to be an appropriate media strategy to counter the regime's propaganda machinery. All aspects of the campaign should be coordinated with some key governments that can help. VOA: Iran and its main proxy Hezbollah are once again threatening revenge against Israel for alleged Israeli attacks on Hezbollah communications devices in Lebanon this week. What is your message to the Islamic Republic as it considers its next move? Pahlavi: There is no message to give to warmongers who stand against freedom, peace, human rights and even our national identity. Iranians, by the millions, have shown how much they despise this regime and want to tell the world that it does not represent us. Iranians are peace lovers. We want to have good relationships with our neighborhood — with Arabs, Israelis and the rest of the world. This is why I’m not going to waste my time telling the regime anything. At the end of the day, the solution is for the Iranian people themselves to put an end to this regime. But as I said in my speech, they have done all of this work alone so far. They need extra support to have a chance of success. VOA: In the audience, some Iranian Muslims waved Iran’s former Lion and Sun flag and chanted your name, reflecting the support you have in the diaspora for your friendship toward Israel. But there also are some in the diaspora who accuse you of supporting Israeli aggression toward Palestinians and others in the region. What is your message to Iranians who are skeptical of your view that they need to embrace Israel to achieve regime change? Pahlavi: I think a strategic partnership with a country like Israel brings a tremendous amount of opportunities for sharing technological knowhow. One of the reasons for my trip to Israel was to explore the possibilities of using their expertise in water management for agriculture. We are facing a drought and water crisis in Iran, so we need to have a cordial relationship with such governments. It is unfortunate that when we have such a conflict [like the Israel-Hamas war], there always are casualties. Of course, my heart goes out to many victims. The main problem is the regime itself. As long as it is there, it will not allow for normalization [of relations in the region], or for stability and peace. I’ve been insisting for years that as long as you don’t eliminate the source of the problem, which finances terrorism and forces governments to act and react, we will never be rid of it. The solution is for this regime to go. That is what the majority of the Iranian people are calling for. And what I’ve been calling for is solidarity. I think governments, including Israel, are very cognizant of, and know the difference between, the people of Iran and the regime that has nothing to do with the people’s aspirations. The regime is only there to represent its own self-interest at the expense of the Iranian people. This story was produced in collaboration with VOA’s Persian Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-exiled-prince/7793045.html	2024-09-23T12:01:24-07:00

Climate of fear permeates repressive Belarusian society	geneva — United Nations investigators are accusing the Belarusian government of Alexander Lukashenko of instilling 'a pervasive climate of fear by quashing all avenues of dissent' by systematically oppressing its perceived political opponents. 'Measures of repression and intimidation aimed at suppressing dissent continue unabated in Belarus, particularly in the lead-up to the presidential election scheduled in 2025,' Karinna Moskaleko, chair of the Group of independent Experts told the U.N. human rights council Monday. Moskaleko presented a searing account of widespread human rights violations, abuse, and horrific cases of cruelty and deprivation in this first oral update of the human rights situation in Belarus by the Expert Group, newly created by the council in March. She read out a list of abuses committed in Belarus since May 2020, when nationwide protests erupted, following Lukashenko’s decision to seek another term as president. Among those cited are arbitrary deprivation of the right to life and to liberty, torture and ill-treatment, including sexual and gender-based violence, denial of a fair trial, violations of the rights to freedom of expression, peaceful assembly and association. 'While sexual and gender-based violence is underreported, there is credible information some women and men in detention have been threatened with rape and subjected to forced nudity and cavity searches,' Moskaleko said. 'We continue to observe a misuse of national security and criminal laws to silence any dissent. Individuals perceived as political opponents continue to be charged and arrested under the criminal code, for exercising their legitimate rights to freedom of expression and association,' she said, adding that 'free trial rights are systematically violated.' The report notes that Belarusians forced into exile continue to be harassed by Lukashenko’s government, that their assets and properties are seized and relatives left behind are intimidated by the authorities. The group of experts accused the government 'for the near-total destruction of civic space and fundamental freedoms,' with most of the opposition either imprisoned or forced into exile since the 2020 elections … creating a chilling effect on any participation in activities 'perceived as critical of the government.' Lukashenko recently pardoned dozens of people who had been convicted for participating in the 2020 protests. While welcoming the announced release, Moskaleko noted that 'they represent only a small fraction of those who have been arrested' and urged the government to promptly release 'all those arbitrarily detained on politically motivated charges.' Larysa Belskaya, Belarusia ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva was unimpressed by what she heard and told 'the West,' which she claimed was behind the report, 'to stop meddling in our domestic affairs.' She said next year’s presidential election will be the domestic affair of a sovereign state. 'We do not need foreign approval or disapproval regarding the outcome of our peoples’ expression of their will,' she said. 'Belarus, like the overwhelming majority of developing countries, does not accept interference in its domestic affairs or pressure or sanctions.' This set off a spirited debate in the council with Western countries strongly condemning the persecution and intimidation of all segments of Belarusian society. They demanded an end to the government’s repressive policies and urged the immediate release of all political prisoners. They denounced the Belarusian government’s support of Russia’s aggression against Ukraine and called for an end to its complicity in the illegal deportation of Ukranian children by Russia. Michele Taylor, U.S. ambassador to the U.N. human rights council in Geneva, condemned the ongoing repression in Belarus 'including the use of torture, arbitrary detention, intimidation, harassment of families of political prisoners and transnational repression of Belarusians.' On the other hand, Stanislav Kovpak, chief counselor at the Russian Foreign Ministry’s Department for Multilateral Human Rights Cooperation deplored 'the double standards and biased approach in assessing the situation in Belarus.' 'At the same time, the role of the West is hushed up as is their significant support for the opposition who has emigrated,' he said, criticizing the use of illegal restrictive measures by Western countries against the Belarusian economy … 'and the stirring up of anti-government feeling by Western-controlled, biased media.' He rebuked the group of experts who 'worked here in gross violation of the basic principles of impartiality that should underpin the human rights body.' Addressing the council via videolink, exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya said she was speaking for the more than 1,400 political prisoners who could not speak for themselves, along with the teachers, doctors and activists behind bars for 'speaking the truth and dreaming of freedom.' 'Many of them are held in complete isolation, incommunicado … no letters, no phone calls, no contact with the outside world. My husband Syarhei has been cut off for over a year. I do not know if he is alive,' she said. Syarhei Tsikhanouski was arrested and imprisoned in 2020 after announcing his plan to challenge Lukashenko for the presidency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/climate-of-fear-permeates-repressive-belarusian-society-/7795155.html	2024-09-23T10:10:13-07:00

FBI data shows violent crime down for a second consecutive year	washington — Violent crime in the United States is down for a second consecutive year, with law enforcement agencies reporting significant declines in murder and rapes, according to a just-released report from the FBI. The FBI Crime in the Nation report released Monday found violent crime, overall, fell by 3% from 2022 to 2023, with murder and manslaughter rates dropping by 11.6% and rape down by more than 9%. There were also smaller declines in the number of robberies and aggravated assaults. Additionally, property crimes, which include burglary, fell by an estimated 2.4% year over year, though motor vehicle theft jumped by 12.6%. FBI officials, briefing reporters on the report, described the drop in the number of murders as notable, saying the 11.6% decline is the largest recorded over the past 20 years. Overall, the officials said the rate of all violent crimes in 2023 was 363.3 crimes per 100,000 inhabitants, down from a rate of 377.1 violent crimes per 100,000 inhabitants in 2022. More than 16,000 U.S. state and local law enforcement agencies contributed data for the report, including all agencies serving cities with more than one million people. The decrease in violent crimes across the U.S. continues a trend dating back to 2021, when crime rates fell after a spike in murders in 2020, during the coronavirus pandemic. The violent crime rate also remains well below a peak in rates during the early 1990s. Some crimes, though, have seen slight increases, including the number of aggravated assaults with knives, cutting instruments or other weapons. The number of so-called 'strong-arm' robberies – involving intimidation or a threat of the use of force – rose by 3.2%. Assaults on police officers also jumped to a 10-year high according to the FBI report, including 60 officers murdered in the line of duty. The number of hate crimes and victims of hate crimes also increased from 2022 to 2023, though FBI officials said the rise could have been impacted by an increase in the number of law enforcement agencies reporting hate crime data. FBI officials declined to comment on whether the trends and the overall decrease in violent crime from 2022 to 2023 have extended into 2024. But a report issued by the non-partisan Council on Criminal Justice (CCJ) in July indicates the number of violent crimes continue to fall. That study, based on monthly crime rates for dozens of major U.S. cities found murder rates fell by 13% in the first half of 2024 compared to the first six months of 2023. Assaults, assaults with guns and carjacking also fell. But while the CCJ report called the overall trends encouraging, it noted, 'many cities are still experiencing disturbingly high leve	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-data-shows-violent-crime-down-for-a-second-consecutive-year-/7795119.html	2024-09-23T09:29:10-07:00

At least 30 bodies found on boat along migrant route off Senegal	DAKAR, Senegal — At least 30 bodies were found on a boat drifting off the coast of Senegal's capital, the military said Monday, as the number of migrants leaving West Africa increases. The navy was informed of the vessel's presence on Sunday evening and sent out a boat patrol to the area, 70 kilometers (38 nautical miles) from Dakar, Ibrahima Sow, spokesperson for Senegal's military, said in a statement. 'So far, 30 bodies have been counted,' Sow said. The advanced state of decomposition of the bodies is making the identification process very difficult, the military said, adding that investigations will provide more information on the death toll and the boat's origin. Earlier this month, a boat carrying 89 people on board capsized off the coast of Senegal. At least 37 people died, according to Senegalese authorities. Many of the migrants leaving West Africa through Senegal flee conflict, poverty and a lack of jobs. Most head to the Canary Islands, a Spanish archipelago off the coast of West Africa, which is used as a stepping stone to continental Europe. Since the beginning of the year, more than 22,300 people have landed on the Canary Islands, 126% more than the same period last year, according to statistics released by Spain's Interior Ministry. Last month, the Senegalese army said it had arrested 453 migrants and 'members of smuggling networks' as part of a 12-day operation patrolling the coastline. More than half of those arrested were Senegalese nationals, the army said. In July, a boat carrying 300 migrants, mostly from Gambia and Senegal, capsized off Mauritania. More than a dozen died and at least 150 others went missing. The Atlantic route from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. While there is no accurate death toll because of the lack of information on departures from West Africa, the Spanish migrant rights group Walking Borders estimates the victims are in the thousands this year alone. Migrant vessels that get lost or run into problems often vanish in the Atlantic, with some drifting across the ocean for months until they are found in the Caribbean and Latin America carrying only human remains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-30-bodies-found-on-boat-along-migrant-route-off-senegal-/7795054.html	2024-09-23T08:55:26-07:00	
Pakistan names new chief for powerful ISI spy agency	Islamabad — Pakistan has appointed Lieutenant-General Muhammad Asim Malik as the new head of the country’s top spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI. The move comes amid persistent criticism of the powerful military-run agency for its alleged role in making or breaking elected governments in the South Asian nation. A senior Pakistani security source confirmed to VOA on Monday that Malik will assume office as the agency's next director general on September 30, replacing the current ISI chief, Nadeem Anjum. The military's media wing did not immediately comment on the high-profile appointment, but Pakistan’s state broadcaster reported it with a brief profile of the new ISI chief. Malik graduated from Fort Leavenworth in the United States and the Royal College of Defence Studies in London and currently serves as an adjutant general at the military headquarters in Rawalpindi, adjacent to the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. The ISI’s meddling in national politics has lately been the subject of intense debate in Pakistan’s national media and political circles. Jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan accuses current ISI chief Anjum of playing a role at the behest of the military in ousting him from power in 2022 through an opposition parliamentary no-confidence vote, instituting frivolous lawsuits subsequently, and unleashing a crackdown on his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party to keep himfrom returning to power. Several federal and provincial court judges, in a recent letter to the Supreme Court chief justice, have also alleged that the ISI was pressuring them to decide cases against Khan to ensure he remains in jail. The incarcerated former prime minister remains Pakistan’s most popular politician. The military, in turn, has recently arrested Anjum’s predecessor, Faiz Hameed, and initiated his court marshal on various charges, including the use of his position as the ISI chief to enable Khan to suppress political opponents while in office. It is widely believed that Khan's decision not to let Anjum replace Hameed in October 2021 angered the military and eventually led to the prime minister's removal from power several months later. Subsequent governments and the military deny having any political role or pressuring judges, a claim critics dispute. The army has ruled Pakistan for more than three decades since the country gained independence from Britain in 1947. Former Pakistani prime ministers, including Khan, and political parties say generals maintain control over foreign policy and national security issues. Khan has persistently alleged in statements from his prison cell that the current coalition government of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif 'is merely a tout' of the military. He alleges that the army leadership used the ISI to massively rig the February 8 parliamentary elections this year to prevent his party from winning. The allegations were supported by a detailed Supreme Court majority decision released on Monday, resolving a petition concerning pre- and post-election controversies. The judgment declared several actions of Pakistan’s election commission in the lead-up to the polls 'unlawful,' saying they were meant to keep PTI-nominated candidates from winning. The judgment stated that the commission 'has failed to fulfill this role in the general elections of 2024.' It noted that election authorities’ actions 'significantly infringe upon the rights of the electorate and corrode their own institutional legitimacy.' The vote outcome has worsened the political turmoil triggered by Khan’s ouster, undermining Pakistan’s efforts to stabilize an already troubled economy. A spike in militant violence, particularly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Baluchistan provinces, which border Afghanistan, has added to the challenges facing the military-backed Sharif administration. 'All this has familiar echoes of the past — a government unwilling to engage with the opposition, jailing opposition leaders, trying to steamroll legislation, and a desperate opposition in constant protest mode against a backdrop of economic gloom, weak governance, and ubiquitous establishment pulling the strings from behind the scenes,' Maleeha Lodhi, Pakistan’s former ambassador to the U.S. and the United Nations, wrote in an article published by Pakistan’s Dawn newspaper Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-names-new-chief-for-powerful-isi-spy-agency/7795059.html	2024-09-23T08:54:53-07:00	
Biden proposes banning Chinese vehicles from US roads with software crackdown	Washington — The U.S. Commerce Department on Monday proposed prohibiting key Chinese software and hardware in connected vehicles on American roads due to national security concerns — a move that would effectively bar nearly all Chinese cars from entering the U.S. market. The planned regulation, first reported by Reuters, would also force American and other major automakers in the coming years to remove key Chinese software and hardware from vehicles in the United States. The Biden administration has raised serious concerns about the collection of data by Chinese companies on U.S. drivers and infrastructure through connected vehicles as well as about potential foreign manipulation of vehicles connected to the internet and navigation systems. The White House ordered an investigation into the potential dangers in February. The prohibitions would prevent testing of self-driving cars on U.S. roads by Chinese automakers and extend to vehicle software and hardware produced by other U.S. foreign adversaries including Russia. 'When foreign adversaries build software to make a vehicle that means it can be used for surveillance, can be remotely controlled, which threatens the privacy and safety of Americans on the road,' Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told a briefing. 'In an extreme situation, a foreign adversary could shut down or take control of all their vehicles operating in the United States all at the same time causing crashes, blocking roads.' The move is a significant escalation in the United States' ongoing restrictions on Chinese vehicles, software and components. Earlier this month, the Biden administration locked in steep tariff hikes on Chinese imports, including a 100% duty on electric vehicles as well as new hikes on EV batteries and key minerals. There are relatively few Chinese-made cars or light-duty trucks imported into the United States. But Raimondo said the department is acting 'before suppliers, automakers and car components linked to China or Russia become commonplace and widespread in the U.S. automotive sector... We're not going to wait until our roads are filled with cars and the risk is extremely significant before we act.' Nearly all newer cars and trucks are considered 'connected' with onboard network hardware that allows internet access, allowing them to share data with devices both inside and outside the vehicle. A senior administration official confirmed the proposal would effectively ban all existing Chinese light-duty cars and trucks from the U.S. market, but added it would allow Chinese automakers to seek 'specific authorizations' for exemptions. The United States has ample evidence of China prepositioning malware in critical American infrastructure, White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan told the same briefing. 'With potentially millions of vehicles on the road, each with 10- to 15-year lifespans the risk of disruption and sabotage increases dramatically,' Sullivan said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington last month criticized planned action to limit Chinese vehicle exports to the United States: 'China urges the U.S. to earnestly abide by market principles and international trade rules, and create a level playing field for companies from all countries. China will firmly defend its lawful rights and interests.' The proposal calls for making software prohibitions effective in the 2027 model year while the hardware ban would take effect in the 2030 model year or January 2029. The Commerce Department is giving the public 30 days to comment on the proposal and hopes to finalize it by Jan. 20. The rules would apply to all on-road vehicles but exclude agricultural or mining vehicles not used on public roads. The Alliance For Automotive Innovation, a group representing major automakers including General Motors, Toyota, Volkswagen and Hyundai, has warned that changing hardware and software would take time. The group noted connected vehicle hardware and software are developed around the world, including China, but could not detail to what extent Chinese-made components are prevalent in U.S. models.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-proposes-banning-chinese-vehicles-from-us-roads-with-software-crackdown-/7794812.html	2024-09-23T06:58:56-07:00	
Soyuz capsule with 2 Russians, 1 American from ISS returns to Earth	Moscow — A Soyuz capsule carrying two Russians and one American from the International Space Station landed Monday in Kazakhstan, ending a record-breaking stay for the Russian pair. The capsule landed on the Kazakh steppe about 3 1/2 hours after undocking from the ISS in an apparently trouble-free descent. In the last stage of the landing, it descended under a red-and-white parachute at about 7.2 meters per second (16 mph), with small rockets fired in the final seconds to cushion the touchdown. The astronauts were extracted from the capsule and placed in nearby chairs to help them adjust to gravity, then given medical examinations in a nearby tent. Oleg Kononenko and Nikolai Chub returned after 374 days aboard the space station; on Friday they broke the record for the longest continuous stay there. Also in the capsule was American Tracy Dyson, who was in the space station for six months. Eight astronauts remain in the space station, including Americans Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams, who have remained long past their scheduled return to Earth. They arrived in June as the first crew of Boeing's new Starliner capsule. But their trip was marred by thruster troubles and helium leaks, and the U.S. space agency NASA decided it was too risky to return them on Starliner. The two astronauts are to ride home with SpaceX next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/soyuz-capsule-with-2-russians-1-american-from-iss-returns-to-earth/7794800.html	2024-09-23T06:31:17-07:00	
Muslim Americans could flex 'political muscles' in November US elections	Muslims account for less than 2% of the U.S. population, but as VOA’s Kane Farabaugh reports, Muslim American influence in U.S. elections is growing, driven largely by concerns over the continued war between Israel and Hamas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/muslim-americans-could-flex-political-muscles-in-november-us-elections/7794750.html	2024-09-23T05:52:28-07:00	
Cholera spreading in Sudan as fighting between rival generals shows no sign of abating	Cairo — Cholera is spreading in war-torn Sudan, killing at least 388 people and sickening about 13,000 others over the past two months, health authorities said, as more than 17 months of fighting between the military and a notorious paramilitary group shows no sign of abating. The disease is spreading in areas devastated by recent heavy rainfall and floods especially in eastern Sudan where millions of war displaced people sheltered. The casualties from cholera included six dead and about 400 sickened over the weekend, according to Sunday’s report by the Health Ministry. The disease was detected in 10 of the country’s 18 provinces with the eastern Kassala and al-Qadarif provinces the most hit, the ministry said. Cholera is a fast-developing, highly contagious infection that causes diarrhea, leading to severe dehydration and possible death within hours when not treated, according to the World Health Organization. It is transmitted through the ingestion of contaminated food or water. The disease is not uncommon in Sudan. A previous major outbreak left at least 700 dead and sickened about 22,000 in less than two months in 2017. Sudan was plunged into chaos in April last year when simmering tensions between the military and a powerful paramilitary group, the Rapid Support Forces, exploded into open warfare across the country. The fighting, which wrecked the capital, Khartoum, and other urban areas has been marked by atrocities including mass rape and ethnically motivated killings that amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity, especially in the western region of Darfur, according to the United Nations and international rights groups. It has killed at least 20,000 people and wounded tens of thousands others, according to the U.N. However, rights groups and activists say the toll was much higher. The war also has created the world’s largest displacement crisis. More than 13 million people have been forced to flee their homes since the fighting began, according to the International Organization for Migration. They include over 2.3 million who fled to neighboring countries. Devastating seasonal floods and cholera have compounded the Sudanese misery. At least 225 people have been killed and about 900 others were injured in the floods, the Health Ministry said. Critical infrastructure has been washed away, and more than 76,000 houses have been destroyed or damaged, it said. Famine was also confirmed in July in the Zamzam camp for displaced people, which is located about 15 kilometers (10 miles) from North Darfur’s embattled capital of al-Fasher, according to global experts from the Famine Review Committee. About 25.6 million people — more than half of Sudan’s population — will face acute hunger this year, they warned. Fighting, meanwhile, rages in al-Fasher, the last major city in Darfur that is still held by the military. The RSF has been attempting to retake it since the start of the year. Last week, the paramilitary force and its allied Arab militias launched a new attack on the city. The military said its forces, aided by rebel groups, managed to repel the attack and kill hundreds of RSF fighters, including two senior commanders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cholera-spreading-in-sudan-as-fighting-between-rival-generals-shows-no-sign-of-abating-/7794678.html	2024-09-23T04:34:51-07:00	
Eurozone business activity slumps after Olympics boost	Brussels, Belgium — Eurozone business activity declined for the first time in seven months in September, as France lost steam after the end of the Paris Olympic Games, a key survey said Monday. S&P Global's purchasing managers' index (PMI) — a key gauge of the overall health of the economy — dropped to 48.9 in September, down from 51 in August. Any reading below 50 indicated contraction. 'The eurozone is heading towards stagnation. After the Olympic effect had temporarily boosted France, the eurozone heavyweight economy, the Composite PMI fell in September to the largest extent in 15 months,' said Cyrus de la Rubia, chief economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank. 'Considering the rapid decline in new orders and the order backlog, it doesn't take much imagination to foresee a further weakening of the economy.' The survey showed that Germany and France, the eurozone's top two economies, were largely responsible for driving the slump in the 20-country single currency area. French private sector output returned to contraction after the shot in the arm from the Olympics, while German business activity dropped the fastest since February. The 'big decline' in eurozone PMI 'suggests that the economy is slowing sharply, that Germany is in recession and that France's Olympics boost was just a blip', said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at London-based research group Capital Economics. 'With France's new minority government now planning to tighten fiscal policy significantly, prospects for growth in France look increasingly poor,' he said. President Emmanuel Macron named a new government led by Prime Minister Michel Barnier Saturday, 11 weeks after an inconclusive parliamentary election. The eurozone PMI data showed the manufacturing sector was down across the board, falling for the eighteenth month in a row. 'Manufacturing is getting messier by the month,' de la Rubia said. 'Looking ahead, the sharp drop in new orders and companies' increasingly bleak outlook for future output suggest that this dry spell is far from over.' The decline in business activity could add impetus to calls for the European Central Bank (ECB) to cut its key interest rate again in October. The bank for the 20 countries that use the euro cut its deposit rate by a quarter point to 3.50% this month — the second decrease since June. The ECB had hiked rates at record pace from mid-2022 to tame surging consumer prices but has started easing the pressure as inflation drifts back down towards its 2% target.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eurozone-business-activity-slumps-after-olympics-boost-/7794666.html	2024-09-23T04:13:05-07:00	
Trump attempted assassination suspect Ryan Routh to appear in court	WEST PALM BEACH, Florida — The man accused of hiding out with a gun near Donald Trump's Florida golf course in an apparent attempt to assassinate the former U.S. president is due in court on Monday, where prosecutors will argue to keep him in jail until his trial. Ryan Routh, 58, has been charged with two gun crimes after he allegedly pointed a rifle through the tree line on Sept. 15 while the Republican presidential candidate was playing golf at his course in West Palm Beach, according to a criminal complaint. He has not yet entered a plea. U.S. prosecutors may reveal new details about the investigation at the hearing, scheduled to begin at 11 a.m. EDT (1500 GMT), as they argue that Routh poses a danger to public safety and must remain detained pending trial. Routh has been charged with possession of a firearm as a convicted felon and possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number. More charges could follow. A U.S. Secret Service agent spotted the weapon and fired in Routh's direction, causing the suspect to flee, according to the complaint. Routh was later arrested along a Florida highway. U.S. officials have said Routh did not fire a shot during the encounter at the golf course and did not have a line of sight to Trump, who was a few hundred meters away. Authorities have not yet divulged a motive for the incident, which the FBI has said is being investigated as an apparent attempted assassination of Trump ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election. It came about two months after another gunman wounded Trump on the ear during a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. That gunman was shot and killed by the Secret Service. The pair of incidents revealed the agency's strains at a time of rising political threats and violence in the United States. Routh, a struggling roofing contractor who most recently lived in Hawaii, had a criminal history. He was a vocal supporter of Ukraine who was interviewed about his quixotic effort to recruit Afghans to fight against Russia's invasion. In a 2023 self-published book, Routh wrote that Iran was 'free to assassinate Trump' for pulling the United States out of an international nuclear deal with Teheran during his presidency. In December 2002, Routh was convicted in North Carolina of possessing a weapon of mass death and destruction. He was also convicted of possessing stolen goods in 2010, according to court records. Cellphone data showed that Routh may have been waiting in the area for nearly 12 hours — from around 2 a.m. until about 1:30 p.m. - when the gun was spotted, according to the criminal complaint. Investigators found a loaded SKS-style rifle with a scope, a digital camera and a plastic bag with food at the scene, according to the complaint.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-attempted-assassination-suspect-ryan-routh-to-appear-in-court-/7794653.html	2024-09-23T03:57:32-07:00	
EU challenges China's dairy product probe at WTO	Brussels — The European Commission launched a challenge at the World Trade Organization (WTO) on Monday against China's investigation into EU dairy products, initiated after the European Union placed import tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles. This is the first time the European Union has taken such action at the start of an investigation, rather than wait for it to result in trade measures against the bloc. 'The EU's action was prompted by an emerging pattern of China initiating trade defense measures, based on questionable allegations and insufficient evidence, within a short period of time,' the commission said. Proceedings at the WTO start with a mandatory period of 60 days for the parties to consult each other. The Commission said it would ask the WTO to set up an adjudicating panel if the consultations did not lead to a satisfactory solution. WTO panels usually take more than a year to reach conclusions. China initiated its anti-subsidy investigation on Aug. 21, targeting EU liquid milk, cream with a fat content above 10% and various types of cheeses. The Commission said it was confident that EU dairy subsidy schemes are fully in line with international rules and not causing injury to China's dairy sector. The EU imposed provisional duties in July on electric vehicles built in China and EU members are expected to vote soon on final tariffs, which would apply for five years. China also has ongoing anti-dumping investigations into EU brandy and pork.

High inflation memories cloud US consumers' outlooks	Washington — Even before the Federal Reserve approved its outsized half-percentage-point interest rate cut last week, financial markets had begun making credit cheaper for households and businesses as they bid down mortgage rates, cut corporate bond yields, and chipped away at what consumers pay for personal, auto and other loans. How fast that process will continue now that the U.S. central bank's first rate cut is in the books is unclear, in particular whether easing credit conditions will become tangible to consumers in ways that shift attitudes about the economy before the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election. Recent surveys suggest that while the pace of price increases has declined dramatically, the public's mood is still marred by nearly two years of high inflation — even if falling rates signal that chapter of recent economic history is closed and will begin making it cheaper for people to borrow money. 'My daughter has been trying to buy a home for years and cannot,' said Julie Miller, who works at her son's electrical company in Reno, Nevada, a state where home prices rose fast during the COVID-19 pandemic. One of seven key battleground states in the presidential race, Nevada is being aggressively contested by Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced President Joe Biden as the Democratic candidate, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican challenger. If housing costs are vexing Miller's daughter, higher prices at Taco Bell have caused Miller to cut back on the usual Friday night trips to the fast food retailer with her granddaughter, and left her inclined to vote for Trump because 'I don't think Biden has done a great job with inflation.' Harris supporters had similar concerns about high prices even as they vouched for her as the best candidate to address the problem. Borrowing costs decline The Fed's rate cut on Sept. 18 is likely to be followed by more, with at least another quarter-percentage-point reduction expected when policymakers begin their next two-day policy meeting a day after the U.S. election. Just as rate increases feed through to a higher cost of credit for families and businesses, discouraging them from borrowing, spending and investing in order to cool inflation, reductions in borrowing costs change the calculus for would-be homebuyers and firms, particularly small businesses wanting to finance new equipment or expand production. Looser monetary policy, which the Fed had been signaling was on the way, has already put money back into people's pockets. The average rate on a 30-year fixed-rate home mortgage, the most popular home loan, for example, is approaching 6% after nearing 8% just a year ago. Redfin, a real estate firm, recently estimated that the median payment on homes sold or listed in the four weeks through Sept. 15 was $300 less than the all-time high hit in April and nearly 3% lower than a year ago. But with that adjustment already done, 'mortgage rates are likely to remain relatively stable for the next couple of weeks,' Chen Zhao, an economist at Redfin, wrote in a post on the company's website. Indeed, under baseline estimates from the Fed's own staff, mortgage rates are likely to level off somewhere in the mid-5% range, meaning most of the relief there has already occurred. Banks have begun trimming the 'prime rate' they charge their most credit-worthy borrowers to match the Fed rate cut. Other forms of consumer credit - the auto and personal loans where a better deal might be available to households - have changed only marginally so far, and it may take longer for banks to give up on charging higher finance costs. Investors and economists saw last week's rate cut as less important than the message it carried of a central bank ready to loosen credit and confident that recent high inflation won't recur. Inflation in fact has registered one of its fastest ever declines, with the consumer price index's annual increase falling from more than 9% in June 2022 to 2.6% on a year-over-year basis last month. The Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures price index rose at a 2.5% rate in July, near the central bank's 2% target. Sour sentiment The U.S. economy has been performing reasonably well despite concerns the job market might be on the brink of weakening. New claims for unemployment benefits remain low and unexpectedly fell in the most recent week, while the unemployment rate, at 4.2% in August, has risen from a year ago but is around the level the Fed feels is sustainable without generating excess wage and price pressures. A Philadelphia Fed index of manufacturing rose recently and retail sales for August grew despite expectations for a drop. But none of that has led to a decisive shift in public sentiment. The share of Americans who see the economy as heading in the right direction climbed to 25% in August from 17% in May 2022, according to Reuters/Ipsos polling. Yet the share that sees the economy on the wrong track has eased to 60% from 74% over the same period. A New York Fed survey that through early this year showed people feeling better off than a year ago and expecting more improvement in the year ahead has since been moving in the other direction even as inflation slowed further and rate cuts became more likely. The University of Michigan's consumer sentiment index had been improving but then dropped in recent months and remains below where it was before the pandemic. The most recent U.S. Census 'pulse' polls of households showed the share who reported trouble paying household expenses in the past week has ebbed from 2022, when inflation hit its peak, but has made little improvement recently. In his press conference following the rate cut last week, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said his aim was to keep the economy on track between the central bank's two goals of stable inflation and a healthy job market. To that end, credit will ease but at no guaranteed pace. 'This is the beginning of that process,' Powell said. 'The direction ... is toward a sense of neutral, and we'll move as fast or as slow as we think is appropriate in real-time.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/high-inflation-memories-cloud-us-consumers-outlooks-/7794639.html	2024-09-23T03:38:45-07:00	
Tanzania arrests opposition leaders, blocks protest	Dar es Salaam, Tanzania — Police arrested Tanzania's top opposition figures on Monday, their party said, as the authorities moved to block a mass protest in the commercial capital Dar es Salaam. Despite an official ban, the opposition Chadema party had vowed to go ahead with the rally over the alleged kidnapping and killing of its members by security forces. Chadema said its chairman Freeman Mbowe and his deputy Tundu Lissu were both arrested on Monday, while riot police were stationed in key areas across the city to prevent gatherings. 'Demonstration is our constitutional right and we are surprised by the magnitude of force being used by the police to threaten people and suppress our freedom,' Mbowe told supporters before being led away by police, according to a video shared by the party online. Chadema accuses President Samia Suluhu Hassan's government of returning the country to the repressive tactics of her predecessor, John Magufuli. Hassan took over following Magufuli's sudden death in March 2021 and appeared to signal a more liberal approach, reversing restrictions on opposition rallies and the media. But Chadema accuses the security forces of being behind the recent disappearance of several members and the killing of Ali Mohamed Kibao, of its national secretariat, who was found dead earlier this month. Police also blocked a youth day rally by the party in August, arresting dozens of its leaders including Mbowe and Lissu. Rights groups and Western governments, including the United States, have raised concerns about renewed repression ahead of local elections in November and a general election in late 2025. Lissu, an opposition stalwart, has been arrested countless times and suffered multiple gunshot wounds in an assassination attempt in 2017. He returned to Tanzania last year after Hassan lifted the ban on opposition rallies. Police had alleged that the Chadema protests would be violent. But in a speech broadcast on X on Sunday, Mbowe said: 'I remind Tanzanians that we are going to hold peaceful protests. We are neither carrying any weapons nor planning to violate the peace as some people allege. 'In case some of us will be arrested, hurt or even killed, pray for us and never turn back.

Search underway for suspects in Alabama mass shooting	BIRMINGHAM, Ala. — Authorities have reported no immediate arrests after a weekend mass shooting killed four people and left 17 others injured in what police described as a targeted 'hit' by multiple shooters who opened fire outside a popular Alabama nightspot. The shooting late Saturday night in the popular Five Points South entertainment district of Birmingham, rocking an area of restaurants and bars that is often bustling on weekend nights. The mass shooting, one of several this year in the major city, unnerved residents and left officials at home and beyond pleading for help to both solve the crime and address the broader problem of gun violence. 'The priority is to find these shooters and get them off our streets,' Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin said a day after the shooting. The mayor planned a morning news conference Monday to provide updates on the case. The shooting occurred on the sidewalk and street outside Hush, a lounge in the entertainment district, where blood stains were still visible on the sidewalk outside the venue on Sunday morning. Birmingham Police Chief Scott Thurmond said authorities believe the shooting targeted one of the people who was killed, possibly in a murder-for-hire. A vehicle pulled up and 'multiple shooters' got out and began firing, then fled the scene, he said. 'We believe that there was a 'hit,' if you will, on that particular person,' Thurmond said. Police said approximately 100 shell casings were recovered. Thurmond said law enforcement was working to determine what weapons were used, but they believe some of the gunfire was 'fully automatic.' Investigators also were trying to determine whether anyone fired back, creating a crossfire. In a statement late Sunday, police said the shooters are believed to have used 'machine gun conversion devices' that make semi-automatic weapons fire more rapidly. Some surviving victims critically injured Officers found two men and a woman on a sidewalk with gunshot wounds and they were pronounced dead there. An additional male gunshot victim was pronounced dead at a hospital, according to police. Police identified the three victims found on the sidewalk as Anitra Holloman, 21, of the Birmingham suburb of Bessemer, Tahj Booker, 27, of Birmingham, and Carlos McCain, 27, of Birmingham. The fourth victim pronounced dead at the hospital was pending identification. By the early hours of Sunday, victims began showing up at hospitals and police subsequently identified 17 people with injuries, some of them life-threatening. Four of the surviving victims, in conditions ranging from good to critical, were being treated at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital on Sunday afternoon, according to Alicia Rohan, a hospital spokeswoman. Popular nightspot rocked by gunfire The area of Birmingham where the gunfire erupted is popular with young adults because of its proximity to the University of Alabama at Birmingham and the plethora of nearby restaurants and bars. The shooting was the 31st mass killing of 2024, of which 23 were shootings, according to James Alan Fox, a criminologist and professor at Northeastern University, who oversees a mass killings database maintained by The Associated Press and USA Today in partnership with the university. Three of the nation's 23 mass shootings this year were in Birmingham, including two earlier quadruple homicides. Mayor pleads for a solution to gun violence Woodfin expressed frustration at what he described as an epidemic of gun violence in America and the city. 'We find ourselves in 2024, where gun violence is at an epidemic level, an epidemic crisis in our country. And the city of Birmingham, unfortunately, finds itself at the tip of that spear,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/search-underway-for-suspects-in-alabama-mass-shooting/7794582.html	2024-09-23T01:56:19-07:00

Pope Francis cancels meetings due to mild flu, Vatican says	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis canceled his scheduled appointments for Monday due to a mild flu, the Vatican said in a statement. The Vatican said the 87-year-old pontiff made the decision as a precautionary measure in view of his planned four-day trip to Luxembourg and Belgium later this week. It gave no further details. Francis is scheduled to begin the trip, his 46th foreign visit as pope, on Thursday. It comes less than two weeks after he returned from a demanding 12-day, four-country tour of Southeast Asia and Oceania. Francis now regularly uses a wheelchair due to knee and back pain. He has also suffered bouts of ill health in recent years. Earlier this year, he canceled several appointments over what the Vatican variously described as a cold, bronchitis and influenza. The pope appeared in good form throughout his Sept. 2-13 trip to Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore. He maintained a packed schedule, headlining more than 40 events, and clocked up a total of nearly 33,000 km. His trip to Luxembourg and Belgium is expected to highlight the needs of migrants in Europe and to include a meeting with survivors of abuse by Catholic clergy. Francis' agenda in Luxembourg and Belgium will be lighter than that of the Southeast Asia and Oceania trip, with the pope scheduled to take part in about a dozen events over four days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-cancels-meetings-due-to-mild-flu-vatican-says/7794559.html	2024-09-23T00:22:19-07:00	
Sri Lankan leftist leader sworn in after landslide election win	Colombo, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka's first leftist president was sworn into office Monday vowing to restore public faith in politics after anger over the island nation's unprecedented economic crisis propelled him to a landslide poll win. Self-avowed Marxist Anura Kumara Dissanayaka of the People's Liberation Front (JVP) took his oath at the colonial-era Presidential Secretariat in Colombo after trouncing his nearest rivals in Saturday's vote. The previously fringe politician, whose party led two failed uprisings that left tens of thousands dead, saw a surge of support after the country's 2022 economic meltdown forced painful hardships on ordinary Sri Lankans. Dissanayaka, 55, was sworn in by the chief justice in a ceremony attended by lawmakers, members of the Buddhist clergy and the military who sang the national anthem after the ceremony. 'I will do my best to fully restore the people's confidence in politicians,' Dissanayaka said after taking the oath. 'I am not a conjurer, I am not a magician,' he added. 'There are things I know and things I don't know, but I will seek the best advice and do my best. For that, I need the support of everyone.' Dissanayaka succeeds outgoing president Ranil Wickremesinghe, who took office at the peak of the financial crisis following the government's first-ever foreign debt default and months of punishing food, fuel and medicine shortages. Wickremesinghe, 75, imposed steep tax hikes and other austerity measures per the terms of an International Monetary Fund bailout. His policies ended the shortages and returned the economy to growth but left millions struggling to make ends meet. 'I can confidently say that I did my best to stabilize the country during one of its darkest periods,' he said in a statement after placing a distant third in Saturday's poll. Shortly before the ceremony, Prime Minister Dinesh Gunawardena resigned, clearing the way for Dissanayaka to appoint his own cabinet. Dissanayaka's party has said he wants to have his own cabinet until a fresh parliament is elected later this year. His JVP party has only three members in the 225-member parliament. He has vowed to press ahead with the IMF rescue package negotiated by his predecessor last year but modify its terms in order to deliver tax cuts. 'It is a binding document, but there is a provision to renegotiate,' Bimal Ratnayake, a senior member of Dissanayaka's party, told AFP. Legacy of violence Dissanayaka's party led two rebellions in the 1970s and 1980s that left more than 80,000 people dead before renouncing violence. It had been a peripheral player in Sri Lankan politics in the decades since, winning less than four percent of the vote during the most recent parliamentary elections in 2020. But Sri Lanka's crisis proved an opportunity for Dissanayaka, who saw his popularity rise after pledging to change the island's 'corrupt' political culture. The 55-year-old laborer's son was a JVP student leader during the second insurrection and has described how one of his teachers sheltered him to save him from government-backed death squads that killed party activists. He counts famous Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara among his heroes. Since his rise to popularity, he has softened some policies, saying he believes in an open economy and is not totally opposed to privatization.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lankan-leftist-leader-sworn-in-after-landslide-election-win/7794541.html	2024-09-22T22:56:04-07:00	
China urges vigilance against Taiwanese cyberattacks	BEIJING/TAIPEI — China's national security ministry said on Monday a Taiwan military-backed hacking group called Anonymous 64 has been carrying out cyberattacks against targets in China, urging people to report 'anti-propaganda sabotage.' Taiwan's defense ministry denied the allegations, saying China was the real disturber of the peace with its cyber attacks and military harassment. Since the beginning of this year, Anonymous 64 - which China's national security ministry said belonged to Taiwan's cyber warfare wing - has sought to upload and broadcast 'content that denigrates the mainland's political system and major policies,' on websites, outdoor screens and network TV stations, it said in a blog post. Taiwan frequently accuses Chinese groups of seeking to spread online disinformation or carry out cyberattacks across the democratically governed island. China claims sovereignty over Taiwan and has ramped up military and political pressure against over the past five years to assert its claims. The Taiwan defense ministry's Information, Communications and Electronic Force Command said China's accusations were untrue. 'The current enemy situation and cyber threats are severe,' it said in a statement. 'The Chinese communist military and forces that coordinate with it continue to use aircraft, ships and cyber attacks to harass Taiwan and are the originators of undermining regional peace.' Taiwan's government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims. The hacking group's X account said it was set up in June 2023 and showed screenshots of efforts to broadcast videos likening Chinese President Xi Jinping to an emperor, marking the second anniversary of protests against Beijing's strict COVID curbs and commemorating the 1989 Tiananmen Square demonstrations. One video was an address from an Anonymous 64 member wearing the Anonymous hacking group's Guy Fawkes mask in the style of the graphic novel and film V for Vendetta. Neither the X site nor the blog post from China's national security ministry said whether Anonymous 64 had any affiliation with the international hacking group. Reuters was not immediately able to verify where the group was based or whether they had actually carried out the hacking attacks they were accused of. In the blog post published on its official WeChat account, the national security ministry said its investigation into the group had found many of the websites Anonymous 64 claimed to have accessed were fake or had little no traffic. Posts showing it having infiltrated numerous university and media websites had been photoshopped, the ministry added. The security ministry published screenshots of the group's X account with heavily redacted text. It also said it had opened a case against three members of Taiwan's cyber warfare wing. 'We advocate that netizens should not believe in or spread rumors and should promptly report cyberattacks or cases of anti-propaganda activity to the national security authorities,' the blog post said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-urges-vigilance-against-taiwanese-cyberattacks/7794532.html	2024-09-22T22:37:12-07:00

Vietnam aims for 1 semiconductor fab plant, 10 packaging plants by 2030	HANOI, VIETNAM — Vietnam aims to have at least one semiconductor fabrication plant and 10 packaging plants by 2030, and will launch a fund to help foreign investors mitigate the impacts of the global minimum business tax, the government said on the weekend. The country's semiconductor industry is targeting revenue of $25 billion by 2030, the government said in a statement after the release of its semiconductor industry development strategy on Saturday. The Southeast Asian country, a regional manufacturing hub, is seeking to move to high-tech industries from labor-intensive ones. As part of its drive, the country aims to have 50,000 semiconductor engineers by 2030, the government said. Several global electronics and semiconductor firms including Intel, Samsung, Amkor Technology, Qualcomm and Marvell Technology have facilities in the country. Beyond the initial 2030 target, the government said it plans to have at least three semiconductor fabrication plants and 20 packaging plants, with annual revenues of $100 billion, by 2050. In July, the Ministry of Planning and Investment said it was finalizing a draft plan to set up a fund to help attract foreign investment into high-tech industries and maintain the country's competitiveness.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-aims-for-1-semiconductor-fab-plant-10-packaging-plants-by-2030/7794515.html	2024-09-22T21:13:40-07:00

Micro dramas shake up China's film industry, aim for Hollywood	ZHENGZHOU, China — On a film set that resembles the medieval castle of a Chinese lord, Zhu Jian is busy disrupting the world's second-largest movie industry. The 69-year-old actor is playing the patriarch of a wealthy family celebrating his birthday with a lavish banquet. But unbeknownst to either of them, the servant in the scene is his biological granddaughter. A second twist: Zhu is not filming for cinema screens. 'Grandma's Moon' is a micro drama, composed of vertically shot, minute-long episodes featuring frequent plot turns designed to keep millions of viewers hooked to their cellphone screens — and paying for more. 'They don't go to the cinema anymore,' said Zhu of his audience, which he described as largely composed of middle-aged workers and pensioners. 'It's so convenient to hold a mobile phone and watch something anytime you want.' China's $5 billion a year micro drama industry is booming, according to Reuters' interviews with 10 people in the sector and four scholars and media analysts. The short-format videos are an increasingly potent competitor to China's film industry, some experts say, which is second in size only to Hollywood and dominated by state-owned China Film Group. And the trend is already spreading to the United States, in a rare instance of Chinese cultural exports finding traction in the West. Three major China-backed, micro-drama apps were downloaded 30 million times across both Apple's App Store and Google Play in the first quarter of 2024, grossing $71 million internationally, according to analytics company Appfigures. 'The audience only has that much attention. So obviously, the more time they spend in short videos, the less time they have for TV or other longer-format shows,' said Ashley Dudarenok, founder of a Hong Kong-based marketing consultancy. The leader in the space is Kuaishou, an app that accounted for 60% of the top 50 Chinese micro dramas last year, according to media analytics consultancy Endata. Kuaishou vice president Chen Yiyi said at a media conference in January that the app featured 68 titles that notched more than 300 million views last year, with four of them watched over a billion times. Some 94 million people -- more than the population of Germany -- watched more than 10 episodes a day on Kuaishou, she said. Reuters was not able to independently verify the data. Initial episodes on such apps are often free, but to complete a micro drama like 'Grandma's Moon,' which has 64 clips, audiences may pay tens of yuan. Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok that is owned by internet technology firm Bytedance, is also popular with micro drama fans. Alongside other major Chinese social media apps like Instagram-like Xiaohongshu and YouTube competitor Bilibili, it has announced plans to make more. In the United States, micro drama platform ReelShort, whose parent company is backed by Chinese tech giants Tencent and Baidu, has recently outranked Netflix in terms of downloads on Apple's U.S. app store, according to market researcher Sensor Tower. 'China discovered this audience first,' said Layla Cao, a Chinese producer based in Los Angeles. 'Hollywood hasn't realized that yet, but all the China-based companies are already feeding the content.' 'Low-brow and vulgar' Many popular micro dramas, including 'Grandma's Moon,' have narratives that revolve around revenge or Cinderella-like rags-to-riches journeys. Tales of how circumstances at birth are deterministic and can only be changed by near-miracles have struck a chord with viewers at a time when upward mobility in China is low and youth unemployment high. The micro dramas often 'show people who one day are lower class and the next day become upper class -- you get so rich that you get to humiliate those who used to humiliate you,' said a 26-year-old screenwriter known by her pen name of Camille Rao. Rao recently left her poorly paid job as a junior producer in the traditional film industry for what she described as the more dynamic and less hierarchical world of micro dramas. She now writes and adapts scripts for the U.S. market. 'Social mobility is actually very difficult now. Many people perceive this as a social reality,' said Xu Ting, associate professor of Chinese language and literature at Jiangnan University. This has fueled interest in stories about billionaires and wealthy families, she added: 'Everyone desires power and wealth, so it is normal for these type of stories to be popular.' In the U.S. market, by contrast, fantasy stories about werewolves and vampires are particularly popular, several creators told Reuters. The boom in micro dramas in China has brought scrutiny from the Communist Party. Between late 2022 and early 2023, the National Radio and Television Administration regulator said it organized a 'special rectification campaign' during which it removed 25,300 micro dramas, totaling close to 1.4 million episodes, due to their 'pornographic, bloody, violent, low-brow and vulgar content.' As Chinese leader Xi Jinping promotes values such as loyalty to the Communist Party and heteronormative marriages, the state-owned China Women's News outlet in April complained that some micro dramas 'portray unequal and twisted marriage and family relationships as a common phenomenon' and 'deviate from mainstream social values.' In June, the government began requiring some creators to register micro dramas with NRTA. The regulator didn't respond to Reuters' questions for this story. Key to the commercial success of these films are plot twists that keep people paying as they scroll while commuting or in line at a grocery store. Episodes often end with a hook — such as a boyfriend walking in on his partner with another man — and viewers have to pay for the next episode to find out what happened. 'The plot of these micro dramas is exaggerated,' said Zhu, the actor. 'It has plot reversals, it's nonsensical, so it catches people's attention and a large audience wants to see them.' Zhu is a lover of cinema and an avid fan of Ingrid Bergman in 'Casablanca.' Like many of his colleagues in micro dramas, he thinks the genre has limited artistic value. 'I see it as fast food: a longer drama is a kind of sumptuous meal, and a micro drama is fast food.' But its dedicated viewers disagree. Huang Siyi, a 28-year-old customer service agent, said she enjoyed watching romantic micro dramas because 'the acting is good and the male and female leads are good-looking.' 'It's easy to be obsessed with micro dramas,' she said. Explosive growth Vertical filming and distribution through social media apps mean micro dramas can be made with small overhead costs. Budgets for such films range from between $28,000 and $280,000, according to market researcher iResearch. In the central Chinese city of Zhengzhou, 'Grandma's Moon' is being made with a compressed budget and timeline. When Reuters visited the set in July, the filming day stretched until 2 a.m. The crew then moved to a new location and began shooting again at 7 a.m. The show was shot in just six days, and Zhu, a muscular man with a wide smile and boundless energy, says he plays table tennis after hours to keep up with the young crew on set. 'We'd need to take two to three years to distribute one traditional TV series of film, but we only need three months to distribute a micro drama, saving us a lot of time,' said Zhou Yi, a showrunner at Chinese gaming giant NetEase, which also makes micro dramas. As micro dramas gain in popularity, actors' salaries have also grown. Leading roles used to pay $280 a day, said Zhu, adding that main actors in big productions can now make more than double the rate, though extras earn as little as $17 daily. A retired railway employee who started acting in the 1970s in a theater troupe attached to the unit where he worked, Zhu now lives off his pension and occasional acting gigs. Many Chinese micro drama producers have their eye on Western markets, where cultural exports from China have often struggled. NetEase last year started making productions for the U.S. that it distributes via an app called LoveShots; the made-for-export films aren't typically available in China. Micro dramas designed for the West are often made by production and acting crews in Los Angeles and shot on location. The scripts, which are in English, may also revolve around themes of wealth, cheating partners and miracles. One of the latest micro dramas on LoveShots is about a woman who, after years of being paralyzed, miraculously regains her ability to move -- and walks in on her husband cheating on her.	https://www.voanews.com/a/micro-dramas-shake-up-china-s-film-industry-aim-for-hollywood/7794473.html	2024-09-22T18:16:06-07:00	
Long-forbidden French anti-riot force sent to Martinique as thousands defy bans on protests	Mexico City — France has sent a group of special anti-riot police that's been banned for 65 years to the French Caribbean island of Martinique, where protesters have gathered despite the government barring demonstrations in parts of the island. The force arrived this weekend after the local representative of France's central government in its overseas territory said in a statement that protests were forbidden in the municipalities of Fort-de-France, Le Lamentin, Ducos and Le Robert until Monday. The government also issued a curfew. The restrictions came after violent protests broke out on the island last week over the high cost of living, with gunfire injuring at least six police officers and one civilian. Police launched tear gas and government officials said several stores were also looted. Officials said the bans were meant 'to put an end to the violence and damage committed at gatherings, as well as to the numerous obstacles to daily life and freedom of movement that penalize the entire population, particularly at weekends.' But the measure was met by defiance by many on the island, with massive peaceful protests breaking out Saturday night. Videos from local media show crowds of thousands peacefully walking along highways overnight banging on drums and waiving flags. As protests wound on without violence, the force of French anti-riot police arrived on the island and were staying at a hotel in Fort-de-France on Sunday. It wasn't immediately clear how many were sent. The elite riot police, known as the Companies for Republican Security, were banned in the French territory following bloody riots in December 1959. The unit had been accused of using disproportionate force against protesters, ending in the deaths of a number of young demonstrators. The force is rarely deployed in French territories in the Caribbean but was called on during riots and strikes in Guadeloupe in 2009. Martinique's leaders requested the forces amid the recent protests in an historic shift for the island, and one met with a sharp rejection by some in the territory. Beatrice Bellay, a representative of the socialist party on the island, blasted the move, saying: 'Martinique is not in a civil war, it is a social war.' She called for an 'open and transparent dialogue' between protesters and the government. 'This measure ... only serves to aggravate tensions and distract attention from the legitimate demands of the people of Martinique,' she wrote in a statement Sunday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/long-forbidden-french-anti-riot-force-sent-to-martinique-as-thousands-defy-bans-on-protests/7794186.html	2024-09-22T16:50:50-07:00	
California governor signs law banning all plastic shopping bags at grocery stores	Sacramento, California — 'Paper or plastic' will no longer be a choice at grocery store checkout lines in California under a new law signed Sunday by Gov. Gavin Newsom that bans all plastic shopping bags. California had already banned thin plastic shopping bags at supermarkets and other stores, but shoppers could purchase bags made with a thicker plastic that purportedly made them reusable and recyclable. The new measure, approved by state legislators last month, bans all plastic shopping bags starting in 2026. Consumers who don't bring their own bags will now simply be asked if they want a paper bag. State Sen. Catherine Blakespear, one of the bill's supporters, said people were not reusing or recycling any plastic bags. She pointed to a state study that found that the amount of plastic shopping bags trashed per person grew from 3.6 kilograms per year in 2004 to 5 kilograms per year in 2021. Blakespear, a Democrat from Encinitas, said the previous bag ban passed a decade ago didn't reduce the overall use of plastic. 'We are literally choking our planet with plastic waste,' she said in February. The environmental nonprofit Oceana applauded Newsom for signing the bill and 'safeguarding California's coastline, marine life, and communities from single-use plastic grocery bags.' Christy Leavitt, Oceana's plastics campaign director, said Sunday that the new ban on single-use plastic bags at grocery store checkouts 'solidifies California as a leader in tackling the global plastic pollution crisis.' Twelve states, including California, already have some type of statewide plastic bag ban in place, according to the environmental advocacy group Environment America Research & Policy Center. Hundreds of cities across 28 states also have their own plastic bag bans in place. The California Legislature passed its statewide ban on plastic bags in 2014. The law was later affirmed by voters in a 2016 referendum. The California Public Interest Research Group said Sunday that the new law finally meets the intent of the original bag ban. 'Plastic bags create pollution in our environment and break into microplastics that contaminate our drinking water and threaten our health,' said the group's director Jenn Engstrom. 'Californians voted to ban plastic grocery bags in our state almost a decade ago, but the law clearly needed a redo. With the governor's signature, California has finally banned plastic bags in grocery checkout lanes once and for all.' As San Francisco's mayor in 2007, Newsom signed the nation's first plastic bag ban.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-governor-signs-law-banning-all-plastic-shopping-bags-at-grocery-stores/7794183.html	2024-09-22T16:18:00-07:00	
As UN meets, Haitians express hopelessness at finding international solution to gang crisis	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — As world leaders meeting in the United Nations this week discuss the future of efforts to rein in the gangs strangling Haiti, Haitians are expressing hopelessness that an international response can turn the tide of violence. Thus far, a U.N.-backed force of 400 police from Kenya and about two dozen Jamaican officers have done little to quell the country's gangs, which have terrorized the country since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. World leaders have been discussing the next steps in a convoluted effort to restore order to the Caribbean nation. The United States has floated the idea of a U.N. peacekeeping force, but the idea was considered too controversial given the introduction of cholera and sexual abuse cases that occurred the last time U.N. troops were in Haiti. The deployment of Kenyan forces was, in part, to avoid tensions that may be sparked by sending another U.N. peacekeeping mission. But in a visit to Haiti by Kenya's President William Ruto over the weekend – on his way to the United Nations General Assembly session, which began on Sunday – Ruto said he would be open to expanding Kenya's operations into a larger U.N. peacekeeping mission. 'On the suggestion to transit this into a fully U.N. Peacekeeping mission, we have absolutely no problem with it, if that is the direction the U.N. security council wants to take,' Ruto said. While Ruto hailed the successes of the Kenyan forces on Sunday, a recent report by a UN human rights expert said gang violence is spreading across Haiti and that Haitian police still lack the 'logistical and technical capacity' to fight gangs. The ongoing violence has left Haitians like 39-year-old Mario Canteve disillusioned with further international efforts to quell the gangs, saying he no longer believes promises by world leaders that they'll be able to change anything in the crisis-stricken nation. 'No one is coming to save Haiti. Nothing is changing,' he said. 'A new mission cannot save Haiti.' Canteve sells cellphone chips and repairs electronics in the capital of Port-au-Prince, 80% of which is estimated to be controlled by gangs. Facing brutal gang violence, some Haitians have organized vigilante groups to battle the gangs themselves. Such groups speak to the lack of hope many Haitians have that an international solution can mark a shift in Haiti. Moise Jean-Pierre, a 50-year-old schoolteacher, recalled past U.N. missions in Haiti and said such efforts were a 'waste of time.' 'It would not be the first time we've had U.N. missions in Haiti,' he said. 'What difference will it make?' Sentiments on the ground speak to the bind world leaders are in as they've spent years looking for a larger solution to Haiti's woes. The current security mission is expected to reach a total of 2,500 personnel, with the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad also pledging to send police and soldiers, although it wasn't clear when that would happen. Few at the U.N. have an appetite for a larger peacekeeping mission in part due to the abuses in past missions, but also because many Haitians have an aversion to foreign interventions. Experts say three previous interventions by U.S. and the U.N. have not improved crises in Haiti. Some harbor hope that elections planned next year will pave the path to a Haitian-born solution. The country has not held general elections since 2016 as the crisis has dragged on. Last week, Haiti took its first steps in creating a provisional election council to prepare the nation for elections. Haiti still has many hurdles ahead of it to get there. Chief among them is violence. While Canteve, the cellphone chip salesman, called for unity and said 'a new mission cannot save Haiti, the children of Haiti need to save themselves,' he also expressed doubts the country was safe enough to facilitate elections. 'How can you hold an election when everything is so violent. Everyone is so violent. When police cannot even go into certain areas, what kind of election are going to get?' he asked.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-un-meets-haitians-express-hopelessness-at-finding-international-solution-to-gang-crisis/7794181.html	2024-09-22T16:07:30-07:00	
In Switzerland, voters reject plan to better protect country's biodiversity	Geneva — Switzerland, known for natural beauty like pristine lakes and majestic Alpine peaks, ranks among the world's richest countries whose plant and animal life is under the greatest threat. Environmentalists were seeking better protections for the country's biodiversity in a nationwide vote that culminated Sunday. Final official results showed more than 63% of voters casting ballots had rejected the initiative that aimed to boost public funding to encourage farmers and others to set aside lands and waterways to let the wild develop more, and increase the total area allocated for green spaces that must remain untouched by human development. The contest was decided by mail-in ballots followed by a morning of in-person voting Sunday. Factors behind the weakening biodiversity in the country of rivers, lakes, valleys and mountains include intensified agriculture, soil alteration, a fragmentation of the landscape — such as the building of roads and housing that cut through wildlife habitats — and pollution and climate change, proponents of the measure said. The federal government — parliament and the executive branch — opposed the plan, as did many rural voters and the country's main right-wing party, according to polls. They called it too costly, saying 600 million Swiss francs (over $700 million) is already spent on biodiversity protection each year, and fear economic development will suffer. Passage was estimated to cost at least another 400 million francs for national and local governments, the Federal Council estimates. The initiative would also, for example, prohibit the construction of new railway lines through protected dry meadows — even if such meadow is set aside and developed elsewhere, it says. 'Passage of the biodiversity initiative would severely limit (sustainable) energy and food production, restrict the use of forests and rural areas for tourism, and make construction more expensive,' argued the campaign for a 'no' vote on its website. 'YES to biodiversity, but NO to the extreme biodiversity initiative.' Proponents, meanwhile, pointed to dwindling natural resources in Switzerland and threats to bees, frogs, birds, mosses and other wildlife. They argued that protected green spaces are 'the main capital for tourism' and more of them would support local economies. 'Diversified nature guarantees air purity, drinkable water, pollination, fertility of the soil, and our food supply,' said a committee that backed the idea. 'But in Switzerland, biodiversity is suffering. One-third of all our plant and animal species are threatened or have already disappeared.' The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank that counts 38 mostly rich countries as members, has produced a comparative look at threats to plant and animal life. Switzerland ranks among the top four countries with the highest rates of threatened species in all eight categories of wildlife. The voting was part of the latest Swiss referendums, which take place four times a year to give voters a direct say in policymaking in the country of around 9 million people. The only other nationwide issue up for consideration this time was a pension reform plan backed by the government. More than two-thirds of voters turned down the pension reform plan, the final results showed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-switzerland-voters-reject-plan-to-better-protect-countrys-biodiversity/7794178.html	2024-09-22T15:53:40-07:00	
PM Rama says Albania to grant sovereignty to Bektashi Muslims in Tirana	Tirana, Albania — Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said Sunday his country would transform the Tirana-based Bektashi Muslims, an Islamic Sufi order, into a sovereign state to promote moderation, tolerance and peaceful coexistence. Speaking at the United Nations, Rama pointed out that Albania, a tiny Western Balkan country, saved Jewish refugees from the Nazis during World War II and sheltered Afghans after the Taliban came to power three years ago. Albanians are also proud of giving to the world Mother Teresa who 'embodied love for humanity,' he said. 'She told us that not all of us can do big things, but we can all do small things with big love,' he said. 'That is our inspiration in supporting the transformation of the World Bektashi Order into a sovereign state in our capital, Tirana, as a new center of moderation, tolerance and peaceful coexistence.' Albania's 2.4-million population is about 50% Muslim with the rest of the population Catholic and Orthodox Christians and other smaller communities. The country is known for its religious harmony and co-existence. Bektashi Muslims make up about 10% of the Muslims in the country, according to the last census. It wasn't immediately clear how the order would legally be granted sovereignty. But the Bektashi Order said it considers the move the beginning of a new era promoting global religious tolerance. 'Such a historic step aims at recognizing the Beltashi Order as a sovereign, self-governing state, committed to supporting its century-old culture of moderation and spiritual involvement,' it said in a statement. The Bektashi Order will receive sovereignty similar to that of the Vatican, governing religious and administrative issues independently of Albania, the Order said. Citizenship would be provided only to the top religious members and those individuals involved in managing the state, while the leadership will run from the head of the Bektashi, Baba Mondi, and a council that will monitor its religious and administrative operation. 'The new state will aim at nothing but the spiritual leadership,' the statement said. The Bektashi Order originated in the Ottoman Empire in the 13th century. The Bektashis acquired political importance in the 15th century, when the order dominated the Janissary Corps, the elite infantry units that formed the Ottoman sultan's household troops. After the foundation of the Turkish Republic, its leader Kemal Ataturk banned religious institutions that were not part of the Directorate of Religious Affairs and the Bektashi community's headquarters relocated to Albania, where it became involved in politics. One of its members, Ismail Qemali declared Albania's independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1912.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pm-rama-says-albania-to-grant-sovereignty-to-bektashi-muslims-in-tirana/7794166.html	2024-09-22T15:19:20-07:00	
Israel, Hezbollah trade rocket fire and threats	Tensions between Israel and Hezbollah increased sharply in recent days, after an Israeli airstrike on Beirut killed a senior Hezbollah official, Ibraim Aqil, as well as dozens of others. On Sunday, Hezbollah fired more than 150 rockets at Israel, damaging homes in northern Israel, and sparking fires. Israel continued to fire barrages of rockets at Lebanon.

Spending deal averts a possible US federal shutdown, funds government into December	Washington — Congressional leaders announced an agreement Sunday on a short-term spending bill that will fund federal agencies for about three months, averting a possible partial government shutdown when the new budget year begins Oct. 1 and pushing final decisions until after the November election. Lawmakers have struggled to get to this point as the current budget year winds to a close at month's end. At the urging of the most conservative members of his conference, House Speaker Mike Johnson had linked temporary funding with a mandate that would have compelled states to require proof of citizenship when people register to vote. But Johnson could not get all Republicans on board even as the party's presidential nominee, Donald Trump, insisted on that package. Trump said Republican lawmakers should not support a stop-gap measure without the voting requirement, but the bill went down to defeat anyway, with 14 Republicans opposing it. Bipartisan negotiations began in earnest shortly after that, with leadership agreeing to extend funding into mid-December. That gives the current Congress the ability to fashion a full-year spending bill after the Nov. 5 election, rather than push that responsibility to the next Congress and president. In a letter to Republican colleagues, Johnson said the budget measure would be 'very narrow, bare-bones' and include 'only the extensions that are absolutely necessary.' 'While this is not the solution any of us prefer, it is the most prudent path forward under the present circumstances,' Johnson wrote. 'As history has taught and current polling affirms, shutting the government down less than 40 days from a fateful election would be an act of political malpractice.' Rep. Tom Cole, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, had said on Friday that talks were going well. 'So far, nothing has come up that we can't deal with,' said Cole, R-Okla. 'Most people don't want a government shutdown and they don't want that to interfere with the election. So nobody is like, ‘I’ve got to have this or we're walking.' It's just not that way.' Johnson's earlier effort had no chance in the Democratic-controlled Senate and was opposed by the White House, but it did give the speaker a chance to show Trump and conservatives within his conference that he fought for their request. The final result — government funding effectively on autopilot — was what many had predicted. With the election just weeks away, few lawmakers in either party had any appetite for the brinksmanship that often leads to a shutdown. Now a bipartisan majority is expected to push the short-term measure over the finish line. Temporary spending bills generally fund agencies at current levels, but some additional money was included to bolster the Secret Service, replenish a disaster relief fund and aid with the presidential transition, among other things.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spending-deal-averts-a-possible-us-federal-shutdown-funds-government-into-december/7794149.html	2024-09-22T14:46:08-07:00	
Ukraine's Zelenskyy visits Pennsylvania ammunition factory to thank workers	Scranton, Pennsylvania — Under extraordinarily tight security, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday visited the Pennsylvania ammunition factory that is producing one of the most critically needed munitions for his country's fight to fend off Russian ground forces. His visit to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant kicked off a busy week in the United States to shore up support for Ukraine in the war. He will speak at the U.N. General Assembly annual gathering in New York on Tuesday and Wednesday and then travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As Zelenskyy's large motorcade made its way to the ammunition plant on Sunday afternoon, a small contingent of supporters waving Ukrainian flags assembled nearby to show their appreciation for his visit to thank the workers. The area around the ammunition plant had been sealed off since the morning, with municipal garbage trucks positioned across several roadblocks and a very heavy presence of city, regional and state police, including troopers on horseback. The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells and has increased production over the past year. The 155 mm shells are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large guns with long barrels that can fire at various angles. Howitzers can strike targets up to 24 kilometers to 32 kilometers away and are highly valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected distance. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of the 155 mm shells from the U.S. 'It's unfortunate that we need a plant like this, but it's here, and it's here to protect the world,' said Vera Kowal Krewsun, a first-generation Ukrainian American who was among those who greeted Zelenskyy's motorcade. 'And I strongly feel that way.' She said many of her friends' parents have worked in the ammunition plant, and she called Zelenskyy's visit 'a wonderful thing.' Laryssa Salak, 60, whose parents also immigrated from Ukraine, also said she was pleased Zelenskyy came to thank the workers. She said it upsets her that funding for Ukraine's defense has divided Americans and that even some of her friends oppose the support, saying the money should go to help Americans instead. 'But they don't understand that that money does not directly go to Ukraine, Salak said. 'It goes to American factories that manufacture, like here, like the ammunition. So that money goes to American workers as well. And a lot of people don't understand that.' With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire deeper inside of Russia. So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000 of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S. stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out, such as in a potential conflict over Taiwan. In response the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans to hit 100,000 rounds a month. Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology, and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer — were expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant, as was Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro. The 155 mm rounds are just one of the scores of ammunition, missile, air defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine — everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56 billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have collected to aid in its defense. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its defense is seen by many of the European nations as a must to keep Putin from further military aggression that could threaten bordering NATO-member countries and result in a much larger conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-zelenskyy-visits-pennsylvania-ammunition-factory-to-thank-workers/7794139.html	2024-09-22T14:18:49-07:00	
Republicans in swing states say they see scant signs of groups door-knocking for Trump	Lansing, Michigan — Republican activists in swing states say they have seen little sign of the teams tasked with knocking on doors and turning out infrequent voters on behalf of Donald Trump, raising concerns about the party's presidential nominee relying on outside groups for an important part of his campaign operations. Trump and the Republican National Committee he controls opted to share get-out-the-vote duties in key parts of the most competitive states this year with groups such as America PAC, the organization supported by billionaire Elon Musk. It is difficult to demonstrate that something is not happening. But with fewer than 50 days until the Nov. 5 election, dozens of Republican officials, activists and operatives in Michigan, North Carolina and other battleground states say they have rarely or never witnessed the group's canvassers. In Arizona and Nevada, the Musk-backed political action committee replaced its door-knocking company just this past week. 'I haven't seen anybody,' said Nate Wilkowski, field director for the Republican Party in vote-rich Oakland County, Michigan, which includes crucial Detroit suburbs. He was speaking specifically of America PAC. 'Nobody's given me a heads-up that they're around in Oakland County areas.' Trump has relied on the loyalty of his fervent base, in an election expected to pivot on turnout. The spotty evidence, however, of what was portrayed as a sophisticated operation has some party activists questioning the operation's value. Trump's campaign views the race with Vice President Kamala Harris as a toss-up among likely voters but believes it has the edge among people who stayed away in 2016 and 2020, making it even more essential to reach them. The work is particularly important in Michigan, where Trump lost by fewer than 160,000 votes in 2020, and where the Republican Party began the year mired in debt and fighting an ugly contest over the rightful state party leader. Michigan's Republican chairman, Pete Hoekstra, said he was told that America PAC canvassers had arrived in late August and were at work. A spokesperson for the PAC said canvassers were in Michigan, as well as Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — the seven most competitive states. The spokesperson declined to say how many canvassers there were across the states. Meghan Reckling, a Republican canvassing firm owner in Michigan, said she spotted two America PAC canvassers Tuesday in Oakland County. Identifiable in blue polo shirts emblazoned with 'America,' they were working an area that Reckling's own data showed to be one with low-propensity voters, she said. 'They had, you could tell, a very pleasant exchange with the lady who answered the door, and probably talked to her for five minutes,' Reckling said. 'From what I observed, they were obviously engaging in direct conversations.' But in interviews with more than two dozen activists and party officials across the seven battleground states, such reports were rare. 'I don't know what the PACs are doing,' said Mark Forton, the Republican chair in Macomb County, Michigan, a populous, suburban area northeast of Detroit. 'I don't know if they are going door to door.' Trump aides say the campaign has an estimated 30,000 volunteer captains who are identifying less likely voters at the local level, including through neighborhood canvassing. Campaign political director James Blair also estimates that close to 2,500 paid canvassers, with America PAC making up a significant chunk, are working in the seven states. The PAC has paid canvassing firms more than $14 million since mid-August for work on the presidential campaign, according to Federal Election Commission spending reports filed by the group. Blair dismissed the statement that the campaign was ceding work to outside groups. Instead, he said, the campaign was making use of 'the resources within those groups to bolster the frequency of contacts and the total coverage within the universe of where we would want them.' 'We very much are focused on low-propensity voters, because it's what makes strategically the most sense in terms of how the president is going to win these states, and these groups' efforts have helped reach them,' Blair said. America PAC is run by former top aides to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' failed presidential campaign. Trump's team also is sharing the responsibility of reaching less-frequent voters with groups that include Turning Point USA, led by conservative millennial personality Charlie Kirk, and the Faith and Freedom Coalition, headed by Christian conservative figure Ralph Reed. Part of the reason for the campaign's move was the result of an FEC ruling this year that a candidate's campaign and outside groups could coordinate their canvassing efforts with super PACs, and specifically share voter lists and data that they collect door to door. It means campaigns could share much of their labor- and cost-heavy ground efforts with groups that can take unlimited donations. Harris' outreach on the ground in the seven states is being led by campaign-paid staff, a number the campaign puts at nearly 2,200 in more than 328 offices. Campaign aides said groups affiliated with labor organizations were canvassing independent of the campaign. The vast majority of what outside groups that support Harris are doing is advertising. Based on ad reservations for Harris and the leading super PAC supporting her, they are on track to spend nearly $175 million more than Trump's campaign and the leading super PACs supporting him by Election Day. Harris' campaign has outspent Trump's on advertising by 2-to-1 since she entered the race on July 23, according to the media tracking firm AdImpact. Over the past week, there were complications for America PAC, the most high-profile of the groups helping Trump in 2024. America PAC fired Nevada-based canvassing company September Group, according to two people familiar with the matter. America PAC had paid the company almost $2.7 million a month ago, according to FEC reports. The people familiar with September Group's dismissal spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss private business decisions. A spokesman for America PAC declined to confirm the move. Trump is not the first candidate to delegate some typical campaign-managed duties to outside groups. But the arrangement has not gone smoothly for some of the others who have tried it. Last year, DeSantis entrusted much of the political outreach for his Republican presidential campaign to a super PAC called Never Back Down, with conflict between its board and top campaign personnel late in the lead-up to the Iowa caucuses. Despite starting the campaign with roughly $100 million, DeSantis dropped out after losing the first contest in Iowa. In his unsuccessful quest for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush attempted something very similar, ceding much of the political infrastructure work to a super PAC called Right to Rise, which raised more than $114 million in 2015.	https://www.voanews.com/a/republicans-in-swing-states-say-they-see-scant-signs-of-groups-door-knocking-for-trump/7794135.html	2024-09-22T14:00:08-07:00	
On New York visit, India's Modi celebrates cultural ties	Uniondale, New York — Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, continuing a multiday U.S. visit, addressed a cultural celebration on Long Island Sunday, where he praised the United States' return of nearly 300 antiquities to India and relayed news of his country's dual win at the Chess Olympiad in Budapest, Hungary, to an enthusiastic crowd. 'I just got some very good news,' Modi told an estimated 13,000 people inside Nassau Veterans Coliseum for an event billed as a celebration of cultural ties between India and the United States. 'In the Chess Olympiad, in both the men's and women's tournament, India has won gold medals,' he said to applause in a speech that was translated into English for an online audience. Modi was reelected in June following a marathon election in which more than 640 million votes were cast over a span of six weeks in the world's largest democratic exercise. 'This year, 2024, is a very important one for the entire world,' he said. 'On the one hand, there are conflicts raging between several countries in the world, there is tension. And on the other, democracy is being celebrated in several countries of the world. India and America are also together in this celebration of democracy.' Modi's appearance in New York came a day after he attended a summit hosted by President Joe Biden in Wilmington, Delaware, for leaders of the so-called Quad that also included Prime Minister Anthony Albanese of Australia and Prime Minister Kishida Fumio of Japan. Also Saturday, Modi accepted the return of 297 antiquities spanning thousands of years that had been stolen or trafficked from India. The U.S. has returned nearly 600 such cultural artifacts to India since 2016, according to India's Ministry of External Affairs. On Monday, the prime minister is expected to attend a United Nations summit in advance of this week's General Assembly. Sunday's event was sponsored by the not-for-profit Indo American Community of USA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-new-york-visit-india-s-modi-celebrates-cultural-ties/7794129.html	2024-09-22T13:39:38-07:00	
US to propose ban on Chinese software, hardware in connected vehicles, sources say	Washington — The U.S. Commerce Department is expected on Monday to propose prohibiting Chinese software and hardware in connected and autonomous vehicles on American roads due to national security concerns, two sources told Reuters. The Biden administration has raised serious concerns about the collection of data by Chinese companies on U.S. drivers and infrastructure as well as the potential foreign manipulation of vehicles connected to the internet and navigation systems. The proposed regulation would ban the import and sale of vehicles from China with key communications or automated driving system software or hardware, said the two sources, who declined to be identified because the decision had not been publicly disclosed. The move is a significant escalation in the United States' ongoing restrictions on Chinese vehicles, software and components. Last week, the Biden administration locked in steep tariff hikes on Chinese imports, including a 100% duty on electric vehicles as well as new hikes on EV batteries and key minerals. Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in May the risks of Chinese software or hardware in connected U.S. vehicles were significant. 'You can imagine the most catastrophic outcome theoretically if you had a couple million cars on the road and the software were disabled,' she said. President Joe Biden in February ordered an investigation into whether Chinese vehicle imports pose national security risks over connected-car technology -- and if that software and hardware should be banned in all vehicles on U.S. roads. 'China's policies could flood our market with its vehicles, posing risks to our national security,' Biden said earlier. 'I’m not going to let that happen on my watch.' The Commerce Department plans to give the public 30 days to comment before any finalization of the rules, the sources said. Nearly all newer vehicles on U.S. roads are considered 'connected.' Such vehicles have onboard network hardware that allows internet access, allowing them to share data with devices both inside and outside the vehicle. The department also plans to propose making the prohibitions on software effective in the 2027 model year and the ban on hardware would take effect in January 2029 or the 2030 model year. The prohibitions in question would include vehicles with certain Bluetooth, satellite and wireless features as well as highly autonomous vehicles that could operate without a driver behind the wheel. A bipartisan group of U.S. lawmakers in November raised alarm about Chinese auto and tech companies collecting and handling sensitive data while testing autonomous vehicles in the United States. The prohibitions would extend to other foreign U.S. adversaries, including Russia, the sources said. A trade group representing major automakers including General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai and others had warned that changing hardware and software would take time. The carmakers noted their systems 'undergo extensive pre-production engineering, testing, and validation processes and, in general, cannot be easily swapped with systems or components from a different supplier.' The Commerce Department declined to comment on Saturday. Reuters first reported, in early August, details of a plan that would have the effect of barring the testing of autonomous vehicles by Chinese automakers on U.S. roads. There are relatively few Chinese-made light-duty vehicles imported into the United States. The White House on Thursday signed off on the final proposal, according to a government website. The rule is aimed at ensuring the security of the supply chain for U.S. connected vehicles. It will apply to all vehicles on U.S. roads, but not for agriculture or mining vehicles, the sources said. Biden noted that most cars are connected like smartphones on wheels, linked to phones, navigation systems, critical infrastructure and to the companies that made them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-propose-ban-on-chinese-software-hardware-in-connected-vehicles-sources-say/7794115.html	2024-09-22T13:16:40-07:00	
Angry French cognac makers see red over Chinese tariffs threat	Cognac, France — Frustrated cognac producers in southwestern France are growing increasingly anxious over the looming threat of Chinese tariffs on European brandy, a move industry representatives worry could force French liquor from the Chinese market. Some 800 protesters riding on tractors and carrying signs gathered in France's southwestern town of Cognac this week demanding a delay to an upcoming European Union vote to impose duties on Chinese electric vehicles. This protest -- the first since 1998 -- comes after Beijing refused to rule out future tariffs following an anti-dumping investigation into brandy imported from the European Union. The probe was launched months after the EU undertook an investigation into Chinese electric vehicle (EV) subsidies. And with the EU set to vote next week on introducing tariffs on Chinese EVs, France's brandy makers are worried about the consequences that vote could have on their livelihood. 'The situation is urgent,' said Anthony Brun, the union head for Cognac's brandy makers, adding that a decision to levy tariffs on Chinese EVs 'will jeopardize the entire industry.' Cognac's interprofessional association BNIC said it was recently notified that China intends to impose tariffs of around 35% on European brandy, a move seen as targeting France. This comes despite repeated assurances from Beijing it would not implement provisional tariffs after it found European brandy had been dumped into China, threatening the country's domestic industry with 'substantial damage.' 'For a year now, we have been warning French and European authorities about this risk and the need to stop this downward spiral,' wrote Brun in a letter addressed to new French Prime Minister Michel Barnier about the tariff threat. 'We are the victims without being in any way responsible. ... We have not been listened to,' Brun said, writing on behalf of the cognac union. In May, French President Emmanuel Macron thanked his Chinese counterpart for not imposing customs duties on French cognac amid the probe, presenting Xi Jinping with bottles of the expensive drink. But cooperating with Chinese authorities has produced 'no results' and incurred millions in costs, said Florent Morillon, head of BNIC. Tariffs could force French brandy to 'disappear from the Chinese market,' which accounts for a quarter of exports, added Morillon. The threat of losing the Chinese market could be existential for some brandy makers, who count on overseas consumers for up to 60% of their profits. China imported more brandy than any other spirit in 2022, with most of it coming from France, according to a report by research group Daxue Consulting. Cognac producers are calling on the EU to postpone its September 25 vote on imposing tariffs on EVs imported from China, fearing China will respond with customs duties on European brandy. 'We have no way out,' said Rodolphe Texier, a member of a farmers' union in France's western Charente region. 'If Europe doesn't follow us, we're dead,' said Texier, adding he is concerned about widespread repercussions throughout the industry which could impact everyone from distillers to barrel makers to truck drivers. With more than 4,400 farms and some 85,000 jobs, France's cognac industry is already in trouble after it saw a 22% drop in sales in 2023 and dramatically reduced new vine planting zones. France's brandy makers are not the only ones under pressure, as Beijing launched a probe into EU subsidiaries on some dairy products in August. Even though a meeting is set 'in principle' between BNIC and the prime minister's office, Florent Morillon told AFP there is a feeling of being 'taken hostage' by Paris and Brussels. 'The French and European authorities have decided to sacrifice us,' wrote union head Anthony Brun. 'Never mind our jobs, our weight in the local economy, our contribution to trade, and to France's image,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/angry-french-cognac-makers-see-red-over-chinese-tariffs-threat/7794107.html	2024-09-22T13:02:35-07:00	
Beetlejuice Beetlejuice' scares off 'Transformers' for third week as box office No. 1	Los Angeles — It's a three-peat for 'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice.' The Tim Burton legacy sequel to his 1988 horror comedy topped the North American box office charts for the third straight weekend with $26 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. It edged out the animated new release 'Transformers: One,' which brought in $25 million. The Optimus Prime origin story from Paramount Pictures features the voices of Chris Hemsworth, Brian Tyree Henry and Scarlett Johansson. 'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,' a Warner Bros. release with Michael Keaton and Winona Ryder returning as stars, has earned more than $226 million domestically in its three weeks after a monster opening of $110 million — the third best of the year — and a second weekend of $51.6 million. Third place went to the James McAvoy horror 'Speak No Evil,' which came in at $5.9 million in its second week for a total of $21.5 million. On the whole, the box office was in a quiet phase that is expected to break when ' Joker: Folie à Deux ' dances its way onto the big screen on Oct. 4. The year's second-highest grosser ' Deadpool & Wolverine ' remained in the top 5 in its ninth weekend with another $3.9 million and a domestic total of $627 million. Only Pixar's 'Inside Out 2' has earned more. The Demi Moore-starring, Coralie Fargeat-directed body horror 'The Substance,' which made a splash at the Cannes Film Festival, brought in $3.1 million on limited screens in its first weekend for the sixth spot. The Daily Wire movie 'Am I Racist?' — in which conservative columnist Matt Walsh goes undercover as a 'DEI trainee' — stayed in the top 10 after a fourth place finish last week, earning $2.9 million for seventh place and a two-week total of $9 million. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. 'Beetlejuice Beetlejuice,' $26 million. 2. 'Transformers One,' $25 million. 3. 'Speak No Evil,' $5.9 million. 4. 'Never Let Go,' $4.5 million. 5. 'Deadpool & Wolverine,' $3.9 million. 6. 'The Substance,' $3.1 million. 7. 'Am I Racist?' $2.5 million. 8. 'Reagan,' $1.7 million. 9. 'JUNG KOOK: I AM STILL,' $1.4 million. 10.

Iran arrests 12 people for collaborating with Israel, Revolutionary Guards say	Dubai, UAE — Iran's Revolutionary Guards said on Sunday that 12 people had been arrested for being operatives collaborating with Israel and planning acts against Iran's security. 'As the Zionist regime (Israel) and their Western backers, most notably the United States, have not succeeded in their sinister goals against the people of Gaza and Lebanon, they are now seeking to spread the crisis to Iran with a series of actions planned against our country's security,' the statement said. Tensions in the Middle East have shot up since thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Lebanon's Hezbollah members exploded in an attack widely blamed on Israel.

Wall St week ahead - Investor focus turns to data, election, earnings after Fed cut	NEW YORK — A roaring rally in U.S. stocks will face a gauntlet of economic data, looming political uncertainty and a corporate earnings test in coming weeks as investors navigate one of the most volatile periods of the year for equity markets. The benchmark S&P 500 .SPX last week hit its first closing all-time high in two months after the Federal Reserve unveiled a hefty 50-basis point rate cut, kicking off the first U.S. monetary easing cycle since 2020. The index is up 0.8% so far in September, historically the weakest month for stocks, and has gained 19% year-to-date. But the rocky period could carry over until the Nov 5 election, strategists said, leaving the S&P 500 vulnerable to market swings. 'We're entering that period where seasonality has been a bit less favorable,' said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. 'Despite the excitement about the start of the new rate-cutting cycle, it could still be a bumpy road ahead.' The second half of September is historically the weakest two-week period of the year for the S&P 500, according to a Ned Davis Research analysis of data since 1950. The index has also logged an average 0.45% decline in October during presidential years, data from CFRA going back to 1945 showed. Volatility also tends to pick up in October in election years, with the Cboe Market Volatility index .VIX rising to an average level of 25 at the start of the month, as opposed to its long-term average of 19.2, according to an Edward Jones analysis of the past eight presidential election years. The VIX was recently at 16.4. The market could be particularly sensitive to this year's close election between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris. Recent polls show a virtually tied race. 'Unless the data deteriorates considerably, we think U.S . elections will start to be more at the forefront,' UBS equity derivative strategists said in a note. Investors are also looking for data to support expectations that the economy is navigating a 'soft landing,' during which inflation moderates without badly hurting growth. Stocks fare much better after the start of rate cuts in such a scenario, as opposed to when the Fed cuts during recessions. The coming week includes reports on manufacturing, consumer confidence and durable goods, as well as the personal consumption expenditures price index, a key inflation measure. Attention will be squarely on employment after Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank wanted to stay ahead of any weakening in the job market as the Fed announced its cut last week. The closely-watched monthly U.S. jobs report is due on Oct 4. 'We're going to have hyper-focus on anything that speaks to the strength of the labor force,' said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth. Meanwhile, the rally in stocks has pushed up valuations. The S&P 500 has a price-to-earnings ratio of 21.4 times expected 12-month earnings, well above its long-term average of 15.7, according to LSEG Datastream. With the scope for valuations to go higher now more limited, investors said that puts a greater burden on corporate earnings to be strong in order to support stock gains. Third-quarter reporting season kicks off next month. S&P 500 earnings for the period are expected to have climbed 5.4% from the prior year, and then jump nearly 13% in the fourth quarter, according to LSEG IBES. FedEx FDX.N shares tumbled on Friday after the delivery giant reported a steep quarterly profit drop and lowered its full-year revenue forecast. 'Extended multiples put pressure on macro data and fundamentals to support S&P 500 prices,' Scott Chronert, head of U.S. equity strategy at Citi, said in a report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wall-st-week-ahead---investor-focus-turns-to-data-election-earnings-after-fed-cut-/7793887.html	2024-09-22T10:45:03-07:00

Classes resume at Bangladesh university at heart of protests	Dhaka, Bangladesh — Students returned to classes at Bangladesh's Dhaka University on Sunday after a weeks-long shutdown sparked by a student-led uprising that toppled autocratic prime minister Sheikh Hasina. Tens of thousands demonstrated on campus and in the surrounding Shahbagh neighborhood as protests against job quotas morphed into a nationwide struggle to end Hasina's 15 years of iron-fisted rule. As the protests swelled in July, authorities shuttered the campus as part of a crackdown on the demonstrations that killed hundreds. Several of the top student protest leaders were enrolled at the university, some of whom were snatched by plainclothes police and held in custody for several days. On Sunday the lecture halls were full again, with students chatting in groups along tree-covered walkways and buying drinks and snacks at canteens. 'I feel so much better coming back to class after a long time,' said Arpita Das, who studies political science. 'It was like a new students' reception as our teacher welcomed us in class with flowers.' Das said she was present during a pitched battle on campus in July, when protesters and students backing Hasina's Awami League party fought each other with rocks, sticks and iron rods. 'We were used to the routine of going to classes, study and exams,' she said. 'We were in so much uncertainty about whether we could resume class again and complete our studies,' she added. Classes had started again in all but four or five departments said assistant proctor Mohammad Mahbub Quaisar, who was appointed after previous administrators loyal to Hasina resigned. 'Students are attending in a joyous mood,' he said. Hasina's government was accused of widespread abuses, including the mass detention and extrajudicial killing of political rivals. More than 600 people were killed in the weeks leading up to Hasina's ouster in early August, according to a preliminary United Nations report that said the toll was 'likely an underestimate.' Since her departure for exile in neighboring India, cabinet ministers and other senior members of Hasina's party have been arrested, and her government's appointees have been purged from courts and the central bank. In the leafy streets of the Shahbagh neighborhood, colorful new murals exhort the public to 'destroy the iron doors of prison' and celebrate Bangladesh's 'rebirth.' 'It was like we were in an oppressive era when we could not say anything,' said masters student Kalimulla Al Kafi, 25, of the crackdown ordered by Hasina. 'Today it feels like I am attending classes with freedom.' 'We can express ourselves freely.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/classes-resume-at-bangladesh-university-at-heart-of-protests-/7793994.html	2024-09-22T09:20:28-07:00	
Deadly bomb hits Pakistan police escorting convoy of foreign diplomats	Islamabad — A roadside bomb detonated near a convoy of foreign diplomats visiting Pakistan's scenic Swat district Sunday, killing at least one police officer and injuring several others. Police officials in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where the district is located, confirmed the casualties, saying the victims were part of the squad leading the convoy of about a dozen countries. They noted that all the foreign dignitaries were unharmed. The foreigners were mostly ambassadors from Russia, Portugal, Iran, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Tajikistan, Rwanda, Zimbabwe, Turkmenistan, Vietnam, and Bosnia and Herzegovina. 'All the ambassadors remained safe in the attack and had been shifted to a safe place before their departure to Islamabad,' said Mohammad Ali Gandapur, a senior provincial police officer. In a late evening statement, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry reported that 'the group of diplomats has returned safely to Islamabad.' Separately, Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif’s office stated that he condemned the attack as a 'cowardly terrorist' act. Russian Ambassador Albert Khorev’s office in Islamabad confirmed his presence in the convoy, along with several other ambassadors, saying they took part in a tourism summit in Swat. 'On the way to the hotel from the town of Mingora in Khyber-Pakhtunkwa, an escort vehicle hit a mine. Several policemen were injured, [but] diplomats were not harmed,' the Russian embassy wrote on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. No group claimed responsibility for Sunday’s rare attack in Swat, a former stronghold of the Terik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, an Islamist insurgent militant group waging deadly attacks against military and police forces in the province and elsewhere in the country. Pakistani Nobel Peace laureate Malala Yousafzai, a resident of Swat, was shot and seriously wounded by TTP militants in 2012, apparently in retaliation for her campaign to promote girls’ education in the largely conservative district. Malala was swiftly airlifted to Britain for treatment. TTP’s intensified attacks in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which borders Afghanistan, have killed more than 100 police and an equal number of civilians since the start of the year. Pakistan alleges that the extremist group is orchestrating the violence from Afghan sanctuaries and is being facilitated by Taliban rulers of the neighboring country. The Taliban government in Kabul, which is officially not recognized by any country, rejects the allegations, saying no foreign group, including TTP, is being allowed to use Afghan soil against other countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-bomb-hits-pakistan-police-escorting-convoy-of-foreign-diplomats-/7793957.html	2024-09-22T08:50:00-07:00

More shelter beds and a crackdown on tents mean fewer homeless encampments in San Francisco	SAN FRANCISCO — Sidewalks once teeming with tents, tarps and people passed out next to heaps of trash have largely disappeared from great swaths of San Francisco, a city widely known for its visible homeless population. The number of people sleeping outdoors dropped to under 3,000 in January, the lowest the city has recorded in a decade, according to a federal count. And that figure has likely dropped even lower since Mayor London Breed — a Democrat in a difficult reelection fight this November — started ramping up enforcement of anti-camping laws in August following a U.S. Supreme Court decision. Homelessness in no way has gone away, and in fact grew 7%, to 8,300 in January, according to the same federal count. But the problem is now notably out of the public eye, raising the question of where people have gone and whether the change marks a turning point in a crisis long associated with San Francisco. 'We’re seeing much cleaner sidewalks,' said Terry Asten Bennett, owner of Cliff’s Variety store in the city’s historically gay Castro neighborhood, adding that she hates to see homeless people shuffled around. 'But also, as a business owner, I need clean, inviting streets to encourage people to come and shop and visit our city,' she said. Advocates for homeless people say encampment sweeps that force people off the streets are an easy way to hide homelessness from public view. 'Shelter should always be transitional,' said Lukas Illa, an organizer with San Francisco's Coalition on Homelessness. 'We shouldn’t have folks be in there as the long-lasting solution.' Other California cities have also reported a drop in visible homelessness, thanks to improved outreach and more temporary housing. The beach city of Santa Cruz reported a 49% decline in people sleeping unsheltered this year, while Los Angeles recorded a 10% drop. San Francisco has increased the number of shelter beds and permanent supportive housing units by more than 50% over the past six years. At the same time, city officials are on track to eclipse the nearly 500 sweeps conducted last year, with Breed prioritizing bus tickets out of the city for homeless people and authorizing police to do more to stamp out tents. San Francisco police have issued at least 150 citations for illegal lodging since Aug. 1, surpassing the 60 citations over the entire previous three years. City crews also have removed more than 1,200 tents and structures. Tracking homeless people is extremely difficult and where all the people once living on San Francisco’s streets have gone is impossible to know. There are still people sleeping on sidewalks, some with just a blanket, and tents continue to crop up under freeway overpasses and more isolated corners of the city. But tents that once sprouted outside libraries and subway stations, and went on endlessly for blocks in the Mission, downtown and South of Market districts, are gone. Even the troubled Tenderloin district has seen progress. Steven Burcell, who became homeless a year ago after a shoulder injury cost him his job, moved into one of 60 new, tiny cabins in May after the car he was living in caught fire. Mission Cabins is a new type of emergency shelter that offers privacy and allows pets. But like all shelters, it has rules. No drugs, weapons or outside guests are allowed. Residents must consent to their rooms being searched. 'At the beginning, it was rough, you know, going in and just getting adjusted to being searched and having them look through your bags,' acknowledged Burcell, 51. His tidy 65-square-foot (6-square-meter) room contains a twin bed, pairs of shoes lined by a door that locks and opens onto a sunny courtyard that, on a recent morning, was filled with the voices of children playing at the elementary school next door. 'To have your own space inside here and close the door, not sharing anything with anybody,' he said, 'it’s huge.' But Burcell opposes encampment sweeps. He said two friends rejected beds because they thought — inaccurately, he said — the shelter would be infested with rodents. That did not stop crews from taking their tent and everything inside it. 'Now they have nothing. They don’t have any shelter at all,' he said. 'They just kind of wander around and take buses, like a lot of people do.' Since 2018, San Francisco has added 1,800 emergency shelter beds and nearly 5,000 permanent supportive housing units, where people pay 30% of their income toward rent and the rest is subsidized, bringing the total to more than 4,200 beds and 14,000 units. Breed, who first won office in June 2018, can claim credit for the expansion, although some plans were in place before she became mayor and her administration had huge financial help. The money came from the federal government battling the pandemic and a California governor — and onetime San Francisco mayor — who made fighting homelessness and tent encampments his priority. Gov. Gavin Newsom has pumped at least $24 billion into the effort since taking office in 2019, including a program to turn hotels into housing. San Francisco also benefited from a controversial 2018 wealth tax on the city’s tech titans that Breed opposed, saying companies would leave. There was no exodus and the pandemic overshadowed any fallout. The funds have helped get people off the streets and tripled the annual budget of the San Francisco Department of Homelessness and Supportive Housing from nearly $300 million in 2018 to $850 million this year. But the department's budget is expected to dip below $700 million next year, and that worries experts who say more is needed in a city where the median price of a home is $1.4 million. 'We still have a housing market that is way too expensive for way too many people. And as long as that continues to be the case, we’re going to see folks falling into homelessness,' said Alex Visotzky, a policy fellow with the National Alliance to End Homelessness. Advocates for the homeless say that's why city officials need to invest in more affordable housing. One such place is 835 Turk Street, a former hotel the city purchased and reopened two years ago as supportive housing. It's home to David Labogin, who lost his housing after his mother died. 'Of course, things could be a whole lot better,' he said, sitting on a single bed, 'but from where I came from, I got no complaints.' But housing takes longer to build, and converting old properties is not cheap. The city purchased 835 Turk for $25 million and spent $18 million — twice the estimated amount — rehabilitating it. Until then, shelters are adapting, accommodating couples and people with pets. It takes new residents about two weeks to adjust to the rules at Mission Cabins, said Steve Good, CEO of operator Five Keys. 'A few rules to keep them safe is better than living on the street, where there aren’t any rules,' he said. 'Amen,' said Patrick Richardson, 54, who stopped by to watch as Good was interviewed. He was on his way to a two-year college in Oakland where he is studying to be an X-ray technician. Richardson had been sleeping on couches and pavement when an outreach worker offered him a cabin. His new home, he said, 'rescued me.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-shelter-beds-and-a-crackdown-on-tents-mean-fewer-homeless-encampments-in-san-francisco-/7793900.html	2024-09-22T07:19:50-07:00	
Russian strike on Ukraine's Kharkiv wounds 21	Kharkiv, Ukraine — A Russian strike on a residential neighborhood in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv wounded 21 people including three minors, the regional governor said Sunday. Oleg Synegubov posted on Telegram that eight of the victims were hospitalized, two in critical condition, after the strike late Saturday, when dozens of people were asleep in the two multistory buildings that were hit. Russia has repeatedly targeted Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, near the Russian border in the country's east that counted 1.4 million inhabitants before Moscow launched its war in February 2022. Rescue workers used torches to search through the rubble, while one girl shook with sobs and held fast to a corridor wall, too scared to descend the stairs, and calling for her mother, an AFP reporter saw at the scene. A rescuer took her by the hand, saying, 'Everything is OK,' and guided her down to her mother, Oleksandra. 'It has just blown up. It's terrible in there, the place is a wreck,' she said. The city's mayor, Igor Terekhov, said at the site that 'As you can see, there are no military here.' 'Every day and every night Kharkiv suffers the hits,' he said. Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, said the attack showed why his forces needed to use weapons supplied by Western allies to strike deeper into Russian territory, which, so far, they have refused. 'We must reinforce our capabilities to better protect lives and ensure our security,' he said in a statement ahead of a U.S. trip this week, where he will address the U.N. General Assembly and hold talks in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-strike-on-ukraine-s-kharkiv-wounds-21-/7793797.html	2024-09-22T03:17:08-07:00	
Sri Lanka's Dissanayake and Premadasa head to presidential race runoff	COLOMBO, SRI LANKA — Marxist-leaning Anura Kumara Dissanayake and opposition leader Sajith Premadasa headed to a run-off for Sri Lanka's presidency on Sunday, the election body said, with a second round of counting to determine the winner using preferential votes. It is the first time in Sri Lanka's history that the presidential race is to be decided by a second round of counting after the top two candidates failed to win the mandatory 50% of votes to be declared winner. All remaining candidates, including incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, have been disqualified, the Election Commission told reporters. Dissanayake polled 39.5% of the counted ballots with Premadasa finishing second at 34%. Wickremesinghe, who led the heavily indebted nation's fragile economic recovery from a debilitating crisis in 2022, trailed in third with 17%. This is Sri Lanka's first election since the Indian Ocean nation's economy buckled in 2022 under a severe foreign exchange shortage, leaving it unable to pay for imports of essentials including fuel, medicine and cooking gas. Protests forced then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee and later resign. 'The election result clearly shows the uprising that we witnessed in 2022 is not over,' said Pradeep Peiris, a political scientist at University of Colombo. 'People have voted in line with those aspirations to have different political practices and political institutions. AKD (as Dissanayake is known) reflects these aspirations and people have rallied around him.' Dissanayake, 55, presented himself as the candidate of change for those reeling under austerity measures linked to a $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund bailout, promising to dissolve parliament within 45 days of taking office for a fresh mandate for his policies in general elections. He has worried investors with a manifesto pledging to slash taxes in the island nation, which could impact IMF fiscal targets, and a $25 billion debt rework. But during the campaign, he took a more conciliatory approach, saying any changes would be undertaken in consultation with the IMF and that he was committed to ensuring repayment of debt. Premadasa also pledged to renegotiate the contours of the IMF deal. Grinding poverty for millions Buttressed by the IMF deal, Sri Lanka's economy has posted a tentative recovery. It is expected to grow this year for the first time in three years and inflation has collapsed to 0.5% from a crisis peak of 70%. But the continued high cost of living was a critical issue for many voters, and millions remain mired in poverty, with many pinning hopes of a better future on the next leader. Voting was peaceful, although police declared a curfew across the island nation until noon (0630 GMT) as a precaution while vote counting continued. About 75% of the 17 million eligible voters cast their ballots, according to the commission. Dissanayake, known for stirring speeches, ran as a candidate for the National People's Power alliance, which includes his Marxist-leaning Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna party. Traditionally, Dissanayake's party has backed stronger state intervention, lower taxes and more closed market economic policies. Although JVP has just three seats in parliament, Dissanayake was boosted by his promises of tough anti-corruption measures and more pro-poor policies. He drew big crowds at rallies, calling on Sri Lankans to leave behind the suffering of the crisis. Premadasa, 57, entered politics after his father, President Ranasinghe Premadasa, was killed in a suicide bombing in 1993. The younger Premadasa polled 42% of the votes in 2019 to finish second, behind Rajapaksa, in the last presidential election. Premadasa's center-left party has promised tax changes to reduce living costs. Support from farming communities in north and central Sri Lanka helped him close the gap on Dissanayake as counting progressed. The winner will have to ensure Sri Lanka sticks with the IMF program until 2027 to get its economy on a stable growth path, reassure markets, repay debt, attract investors and help a quarter of its people climb out of poverty.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-s-dissanayake-and-premadasa-head-to-presidential-race-runoff/7793790.html	2024-09-22T02:43:41-07:00	
Alabama shooting leaves 4 dead, police say	BIRMINGHAM, Alabama — Four people have died and more than 20 were wounded in a shooting in a nightlife area in the U.S. state of Alabama, according to police and news reports. There were multiple people shot in Birmingham, the Birmingham Police Department said in a social media post. Birmingham Officer Truman Fitzgerald said the shooting, with up to 21 people wounded, happened shortly after 11 p.m., AL.COM reported. Fitzgerald said there were 'dozens of gunshot victims' and at least four had 'life-threatening' injuries, AL.COM reported. Birmingham Fire and Rescue Service pronounced the three victims dead on the scene and a fourth person was pronounced dead at University of Alabama at Birmingham Hospital, AL.COM reported. Police said the victims found dead at the scene included two men and a woman, WBMA-TV reported. Other victims were transported to hospitals in private vehicles, police told WBMA. The Birmingham police did not immediately respond to an email from The Associated Press seeking additional information. The Five Points South area of Birmingham has numerous entertainment venues, restaurants and bars and often is crowded on Saturday nights. Police said there were no immediate arrests. 'We will do everything we possibly can to make sure we uncover, identify and hunt down whoever is responsible for preying on our people this morning,' Fitzgerald told WBMA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/alabama-shooting-leaves-4-dead-police-say/7793779.html	2024-09-22T01:21:04-07:00	
Japan cracks down on bad-faith buyers as temple, shrine sales surge	SANBAGAWA, Japan — Benmou Suzuki's dilapidated 420-year-old temple, located deep in the forest near a tiny Japanese mountain village, hardly looks like prized real estate. Yet the monk was recently approached by two men, who said they were real estate brokers and wanted to know if he was interested in selling. He suspects they weren't really interested in the ornate building at the trailhead of a sacred mountain, but the special tax status that comes with running a religious property. 'There are people out there who want a temple, even a mountain temple like this. In fact, considering the value of the religious corporation status, this temple could fetch quite a lot of money,' said 52-year-old Suzuki. As Japan's population falls and interest in religion declines, there are fewer people to contribute to the upkeep of the country's numerous temples and shrines. Suzuki's Mikaboyama temple, for example, is located in Sanbagawa -- an area a three-hour drive from Tokyo with only 500 residents and which also has three other Buddhist temples, one Shinto shrine and a church. A surge in religious properties coming up for sale has Japanese authorities worried that prospective buyers are not interested in them for heavenly purposes. Rather they fear many are out to dodge taxes or possibly even launder money. 'It's already a sense of crisis for us and the religious community,' said an official at Japan's Agency for Cultural Affairs, which oversees religious sites. Cases of temple or shrine properties being extensively repurposed have triggered public outrage. In Osaka, a temple sold in 2020 was later razed and dozens of graves were relocated to make way for a property development. In Kyoto, a case about a temple that was demolished and turned into a parking lot made headlines this year. Owning a temple, shrine or church recognized as a religious corporation in Japan can confer sizeable tax benefits. Businesses under such corporations that offer religious services such as funerals do not have to pay taxes while other non-religious businesses also enjoy preferential tax rates. A wide range of undertakings are allowed from restaurants to hair salons to hotels. Japan had about 180,000 religious sites with corporation status as end-2023, according to the agency's data. The number of so-called inactive corporations -- such as those with no religious events for more than a year -- jumped by a third to more than 4,400. When monks or priests die without a successor, the overseeing religious group will usually appoint someone to take over or voluntarily relinquish the site's corporation status. However, there are around 7,000 religious sites that operate independently of these groups and are considered easy to acquire, according to the agency and specialist brokers. The cultural affairs agency said it has stepped up efforts to dissolve the corporation status of inactive religious sites to stop them from being targeted by dubious buyers. And when big earthquakes hit, often damaging temples and shrines, agency officials visit religious groups in those areas, warning them about falling prey to such buyers. Last year, 17 religious corporations were voluntarily dissolved and six were ordered to dissolve. The agency said the number would increase this year and next year as it ratchets up scrutiny. It might seem easier for Japan to change its laws to more strictly control the criteria for purchasing religious sites. But the agency said the government is wary about amending laws related to religion as that could be seen as impinging on religious freedom which is guaranteed by Japan's constitution. Reuters checks of six websites specializing in brokering the sale of religious properties showed hundreds on the market. Most are only obliquely described online with brokers saying sellers prefer to conduct sales as privately as possible. Osaka-based broker Takao Yamamoto told Reuters interest is surging. A religious corporation license alone can fetch 30 million yen ($210,000), he adds. Some religious sites, especially those with profitable graveyards, are advertised for millions of dollars. 'Anyone can buy independent sites as long as you have money...even foreigners can buy them. Recently, a lot of Chinese people are trying to buy them,' Yamamoto said. For his part, Suzuki says he has no intention to sell Mikaboyama temple and is working on ideas to raise funds to maintain it. 'Temples are places for local people to gather and forge connections. We just can't get rid of them,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-cracks-down-on-bad-faith-buyers-as-temple-shrine-sales-surge/7793040.html	2024-09-22T00:03:53-07:00	
Dolphins dying in Amazon lake made shallow by drought	TEFE, Brazil — The carcass of a baby dolphin lay on the sand bank left exposed by the receding waters in an Amazon lake that has been drying up during the worst drought on record. Researchers recovered the dead animal on Wednesday and measured water temperatures that have been rising as the lake's level drops. In last year's drought, more than 200 of the endangered freshwater dolphins died in Lake Tefe from excessive water temperatures. 'We've found several dead animals. Last week, we found one a day on average,' said Miriam Marmontel, head of the dolphin project at the Mamiraua Institute for Sustainable Development. 'We're not yet associating the deaths with changes in water temperatures, but with the exacerbation of the proximity between human populations, mainly fishermen, and the animals,' she said. With branches of major rivers in the Amazon basin drying up in this year's critical drought, the lake connected to the Solimoes River has shrunk, leaving less room for the dolphins in their favorite habitat. The lake's main channel is 2 meters deep and roughly 100 meters wide, and it is used by all the boat traffic, from canoes to heavy ferries, Marmontel said. Two dolphins were killed recently when boats ran into them in the shallow water. 'Nobody thought this drought would come so quickly or imagine that it would surpass last year's drought,' fisherman Clodomar Lima said. While the dolphin deaths are nowhere close to last year's toll, the dry season has more than a month to go and water levels will continue to decline, the researcher said. And it is not just the rare dolphin species that are suffering. Riverine communities across the Amazon are stranded by the lack of transport on waters too shallow for boats, and their floating houses are now on solid ground. Even houses built on stilts over water are now high and dry a distance from the river shore. Lake Tefe resident Francisco Alvaro Santos said it was the first time ever that his floating house was out of the water. 'Water is everything to us. It is part of our daily lives, the means of transportation for everyone who live here,' said Santos. 'Without water we are nobody!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dolphins-dying-in-amazon-lake-made-shallow-by-drought-/7793000.html	2024-09-22T00:03:13-07:00	
Kenyan church cult massacre that killed hundreds haunts survivors	MALINDI, Kenya — Shukran Karisa Mangi always showed up drunk at work, where he dug up the bodies of doomsday cult members buried in shallow graves. But the alcohol couldn't numb his shock the morning he found the body of a close friend, whose neck had been twisted so severely that his head and torso faced opposite directions. This violent death upset Mangi, who had already unearthed children's bodies. The number of bodies kept rising in this community off Kenya's coastline where extremist evangelical leader Paul Mackenzie is accused of instructing his followers to starve to death for the opportunity to meet Jesus. While he sometimes sees the remains of others when he tries to sleep, Mangi said recently, the recurring image of his friend's mutilated body torments him when he's awake. 'He died in a very cruel manner,' said Mangi, one of several gravediggers whose work was suspended earlier in the year as bodies piled up in the morgue. 'Most of the time, I still think about how he died.' In one of the deadliest cult-related massacres ever, at least 436 bodies have been recovered since police raided Good News International Church in a forest some 70 kilometers inland from the coastal town of Malindi. Seventeen months later, many in the area are still shaken by what happened despite repeated warnings about the church's leader. Mackenzie pleaded not guilty to charges in the murders of 191 children, multiple counts of manslaughter and other crimes. If convicted, he would spend the rest of his life in prison. Some in Malindi who spoke to The Associated Press said Mackenzie's confidence while in custody showed the wide-ranging power some evangelists project even as their teachings undermine government authority, break the law, or harm followers desperate for healing and other miracles. It's not only Mackenzie, said Thomas Kakala, a self-described bishop with the Malindi-based Jesus Cares Ministry International, referring to questionable pastors he knew in the capital, Nairobi. 'You look at them. If you are sober and you want to hear the word of God, you wouldn't go to their church,' he said. 'But the place is packed.' A man like Mackenzie, who refused to join the fellowship of pastors in Malindi and rarely quoted Scripture, could thrive in a country like Kenya, said Kakala. Six detectives have been suspended for ignoring multiple warnings about Mackenzie's illegal activities. Kenya, like much of East Africa, is dominated by Christians. While many are Anglican or Catholic, evangelical Christianity has spread widely since the 1980s. Many pastors style their ministries in the manner of successful American televangelists, investing in broadcasting and advertising. Many of Africa's evangelical churches are run like sole proprietorships, without the guidance of trustee boards or laity. Pastors are often unaccountable, deriving authority from their perceived ability to perform miracles or make prophecies. Some, like Mackenzie, can seem all-powerful. Mackenzie, a former street vendor and cab driver with a high school education, apprenticed with a Malindi preacher in the late 1990s. There, in the laid-back tourist town, he opened his own church in 2003. A charismatic preacher, he was said to perform miracles and exorcisms, and he could be generous with his money. His followers included teachers and police officers. They came to Malindi from across Kenya, giving Mackenzie national prominence that spread the pain of the deaths across the country. The first complaints against Mackenzie concerned his opposition to formal schooling and vaccination. He was briefly detained in 2019 for opposing the government's efforts to assign national identification numbers to Kenyans, saying the numbers were satanic. He closed his Malindi church premises later that year and urged his congregation to follow him to Shakahola, where he leased 800 acres of forest inhabited by elephants and big cats. Church members paid small sums to own plots in Shakahola, and were required to build houses and live in villages with biblical names like Nazareth, according to survivors. Mackenzie grew more demanding, with people from different villages forbidden from communicating or gathering, said former church member Salama Masha. 'What made me (realize) Mackenzie was not a good person was when he said that the children should fast to die,' said Masha, who escaped after witnessing the starvation deaths of two children. 'That's when I knew that it's not something I can do.' Mbatha Mackenzie, a mason who lives with his family and goats in a tin shack in Malindi, said that while Mackenzie was generous to his followers, he never treated his extended family with similar kindness. 'My brother — he seemed like a politician,' he said. 'They have a sweet tongue, and when he talks something to the people, people believe him.' A former church member who escaped Shakahola said she lost faith in Mackenzie when she saw how his men handled people on the verge of dying from starvation. She said Mackenzie's bodyguards would take the starving person away, never to be seen again. The woman said it was 'like a routine' for the bodyguards to rape women in the villages. She says she, too, was sexually assaulted by four men while she was pregnant with her fourth child. The Associated Press does not identify victims of alleged sexual assault unless they choose to publicly identify themselves. Those who tried to the leave the forest without Mackenzie's permission faced beatings, as did those who were caught breaking fast, according to former church members. Autopsies on more than 100 bodies showed deaths from starvation, strangulation, suffocation, and injuries from blunt objects. Mangi, the gravedigger, said he believed more mass graves were yet to be discovered in Shakahola. At least 600 people are reported missing, according to the Kenya Red Cross.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-church-cult-massacre-that-killed-hundreds-haunts-survivors/7791589.html	2024-09-22T00:02:17-07:00	
This US city is hailed as a vaccination success. Can it be sustained?	LOUISVILLE, Kentucky — On his first day of school at Newcomer Academy, Maikel Tejeda was whisked to the school library. The 7th grader didn't know why. He soon got the point: He was being given make-up vaccinations. Five of them. 'I don't have a problem with that,' said the 12-year-old, who moved from Cuba early this year. Across the library, a group of city, state and federal officials gathered to celebrate the school clinic, and the city. With U.S. childhood vaccination rates below their goals, Louisville and the state were being praised as success stories: Kentucky's vaccination rate for kindergarteners rose 2 percentage points in the 2022-23 school year compared with the year before. The rate for Jefferson County — which is Louisville — was up 4 percentage points. 'Progress is success,' said Dr. Mandy Cohen, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But that progress didn't last. Kentucky's school entry vaccination rate slipped last year. Jefferson County's rate slid, too. And the rates for both the county and state remain well below the target thresholds. It raises the question: If this is what success looks like, what does it say about the nation's ability to stop imported infections from turning into community outbreaks? Local officials believe they can get to herd immunity thresholds, but they acknowledge challenges that includes tight funding, misinformation and well-intended bureaucratic rules that can discourage doctors from giving kids shots. 'We're closing the gap,' said Eva Stone, who has managed the county school system's health services since 2018. 'We're not closing the gap very quickly.' Falling vaccination rates Public health experts focus on vaccination rates for kindergartners because schools can be cauldrons for germs and the launching pad for community outbreaks. For years, those rates were high, thanks largely to mandates that required key vaccinations as a condition of school attendance. But they have slid in recent years. When COVID-19 started hitting the U.S. hard in 2020, schools were closed, visits to pediatricians declined and vaccination record-keeping fell off. Meanwhile, more parents questioned routine childhood vaccinations that they used to automatically accept, an effect that experts attribute to misinformation and the political schism that emerged around COVID-19 vaccines. A Gallup survey released last month found that 40% of Americans said it is extremely important for parents to have their children vaccinated, down from 58% in 2019. Meanwhile, a recent University of Pennsylvania survey of 1,500 people found that about 1 in 4 U.S. adults think the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine causes autism — despite no medical evidence for it. All that has led more parents to seek exemptions to school entry vaccinations. The CDC has not yet reported national data for the 2023-24 school year, but the proportion of U.S. kindergartners exempted from school vaccination requirements the year before hit a record 3%. Overall, 93% of kindergartners got their required shots for the 2022-23 school year. The rate was 95% in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic. Officials worry slipping vaccination rates will lead to disease outbreaks. The roughly 250 U.S. measles cases reported so far this year are the most since 2019, and Oregon is seeing its largest outbreak in more than 30 years. Kentucky has been experiencing its worst outbreak of whooping cough — another vaccine-preventable disease — since 2017. Nationally, nearly 14,000 cases have been reported this year, the most since 2019. Persuading parents The whooping cough surge is a warning sign but also an opportunity, said Kim Tolley, a California-based historian who wrote a book last year on the vaccination of American schoolchildren. She called for a public relations campaign to 'get everybody behind' improving immunizations. Much of the discussion about raising vaccination rates centers on campaigns designed to educate parents about the importance of vaccinating children — especially those on the fence about getting shots for their kids. But experts are still hashing out what kind of messaging work best: Is it better, for example, to say 'vaccinate' or 'immunize''? A lot of the messaging is influenced by feedback from small focus groups. One takeaway is some people have less trust in health officials and even their own doctors than they once did. Another is that they strongly trust their own feelings about vaccines and what they've seen in Internet searches or heard from other sources. 'Their overconfidence is hard to shake. It's hard to poke holes in it,' said Mike Perry, who ran focus groups on behalf of a group called the Public Health Communications Collaborative. But many people seem more trusting of older vaccines. And they do seem to be at least curious about information they didn't know, including the history of research behind vaccines and the dangers of the diseases they were created to fight, he said. Improving access Dolores Albarracin has studied vaccination improvement strategies in 17 countries, and repeatedly found that the most effective strategy is to make it easier for kids to get vaccinated. 'In practice, most people are not vaccinating simply because they don't have money to take the bus' or have other troubles getting to appointments, said Albarracin, director of the communication science division within Penn's Annenberg Public Policy Center. That's a problem in Louisville, where officials say few doctors were providing vaccinations to children enrolled in Medicaid and fewer still were providing shots to kids without any health insurance. An analysis a few years ago indicated 1 in 5 children — about 20,000 kids — were not current on their vaccinations, and most of them were poor, said Stone, the county school health manager. A 30-year-old federal program called Vaccines for Children pays for vaccinations for children who Medicaid-eligible or lack the insurance to cover it. But in a meeting with the CDC director last month, Louisville health officials lamented that most local doctors don't participate in the program because of paperwork and other administrative headaches. And it can be tough for patients to get the time and transportation to get to those few dozen Louisville providers who do take part. The school system has tried to fill the gap. In 2019, it applied to become a VFC provider, and gradually established vaccine clinics. Last year, it held clinics at nearly all 160 schools, and it's doing the same thing this year. The first was at Newcomer Academy, where many immigrant students behind on their vaccinations are started in the school system. It's been challenging, Stone said. Funding is very limited. There are bureaucratic obstacles, and a growing influx of children from other countries who need shots. It takes multiple trips to a doctor or clinic to complete some vaccine series. And then there's the opposition — vaccination clinic announcements tend to draw hateful social media comments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/this-us-city-is-hailed-as-a-vaccination-success-can-it-be-sustained-/7791570.html	2024-09-22T00:01:24-07:00	
Refugees in New Hampshire turn to farming for income and a taste of home	DUNBARTON, New Hampshire — It's harvest time in central New Hampshire, and one farm there appears to have been transplanted from a distant continent. Farmers balance large crates laden with vegetables on their heads while chatting in Somali and other languages. As the sun burns away the early morning mist, the farmers pick American staples like corn and tomatoes as well as crops they grew up with, like okra and sorrel. Many of the women wear vibrant orange, red and blue fabrics. Most workers at this Dunbarton farm are refugees who have escaped harrowing wars and persecution. They come from the African nations of Burundi, Rwanda, Somalia and Congo, and they now run their own small businesses, selling their crops to local markets as well as to friends and connections in their ethnic communities. Farming provides them with both an income and a taste of home. 'I like it in the USA. I have my own job,' says Somali refugee and farmer Khadija Aliow as she hams it up by sashaying past a reporter, using one hand to steady the crate of crops on her head and the other to give a thumbs-up. 'Happy. I'm so happy.' The farm is owned by a New Hampshire-based nonprofit, the Organization for Refugee and Immigrant Success, which lets the farmers use plots of land and provides them with training and support. The organization runs similar farms in Concord and the nearby town of Boscawen. In all, 36 people from five African countries, including South Sudan, and the Asian nation of Nepal work on the farms. Many were farmers in their home countries before coming to the U.S. or had previous experience with agriculture, said Tom McGee, a program director with the nonprofit. 'These are farmers who are basically independent business owners, who are working in partnership with our organization to be able to bring this produce to life in this country,' he said. 'And to have another sense of purpose, and a way that they can bring themselves into the community and belong. And really participate in the American dream.' The nonprofit runs a food market in Manchester, where people can buy fresh produce or sign up to have boxes delivered. McGee said there are a few other programs with similar aims scattered throughout the U.S. but that the model remains relatively rare. He said his organization relies on state and federal funding, as well as private donations. Farmer Sylvain Bukasa said he escaped in 2000 from the decades-long conflict in Congo that has resulted in millions of deaths. He spent six years with his wife and son in a refugee camp in Tanzania before being accepted into the U.S. in 2006. 'I was worried for my safety,' he said. 'I decided to just go somewhere where it's a little bit safer.' Bukasa said he has worked hard since arriving in the U.S. and relishes his new life. But at first he missed the foods he grew up with. He could only find them in specialized markets, where they tended to be expensive and of poor quality. 'Back home we ate more vegetables and less meat,' he said. 'When we came here, it's more chicken, more pizza, things like that. They taste good, but it's not good for you.' Bukasa started growing crops on the farm in 2011. The initial plan on the Dunbarton farm was to allow migrants like him to grow traditional crops for themselves and their families. But demand grew, particularly during the pandemic, prompting the farm's evolution into a commercial operation. For a few of the farmers, the harvest provides their primary income. For most, like Bukasa, it's a side gig. He works fulltime as a service agent for a rental car company and travels whenever he can to tend his plot of just over 0.4 hectares. The biggest challenges are making sure his crops are adequately watered and stopping the weeds from taking over, he said. Mondays are harvest days, and on a recent Monday, Bukasa listed the crops he was picking: tomatoes, summer squash, zucchini, kale, corn, okra, and the leaves from pumpkins and sorrel — which he and the other migrants call sour-sour because of its taste. He said there's a surprisingly large Congolese community throughout New England, and they appreciate what he grows. 'It's a hard job, but hard work is good work,' Bukasa said. 'It's fun and it helps people. I like when I satisfy people with the food that they eat.' His dream is to one day buy his own farm with a couple of acres of land, so he can walk out his front door to tend to his crops rather than driving 20 minutes like he does now. A more immediate challenge, he said, is to work on the marketing side of his business. He's got to the point where he now grows more food than he's able to sell, and he hates seeing any of it go to waste. One idea is to buy a van, so he can deliver more produce himself. 'You see the competition in there,' he says with a grin, motioning toward the tent where other refugee farmers wash and pack their crops. 'See how many farmers are trying to sell their produce.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/refugees-in-new-hampshire-turn-to-farming-for-income-and-a-taste-of-home/7791526.html	2024-09-21T23:56:52-07:00	
Fortified bouillon cubes are seen as way to curb malnutrition in Africa	IBADAN, Nigeria — In her cramped, dimly lit kitchen, Idowu Bello leans over a gas cooker while stirring a pot of eba, the thick, starchy West African staple made from cassava root. Kidney problems and chronic exhaustion forced the 56-year-old Nigerian woman to retire from teaching, and she switches between cooking with gas or over a wood fire depending on the fuel she can afford. Financial constraints also limit the food Bello has on hand even though doctors have recommended a nutrient-rich diet both to improve her weakening health and to help her teenage daughter, Fatima, grow. Along with eba, on the menu today is melon soup with ponmo, an inexpensive condiment made from dried cowhide. 'Fish, meat, eggs, fruits, vegetables and even milk are costly these days,' Bello, 56, said, her lean face etched with worry. If public health advocates and the Nigerian government have their way, malnourished households in the West African nation soon will have a simple ingredient available to improve their intake of key vitamins and minerals. Government regulators on Tuesday are launching a code of standards for adding iron, zinc, folic acid and vitamin B12 to bouillon cubes at minimum levels recommended by experts. While the standards will be voluntary for manufacturers for now, their adoption could help accelerate progress against diets deficient in essential micronutrients, or what is known in nutrition and public health circles as 'hidden hunger.' Fortified bouillon cubes could avert up to 16.6 million cases of anemia and up to 11,000 deaths from neural tube defects in Nigeria, according to a new report from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. 'Regardless of economic situation or income level, everyone uses seasoning cubes,' Bello said as she unwrapped and dropped one in her melon soup. A growing and multipronged problem Making do with smaller portions and less nutritious foods is common among many Nigerian households, according to a recent government survey on dietary intake and micronutrients. The survey estimated that 79% of Nigerian households are food insecure. The climate crisis, which has seen extreme heat and unpredictable rainfall patterns hobble agriculture in Africa's troubled Sahel region, will worsen the problem, with several million children expected to experience growth problems due to malnutrition between now and 2050, according to the Gates Foundation report released Tuesday. 'Farmlands are destroyed, you have a shortage of food, the system is strained, leading to inflation making it difficult for the people to access foods, including animal-based proteins,' Augustine Okoruwa, a regional program manager at Helen Keller Intl, said, highlighting the link between malnutrition and climate change. Dietary deficiencies of the micronutrients the government wants added to bouillon cubes already have caused a public health crisis in Nigeria, including a high prevalence of anemia in women of child-bearing age, neural tube defects in newborn babies and stunted growth among children, according to Okoruwa. Helen Keller Intl, a New York-based nonprofit that works to address the causes of blindness and malnutrition, has partnered with the Gates Foundation and businesses and government agencies in Africa to promote food fortification. In Nigeria, recent economic policies such as the cancellation of gasoline subsidies are driving the country's worst cost-of-living crisis in generations, further deepening food hardship for the low-income earners who form the majority of the country's working population. Globally, nearly 3 billion people are unable to access healthy diets, 71% of them in developing countries, according to the World Health Organization. The large-scale production of fortified foods would unlock a new way to 'increase micronutrients in the food staples of low-income countries to create resilience for vulnerable families,' the Gates Foundation said. Bouillon cubes as the vehicle Bouillon cubes — those small blocks of evaporated meat or vegetable extracts and seasonings that typically are used to flavor soups and stews — are widely consumed in many African countries, nearing 100% household penetration in countries like Nigeria, Senegal, Ivory Coast, and Cameroon, according to a study by Helen Keller Intl. That makes the cubes the 'most cost-effective way' to add minerals and vitamins to the diets of millions of people, Okoruwa said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fortified-bouillon-cubes-are-seen-as-way-to-curb-malnutrition-in-africa/7790087.html	2024-09-21T23:53:42-07:00	
Dedicated artists keep Japan's ancient craft of temari alive	KAWARAMACHI, Japan — Time seems to stop here. Women sit in a small circle, quietly, painstakingly stitching patterns on balls the size of an orange, a stitch at a time. At the center of the circle is Eiko Araki, a master of the Sanuki Kagari Temari, a Japanese traditional craft passed down for more than 1,000 years on the southwestern island of Shikoku. Each ball — known as a 'temari' ball — is a work of art, with colorful geometric patterns carrying poetic names like 'firefly flowers' and 'layered stars.' A temari ball takes weeks or months to finish. Some cost hundreds of dollars (tens of thousands of yen), although others are much cheaper. These kaleidoscopic balls aren't for throwing or kicking around. They're destined to be heirlooms, carrying prayers for health and goodness. They might be treasured like a painting or piece of sculpture in a Western home. The concept behind temari is an elegant otherworldliness, an impractical beauty that is also very labor-intensive to create. 'Out of nothing, something this beautiful is born, bringing joy,' said Araki. 'I want it to be remembered there are beautiful things in this world that can only be made by hand.' Natural materials The region where temari originated was good for growing cotton, warm with little rainfall, and the spherical creations continue to be made out of the humble material. At Araki's studio, which also serves as head office for temari's preservation society, there are 140 hues of cotton thread, including delicate pinks and blues, as well as more vivid colors and all the subtle gradations in between. The women dye them by hand, using plants, flowers and other natural ingredients, including cochineal, which is a bug living in cacti that produces a red dye. The deeper shade of indigo is dyed again and again to turn just about black. Yellow and blue are combined to form gorgeous greens. Soy juice is added to deepen the tints, a dash of organic protein. Outside the studio, loops of cotton thread, in various tones of yellow today, hang outside in the shade to dry. Creating and embroidering the balls The arduous process starts with making the basic ball mold on which the stitching is done. Rice husks that are cooked then dried are placed in a piece of cotton, then wound with thread, over and over, until, almost magically, a ball appears in your hands. Then the stitching begins. The balls are surprisingly hard, so each stitch requires a concentrated, almost painful, push. The motifs must be precise and even. Each ball has lines to guide the stitching — one that goes around it like the equator, and others that zigzag to the top and bottom. Appealing to a new generation These days, temari is getting some new recognition, among Japanese and foreigners as well. Caroline Kennedy took lessons in the ball-making when she was United States ambassador to Japan a decade ago. Yoshie Nakamura, who promotes Japanese handcrafted art in her duty-free shop at Tokyo's Haneda airport, says she features temari there because of its intricate and delicate designs. 'Temari that might have been everyday in a faraway era is now being used for interior decoration,' she said. 'I really feel each Sanuki Kagari Temari speaks of a special, one-and-only existence in the world.' Araki has come up with newer designs that feel both modern and historical. She is trying to make the balls more accessible to everyday life — for instance, as Christmas tree ornaments. A strap with a dangling miniature ball, though quite hard to make because of its size, is affordable at about 1,500 yen ($10) each. Another of Araki's inventions is a cluster of pastel balls that opens and closes with tiny magnets. Fill it with sweet-smelling herbs for a kind of aromatic diffuser. A tradition passed down through generations Araki, a graceful woman who talks very slowly, her head cocked to one side as though always in thought, often travels to Tokyo to teach. But mostly she works and gives lessons in her studio, an abandoned kindergarten with faded blue paint and big windows with tired wooden frames. She started out as a metalwork artist. Her husband's parents were temari masters who worked hard to resurrect the artform when it was declining in the modern age, at risk of dying out. They were stoic people, rarely bestowing praise and instead always scolding her, she remembers. It's a tough-love approach that's common in the handing down of many Japanese traditional arts, from Kabuki acting to hogaku music, that demand lifetimes of selfless devotion. Today, only several dozen people, all women, can make the temari balls to traditional standards. 'The most challenging aspect is nurturing successors. It typically takes over 10 years to train them, so you need people who are willing to continue the craft for a very long time,' Araki said. 'When people start to feel joy along with the hardship that comes with making temari, they tend to keep going.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dedicated-artists-are-keeping-japan-s-ancient-craft-of-temari-alive-/7790066.html	2024-09-21T23:53:00-07:00	
At least 30 dead after explosion at Iran coal mine, state TV says	TEHRAN, Iran — A methane leak sparked an explosion at a coal mine in eastern Iran, killing at least 30 people and injuring 17 others, Iranian state media reported Sunday. Another 24 miners are believed to be trapped inside. The report said the deaths happened at a coal mine in Tabas, some 540 kilometers southeast of the capital, Tehran. Authorities were sending emergency personnel to the area after the blast late Saturday, it said. Around 70 people had been working there at the time of the blast. State TV later said 24 were believed to be trapped inside. Provincial Governor Mohammad Javad Qenaat told state TV that 30 miners had been killed and 17 injured. Iran's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, preparing to travel to New York for the United Nations General Assembly, said he ordered all efforts be made to rescue those trapped and aid their families. He also said an investigation into the incident had begun. Oil-producing Iran is also rich in a variety of minerals. Iran annually consumes some 3.5 million tons of coal but only extracts about 1.8 million tons from its mines per year. The rest is imported, often consumed in the country's steel mills. This is not the first disaster to strike Iran's mining industry. In 2013, 11 workers were killed in two separate mining incidents. In 2009, 20 workers were killed in several incidents. In 2017, a coal mine explosion killed at least 42 people. Lax safety standards and inadequate emergency services in mining areas are often blamed for the fatalities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-30-dead-after-explosion-at-iran-coal-mine-state-tv-says/7793769.html	2024-09-21T23:48:57-07:00	
Over 100 rockets fired from Lebanon into Israel	NAHARIYA, Israel — Over 100 rockets were fired into Israel from Lebanon early Sunday, with some landing near the northern city of Haifa, as Israel and the Hezbollah militant group appeared to be spiraling toward all-out war following months of escalating tensions. The rockets streaked over a wider and deeper area of northern Israel than previous volleys and set off air raid sirens across the region. The Israeli military said rockets had been fired 'toward civilian areas,' pointing to a possible escalation after previous barrages had mainly been aimed at military targets. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it treated four people for shrapnel wounds, including a 76-year-old man who was moderately wounded near Haifa, where buildings were damaged and cars set on fire. It was not immediately clear if the damage was caused by a rocket or an Israeli interceptor. The barrage came after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut killed at least 37 people, including one of Hezbollah's top leaders as well as women and children. Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of personal devices to explode just days earlier. The Israeli military said it carried out a wave of strikes across southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours, hitting some 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers. Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly a year ago, when the militant group began firing rockets in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. The low-level fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the frontier. Neither side is believed to be seeking a war. But in recent weeks, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon and vowed to bring back calm to the border so that its citizens can return to their homes. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly elusive as long-running negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly bogged down. The war in Gaza began with Hamas' October 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Gaza's Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed. It does not say how many were fighters but says women and children make up over half of the dead. Israeli media reported that rockets fired from Lebanon early Sunday were intercepted in the areas of Haifa and Nazareth, which are further south than most of the rocket fire to date. Israel canceled school across the north, deepening the sense of crisis. Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles — a new type of weapon the group had not used before — at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, 'in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.' In July, the group released a video with what it said was footage it had filmed of the base with surveillance drones. Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people — including two children — and wounding around 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility. On Friday, an Israeli airstrike took down an eight-story building in a densely populated neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs as Hezbollah members were meeting in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Ibrahim Akil, a top Hezbollah official who commanded the group's special forces unit, known as the Radwan Force. Lebanon's health minister, Firass Abiad, told reporters Saturday that at least seven women and three children were killed in Friday's airstrike on the building. He said another 68 people were injured, including 15 who were hospitalized. It was the deadliest strike on Beirut since the bruising monthlong war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah, and the casualty count could grow, with 23 people still missing, a government official said. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the attack broke up the group's chain of command while taking out Akil, who he said was responsible for Israeli deaths. He had been on the U.S. most wanted list for years, with a $7 million reward, over his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon during the civil war in the 1980s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-100-rockets-fired-from-lebanon-into-israel/7793765.html	2024-09-21T23:05:41-07:00	
Rescue workers search for at least 6 people missing after Japan flooding	TOKYO — Rescue workers searched for at least six people missing Sunday after heavy rain pounded Japan's northcentral region of Noto, triggering landslides and floods and leaving one person dead in a region still recovering from a deadly January 1 earthquake. The Japan Meteorological Agency on Saturday issued the highest alert level for heavy rain across several cities in the Ishikawa prefecture, including hard-hit cities Suzu and Wajima on the northern coast of the Noto peninsula. The agency has since downgraded the heavy rain alert and kept landslide and flooding warnings in place. In Suzu, one person died and another was missing after being swept in floodwaters. Another went missing in the nearby town of Noto, according to the prefecture. In Wajima, rescue workers were searching for four people missing following a landslide at a construction site. They were among 60 construction workers repairing a tunnel damaged by January's quake. The FDMA said another person was missing due to floods at a different location in the city. NHK footage at a coastal area of Wajima showed a wooden house torn and tilted after it was apparently hit by a landslide. No injuries were reported from the site. In Noto town, two people were seriously injured by a landslide while visiting their quake-damaged home. At least 16 rivers in Ishikawa breached their banks as of Saturday afternoon, according to the Land and Infrastructure Ministry. Residents were urged to use maximum caution against possible mudslides and building damage. By late afternoon Saturday, about 1,350 residents were taking shelter at designated community centers, school gymnasiums and other town facilities, authorities said. About 50 centimeters of rain has fallen in the region over the last three days, due to the rainbands that cause torrential rain above the Hokuriku region, JMA said. 'Heavy rain is hitting the region that had been badly damaged by the Noto earthquake, and I believe many people are feeling very uneasy,' said Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi. Hayashi said the government 'puts people's lives first' and its priority was search and rescue operations. He also called on the residents to pay close attention to the latest weather and evacuation advisories and take precautions early, adding that the Self Defense Force troops have been dispatched to Ishikawa to join rescue efforts. A resident in Wajima told NHK that he has just finished cleaning his house from the quake damage and it was depressing to now see it flooded by muddy water. A number of roads flooded by muddy water were also blocked. Hokuriku Electric Power Co. said more than 5,000 homes were still without power Sunday. Traffic lights were out in the affected areas. Many homes were also without water supply. Heavy rain also fell in nearby northern prefectures of Niigata and Yamagata, threatening flooding and other damages and suspending train operations, including the Yamagata Shinkansen bullet trains, officials said. A 7.6 magnitude earthquake struck the region on January 1, killing more than 370 people and damaging roads and other key infrastructure. Its aftermath still affects the local industry, economy and daily lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescue-workers-search-for-at-least-6-people-missing-after-japan-flooding/7793756.html	2024-09-21T21:53:11-07:00	
Germany's far-right AfD on track for another state election win	berlin — The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is predicted to come first in an election in Brandenburg on Sunday, seeking to build on gains in other eastern states this month and beat Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats in a traditional stronghold. The AfD became the first far-right party to win a state election in Germany since World War II, in Thuringia, on September 1 and just missed first place in Saxony. It is one of several far-right groups in Europe capitalizing on worries over an economic slowdown, immigration and the Ukraine war -- concerns that are particularly strong in formerly Communist-run eastern Germany. The party, which is unlikely to be able to govern because it is polling short of a majority and other parties would refuse to work with it, is also seeking to gain from discontent over infighting in Scholz's three-party federal coalition. 'We urgently need a thorough course correction so the country does not go to the dogs,' the AfD's lead candidate in Brandenburg, Hans-Christoph Berndt, said at a campaign event earlier this month. An AfD victory in the state election would be a particular embarrassment for the Social Democrats (SPD), which has won elections in Brandenburg and governed the state of 2.5 million people since reunification in 1990. It would also raise further questions about the suitability of Scholz, the least popular German chancellor on record, to lead the party into next year's election. Brandenburg's popular SPD premier Dietmar Woidke has mostly shunned campaigning with Scholz, who lives in the state's capital, Potsdam. In an unusual move, Woidke has also criticized the behavior and policies of the ruling coalition. Instead, he has sought to highlight economic success stories during the five years since the last state election such as the opening of a TeslaTSLA.O factory and Brandenburg airport -- which serves Berlin and is now Germany's third most important aviation hub. Narrow the gap In recent weeks, the SPD has managed to narrow the gap with the AfD, opinion polls have shown. A poll published by pollster Forschungsgruppe Wahlen on Thursday put the AfD on 28% in Brandenburg with the SPD just one point behind on 27%, followed by the conservatives on 14% and the new leftist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW) on 13%. 'My greatest challenge in this legislative period ... to not allow right-wing extremists to have anything to say in this country ever again,' Woidke said at a campaign event on Tuesday. He has threatened to resign if his party comes in behind the AfD. AfD party leader Tino Chrupalla said Scholz should do the same. 'It is high time this government suffer the consequences after this state election,' Chrupalla said. Both of Scholz's junior coalition partners, the Free Democrats and the Greens, look set to struggle to win the 5% needed to enter the state parliament, polls show. At a national level, the three parties in Scholz's coalition are now collectively polling less than the opposition conservatives although political analysts say much could change before the federal election due in September 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-far-right-afd-on-track-for-another-state-election-win/7793751.html	2024-09-21T21:12:46-07:00	
Sri Lanka's Marxist-leaning Dissanayake takes early lead in presidential race	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka's Marxist-leaning leader, Anura Kumara Dissanayake, grabbed a commanding early lead on Sunday in his bid to become the next president of the debt-ridden country seeking to elect a leader to bolster its fragile economic recovery. Dissanayake won about 53% of a million votes counted so far in the election, Sri Lanka's Election Commission data showed. Opposition leader Sajith Premadasa was second at 22%, ahead of President Ranil Wickremesinghe in third place. About 75% of the eligible 17 million people in the Indian Ocean island nation cast their votes in Saturday's election, according to the poll body. Dissanayake contested as candidate for the National People's Power alliance, which includes his Marxist-leaning Janatha Vimukthi Peremuna party that has traditionally backed stronger state intervention, lower taxes and more closed market economic policies. Although JVP has just three seats in parliament, the 55-year-old Dissanayake has been boosted by his promises of tough anti-corruption measures and more pro-poor policies. He presented himself as the candidate of change, promising to dissolve parliament within 45 days of coming to power in order to seek a fresh mandate for his policies in the general elections. 'After a long and arduous campaign, the results of the election are now clear,' Foreign Minister Ali Sabry said on X. 'Though I heavily campaigned for President Ranil Wickremasinghe, the people of Sri Lanka have made their decision, and I fully respect their mandate for Anura Kumara Dissanayake.' This was Sri Lanka's first election since the economy buckled in 2022 under a severe foreign exchange shortage, leaving the country unable to pay for imports of essentials including fuel, medicine and cooking gas. Thousands of protesters marched in Colombo in 2022 and occupied the president's office and residence, forcing then-President Gotabaya Rajapaksa to flee and later resign. Buttressed by a $2.9 billion bailout program from the International Monetary Fund, the economy has posted a tentative recovery, but the high cost of living was still a critical issue for many voters. Although inflation cooled to 0.5% last month from a crisis high of 70%, and the economy is forecast to grow in 2024 for the first time in three years, millions remain in poverty, with many pinning hopes of a better future on the next leader. The winner will have to ensure Sri Lanka sticks with the IMF program until 2027 to get its economy on a stable growth path, reassure markets, repay debt, attract investors and help a quarter of its people climb out of poverty. In his manifesto, Dissanayake, known for his ability to deliver stirring speeches, has pledged to slash taxes that would impact fiscal targets, leaving investors and market participants worried about his economic policies. However, during campaign speeches he has taken a more conciliatory approach, saying any changes would be undertaken in consultation with the IMF and that he is committed to ensuring repayment of debt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-s-marxist-leaning-dissanayake-takes-early-lead-in-presidential-race/7793734.html	2024-09-21T19:41:12-07:00	
Israeli forces raid Al Jazeera West Bank office, order 45-day closure	Jerusalem — Qatari broadcaster Al Jazeera said that Israeli forces raided its office in Ramallah in the occupied West Bank on Sunday and issued a 45-day closure order. 'There is a court ruling for closing down Al Jazeera for 45 days,' an Israeli soldier told Al Jazeera's West Bank bureau chief Walid al-Omari, the network reported, citing the conversation which was broadcast live. 'I ask you to take all the cameras and leave the office at this moment,' the soldier said. Footage showed heavily armed and masked troops entering the office. The broadcaster said the soldiers did not provide a reason for the closure order. The move was the latest Israeli action against Al Jazeera. Last week Israel's government announced it was revoking the press credentials of Al Jazeera journalists in the country, four months after banning the channel from operating inside Israel. The shutdown had not affected broadcasts from the West Bank or the Gaza Strip, from which Al Jazeera still covers Israel's war with Palestinian militants. The Israeli military has repeatedly accused journalists from the Qatari network of being 'terrorist agents' in Gaza affiliated with Hamas or its ally, Islamic Jihad. Al Jazeera denies the Israeli government's accusations and claims that Israel systematically targets its employees in the Gaza Strip.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-forces-raid-al-jazeera-west-bank-office-order-45-day-closure/7793731.html	2024-09-21T19:23:35-07:00

Biden tells Quad leaders Beijing is testing region at turbulent time for Chinese economy	CLAYMONT, Delaware — President Joe Biden told Indo-Pacific allies on Saturday that he believes China's increasing military assertiveness is an effort to test the region at a turbulent moment for Beijing. Biden's comments were caught by a hot mic after he and fellow leaders of the so-called Quad delivered opening remarks before the press at a summit he's hosting near his hometown of Wilmington, Delaware. He said his administration sees Beijing's actions as a 'change in tactic, not a change in strategy.' China is struggling to pull up an economy pummeled by the coronavirus pandemic and has seen an extended slowdown in industrial activity and real estate prices as Beijing faces pressure to ramp up spending to stimulate demand. 'China continues to behave aggressively, testing us all across the region, and it's true in the South China Sea, the East China Sea, South China, South Asia and the Taiwan Straits,' Biden told Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida. 'At least from our perspective, we believe (Chinese President) Xi Jinping is looking to focus on domestic economic challenges and minimize the turbulence in China's diplomatic relationships, and he's also looking to buy himself some diplomatic space, in my view, to aggressively pursue China's interest,' Biden added. Starting with a trade war that dates back to 2018, China and the United States have grown at odds over a range of issues, from global security, such as China's claims over the South China Sea, to industrial policy on electric vehicle and solar panel manufacturing. The administration has repeatedly voiced concerns about Chinese aggression toward Taiwan and more recently on the frequent clashes between Chinese and Philippine vessels in disputed areas of the South China Sea. At the summit, the leaders agreed to expand the partnership among the coast guards of the Quad nations to improve interoperability and capabilities, with Indian, Japanese and Australian personnel sailing on U.S. ships in the region. But U.S. officials would not say if those transits would include the contested South China Sea. China also has longtime territorial disputes involving other claimants including Vietnam, Taiwan, Malaysia and Brunei. U.S. officials worry about China's long-stated goals of unifying Taiwan with China's mainland and the possibility of war over Taiwan. The self-ruled island democracy is claimed by Beijing as part of its territory. The leaders in a joint declaration issued following their talks expressed 'serious concern about the militarization ... and coercive and intimidating maneuvers in the South China Sea.' Biden last month dispatched his national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to Beijing for three days of talks with Chinese officials. Sullivan during that visit also met with Xi. Both governments are eager to keep relations on an even keel ahead of a change in the U.S. presidency in January. And both sides have said they remain committed to managing the relationship, following up on a meeting between Xi and Biden in San Francisco last November. The concerns about China were raised as Biden showed off a slice of his Delaware hometown to the leaders of Australia, Japan and India. When Biden began his presidency, he looked to elevate the Quad to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend's summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021. 'It will survive way beyond November,' Biden told the leaders. The president, who has admitted to an uneven track record as a scholar, also seemed tickled to get to host a gathering with three world leaders at the school he attended more than 60 years ago. He welcomed each of the leaders individually for one-on-one talks at his nearby home before they gathered at the school for talks and a formal dinner. 'I don't think the headmaster of this school thought I'd be presiding over a meeting like this,' Biden joked to fellow leaders. Albanese, Modi and Kishida came for the summit before their appearances at the U.N. General Assembly in New York next week. 'This place could not be better suited for my final visit as prime minister,' said Kishida, who like Biden, is set to soon leave office. Earlier, the president warmly greeted Kishida when he arrived at the residence on Saturday morning and gave the prime minister a tour of the property before they settled into talks. White House officials said holding the talks at the president's house, which sits near a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown, was intended to give the meetings a more relaxed feel. Sullivan described the vibe of Biden's one-on-one meeting with Albanese, who stopped by the house on Friday, as 'two guys — one at the other guy's home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.' He said Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers. The Australian leader remarked that the visit had given him 'insight into what in my view makes you such an extraordinary world leader.' Modi also stopped by the house on Saturday to meet with Biden before the leaders gathered for their joint talks. 'There cannot be a better place than President Biden's hometown of Wilmington to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Quad,' Modi said. Biden and Modi discussed Modi's recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia's invasion of Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-tells-quad-leaders-beijing-is-testing-region-at-turbulent-time-for-chinese-economy-/7793722.html	2024-09-21T18:17:35-07:00	
Chad floods kill 503, affect 1.7 million people, UN says	N'Djamena, Chad — Severe flooding in Chad since July has claimed 503 lives and affected around 1.7 million people since July, the United Nations said Saturday in its latest assessment of the disaster. The floods have destroyed 212,111 houses, flooded 357,832 hectares of fields, and drowned 69,659 heads of cattle, said the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Chad. All of the country's provinces have been hit, Chad's water and energy minister Marcelin Kanabe Passale told journalists Saturday morning, warning of more trouble to come. 'The waters of the Logone and Chari rivers have reached a critical height likely to cause obvious serious flooding in the coming days,' Passale said. N'Djamena, Chad's capital, is located where the Logone and Chari rivers flow into each other. Passale recommended that all water from private wells be treated with chlorine before consumption. A flood-monitoring committee had been set up to 'assess the risks associated with the pollution of drinking water supplies and rising river levels,' he added. The U.N. warned in early September of the impact of 'torrential rains and severe flooding' in the wider region, particularly in Chad, calling for immediate action and funding to tackle climate change. This summer has been the hottest recorded globally since records have been kept, with a slew of record temperatures, heatwaves, drought and severe flooding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-floods-kill-503-affect-1-7-million-people-un-says-/7793700.html	2024-09-21T17:23:02-07:00	
FBI agents board vessel managed by company whose ship crashed into US bridge	BALTIMORE — Federal agents on Saturday boarded a vessel managed by the same company that managed a cargo ship that caused a deadly bridge collapse in Baltimore, Maryland, the FBI confirmed. In statements, spokespeople for the FBI and the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Maryland confirmed that authorities boarded the Maersk Saltoro. The ship is managed by Synergy Marine Group. 'The Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Criminal Investigation Division and Coast Guard Investigative Services are present aboard the Maersk Saltoro conducting court authorized law enforcement activity,' statements from both the FBI and U.S. Attorney’s Office said Saturday morning. Authorities did not offer further specifics. The Washington Post first reported on federal authorities boarding the ship. The raid came several months after investigators conducted a similar search of the Dali, the cargo ship that crashed into the bridge. In a lawsuit filed Wednesday, the U.S. Justice Department alleged that Dali owner Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and manager Synergy Marine, both of Singapore, recklessly cut corners and ignored known electrical problems on the vessel, which lost power multiple times minutes before it crashed into a support column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. The Justice Department said mechanical and electrical systems on the massive ship had been 'jury-rigged' and improperly maintained, culminating in the power outages and a cascade of other failures that left its pilots and crew helpless in the face of looming disaster. The ship was leaving Baltimore for Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss. Six members of a road work crew were killed when the bridge crumbled into the water. The collapse also snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore for months before the channel was fully reopened in June. The Justice Department is seeking to recover more than $100 million the government spent to clear the underwater debris and reopen the city’s port. The companies filed a court petition days after the collapse seeking to limit their legal liability in what could become the most expensive marine casualty case in history. Justice Department officials said there is no legal support for that bid to limit liability and pledged to vigorously contest it. In its lawsuit, which also seeks punitive damages, the Justice Department argued that vessel owners and operators need to be 'deterred from engaging in such reckless and exceedingly harmful behavior.' That includes Grace Ocean and Synergy themselves because the Dali has a 'sister ship,' authorities wrote in the claim. The two companies 'need to be deterred because they continue to operate their vessels, including a sister ship to the Dali, in U.S. waters and benefit economically from those activities,' the lawsuit says. Darrell Wilson, a Grace Ocean spokesperson, confirmed that the FBI and Coast Guard boarded the Maersk Saltoro in the Port of Baltimore on Saturday morning. Wilson has previously said the owner and manager 'look forward to our day in court to set the record straight.' Like the Dali, the Singapore-flagged Saltoro was built by Hyundai in 2015. According to the Justice Department lawsuit, major issues with the Dali’s electrical system might have resulted from excessive vibrations on the ship that can loosen wires and damage connections. A prior captain of the vessel had reported 'heavy vibration' in his handover notes in May 2023, saying he had made similar reports to Synergy in the past, according to the complaint. The lawsuit noted cracked equipment in the engine room and pieces of cargo shaken loose. The ship’s electrical equipment was in such bad condition that an independent agency stopped further electrical testing because of safety concerns, according to the lawsuit. The ship had also experienced power outages while it was still docked in Baltimore. Those blackouts are considered 'reportable marine casualties' that must be reported to the U.S. Coast Guard, which authorities say never happened. The Dali, which was stuck amid the wreckage of the collapse for months before it could be extricated and refloated, departed Norfolk, Virginia, on Thursday afternoon en route to China on its first international voyage since the March 26 disaster. Justice Department officials refused to answer questions Wednesday about whether a criminal investigation into the bridge collapse remains ongoing. FBI agents boarded the Dali in April.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fbi-agents-have-boarded-vessel-managed-by-company-whose-ship-collapsed-baltimore-bridge-/7793702.html	2024-09-21T17:19:59-07:00	
Hong Kong diaspora media in Britain reports 'government-backed attacks'	london — The Chaser, a news website run by Hong Kong journalists in Britain, says Google informed the diaspora media outlet that its company email was being targeted by 'government-backed attacks.' China is presumed to be behind the attacks, something Beijing denies. Analysts say the case highlights the growing difficulties Hong Kong journalists face both at home and overseas. On Tuesday, The Chaser published a report about the incident on its website, including a screenshot of the email from Google about the government-backed attack. The email listed the severity of the attack as high. According to Google, only 0.1% of users worldwide have been subjected to similar attacks. Google also pointed out that it cannot rule out that the warning may be a false alarm, but the company believes it has detected suspicious activities. These could include attempts to steal passwords or personal information through emails containing harmful attachments, harmful software download links or links to fake websites. VOA reached out to Google for more details on the attack but has yet to receive a response. 'There is no way out' The Chaser said it immediately reviewed all online security measures after receiving the notice and has taken the necessary protective actions. The Chaser said in a statement, 'At a time when Hong Kong's press is mired in the White Terror, the invisible black hand has unscrupulously reached out to the diaspora media overseas. 'Our team members are from Hong Kong and came to the UK three years ago, hoping to continue chasing news on free soil. In today's turbulent world of press freedom in Hong Kong, there is no way out. Our team strongly condemns all threats to press freedom and pledges to remain at our posts.' VOA efforts to seek a response from China's Embassy in Britain were unsuccessful, but the Chinese Embassy in Washington denied that China was involved in the cyberattack. 'China firmly opposes and cracks down on all forms of cyberattacks in accordance with law. Without valid evidence, they jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations against China,' the embassy said in an emailed statement Thursday. 'It is extremely irresponsible and is a complete distortion of facts. China firmly opposes this.' Last month, The Chaser released an investigative report that said the Chinese Embassy in Britain had pressured Dragons Teaching, a British publishing house, in 2018 to remove the phrase 'Republic of China' from chapters about Taiwan in Chinese textbooks. The Republic of China is Taiwan's official name. Beijing is relentless in its global campaign to quash any recognition of the democratically ruled island — no matter how small. The publishing house eventually gave in to pressure from Beijing, according to the report from The Chaser. The textbooks are used in exams for secondary school courses in Britain. The Chinese Embassy in Britain has declined to comment on the incident and report, though other British media picked up the story. Journalists report harassment The cyberattack comes as journalists in Hong Kong are under increasing pressure. Last week, the Hong Kong Journalists Association said that from June to August of this year, dozens of journalists, their families, employers, landlords or neighbors were harassed and intimidated in different ways on the internet and in their daily lives, which was unprecedented. Benson Wong, a Hong Kong political scholar living in Britain, doesn't believe the attacks on The Chaser and other Hong Kong journalists are purely coincidental, especially as China's National Day is approaching. 'From their point of view, it is understandable that the national security and intelligence units would do some things or do some 'homework' as part of their performance,' he said. He said he believes the attack is meant to send a signal that Hong Kong journalists who make critical remarks about China cannot expect to be safe from interference or even attacks just because they move overseas. VOA reached out to Britain's National Cyber Security Center for comment on the attack but has yet to receive a response.

Japanese boy’s death sparks worry, debate	washington — The killing of a Japanese schoolboy in southern China has sparked worry among Japanese expatriots living in China, while online comments from Chinese people show reactions ranging from shock to cynicism. The 10-year-old boy, surnamed Shen, was stabbed by a 44-year-old man while the boy was on his way to class on the morning of September 18 near a Japanese school in the southern city of Shenzhen, according to China’s Foreign Ministry. The child, whose father is Japanese and mother is Chinese, was a Japanese national, according to the ministry. He was taken to a hospital and later died of his injuries. The boy was attending Shenzhen Japanese School, an international school built to serve the children of Japanese expatriots living in the region, an industrial hub where many Japanese firms, especially auto companies, set up factories decades ago. Only Japanese citizens are qualified to go to this school. A Shenzhen local newspaper said the suspect, surnamed Zhong, acted alone and was arrested by police on site. The same report said Zhong has confessed to stabbing the boy. Zhong, who has a previous criminal record, was released on bail by local police on suspicion of 'damaging public telecommunications facilities' in 2015 and was detained on suspicion of 'fabricating facts and disturbing public order' in 2019, according to the report. Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida expressed his condolences in a tweet on X, calling it 'an extremely despicable crime,' and strongly urged China 'to provide an explanation of the facts of the situation.' The stabbing was the third high-profile attack on a foreigner in China in recent months. In June, a Chinese man wounded a Japanese woman and her child in a stabbing attack in front of a school bus in the eastern city of Suzhou. The man also stabbed a Chinese bus attendant who tried to intervene, and the attendant later died of her injuries. Also in June, four U.S. college instructors teaching in the northeastern city of Jilin were stabbed while visiting a public park. The American teachers suffered minor injuries and have since returned to the United States. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said these attacks are 'isolated incidents' and said they would safeguard expatriots’ security in China. However, the Chinese government is notoriously secretive about criminal investigations. Very little information has been published about the two attacks in June beyond the suspects’ last names and their employment status. Nicholas Burns, the United States ambassador to China, criticized Beijing’s limited release of specifics and said that he was actively pressing for more details. Japanese firms, especially auto companies with a presence in China, have warned their workers to stay vigilant. Toshiba and Toyota have told their staff to take precautions against any possible violence. Panasonic is offering its employees free flights home. Mitsubishi and Nissan have communicated with their Japanese employees in China to ease their worries and offered counseling services. Consequence of xenophobia propaganda Meanwhile, Chinese people have shown contrasting reactions in their online comments about the latest stabbing incident. Some expressed shock, sadness and anger. A few local residents in Shenzhen laid flowers and notes of apology to the deceased child outside the Japanese school. A user called 'sara jon' said on X, 'Aren’t you heartbroken when you hear the boy’s mother cry. This is a terrorist attack, this is Hamas.' Another X user called 'Jamy felando' said, 'Poor child, hope he gets peace now and hope the devil goes to hell!' On China’s X-like but censored social platform Weibo, many expressed cynicism and indifference, viewing the attack in light of atrocities committed during Japan's invasion of China 80 years ago. 'The boomerang of the Japanese invaders finally came back to their own people,' wrote a Weibo user called yaxuefensitangtaijia. 'If they had not invaded China and massacred the Chinese, perhaps there would be less extreme anti-Japanese sentiment today.' Someone else said in agreement: 'How many Chinese children died when Japan invaded China?' It’s not clear if Zhong deliberately chose to commit his crime on September 18, a date considered by many Chinese as 'national humiliation day.' The Japanese army officially launched its invasion of China on September 18, 1931, leading to a 14-year-long war and estimated casualties of 10 million military and civilians. Some Chinese say long-lasting anti-Japan propaganda by the Chinese government led to the violence toward Japanese people. A user called 'still typhoon' compared the propaganda to poison on Weibo: 'The poison has backfired. Xenophobia and extreme nationalism are rampant online now.' On Friday, the Chinese Foreign Ministry announced that 'China and Japan reached a consensus' on the discharge of radioactive water from the Fukushima nuclear plant, bringing to an end a diplomatic dispute that had rumbled on for more than two years. Beijing had been bashing Tokyo for causing 'a major nuclear safety issue with cross-border implications,' when Tokyo started discharging treated radioactive water from the site in August 2023. It also announced a blanket ban on all aquatic products from Japan. The anti-Japan sentiment reached a climax in August when official Chinese news media lashed out against Japan relentlessly.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japanese-boy-s-death-sparks-worry-debate-/7793024.html	2024-09-21T16:20:47-07:00

2 months after divisive elections, France announces center-right government	paris — The French presidential palace unveiled a new center-right government Saturday, more than two months after elections that produced a hung parliament and deepened political divisions as France grapples with economic and diplomatic challenges. Conservative French Prime Minister Michel Barnier put together the government after weeks of difficult negotiations, and President Emmanuel Macron approved it. The new government was announced at the presidential palace. A left-wing coalition secured the most seats in June-July elections but failed to win an outright majority. The 38-member Cabinet announced Saturday includes primarily ministers from Macron's centrist alliance and the conservative Republicans party. Jean-Noel Barrot is the new foreign minister, a centrist politician from MoDem known for his work in digital transformation and European affairs. He brings extensive experience in navigating complex international issues, notably within the European Union. The new finance minister is Antoine Armand, an emerging figure in French politics now tasked with steering France's fiscal policies and managing the upcoming 2025 budget amid pressure from Brussels to address France's mounting debt. Sebastien Lecornu retains his post as defense minister. He has been instrumental in bolstering France's military capabilities, including modernizing defense systems and managing military aid to Ukraine. His leadership in defense will be crucial as France navigates its role within NATO and handles rising geopolitical tensions over the wars in Ukraine and the Mideast. The interior minister’s job goes to Bruno Retailleau, a staunch conservative who will now handle critical domestic issues such as national security, immigration, and law enforcement. Barnier's ability to govern effectively is under scrutiny, with his political opponents on the left vowing to challenge him at every turn. The party of far-left Jean-Luc Melenchon, France Unbowed, held protests Saturday against his government and calls Barnier's appointment a rejection of the voters' will. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally said it would monitor the government closely and has enough votes in parliament to bring it down but expressed willingness to cooperate on key budgetary issues.	https://www.voanews.com/a/months-after-divisive-elections-france-announces-center-right-government/7793501.html	2024-09-21T16:02:39-07:00	
Biden and Japan's Kishida discuss shared concerns over South China Sea	washington — President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida discussed diplomacy with China and their shared concerns over 'coercive and destabilizing activities' in the South China Sea during a meeting on Saturday at the Quad Leaders Summit in Wilmington, Delaware, the White House said. Biden and Kishida also reiterated their resolve to maintain peace across the Taiwan strait and commitment to developing and protecting technologies such as artificial intelligence and semiconductors, the White House said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-and-japan-s-kishida-discuss-shared-concerns-over-south-china-sea/7793498.html	2024-09-21T15:43:57-07:00	
In final months in office, Biden puts personal touch on Asia-Pacific diplomacy	WILMINGTON, Delaware — U.S. President Joe Biden is showcasing the Indo-Pacific partnership he has nurtured since taking office as he hosts the leaders of Australia, Japan and India in his hometown Saturday with an eye on his legacy as well. When Biden entered the White House, he looked to elevate the so-called Quad, which until then had only met at the foreign minister level, to a leader-level partnership as he tried to pivot U.S. foreign policy away from conflicts in the Middle East and toward threats and opportunities in the Indo-Pacific. This weekend's summit is the fourth in-person and sixth overall gathering of the leaders since 2021. Biden put a personal touch on the engagement — potentially the last of the group before he leaves office on January 20 — by opening his home in Wilmington, Delaware, to each of the leaders and hosting a joint meeting and formal dinner at the high school he attended more than 60 years ago. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida came for the meetings before their appearances at the United Nations General Assembly in New York next week. 'You guys have heard the president say many times that all politics is personal, all diplomacy is personal,' White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters as meetings were set to get underway. 'And developing personal relationships has been core to his approach to foreign policy as president. So, opening his home to the leaders of India, Japan and Australia is a way of him showing, not just saying, but these leaders matter to him.' Biden welcomes Albanese to his home On Friday afternoon, Biden welcomed Albanese to his home on a pond in a wooded area several miles west of downtown. Saturday's agenda included hosting Kishida and Modi and bringing all the leaders together for talks at Archmere Academy in nearby Claymont. Sullivan described the vibe of the meeting with Albanese as 'two guys — one at the other guy’s home — talking in broad strokes about where they see the state of the world.' He said Biden and Albanese also swapped stories about their political careers. Reporters and photographers were prohibited from covering Biden’s individual meetings with the leaders, and Biden does not plan to do a news conference — a question-and-answer appearance that is typical at such international summits. As part of the summit, the leaders were set to announce new initiatives to bolster maritime security in the region — with enhanced coast guard collaboration through the Pacific and Indian oceans — and improve cooperation on humanitarian response missions. The measures are meant to serve as a counterweight to an increasingly assertive China. Sullivan said he expected Biden and Modi would discuss Modi's recent visits to Russia and Ukraine as well as economic and security concerns about China. Modi is the most prominent leader from a nation that maintains a neutral position on Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Sullivan said Biden would underscore 'that countries like India should step up and support the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity' and that 'every country, everywhere, should refrain from supplying inputs to Russia’s war machine.' Biden, Kishida say farewell The gathering was also an opportunity for Biden and Japan's Kishida to bid each other farewell. Biden and Kishida, who are both stepping away from office amid sliding public support, count the tightening of security and economic ties among the U.S., Japan and South Korea as one of their most significant accomplishments. The two leaders sat down for their wide-ranging, one-on-one conversation on Saturday morning. The improved relations between Japan and South Korea, two nations with a deep and complicated history that have struggled to stay on speaking terms, have come amid worrying developments in the Pacific, including strides made by North Korea in its nuclear program and increasing Chinese assertiveness. Biden commended Kishida for demonstrating 'courage and conviction in strengthening ties' with South Korea, according to the White House. They also discussed China's 'coercive and destabilizing activities' in the Pacific, Russia's war against Ukraine, and emerging technology issues. The U.S. and Japan are negotiating through a rare moment of tension in the relationship. Biden, as well as presidential candidates Kamala Harris and Donald Trump, have opposed a $15 billion bid by Japan’s Nippon Steel to take over American-owned U.S. Steel. Biden administration officials indicated this week that a U.S. government committee's formal assessment of the proposed deal has yet to be submitted to the White House and may not come until after the November 5 election. Sullivan pushed back against speculation that the expected timing of the report could suggest Biden is having second thoughts about his opposition to the deal. The Biden administration promised that the leaders would issue a joint statement containing the strongest-ever language on China and North Korea to be agreed upon by the four countries. The White House said the leaders would also roll out an announcement related to Biden’s Cancer Moonshot Initiative, a long-running passion project of the president and his wife, Jill Biden, aimed at reducing cancer deaths. The Bidens’ son Beau died in 2015 at age 46 of brain cancer. White House officials said the leaders will unveil details about a new collaboration aimed at reducing cervical cancer in the Indo-Pacific. As Biden’s time in office draws down, the White House also was celebrating the bipartisan, bicameral formation of a 'Quad Caucus' in Congress meant to ensure the longevity of the partnership regardless of the outcome of the November election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-final-months-in-office-biden-puts-personal-touch-on-asia-pacific-diplomacy/7793491.html	2024-09-21T15:32:39-07:00	
Kenya's president visits Haiti as UN considers future of peacekeeping efforts	PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti — Kenyan President William Ruto arrived in Haiti on Saturday as the United Nations considers how to best support a peacekeeping mission of resource-strapped Kenyan and Jamaican forces that are struggling to contain the gangs terrorizing the Caribbean nation. Ruto stepped off the plane, walking past armed officers on a small patch of red carpet flanked by other officials. He headed to a Kenyan base at the airport where he was expected to meet with some of the police officers who are battling the gangs. Kenya was the first nation to send forces as part of a larger effort by the U.N. to offer international support to Haiti, which descended into turmoil following the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. About 400 Kenyan police are in Haiti. Earlier this month, about two dozen police officers and soldiers from Jamaica arrived in the country. But the United States and other countries have said that the forces aren't enough and lack resources to take on gangs, which control about 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince. The mission is expected to have a total of 2,500 personnel, with the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad also pledging to send police and soldiers, although it wasn't clear when that would happen. While the U.S. has suggested a U.N. peacekeeping force, the idea would be far-fetched and controversial given the cholera and sexual abuse cases that occurred when United Nations troops were last in Haiti. Meanwhile, a U.N. human rights expert warned on Friday that gang violence is spreading across Haiti and that Haiti's National Police still lack the 'logistical and technical capacity' to fight gangs, which continue to expand into new territory. Ruto's visit also comes days after Haiti created a provisional electoral council long sought by the international community to facilitate the first general election held in the country since 2016. In the power vacuum left by Moise's assassination, gangs have seized more and more power. Many hope a general election will also help restore order to Haiti alongside the peacekeeping mission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-s-president-visits-haiti-as-un-considers-future-of-peacekeeping-efforts/7793479.html	2024-09-21T14:38:30-07:00	
Iran's supreme leader says Israel is committing 'shameless crimes' against children		https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-supreme-leader-says-israel-is-committing-shameless-crimes-against-children-/7793470.html	2024-09-21T14:17:35-07:00	
Zelenskyy will visit US ammunition factory to thank workers	washington — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Sunday will visit the U.S. ammunition factory that is producing one of the most critically needed munitions for Ukraine's fight to fend off Russian ground forces. Zelenskyy is expected to go to the Scranton Army Ammunition Plant in the state of Pennsylvania to kick off a busy week in the United States shoring up support for Ukraine in the war, according to two U.S. officials and a third familiar with Zelenskyy's schedule who spoke on the condition of anonymity to provide details that were not yet public. The Ukrainian leader also will address the United Nations General Assembly annual gathering in New York and travel to Washington for talks on Thursday with President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. The Scranton plant is one of the few facilities in the country to manufacture 155 mm artillery shells. They are used in howitzer systems, which are towed large guns with long barrels that can fire at various angles. Howitzers can strike targets up to 15- 20 miles (24-32 kilometers) away and are highly valued by ground forces to take out enemy targets from a protected distance. Ukraine has already received more than 3 million of the 155 mm shells from the U.S. Still pushing for permission With the war now well into its third year, Zelenskyy has been pushing the U.S. for permission to use longer range missile systems to fire deeper inside of Russia. So far he has not persuaded the Pentagon or White House to loosen those restrictions. The Defense Department has emphasized that Ukraine can already hit Moscow with Ukrainian-produced drones, and there is hesitation on the strategic implications of a U.S.-made missile potentially striking the Russian capital. Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned that Russia would be 'at war' with the United States and its NATO allies if they allow Ukraine to use the long-range weapons. At one point in the war, Ukraine was firing between 6,000 and 8,000 of the 155 mm shells per day. That rate started to deplete U.S. stockpiles and drew concern that the level on hand was not enough to sustain U.S. military needs if another major conventional war broke out, such as a potential conflict over Taiwan. In response, the U.S. has invested in restarting production lines and is now manufacturing more than 40,000 155 mm rounds a month, with plans to hit 100,000 rounds a month. During his visit, Zelenskyy is expected meet and thank workers who have increased production of the 155 mm rounds over the past year. Two of the Pentagon leaders who have pushed that increased production through — Doug Bush, assistant secretary of the Army for acquisition, logistics and technology, and Bill LaPlante, the Pentagon's top weapons buyer — are also expected to join Zelenskyy at the plant, as is Josh Shapiro, the governor of Pennsylvania. US largest donor of aid The 155 mm rounds are among the scores of ammunition, missile, air defense and advanced weapons systems the U.S. has provided Ukraine — everything from small arms bullets to advanced F-16 fighter jets. The U.S. has been the largest donor to Ukraine, providing more than $56 billion of the more than $106 billion NATO and partner countries have collected to aid in its defense. Even though Ukraine is not a member of NATO, commitment to its defense is seen by many European nations as a must to keep Putin from further military aggression that could threaten bordering NATO-member countries and result in a much larger conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-president-zelenskyy-will-visit-a-pennsylvania-ammunition-factory-to-thank-workers-/7793462.html	2024-09-21T13:57:34-07:00

Toll from Israeli airstrike on Beirut rises to 37, Lebanese ministry says	BEIRUT/JERUSALEM — An Israeli airstrike that targeted Hezbollah commanders in a Beirut suburb on Friday killed at least 37 people, including three children and seven women, the Lebanese health ministry said, as rescuers continue to search on Saturday for people missing in the rubble. Hezbollah said overnight that 16 of its members including senior leader Ibrahim Aqil and another top commander, Ahmed Wahbi, were among those killed in the deadliest strike in nearly a year of conflict between Israel and the Iran-backed group. The Israeli army, in posts on X, said the strike hit an underground gathering of Aqil and senior commanders of Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces, and had 'almost completely dismantled' Hezbollah's military chain of command. The attack leveled a multistory residential building in the crowded suburb and a nursery next door was damaged, a security source said. Heavy cross-border strikes continued on Saturday, with Israeli warplanes carrying out some of the heaviest bombings in 11 months of fighting across Lebanon's south and Hezbollah claiming rocket attacks on military targets in Israel's north. The Israeli army said it hit around 180 targets, destroying thousands of rocket launch barrels. Friday's strike sharply escalated the conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, and inflicted another blow on Hezbollah after two days of attacks this week in which pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members exploded. The total death toll in those attacks has risen to 39, and more than 3,000 were injured. The attacks on communications devices were widely believed to have been carried out by Israel, which has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati canceled a planned trip to the United Nations General Assembly in New York over the escalating conflict, his office said in a statement. U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said he was worried about an escalation between Israel and Lebanon but that the Israeli killing of a top Hezbollah leader may lead to a cease-fire with the group, which Washington designates as a terrorist group. 'While the risk of escalation is real, we actually believe there is also a distinct avenue to getting to a cessation of hostilities and a durable solution that makes people on both sides of the border feel secure,' Sullivan told reporters Saturday. Hezbollah has said it will keep fighting Israel until it agrees to a cease-fire in its war against Hamas in the Palestinian enclave of Gaza. The war was triggered by a Hamas-led rampage in southern Israel on October 7. Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages. Israel believes Hamas is still holding about 100 hostages, the military believes about a third are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Israel hasn’t estimated the death toll recently but says that most of the dead are combatants. U.S. officials say a truce is unlikely to come anytime soon. Israel wants Hezbollah to cease fire and withdraw its forces from the border region irrespective of any Gaza deal. Hezbollah said overnight that 15 more of its members were killed, including senior commander Wahbi, who oversaw the military operations of the Radwan forces during the Gaza war until early 2024. In a brief statement on Friday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's goals were clear and its actions spoke for themselves. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who said this week Israel was launching a new phase of war on the northern border, posted on X: 'The sequence of actions in the new phase will continue until our goal is achieved: the safe return of the residents of the north to their homes.' Tens of thousands of people have left their homes on both sides of the Israel-Lebanon border since Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel in October in sympathy with Palestinians in Gaza. Israel's military said on Saturday that airspace in northern Israel — from the city of Hadera north — was closed to private flights, but that the measure did not affect international flights. With at least 70 people killed in Lebanon this week, the death toll in the country since October has surpassed 740. The current conflict between Israel and Hezbollah is the worst since they fought an all-out war in 2006. While the current conflict has largely been contained to areas at or near the frontier, this week's escalation has heightened concerns that it could widen and further intensify.	https://www.voanews.com/a/toll-from-israel-s-airstrike-on-beirut-rises-to-37-lebanese-ministry-says-/7793448.html	2024-09-21T13:08:58-07:00	
Cambodia pulls out of regional development pact after protests	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet said he was pulling his country out of a development agreement with neighboring Vietnam and Laos following protests that it was benefiting foreign interests. Critics on social media have focused on land concessions in border areas particularly with Vietnam, a highly sensitive issue because of Cambodia's historical antagonism toward its larger eastern neighbor. Authorities had arrested at least 66 people ahead of a planned August rally to condemn the Cambodia-Laos-Vietnam Development Triangle Area — or CLV-DTA. Most were later released but leaders are facing charges. The agreement, formalized in 2004, intended to facilitate cooperation on trade and migration in four northeastern provinces of Cambodia and border areas in Laos and Vietnam. Hun Manet called groups that opposed the agreement extremists and said they were using the issue to slander and attack the government and confuse the public. 'For instance, allegations that the government ceded the territory of the four northeastern provinces to foreign countries, etc,' he wrote in a post late Friday. He said that in the past 25 years Cambodia had built many achievements for the development of the four provinces but his government decided to pull out of the agreement, 'taking into account people's concern on territory and the need to withdraw weapons out of the hands of extremists to prevent them from using CLV-DTA to further cheat people.' Cambodia's government has long been accused of silencing critics and political opponents. Hun Manet succeeded his father last year after Hun Sen ruled for four decades, but there have been few signs of political liberalization.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodia-pulls-out-of-regional-development-pact-after-protests-/7793441.html	2024-09-21T12:40:59-07:00	
Israeli strike in Gaza City kills 22; military says Hamas targeted	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — An Israeli strike on a school in northern Gaza on Saturday killed at least 22 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, while the Israeli army said that it targeted a Hamas command center in what used to be a school. Another 30 were wounded in the strike on the school in the Zeitoun area of Gaza City, the ministry said in a statement. Most of the casualties were women and children, it said. It wasn't immediately clear to which hospital the dead and injured were taken. Dozens of people, including children, dug through the rubble of the building — its ceilings caved in, walls knocked out and a mess of wires and metal rods visible. Outside, others gathered around shrouded bodies. Some covered their faces as they wept for relatives killed in the strike. 'A missile, a missile from the plane hit us, and another missile,' said Ferial Deloul, who is displaced. 'We saw the whole world covered with smoke and stones and we saw people and children cut up. … What should we do? What is our fault for this to happen to us?' The Israeli army said earlier Saturday that it struck Hamas' 'command and control center, which was embedded inside a compound that previously served' as a school. It said steps were taken to limit harming civilians, including the use of precise munitions and aerial surveillance. 5 Gaza ministry workers killed, it says Also on Saturday, the Gaza Health Ministry said five of its workers were killed and five others wounded by Israeli fire that struck the ministry's warehouses in the southern Musbah area. Since the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war, the Israeli army has struck several schools packed with tens of thousands of Palestinians driven from their homes by Israeli offensives and evacuation orders. The conflict has left 90% of Palestinians in Gaza displaced, according to figures from the United Nations. The military has accused Hamas of operating from within civilian infrastructure in Gaza, including schools, U.N. facilities and hospitals. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the U.S., U.K., EU and others. Israel targets Hamas, strikes school The contesting narratives over the use of schools and hospitals go to the heart of the nearly yearlong conflict. Earlier this month, an Israeli strike hit a school in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing 14, according to Palestinian medical officials. The Israeli military said that it was targeting Hamas militants planning attacks from inside the school. In July, Israeli airstrikes hit a girls' school in Deir al-Balah, killing at least 30 people sheltering inside. Israel's military said that it targeted a Hamas command center used to direct attacks against its troops and store 'large quantities of weapons.' The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an October 7, 2023, terror attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding about 100 hostages. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between fighters and civilians. Israel has not recently estimated the death toll but says that most of the dead are combatants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strike-in-gaza-city-kills-22-military-says-hamas-targeted/7793404.html	2024-09-21T11:46:07-07:00	
Deadly mob violence underscores Bangladesh's security breakdown	Washington — A brutal mob lynching at Bangladesh’s oldest university has put a spotlight on the country's crumbling law and order, just as its fledgling interim government tries to assert control and push through sweeping institutional reforms. Late Wednesday, Tofazzal Hossein, a man known for struggling with mental health issues and roaming around the 102-year-old University of Dhaka, wandered into a residential hall. Accusing him of theft, a mob of students grabbed and savagely beat him over the course of several hours. By Thursday morning, Hossein, 35, was dead, the latest casualty in a wave of mob violence that has gripped Bangladesh since student protests ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and sent her fleeing the country last month. Mob violence and student vigilantism were commonplace during Hasina’s 15-year reign. Rights group Ain o Salish Kendra documented 32 mob killings between January and June, even before student protests toppled her government and left more than 1,000 people dead. But the lawlessness has spiraled out of control since the August 5 fall of the government. In the days that followed, police officers, fearful of student reprisals, vanished from the streets, creating a vacuum that has yet to be filled. In just five weeks since early August, 21 people were lynched across the country, according to a tally by the Daily Star, a leading Bangladeshi newspaper. One of the victims, a former student leader accused of attacking protesters in July, was himself beaten to death at another major university on Wednesday. University students, once hailed as democratic heroes, now stand accused of committing mob violence. Six face charges over Hossein's murder, with seven more implicated in the second case. The lawlessness has spread nationwide, leading to numerous incidents of extortion, harassment, intimidation and courtroom violence, sometimes triggering larger conflicts. In Bangladesh’s southern Chittagong Hill Tracts region, the lynching on Wednesday of a man accused of stealing a bike reignited long-simmering tensions between ethnic Bengalis and indigenous people. The ensuing violence has already claimed at least four lives, according to media reports. The unrest comes just days after the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, granted the army sweeping law enforcement powers to restore order. At stake are more than domestic peace and the stability of the country's industrial regions. Yunus' six-week-old government has set up six commissions to advance democratic reforms, including a panel tasked with changing the country’s 51-year-old Constitution. The instability in Bangladesh, South Asia's third-most-populous country, is also drawing regional scrutiny, with Indian politicians voicing concern about reports of attacks on Hindus. The Bangladeshi army's 60-day new powers, announced Tuesday, allow commissioned officers to act as 'executive magistrates,' making arrests, conducting searches, dispersing unlawful assemblies and opening fire in extraordinary circumstances. Asif Nazarul, the interim government’s law adviser, said the government acted in response to 'subversive acts' and instability, particularly in the country's industrial areas. 'Given the situation, army personnel have been given magistracy power,' Nazarul was quoted in the Daily Star. Rattled by growing insecurity, many Bangladeshis have welcomed the army’s new power. Noting that security remains a 'big challenge' for the interim government, Badiul Alam Majumdar, editor of Citizens for Good Governance, told VOA, 'It has been done to maintain law and order in view of the overall situation. It has been done temporarily. I hope the position will change.' Accused of using violence during the anti-government protests, Bangladeshi police became targets of student anger after Hasina’s ouster. Police stations were looted, and several officers were killed or burned to death, their bodies hanged from overpasses. With no one held accountable in those cases, police fear for their safety. Many have yet to return to their posts, leaving the police forces understaffed and barely functioning. Julia Bleckner, a senior Bangladesh researcher at Human Rights Watch, said while the government has a responsibility to maintain law and order, giving the army 'unchecked' powers raises concerns about abuse. 'They've been given a mandate to carry out pretty widespread and arbitrary searches, detentions and arrests,' Bleckner said in a phone interview with VOA. The army can now arrest anyone on the spot for 'disturbing the peace' and use civilian personnel to disperse 'illegal assemblies,' Bleckner noted. 'We are under a new government that has made massive commitments and very important commitments to human rights, but these are the same security forces that have carried out abuses for decades,' Bleckner said. The Bangladeshi army last wielded similar law enforcement powers during the country’s 2006-2008 political crisis. At the time, military personnel were accused of making arbitrary arrests and other human rights abuses. Nazarul, the law adviser, said he did not believe the army would 'misuse this authority,' according to the Daily Star. But critics remain unconvinced. 'It is not right,' ZI Khan Panna, a veteran lawyer, said of the army’s magistracy power, according to the Daily Star. 'Has the government lost confidence in the magistrates? It is not right for army personnel to perform magistrate's duties under the deputy commissioners. It would not be wise to mix army personnel with the general public.' In the three days since receiving policing powers, the army has not announced any arrests. However, it has faced criticism for failing to quell violence. Nolen Deibert, head of Freedom House’s Asia Religious and Ethnic Freedom Program, noted that the attacks against indigenous communities in the Chittagong Hill Tracks region came as 'the army allegedly stood by and watched.' The interim government's home affairs adviser, Jahangir Alam Chowdhury, said a high-level committee will be formed to investigate the violence, Reuters reported. 'The country faces real risks of heightened conflict and threats of violence toward minority groups,' Deibert said via email. 'The interim government must come up with a plan to return policing powers to civilian authorities who will fairly protect and serve all Bangladeshis, regardless of race or creed.' VOA’s Bangla Service contributed to this article.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-mob-violence-underscores-bangladesh-s-security-breakdown/7793384.html	2024-09-21T10:37:44-07:00	
Humanitarian crisis in Syria threatens to spiral out of control	GENEVA — U.N. investigators are warning the humanitarian crisis in Syria threatens to spiral out of control as violence increases and the collapsing economy keeps the population mired in poverty and hopelessness 13 years after civil war erupted in the country. 'As world attention and resources shift to other grave political or humanitarian crises, Syria descends further into a quagmire of misery and despair,' Paulo Pinheiro, chair of the U.N. Syria Commission of Inquiry, told the U.N. human rights council Friday. In presenting the latest report by the three-member commission, Pinheiro painted a dark picture of a society that has fallen into an abyss of 'multiple failures and missed opportunities.' 'We have seen 13 years of internal armed conflict brought about by the Syrian state’s violent and repressive response to peaceful demonstrations,' he said. 'Our report to you documents continuing arbitrary detentions with state officials continuing to forcibly disappear, torture and ill-treat detainees in their custody.' The report says that fighting has intensified along multiple front lines, as disparate military forces use heavy artillery to maintain territorial control and resort to intensified violence against their perceived political opponents. It accuses these militias of committing a litany of human rights violations and abuses against the civilian population, increasing the fear 'of a large-scale war' breaking out. For example, the report says that in the northwest of the country, conflict between a Syrian terrorist organization, Hay’at Tahrir al-Sham, and some factions of the Syrian National Army continue to 'arbitrarily detain, torture and disappear civilians and those perceived as political opponents.' The report cites intensified fighting by Syrian government forces in the Idlib area of northwest Syria, where civilians have been killed, injured and maimed 'in unlawful attacks' with cluster munitions in densely populated urban centers. In the incidents investigated by the commission, the report finds more than 150 civilians, half of them women and children, were killed and injured by government forces. The vast majority were in indiscriminate ground attacks near frontline villages and towns 'in violation of international humanitarian law.' 'Such attacks may amount to war crimes,' it says, noting that 'airstrikes by Syria’s ally, Russia, again led to casualties.' 'Aerospace forces of the Russian Federation may have failed to take all feasible precautions to minimize harm to civilians, in violation of international humanitarian law,' authors of the report say. Syria’s ambassador to the U.N. in Geneva, Haydar Ali Ahmad, responded to the report by calling the commission’s mandate into question and branding the commissioners as 'nothing but tools designed to implement specific agendas' of certain Western powers. 'What is the benefit of such mandates when we are faced with a commission of inquiry whose task is not to investigate but establish the misleading Western narrative on the situation in Syria?' he said. 'Regrettably, it has betrayed the principles of impartiality, objectivity, independence and transparency.' Commission Chair Pinheiro expressed particular alarm at 'the heightened regional tensions stemming from the conflict' in Israel and Lebanon. 'These have led to intensified Israeli airstrikes — and last week a raid into Syria —targeting Iranian officials and militias across Syria, causing civilian casualties on at least three occasions,' he said. 'Iranian-affiliated groups and the U.S. have stepped up attacks on each other in northeast Syria since the start of the Gaza war.' He warned of the dangers to the system of international law itself 'if the member states charged with upholding it are seen to be failing in this obligation,' a sentiment shared by Geir O. Pedersen, U.N. special envoy for Syria. In a briefing Friday to the Security Council, Pedersen said he was deeply alarmed at the reports of 'a large number of communication devices exploding across Lebanon as well as in Syria … resulting in casualties, including children, and subsequent Israeli airstrikes on Lebanon and Hezbollah rocket fire into Israel.' 'There is a clear and present danger of a wider regional war that drags the Syrian people into its crosshairs,' he said. Pinheiro cited multiple other ongoing military operations in different parts of Syria by various military groups intent on seizing land, extorting money and other possessions for personal gain, regardless of the costs. 'Civilians continue to be killed on a daily basis in a senseless war that has left the country economically and politically broken, dramatically eroding the social fabric,' he said. The United Nations reports more than 306,000 civilians have been killed in Syria since civil war broke out in 2011, and nearly 14 million have been forcibly displaced, 7.2 million inside Syria and 5.6 million as refugees in neighboring countries, across Europe and beyond. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs reports 16.7 million people, or 3 in every 4 people in Syria, need humanitarian assistance. Of those, 13 million face acute food insecurity, and upwards of 650,000 children under the age of 5 are stunted from severe malnutrition. 'Living conditions are increasingly desperate, and we note the failure of the international community to fund more than a quarter of the U.N.’s [$4.9 billion] 2024 humanitarian response plan,' Pinheiro said. 'Overall, Syria’s GDP has shrunk by more than half since 2011, a result of the combined effect of destruction of infrastructure and economic networks, forced displacement of more than half the population, predatory practices and rampant corruption,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/humanitarian-crisis-in-syria-threatens-to-spiral-out-of-control/7793374.html	2024-09-21T10:14:48-07:00	
California governor signs law to protect children from social media addiction	SACRAMENTO, California — California will make it illegal for social media platforms to knowingly provide addictive feeds to children without parental consent beginning in 2027 under a new law Governor Gavin Newsom signed Friday. California follows New York state, which passed a law earlier this year allowing parents to block their kids from getting social media posts suggested by a platform's algorithm. Utah has passed laws in recent years aimed at limiting children's access to social media, but those have faced challenges in court. The California law will take effect in a state home to some of the largest technology companies in the world. Similar proposals have failed to pass in recent years, but Newsom signed a first-in-the-nation law in 2022 barring online platforms from using users' personal information in ways that could harm children. It is part of a growing push in states across the country to try to address the impact of social media on the well-being of children. 'Every parent knows the harm social media addiction can inflict on their children — isolation from human contact, stress and anxiety, and endless hours wasted late into the night,' Newsom, a Democrat, said in a statement. 'With this bill, California is helping protect children and teenagers from purposely designed features that feed these destructive habits.' The law bans platforms from sending notifications without permission from parents to minors between midnight and 6 a.m., and between 8 a.m. and 3 p.m. on weekdays from September through May, when children are typically in school. The legislation also makes platforms set children's accounts to private by default. Opponents of the legislation say it could inadvertently prevent adults from accessing content if they cannot verify their age. Some argue it would threaten online privacy by making platforms collect more information on users. The law defines an 'addictive feed' as a website or app 'in which multiple pieces of media generated or shared by users are, either concurrently or sequentially, recommended, selected, or prioritized for display to a user based, in whole or in part, on information provided by the user, or otherwise associated with the user or the user's device,' with some exceptions. The subject garnered renewed attention in June when U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms and their impacts on young people. Attorneys general in 42 states endorsed the plan in a letter sent to Congress last week. State Senator Nancy Skinner, a Democrat representing Berkeley who wrote the California law, said that 'social media companies have designed their platforms to addict users, especially our kids.' 'With the passage of SB 976, the California Legislature has sent a clear message: When social media companies won't act, it's our responsibility to protect our kids,' she said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-governor-signs-law-to-protect-children-from-social-media-addiction/7793355.html	2024-09-21T09:32:40-07:00	
US, UK, Norway say South Sudan poll delay shows leadership 'failure'	Washington — The United States, the United Kingdom and Norway expressed 'deep concern' on Saturday at the announcement of a two-year delay in elections in South Sudan, terming the extension of a transitional government a 'failure.' 'This announcement demonstrates the persistent and collective failure of South Sudan’s leaders to create the conditions necessary to hold credible and peaceful elections,' said a joint statement from the three governments. South Sudan won independence from Sudan in 2011 but was plunged into a civil war two years later that killed an estimated 400,000 people. A 2018 peace deal brought together President Salva Kiir and bitter rival Vice President Riek Machar, but efforts to write a constitution and hold the country's first elections have been repeatedly delayed. Last week, Kiir's office announced that voting planned for December would be pushed back by another two years, ahead of a Sunday deadline for the transitional government to be dissolved. Cabinet Affairs Minister Martin Elia Lomuro said the extension was 'in response to the recommendations from both electoral institutions and the security sector.' The three countries 'acknowledged' that polls could not be held as scheduled in December and blamed 'a lack of political will.' 'Responsibility for this failure is shared by all parties in the transitional government,' said the statement. 'As South Sudan's leaders vie for power and fail to organize credible and peaceful elections, the people of South Sudan suffer the consequences.' Earlier this week, the United Nations expressed 'regret and disappointment' at the delay. 'Two years ago, we were in a similar situation, as we are today, and gave our support specifically under the condition that there would be no more extensions,' U.N. special representative Nicholas Haysom said in a statement. South Sudan has battled flooding, hunger and violence, while its leaders have appeared reluctant to risk going to the polls and are accused of massive corruption. Earlier this month, the U.N.'s humanitarian agency warned that more than 700,000 people had been affected by flooding, with aid failing to meet many in need. South Sudan boasts plentiful oil resources, but the vital source of revenue was cut in February when an export pipeline was damaged in war-torn Sudan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-uk-norway-say-south-sudan-poll-delay-shows-leadership-failure-/7793349.html	2024-09-21T09:21:15-07:00	
Parts of US Midwest could offer fall's most vibrant foliage	PORTLAND, Maine — Fall is back, and bringing with it jack-o'-lanterns, football, pumpkin spice everything and — in some parts of the country — especially vibrant foliage. Leaves around the northern United States are starting to turn orange, yellow and red, inspiring legions of leaf lovers to hop in their cars and travel to the countryside for the best look at fall's fireworks. Leaf peeping — the act of traveling to witness nature's annual kaleidoscope — contributes billions of dollars to the economy, especially in New England and New York. But this year, some of the most colorful displays could be in the Midwest. AccuWeather, the commercial forecasting service, said in early September that it expects especially vibrant foliage in states such as Michigan and Illinois. The service also said powerful, popping colors are expected in upstate New York and parts of Pennsylvania, while New England will follow a more typical color pattern. But that doesn't mean New England travelers will miss out. Maine, the most forested state in the country, had 'an abundance of daily sunshine with just the right amount of rainfall to set the stage for a breathtaking foliage season,' said Gale Ross, the state's fall foliage spokesperson. Color change and timing depend on the weather in the fall, but cooler nighttime temperatures and shorter days should enhance the colors, Ross said. 'The growing season of 2024 has been excellent for trees, supporting tree health and resilience that should lead to brilliant fall colors throughout Maine,' said Aaron Bergdahl, the state's forest pathologist. Fall colors peak at different times around the U.S., with the foliage season sometimes starting not long after Labor Day in the far northern reaches of the country and extending into November further to the south. In Maine alone, peak foliage can arrive in the northern part of the state in late September and not arrive in coastal areas until close to Halloween. Leaf turn happens when summer yields to fall and temperatures drop and the amount of sunlight decreases. Chlorophyll in leaves then breaks down, and that allows their fall colors to shine through before leaf drop. However, weather conditions associated with climate change have disrupted some recent leaf peeping seasons. A warming planet has brought drought that causes leaves to turn brown and wither before reaching peak colors. Other enemies of leaf peeping include heat waves that cause leaves to fall before autumn arrives and extreme weather events like hurricanes that strip trees of their leaves. A summer heatwave in the Pacific Northwest in 2021 caused a condition called 'foliage scorch' that prematurely browned leaves. This year in Maine, leaf turn was still very sparse in most of the state as late September approached, but the state office of tourism was already gearing up for an influx of tourists. Northern Maine was already experiencing moderate color change. And neighboring New Hampshire was expecting about 3.7 million visitors — more than twice the state's population. 'It's no surprise people travel from all over the world to catch the incredible color,' said New Hampshire Travel and Tourism Director Lori Harnois.	https://www.voanews.com/a/parts-of-us-midwest-could-offer-fall-s-most-vibrant-foliage/7793339.html	2024-09-21T09:11:44-07:00	
Climate protesters say pace of change isn't fast enough	NEW YORK — Six years after a teenage Greta Thunberg walked out of school in a solitary climate protest outside of the Swedish parliament, people around a warming globe marched in youth-led protest, saying their voices are being heard but not sufficiently acted upon. Emissions of heat-trapping gases and temperatures have been rising and oil and gas drilling has continued, even as the protests that kicked off major weeklong climate events in New York City have become annual events. This year, they come days before the United Nations convenes two special summits, one concentrating on sea level rise and the other on the future. The young people who organized these marches with Fridays for Future said there is frustration with inaction but also hope. People marched in Berlin, Rio de Janeiro, New Delhi and elsewhere, but the focus often is in New York City because of Climate Week NYC. Diplomats, business leaders and activists are concentrating their discussions on the money end of fighting climate change — something not lost on protesters. 'We hope that the government and the financial sector make polluters pay for the damage that they have imposed on our environment,' said Uganda Fridays for Future founder Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, who was among a few hundred marching in New York Friday, a far cry from the tens of thousands that protested in a multigroup mega-rally in 2023. The New York protest wants to take aim at 'the pillars of fossil fuels' — companies that pollute, banks that fund them and leaders who are failing on climate, said Helen Mancini, an organizer and a senior at the city's Stuyvesant High School. 'A lot of older people want to make sure the economy is intact, and that's their main concern,' said Julia Demairo, a sophomore at Pace University. 'I think worrying about the future and the environment is worrying about the economy.' On a day that was at least 8 degrees warmer than average, protest signs included 'This is not what we mean by Hot Girl Summer,' while others focused on the theme of fighting the coal, oil and gas industries: 'Youth Didn't Vote for Fossil Fuels,' 'Don't Be a Fossil Fool' and 'Climate Crisis = Extermination By Capitalism.' Nakabuye said she was in New York to represent Uganda 'that is bearing the brunt of the climate crisis.' 'We feel like we are creating an impact in the community. However, we are not listened to enough; there is more that needs to be done, especially right now when the climate catastrophes are intensifying,' said Nakabuye. 'We need to even raise our voices more to demand change and to demand that fuels should end.' In the six years since Thunberg founded what became Fridays for Future, global carbon dioxide emissions from the burning of fossil fuels have increased by about 2.15%, according to Global Carbon Project, a group of scientists who monitor carbon pollution. The growth of emissions has slowed compared with previous decades and experts anticipate peaking soon, but that's a far cry from the 43% reduction that a U.N. report said is needed to keep temperature increases to an agreed-upon limit. Since 2019, carbon dioxide emissions from coal have increased by nearly 900 million metric tons, while natural gas emissions have increased slightly and oil pollution has dropped a tiny amount, according to the International Energy Agency, or IEA. That growth has been driven by China, India and developing nations. But emissions from advanced or industrialized economies have been falling and in 2023 were the lowest in more than 50 years, according to the IEA. Coal emissions in rich countries are down to levels seen around the year 1900, and the United Kingdom next month is set to shutter its last coal plant. In the past five years, clean energy sources have grown twice as fast as fossil fuels, with solar and wind individually growing faster than fossil fuel-based electricity, according to the IEA. Developing countries — where more than 80% of the world population lives — say that they need financial help to curb their increasing use of fossil fuels. Since 2018, the globe has warmed more than 0.29 degrees Celsius, with last year setting a record for the hottest year and this year poised to break that mark, according to the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the European climate agency Copernicus. 'We're making progress, even if it's slow progress,' said 17-year-old Ashen Harper of Connecticut, a veteran protester turned organizer. 'Our job right now is to accelerate that progress.' In Berlin, hundreds of people took to the streets, although in fewer numbers than in previous years. Activists held up signs saying, 'Save the Climate' and 'Coal is Over!' as they watched a gig put on outside the German Chancellor's Office. Protesters in London held up letters spelling out 'Pay Up,' calling for the country to pay more to adapt to climate change and transition away from fossil fuels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/climate-protesters-say-pace-of-change-isn-t-fast-enough/7793326.html	2024-09-21T09:02:01-07:00	
Czechs vote in Senate, regional elections in aftermath of flooding	PRAGUE — Czechs went to the polls on Friday in a two-day vote for a third of the seats in Parliament's upper house, which is the Senate, and to select their representatives in regional elections. The elections took place as the Czech Republic was recovering from massive floods that hit Central Europe in recent days. The floods claimed at least 24 lives in the region, five of them in the Czech Republic. State officials helped dozens of the hardest-hit towns organize the ballot in the northeast of the country, where schools and various other buildings that serve as polling stations were submerged and damaged. Interior Ministry officials took over the organization of the vote in five towns where local authorities were preoccupied with cleanup and recovery efforts. In some places, voting took place in tents, shipping containers or outside. The current ruling five-party coalition led by Prime Minister Petr Fiala has a clear majority in the 81-seat Senate, where 27 seats are up for grabs in the two-round election. The runoffs take place next week. Parliament's lower house dominates the legislative process, but the Senate plays an important role in passing constitutional amendments and approving Constitutional Court judges. In separate regional elections, a political movement led by former populist Prime Minister Andrej Babis is the favorite to win for the third straight time. Babis' ANO (YES), which is currently in opposition, is also favored to win the next general election, scheduled for next year. The results of the elections will be known late Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/czechs-vote-in-senate-regional-elections-in-aftermath-of-flooding/7793302.html	2024-09-21T08:36:42-07:00

Striking Indian doctors set to resume essential services	KOLKATA, INDIA — Striking junior doctors in India's West Bengal state agreed to resume essential services, in a partial resumption of medical facilities, but they will continue their strike over the rape and murder of a colleague over a month ago. The rape and murder of the 31-year-old female doctor in West Bengal in August set off a wave of protests by doctors demanding greater workplace safety for women and justice for their slain colleague, prompting India's Supreme Court to create a hospital safety task force. The junior doctors will resume essential duties from Saturday, the West Bengal Junior Doctors' Front, which represents about 7,000 physicians in the state, said in a statement on Thursday. 'The movement for ‘justice’ will continue in each state-run hospital but we have decided to resume essential services in hospitals due to the flood situation in parts of the state,' said Aniket Mahato of the West Bengal Junior Doctors' Front. Doctors are demanding better security, included additional CCTV coverage, deployment of female security personnel and adequate lighting, toilets and resting spaces. A police volunteer has been arrested in connection with the doctor's rape and death in the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata. The former principal of the college has been arrested over accusations of evidence tampering and graft, and the Kolkata police chief has been replaced. Although tougher laws were introduced after the 2012 gruesome gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student in national capital New Delhi, activists say the Kolkata case shows how women in the country continue to suffer from sexual violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/striking-indian-doctors-set-to-resume-essential-services/7793273.html	2024-09-21T08:04:56-07:00	
Nigeria’s inflation rate dips, but Nigerians still feel the pinch	ABUJA, NIGERIA — The high inflation rate in Nigeria dropped slightly in August, but a decline in the value of the nairia and a continued increase in fuel prices are eroding the slight gains and threatening to reignite the inflationary trend. Michael Anthony, an engineer and father of four, still faces high costs despite the small drop in inflation, which fell from 33.40% in July to 32.15% in August. His household expenses remain steep, with no real relief in sight. 'In the month of July, I bought a bag of rice at the rate of 65,000 naira, but ... three days ago, I bought a bag of rice for 95,000 naira,' he said. 'If you want to buy anything, price has risen because of the price of fuel. I'm worried that inflation rate might rise again.' At a market in a suburb of Abuja, food trader Blessing Ochuba is also struggling. With customers unable to buy in bulk, she’s cutting back her stock and adjusting prices to stay in business. Ochuba said patronage has been slow despite the reported dip in inflation rate. 'People that normally buy in bags, they now buy like half or quarter ... because they can no longer afford to buy for now,' she said. 'I used to buy like 10 bags of rice, but now I cannot afford to buy five. Honestly, I did not see the coming down, everything is going higher. 'It's on the high side, and it is really affecting us.' Despite lower inflation, Nigeria’s currency has weakened from 1,200 to 1,600 to the dollar, and gasoline prices have soared from 620 to nearly 1,000 naira per liter over the past three months. Development economist Hauwa Mustapha credited a government policy in which food imports were not subject to excise duty for 90 days for the slight inflation drop. 'I think that helped a lot, and that also helped for them to boost the supply of food. ... It does not indicate a long-term recovery,' she said, adding that a lasting recovery will depend on government measures. 'What the government can do to manage inflationary pressure for both short term and long term, I think for now, is to concentrate policy action in the area of food supply,' Mustapha said. 'Thankfully, we are approaching the harvest season. Typically, in Nigeria, we also know that we experience a lot of post-harvest loss. This is ... the time for the country to manage the harvest, particularly control [and] minimize post-harvest losses, so that we can keep the food supply steady.' Experts say the government’s next steps will determine whether this inflation dip signals a recovery or just temporary relief.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-s-inflation-rate-dips-but-nigerians-still-feel-the-pinch/7793219.html	2024-09-21T06:35:50-07:00

Rights group says Myanmar military to execute activists	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA/BANGKOK — A prominent Southeast Asian rights group said Friday that Myanmar’s ruling State Administration Council reportedly intends to execute five democracy activists Tuesday following their May 2023 conviction and sentencing for alleged involvement in a deadly 2021 shooting on a train in Yangon. The ASEAN Parliamentarians for Human Rights said it was deeply troubled after receiving a report from what it called a reliable source about the pending executions, which were ordered when a civilian court delivered a verdict in a closed-door hearing held in Insein Prison. It said Zaryaw Phyo, 32; San Min Aung, 24; Kyaw Win Soe 33; Kaung Pyae Sone Oo, 27; and Myat Phyo Pwint, age unknown, were charged with murder and illegal weapons possession under several statutes, including the 1949 Arms Act and a 2014 counterterrorism law. 'The use of capital punishment as a tool to suppress dissent is unacceptable and must be condemned in the strongest terms,' Wong Chen, a Malaysian member of the parliamentarians group’s board, said in the group’s statement. The organization demanded the State Administration Council halt the executions and immediately release the five activists. The SAC is the official name of the military government formed in February 2021 when the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi was ousted by a coup d’etat, tipping the country into civil war. It said such actions represented a grievous infringement of human rights and a blatant disregard for international legal standards. 'We call upon the SAC to immediately release them and ensure that, pending their release, the detention conditions comply with international standards, including access to legal representation, medical care and contact with their family,' said Mercy Chriesty Barends, the chairperson of the parliamentarians group. Lawyers, families of the condemned and prison authorities contacted by VOA could not confirm whether the executions were scheduled to proceed Tuesday; however, one prison authority noted their bodies and necks had been measured regularly. Myanmar’s ruling military hanged four democracy activists in July 2022 after the SAC accused them of carrying out 'terror acts.' They were the first people to be executed in Myanmar in more than 40 years, leading to widespread international condemnation. Shortly after the executions, the G7 leading economies called on the ruling military to 'refrain from further arbitrary executions' and to free all political prisoners, warning the absence of fair trials showed the junta’s contempt for the democratic aspirations of the people of Myanmar. The parliamentarians group said it was 'particularly disconcerting' that the five executions would be carried out under the first death sentences ordered by a civilian judiciary — rather than a military tribunal — since the coup, signaling a disturbing shift in judicial proceedings in Myanmar. Jason Tower, country director for the Burma Program at the United States Institute of Peace, said the death sentences marked a hardening of attitudes by the junta, which has suffered a litany of losses on the battlefield since anti-regime forces launched an offensive last October. 'This is very concerning, and there’s not enough action on this internationally. The junta is out of control — atrocities are everywhere,' he told VOA, adding the broader international community had not done enough to counter an 'illegitimate regime that is perpetrating horrific violence.' He also said a recent shift in China’s posture toward Myanmar’s military regime had sent a signal that the junta can get away with mass atrocities and executing human rights defenders and political opponents without consequences. 'China has blatantly ignored a dramatic increase in junta airstrikes targeting civilians, IDP camps, schools and hospitals, moving forward with inviting senior junta officials to Chinese-led multilateral platforms,' he said. Those platforms include the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, the Xiangshan Forum and the Lancang-Mekong Cooperation. 'Participants in these platforms have failed to push back, and there are worrying signs the Association of Southeast Asian Nations could be tilting toward closer relations with the military regime despite the dramatic increase in atrocities and war crimes,' Tower said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-group-says-myanmar-military-to-execute-activists/7793140.html	2024-09-21T03:38:53-07:00

Thailand grants few asylum claims in first year of program	BANGKOK — Amid a reported surge in cross-border repression across Southeast Asia, rights advocates say Thailand is making promising but very slow progress rolling out an asylum program meant to protect the most vulnerable refugees. They say many who might be eligible for the program are reluctant to apply for fear of exposing themselves to the police and that coming forward could backfire. Thailand does not officially recognize refugees and deems anyone in the country without a valid visa or passport an illegal migrant. Last September, though, the government introduced a National Screening Mechanism to give 'protected persons status' to those from other countries who can prove they are 'unable or unwilling' to return home 'due to a well-founded fear of persecution.' Neither the Royal Thai Police – whose Immigration Bureau is leading the program – nor the National Security Council or Foreign Affairs Ministry, which both participate, replied to VOA’s repeated requests for comment on the NSM, which took effect September 22 of last year. At a meeting with aid groups last week, though, immigration officials said fewer than 10 people, including adults and their children, have been fully vetted and granted asylum under the program to date, participants from the aid groups told VOA. They say officials said one applicant had been rejected and that about 200 were still having their claims assessed. 'In terms of implementation, it’s not proportionate yet with the overall population of asylum seekers and refugees in Thailand,' said Krittaporn Semsantad, program director for Thailand’s Peace Rights Foundation, after attending last week’s meeting. 'I’d say they’re … trying to do their best,' she said of the government. 'However, there’s a lot of limitation.' The United Nations estimates some 5,000 asylum seekers are living in Thailand, though rights groups say the true number is likely higher. Human Rights Watch reported in May that Thailand had made itself increasingly dangerous for asylum seekers over the past decade through what rights groups claim is an arrangement with its neighbors to forcibly return each other’s dissidents, regardless of potential persecution, including arrest, torture and death. In recent years, Thailand has arrested and forced dozens of dissidents and members of persecuted ethnic minorities back to their home countries, including China. A rights activist from Vietnam, Y Quynh Bdap, was arrested in Bangkok in June and is now on trial for possible extradition back to Vietnam, where he is wanted for fomenting a deadly riot he says he had nothing to do with. Once accepted into Thailand’s new asylum program, refugees should be safe from a forced return home, but rights advocates say the NSM is moving far too slowly to cope with the need. They say the screening commission is struggling to verify the biographies of applicants, has too few interpreters to bridge language barriers, and that many potential applicants still don’t know the program even exists. Those who do, they add, can be put off by having to be formally charged with an immigration offense to go through the process. They say many also don’t trust the government to vet them fairly and fear that if their applications are rejected they could end up back in the countries they fled. 'They’re afraid that if they apply for NSM, they reveal themselves to the government, and if they [do] not meet the criteria of the NSM they will need to [be] deport[ed] back to their … home country,' said Tanyakorn Thippayapokin, policy advocacy coordinator for Asylum Access Thailand, who also attended last week’s meeting. Advocates say as well that the eligibility rules are too narrow by barring legal migrant workers — who may also be asylum seekers who need protection — from applying, and that the power the rules give the government to reject applicants over unspecified national security risks are too broad. By not having to explain the security risks, some worry, the government may turn worthy applicants down to either build or maintain good relations with neighboring countries. Opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang, who chairs the House of Representatives subcommittee on sustainable solutions for migrants in the country illegally, cited the case of the four dozen ethnic Uyghurs from China who Thailand has been holding in detention without charges since arresting them for illegal entry over a decade ago. 'When they [use] the justification of the national security concern, it can [mean] everything in this world,' said Kannavee, who worked for the United Nations refugee agency for over a dozen years. 'For example, the Uyghurs. If they said it is a national security concern, we cannot put the 48 cases of the Uyghur refugees who’ve been put in the immigration detention center [through] the NSM, it can be like that,' he said. Krittaporn said she was told by immigration officials that the detained Uyghurs were eligible for the NSM, but she added that nongovernment groups have not been able to meet with them to check whether they have been given the chance to apply. Advocates suggest the government do more to inform asylum seekers and refugees about the program, hire more interpreters, and scale back the share of security agency officials on the screening commission. Some suggest it also scrap the need for applicants to be formally charged. As it is now, the program seems designed more for finding reasons to turn down applicants than to approve them, said Pornsuk Koetsawang, founder of Friends Without Borders, another local refugee aid group. 'The security agencies work for Thailand’s national security, not for protection of refugees, and they [refugees] worry that Thai security agencies … think that refugees are a threat,' she said. 'That’s the thing that has been happening for the past few decades.' Kannavee said transferring primary responsibility for the program from the police to the Interior Ministry would help give it a more humanitarian focus. He says the program may yet collapse from all its faults, though, and has been working on legislation that would give Thailand an entirely new refugee program. On the whole, though, most advocates say the NSM is at least a modest step in the right direction for Thailand and may still be able to spare some refugees from arrest and a forced return to the countries they have fled. Once vetted and approved, said Tanyakorn, 'they’re here legally at least and with the protection of the government authorities.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-grants-few-asylum-claims-in-first-year-of-program/7793119.html	2024-09-21T02:18:11-07:00	
Rapidly escalating Israel-Hezbollah conflict stirs fears of wider war	CAIRO — This week saw a dizzying escalation in the 11-month conflict between Israel and Lebanon’s Hezbollah. First came two days of exploding pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah — deadly attacks pinned on Israel that also maimed civilians around Lebanon. Hezbollah's leader vowed to retaliate and, on Friday, the militant group launched dozens of rockets into northern Israel. Later in the day, Israel said it killed the commander of Hezbollah’s most elite unit with a strike in Beirut that left at least 14 dead. Many fear the events are the prelude to an all-out war between Israel and Hezbollah, the Iranian-backed Shiite group that is Lebanon’s most powerful armed force. A war threatens to bring devastation in Lebanon, heavy missile fire into Israeli cities and further destabilization to a region already shaken by the Gaza war. During 11 months of exchanges of fire over the Lebanese-Israeli border, both sides have repeatedly pulled back when the spiral of reprisals appeared on the verge of going out of control, under heavy pressure from the U.S. and its allies. But in recent weeks, Israeli leaders have warned of a possible bigger military operation with the goal of stopping attacks from Lebanon to allow tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by the fighting to return to homes near the border. Here are some things to know about the situation: What were the latest strikes? An Israeli airstrike Friday brought down a high-rise building in Beirut’s southern suburbs, a Shi’ite-majority area known as Dahiyeh where Hezbollah has a strong presence. At least 14 people were killed and more than 60 wounded, the deadliest Israeli strike in the Lebanese capital since the 2006 Israel-Hezbollah war. The Israeli military said the strike killed Ibrahim Akil, the commander of Hezbollah’s elite Radwan unit, as well as other top leaders of the unit. Hezbollah later confirmed Akil was killed, a heavy blow to Hezbollah’s most effective fighters. Israel said Akil led the group’s campaign of rocket, drone and other fire into northern Israel. The strike came after the shock of the electronic device bombings, in which hundreds of pagers and walkie-talkies used by Hezbollah detonated on Tuesday and Wednesday. At least 37 people were killed, including two children, and some 3,000 wounded. Israel has neither confirmed nor denied its involvement. The casualties included some fighters from the group, but many of the wounded were civilians connected to Hezbollah’s social branches. Analysts say the attack has little effect on Hezbollah’s manpower, but could disrupt its communications and force it to take tighter security measures. What is the situation on the border? Hezbollah fired 140 rockets into northern Israel on Friday, saying it was targeting military sites in retaliation for overnight Israeli strikes into southern Lebanon. There was no immediate report of casualties. It was a continuation of the near daily drumbeat of exchanges over the border since the Gaza war began in October. The exchanges have killed some 600 people in Lebanon – mostly fighters but including around 100 civilians — and some 50 soldiers and civilians in Israel. It has also forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate homes near the border in both Israel and Lebanon. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah has promised retaliation for the electronic device bombings, raising fears of an escalation from the group. But Hezbollah has also proved wary of further stoking the crisis – it has not carried out its vows of revenge from Israel’s killing of a top commander, Fouad Shukur, in July. Hezbollah says its attacks against Israel are in support of Hamas. This week, Nasrallah said the barrages won’t end – and Israelis won’t be able to return to homes in the north – until Israel’s campaign in Gaza ends. As fighting in Gaza has slowed, Israel has fortified forces along the border with Lebanon, including the arrival this week of a powerful army division that took part in some of the heaviest fighting in Gaza. It is believed to include thousands of troops, including paratrooper infantry units and artillery and elite commando forces specially trained for operations behind enemy lines. Defense Minister Yoav Gallant this week declared the start of a 'new phase' of the war as Israel turns its focus toward Hezbollah. 'The center of gravity is shifting to the north by diverting resources and forces,' he said. What is Israel planning? Israeli officials say they have not yet made an official decision to expand military operations against Hezbollah – and have not said publicly what those operations might be. This week, the head of Israel’s Northern Command was quoted in local media as advocating for a ground invasion of Lebanon. A U.N.-brokered truce to their 2006 war called on Hezbollah to pull back 29 kilometers from the border, but it has refused to, accusing Israel of also failing to carry out some provisions. Israel is now demanding Hezbollah withdraw eight to 10 kilometers from the border – the range of Hezbollah’s anti-tank guided missiles. Israel and Hezbollah’s 2006 war was a devastating monthlong fight triggered when Hezbollah fighters kidnapped two Israeli soldiers in a cross-border raid. In that war, Israel heavily bombarded southern Lebanon and Beirut and sent a ground invasion into the south. The strategy, later explained by Israeli commanders, was to inflict the maximum damage possible in towns and neighborhoods where Hezbollah operated to deter them from launching attacks. It became known as the 'Dahiyeh Doctrine,' named after Beirut suburbs where large areas were levelled during the war. But Israel could have a more ambitious and controversial goal this time: to seize a buffer zone in south Lebanon to push back Hezbollah fighters from the border. A fight to hold territory threatens a longer, even more destructive and destabilizing war – recalling Israel’s 1982-2000 occupation of southern Lebanon. What would be the impact of a full-blown war? The fear is that it could turn out even worse than the 2006 war, which was traumatic enough for both sides to serve as a deterrent ever since. The 2006 fighting killed hundreds of Hezbollah fighters and an estimated 1,100 Lebanese civilians and left large swaths of the south and even parts of Beirut in ruins. More than 120 Israeli soldiers were killed and hundreds wounded. Hezbollah missile fire on Israeli cities brought the war to the public, killing dozens of civilians. Now, Israel estimates that Hezbollah possesses some 150,000 rockets and missiles, some of which are precision-guided, putting the entire country within range of Hezbollah fire. Israel has beefed up air defenses, but it is unclear whether it can defend against the intense barrages expected in a new war. Israel has vowed it could turn all of southern Lebanon into a battle zone, saying Hezbollah has embedded rockets, weapons and forces along the border. And in the heightened rhetoric of the past months, Israeli politicians have spoken of inflicting the same damage in Lebanon that the military has wreaked in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rapidly-escalating-israel-hezbollah-conflict-stirs-fears-of-wider-war/7793116.html	2024-09-21T01:56:13-07:00

Ukraine says Russian missile strike kills 3	Kyiv, Ukraine — An overnight Russian missile strike on the central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih killed a 12-year-old boy and two elderly women, regional governor Serhiy Lysak said Saturday. 'Again, a terrifying enemy attack on Kryvyi Rih. In the middle of the night, when the city slept,' Lysak wrote on Telegram. He said three more people were injured and were taken to a hospital with injuries of medium severity. The two women killed by the attack were 75 and 79 years old. Lysak also said two buildings were destroyed and 20 more damaged. Kryvyi Rih, a major steel-producing city, is near Russian-occupied territory. It is regularly hit by air strikes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-russian-missile-strike-kills-3-/7793101.html	2024-09-21T00:49:25-07:00

Volunteer network of interpreters hopes to make refugees' languages more accessible via AI	NEW YORK — They may be Tigrinya speakers fleeing the authoritarian Eritrean government's indefinite military service policy. Or Rohingya people escaping ethnic violence in Myanmar. But refugees navigating resettlement often face a shared hurdle: poor machine translations and a short supply of interpreters knowledgeable in their less-serviced languages. Tarjimly, a Google-backed nonprofit described as 'Uber for translators,' aims to help asylum seekers clear that hurdle. Through a new artificial intelligence partnership, Tarjimly trains outside large language models while allowing its volunteers to respond more urgently to needs for translators. It's a feedback loop where humans teach the nuances of each language to the machines by sharing data from one-on-one calls and correcting automated translations. And it's this uniquely human realm of language that Tarjimly co-founder Atif Javed believes exemplifies the ever-tricky balance between individuals' ingenuity and technological advancement. He says it's the needed personal touch that shows why AI's rapid development shouldn't generally stoke widespread fears. Languages popular in the Global South — such as the Dari and Pashto commonly spoken in Afghanistan, home to one of the world's largest protracted refugee crises — have the worst quality coverage, according to Javed. He feels well positioned to supplement the internet's English-dominated information troves that train services like Google Translate with his mobile app's more diverse data sets. Tarjimly connects refugees with on-demand interpreters, who can communicate during meetings with social workers, immigration officials and doctors, and records the encounters for AI training. To comply with patient privacy protections, Tarjimly anonymizes the conversations on its app. Javed said the nonprofit also has on option for 'no record' sessions where none of the data is stored for alternative uses. Many of its 60,000 volunteers are multilingual refugees themselves who more intimately understand not only their counterpart's native tongue but also the crisis that brought them there, according to Javed. Among them is Roza Tesfazion, a 26-year-old Eritrean refugee who works professionally as an interpreter for the United Kingdom's government. Fluent in Amharic and Tigrinya, she studied English and Swahili to help her immigrant family overcome language barriers when they first moved to Kenya. Tesfazion said she translates at no cost because she knows 'how emotional it is' for the people on the other side of her sessions. 'You have to have that touch of human emotions to it,' she said. Tarjimly's founders say their mission's sensitive nature lends itself to nonprofit status more than a corporate structure. Users arrive in very vulnerable positions, and the nonprofit works with established humanitarian groups including Catholic Charities, the International Rescue Committee and the United Nations' International Organization for Migration. The work requires a level of trust that would have been difficult to earn in a 'for-profit, competitive world,' according to Javed. 'The underlying engine of our success is the community we've built.' That community, however, also has room for artificial intelligence. A $1.3 million grant from Google.org has enabled a 'First Pass' tool that gives an instantly generated translation for human volunteers to revise. A new information hub will open up its language data for partners, including Google, in early 2025. But refining a more diverse library of languages will require conversational data at a scale much broader than Tarjimly can likely provide on its own, according to Data & Society researcher Ranjit Singh. Singh, who studies the social implications of automation and inclusive digital solutions, said translation services will always need a 'real person in the middle.' 'There is one part of it which is translation and another part of it which is just trying to understand somebody's life situation,' he said. 'Technologies help us do some of this work. But at the same time, it's also fairly social.' Tarjimly was inspired by Javed's time volunteering with Arabic speakers at refugee camps in Greece and Turkey after graduating from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and working in Silicon Valley. A Muslim American whose family immigrated to the United States in 2001, Javed said he was reminded of his own childhood translating for his refugee grandmother. His lived experience is one reason why Elevate Prize Foundation CEO Carolina Garcìa Jayaram said her organization awarded $300,000 last year to Tarjimly. That 'proximate leadership' helps nonprofits better understand developments like artificial intelligence that 'can be both cause for excitement and trepidation,' Jayaram said. The risk-averse philanthropic sector may be slow to catch up with disruptive new technologies, she noted, but shouldn't ignore their positive applications. 'It's a great example of how not to get stuck in that bogeyman complex about AI,' she said. 'To go to leaders who are closest to those issues and say, 'How would AI unlock the possibilities and opportunities for your organization?''	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd-volunteer-network-of-interpreters-hopes-to-make-refugees-languages-more-accessible-via-ai/7793003.html	2024-09-21T00:27:20-07:00	
Congo struggles to contain mpox; here’s why	KAVUMU, Congo — Health authorities have struggled to contain outbreaks of mpox in Congo, a huge central African country where a myriad of existing problems makes stemming the spread particularly hard. Last month, the World Health Organization declared the outbreaks in Congo and about a dozen other African countries a global health emergency. And in Congo, scientists have identified a new strain of mpox that may spread more easily. It has reached areas where conflict and the displacement of a large number of people have already put health services under pressure. Overall, Congo has more than 21,000 of the 25,093 confirmed and suspected mpox cases in Africa this year, according to WHO's most recent count. Has Congo seen cases of mpox before? Yes, Congo is one of the African countries where mpox has been endemic for decades. Mpox, once known as monkeypox, comes from the same family of viruses as smallpox but causes milder symptoms such as fever. People with more serious cases can develop skin lesions. More than 720 people in Africa have died in the latest outbreaks, mostly in Congo. Mpox is a zoonotic disease, meaning it can spread to humans from infected animals. In the global mpox outbreak of 2022, the virus spread between people primarily through sex and close physical contact. What changed in Congo? In September 2023, mpox spread to Congo's eastern province of South Kivu; it had previously been seen in the center and far west. Scientists then identified a new form of mpox in South Kivu that may be more infectious. The WHO said that from the outbreak in South Kivu, the virus spread among people elsewhere in the country, arriving in neighboring province North Kivu. Those two provinces — some 2,000 kilometers from the capital, Kinshasa — face escalating violence, a humanitarian crisis and other issues. What are the problems in eastern Congo? More than 120 armed groups have been fighting each other and the Congolese army for years in the eastern part of the country over the control of minerals. That has forced millions of people fleeing violence into refugee camps or nearby towns. That means mpox is hitting already-stretched health facilities. Dr. Musole Mulambamunva Robert, medical director of the Kavumu hospital in eastern Congo, said it is 'truly a challenge' — sometimes treating as many as four times the facility's capacity for patients. With more than 6 million displaced people in the east, authorities and aid agencies were already struggling to provide food and healthcare, while fighting other diseases such as cholera. Many people have no access to soap, clean water or other basics. Some eastern Congo communities are out of reach of health clinics — roads are unreliable, and hourslong risky boat trips are sometimes the only means of transport, said Mercy Muthee Lake of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent. People can be more susceptible to severe mpox cases because of malnutrition and undiagnosed HIV, she said. She also said health workers in eastern Congo have requested more mpox training as medications to treat fever and ease pain run out. Health authorities 'are up against it because it's such a complex area,' said Chris Beyrer, of Duke University's Global Health Institute. What about vaccines? Africa has no capacity to produce mpox vaccines. Around 250,000 doses have arrived in Congo from the European Union and the United States, and more are expected. Congolese authorities say they need around 3 million vaccines. It will likely be weeks before any vaccines reach people in eastern Congo. For now, the vaccine is approved only for adults. There's limited evidence of how it works in children. Vaccines are desperately needed, but they're just 'an additional tool,' said Emmanuel Lampaert, the Congo representative for Doctors Without Borders. The key, Lampaert said, is still identifying cases, isolating patients, and executing grassroots health and education campaigns. Local conditions make that trying — Lampaert noted it's almost impossible to isolate cases among poor, displaced people. 'Families with six to eight children are living in a hut, which is maybe the space of the bed we are sleeping in,' he said. 'So, this is the reality.' Why are critics blasting the mpox response? Unlike the millions of dollars that poured into Congo for Ebola and COVID aid, the response to mpox has been sluggish, many critics say. Health experts say the sharp contrast is due to a lack of both funds and international interest. 'Ebola is the most dangerous virus in the world, and COVID wiped out the world economy,' said professor Ali Bulabula, who works on infectious diseases in the medical department at Congo's University of Kindu. 'While mpox is a public health emergency of international concern, there is a lack of in-depth research and interest in the virus, as it's still seen as a tropical disease, localized to Africa with no major impact on Western economies.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-struggles-to-contain-mpox-here-s-why-/7792992.html	2024-09-21T00:26:42-07:00	
As traces of Pakistani megacity's past vanish, flamboyant pink palace endures	KARACHI, Pakistan — Stained glass windows, a sweeping staircase and embellished interiors make Mohatta Palace a gem in Karachi, a Pakistani megacity of 20 million people. Peacocks roam the lawn and the sounds of construction and traffic melt away as visitors enter the grounds. The pink stone balustrades, domes and parapets look like they've been plucked from the northern Indian state of Rajasthan, a relic of a time when Muslims and Hindus lived side by side in the port city. But magnificence is no guarantee of survival in a city where land is scarce and development is rampant. Demolition, encroachment, neglect, piecemeal conservation laws and vandalism are eroding signs of Karachi's past. The building's trustees have fended off an attempt to turn it into a dental college, but there's still a decadeslong lawsuit in which heirs of a former owner are trying to take control of the land. It sat empty for almost two decades before formally opening as a museum in 1999. The palace sits on prime real estate in the desirable neighborhood of Old Clifton, among mansions, businesses and upmarket restaurants. The land under buildings like the Mohatta Palace is widely coveted, said palace lawyer Faisal Siddiqi. 'It shows that greed is more important than heritage.' Karachi's population grows by around 2% every year and with dozens of communities and cultures competing for space there's little effort to protect the city's historic sites. For most Pakistanis, the palace is the closest they'll get to the architectural splendor of India's Rajasthan, because travel restrictions and hostile bureaucracies largely keep people in either country from crossing the border for leisure, study or work. Karachi's multicultural past makes it harder to find champions for preservation than in a city like Lahore, with its strong connection to the Muslim-dominated Mughal Empire, said Heba Hashmi, a heritage manager and maritime archaeologist. 'The scale of organic local community support needed to prioritize government investment in the preservation effort is nearly impossible to garner in a city as socially fragmented as Karachi,' she said. Mohatta Palace is a symbol of that diversity. Hindu entrepreneur Shivratan Mohatta had it built in the 1920s because he wanted a coastal residence for his ailing wife to benefit from the Arabian Sea breeze. Hundreds of donkey carts carried the distinctively colored pink stone from Jodhpur, now across the border in India. He left after partition in 1947, when India and Pakistan were carved from the former British Empire as independent nations, and for a time the palace was occupied by the Foreign Ministry. Next, it passed into the hands of Pakistani political royalty as the home of Fatima Jinnah, the younger sister of Pakistan's first leader and a powerful politician in her own right. After her death, the authorities gave the building to her sister Shirin, but Shirin's passing in 1980 sparked a court fight between people saying they were her relatives, and a court ordered the building sealed. The darkened and empty palace, with its overgrown gardens and padlocked gates, caught people's imagination. Rumors spread of spirits and supernatural happenings. Someone who heard the stories as a young girl was Nasreen Askari, now the museum's director. 'As a child I used to rush past,' she said. 'I was told it was a bhoot (ghost) bungalow and warned, don't go there.' Visitor Ahmed Tariq had heard a lot about the palace's architecture and history. 'I'm from Bahawalpur (in Punjab, India) where we have the Noor Mahal palace, so I wanted to look at this one. It's well-maintained, there's a lot of detail and effort in the presentations. It's been a good experience.' But the money to maintain the palace isn't coming from admission fees. General admission is 30 rupees, or 10 U.S. cents, and it's free for students, children and seniors. On a sweltering afternoon, the palace drew just a trickle of visitors. It's open Tuesday to Sunday but closes on public holidays; even the 11 a.m.-6 p.m. hours are not conducive for a late-night city like Karachi. The palace is rented out for corporate and charitable events. Local media report that residents grumble about traffic and noise levels. But the palace doesn't welcome all attention, even if it could help carve out a space for the building in modern Pakistan. Rumors about ghosts still spread by TikTok, pulling in influencers looking for spooky stories. But the palace bans filming inside, and briefly banned TikTokers. 'It is not the attention the trustees wanted,' said Askari. 'That's what happens when you have anything of consequence or unusual. It catches the eye.' A sign on the gates also prohibits fashion shoots, weddings and filming for commercials. 'We could make so much money, but the floodgates would open,' said Askari. 'There would be non-stop weddings and no space for visitors or events, so much cleaning up as well.' Hashmi, the archaeologist, said there is often a strong sense of territorialism around the sites that have been preserved. 'It counterproductively converts a site of public heritage into an exclusive and often expensive artifact for selective consumption.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-traces-of-pakistani-megacity-s-past-vanish-flamboyant-pink-palace-endures/7791582.html	2024-09-21T00:26:00-07:00

Residents of Springfield, Ohio, wait for political firestorm to blow over	SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — In the quiet corners of Springfield, Ohio — out of sight of the drumbeat of politicians and journalists, troopers and newly installed security cameras — the people who live here are taking a breath, praying and attempting to carry on. Between the morning bomb sweeps of Springfield's schools and the near daily afternoon media briefings, a hush comes over the city of 58,000 that residents say is uncanny, haunting even. It's fear. It's confusion — dismay at being transformed overnight into a target for the nation's vitriol. Pastor Andy Mobley, who runs the Family Needs Inc. food pantry on the city's south side, said people are hunkered down out of the public eye. He said they're hoping the attention sparked by former President Donald Trump spreading unsubstantiated rumors about the city's legal Haitian immigrants eating house pets during last week's presidential debate will blow over. Trump and his vice presidential running mate, Ohio's junior Sen. JD Vance, have used the cat-eating rumors to draw attention to the city's 15,000 Haitian immigrants, whose arrival to fill manufacturing, distribution and warehouse jobs has put a severe strain on local resources. Since the Republican candidates' initial comments, more than two dozen bomb threats — mostly from foreign actors seeking to sow discord — have prompted the state to send in additional state troopers and install surveillance cameras around the city in order to reopen schools and government buildings. 'We've got good people here. Republican, Democrat. They're good people,' Mobley said Tuesday, as the pantry tended to a steady stream of clients seeking clothing and food. Resident Josh Valle said the situation is unsettling. 'We definitely need answers,' said the 35-year-old tool and die repairman, who has lived in Springfield for decades. 'It's affecting my kids and my community and my neighbors. With the bomb threats and the influx, it's something new every day. And this used to be a really chill town, you know, it used to be just a small town Ohio.' The area around Springfield City Hall, where Valle spoke, sat largely silent Tuesday afternoon, until a news conference with state and local officials prompted a brief swarm of activity. Local families are avoiding schools in the wake of earlier bomb threats, even though dozens of troopers have fanned out across the Springfield City School District to stand guard. Some 200 of 500 students were absent Tuesday from a single elementary school, officials said. Still, there are signs of hope. 'Home Sweet Springfield' tea towels adorn the window of Champion City Guide & Supply on a downtown block that bustles with activity over the lunch hour. One line of mugs and clothing items reads: 'Speak a Good Word for Springfield — or say nothing.' Across town, a small group of kids whose parents kept them home on Tuesday horsed around together at a makeshift lemonade stand they set up to make a few bucks. They delighted in the revving motor of a passing muscle car and, when sales were slow, swigged back the merchandise. David Graham, who visits communities in crisis as The Praying Cowboy, positioned himself in Springfield this week to show support. 'Agenda: Pray, worship, witness, smile, honor, esteem,' he wrote in a Facebook post from the city, accompanied by his hands holding an open Bible with a newly installed surveillance platform in the background. He added lines with black electrical tape to a small heart placard he posted nearby, to represent Springfield hearts being broken. He wasn't the only one trying to help. A bipartisan group of area mayors met with Springfield Mayor Rob Rue on Monday to figure out how they can help — including with resources to address the traffic, health care, social services and housing needs prompted by the increase in the Haitian population and their language barrier. Andrew Ginther, the Democratic mayor of Ohio's capital, Columbus, and president of the U.S. Conference of Mayors, said in a statement: 'Mayors across America will continue to stand by Springfield and all cities working to responsibly address an increased number of migrants, which we can do without losing sight of our shared humanity.' Years ago, Family Needs Inc. was designated one of President George H.W. Bush's 'thousand points of light,' honoring its dedication to volunteerism. The organization has helped Haitians arriving in Springfield for years now, Mobley said — providing them translation services and co-signing their rental agreements. He recalled working with Haitian immigrants as far back as 2016, the year Trump was elected — though census figures show the population remained at only about 400 until a few years ago. 'In 2016, we started signing contracts. Through the pandemic, we were doing things for the Haitian community,' he said. 'Has that all been forgotten? They have been here, and we've been dealing with this, and we've been asking for help through two different administrations. And no administration has helped us, until now this thing has become public.' As she walked downtown, one resident who declined to give her name said she's not letting the situation get her down. 'It's childish. It's stupid. It took one stupid person to get on a debate and ruin the reputation of a community. I think you know exactly who I'm talking about,' she said. 'He should never have said that. There's no truth to those allegations whatsoever. I was born and raised in this town, I'm staying here, and I have no problem with nobody.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/residents-of-springfield-ohio-wait-for-political-firestorm-to-blow-over/7791540.html	2024-09-21T00:23:21-07:00	
Faces of transgender people adorn an artwork in London's Trafalgar Square	LONDON — An artwork featuring the plaster face casts of hundreds of transgender people went on display Wednesday in London's Trafalgar Square, where their features will be worn away by London's wind and rain over the next 18 months. Mexican artist Teresa Margolles' 'Mil Veces un Instante (A Thousand Times in an Instant)' is a 3.3-metric-ton cube covered in face masks of 726 trans, nonbinary and gender nonconforming people. It's the latest artwork placed atop the 'Fourth Plinth,' a large stone pedestal in the central London square. Margolles, who trained as a forensic pathologist and once worked in a morgue, has used blood and material from crime scenes in artworks exploring death and conflict. The new sculpture evokes a Tzompantli, a rack used in Mesoamerican civilizations to display the skulls of captured enemies and sacrifice victims. It pays tribute to one of the artist's friends, a transgender woman named Karla who was killed in Ciudad Juárez, Mexico in 2015. The crime remains unsolved. 'We pay this tribute to her and to all the other people who were killed for reasons of hate,' the artist said. 'But, above all, to those who live on, to the new generations who will defend the power to freely choose to live with dignity.' Organizers of the project say the work will 'naturally age' while on display, with the detail of the faces slowly fading as the plaster is exposed to the elements. One of London's main gathering spots for tourists and protesters, Trafalgar Square was named for Admiral Horatio Nelson's 1805 victory over the French and Spanish fleets. A statue of the one-armed admiral stands atop Nelson's Column at the center of the square, and statues of other 19th-century military leaders are nearby. The fourth plinth — 7-meter-high stone pedestal — was erected in 1841 for a never-completed equestrian statue, and since 1999 has been occupied by a series of artworks for about 18 months at a time. Previous occupants included a giant bronze thumb, a sculpture of a giant swirl of whipped cream topped with a cherry, a fly and a drone, and 2,400 members of the public who each stood atop the plinth for an hour over the course of 100 days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/faces-of-transgender-people-adorn-an-artwork-in-london-s-trafalgar-square/7790103.html	2024-09-21T00:22:13-07:00

How three US men ended up facing death penalty over Congo coup attempt	KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of Congo — A military court in Democratic Republic of Congo, one of Africa's largest countries, has convicted three Americans and dozens of others of taking part in a coup attempt and imposed 'the harshest penalty, that of death.' The court convicted the 37 defendants, including the three Americans and imposed the death penalty in a verdict delivered by presiding judge Maj. Freddy Ehuma at an open-air military court proceeding. The defendants, a majority of them Congolese but also including a Briton, a Belgian and a Canadian, were charged with terrorism, murder, criminal association and illegal possession of weapons, among other charges. The lawyer who defended the six foreigners said they would appeal the verdicts. The U.S. State Department strongly discourages travel to Congo, warning of violent crime and civil unrest. Here's how the three Americans ended up in the middle of the coup attempt. What happened during the coup attempt in May? In Congo's capital Kinshasa, a ragtag group including three Americans tried to unseat the country's President Felix Tshisekedi. They were led by a little-known opposition figure, Christian Malanga, who sold used cars and dabbled in gold mining before persuading his Utah-born son to join in the foiled coup. The coup attempt began at the Kinshasa residence of Tshisekedi's close ally, Vital Kamerhe, a federal legislator and a candidate for Speaker of the National Assembly of Congo. His guards killed some of the attackers, officials said. Christian Malanga, meanwhile, was live-streaming video from the presidential palace in which he is seen surrounded by several armed men in military uniforms wandering around in the middle of the night. He was later killed while resisting arrest, Congolese authorities said. Dozens, including Malanga's son and two other Americans, were arrested and brought to a high-security military prison in Kinshasa. Family members said the young men have been sleeping on the floor, struggling with health issues and have had to pay for food and hygiene products. Christian Malanga, the unlikely coup leader Malanga, who was born in Kinshasa, had described himself as a refugee who thrived after settling in the U.S. with his family in the 1990s. He said he became a leader of a Congolese opposition political party and met high-level officials in Washington and the Vatican. He also described himself as a devoted husband and father of eight. Court records and interviews paint another picture. In 2001, the year he turned 18, Malanga was convicted in Utah of assault with a firearm, which resulted in a 30-day jail sentence and three years of probation. That same year, he was charged with domestic violence assault in one incident and battery and disturbing the peace in another, but he pleaded not guilty and all counts in both cases were dismissed. In 2004, he was charged with domestic violence with threat of using a dangerous weapon, but he pleaded not guilty and the charges were again dismissed. Since 2004, records show several cases related to a custody dispute and a child support dispute. How three young Americans got involved in a coup attempt The three imprisoned Americans are Malanga's 21-year-old son Marcel Malanga, Tyler Thompson Jr., 21, who flew to Africa from Utah with the younger Malanga for what his family believed was a free vacation, and Benjamin Reuben Zalman-Polun, 36, who is reported to have known Christian Malanga through a gold mining company. Marcel Malanga is a U.S. citizen and was born in Utah. He told the court his father had threatened to kill him and Thompson if they did not take part in the attack. His mother, Brittney Sawyer, has said her son is innocent and was simply following his father, who considered himself president of a shadow government in exile. Thompson was his high school friend and football teammate in the Salt Lake City suburb of West Jordan. He was the only former teammate to accept Marcel Malanga's invitation to travel to Congo, according to several other players who told The Associated Press they had been invited to what the younger Malanga pitched interchangeably as a family vacation or as a service trip to build wells. Other teammates alleged that Marcel Malanga had offered up to $100,000 to join him on a 'security job' in Congo. Thompson's family maintains he had no knowledge of the elder Malanga's intentions, no plans for political activism and didn't even plan to enter Congo. He and the Malangas were meant to travel only to South Africa and Eswatini, his stepmother, Miranda Thompson, said. Here's what happens next All of those convicted have five days to appeal the verdict. Richard Bondo, the lawyer who defended the Americans and three other foreigners, said he plans to do so. Congo reinstated the death penalty earlier this year, lifting a more than two-decade-old moratorium, as authorities struggle to curb violence and militant attacks in the country. The men convicted in the coup attempt would likely be executed by firing squad. The U.S. State Department has not declared the Americans wrongfully detained, making it unlikely that U.S. officials would try to negotiate their return.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-three-us-men-ended-up-facing-death-penalty-over-congo-coup-attempt-/7790062.html	2024-09-21T00:19:05-07:00

New Zealand pilot Phillip Mehrtens freed from captivity in Indonesia's Papua	JAKARTA, Indonesia — New Zealand pilot Phillip Mehrtens has been freed more than 19 months after being kidnapped by armed separatists in Indonesia's Papua, authorities said on Saturday. Mehrtens was freed and picked up by a joint team in the Nduga area and was undergoing health check-ups and a psychological examination in Timika regency, the Indonesian police said in a statement. A faction of the West Papua National Liberation Army (TPNPB), led by Egianus Kogoya, kidnapped Mehrtens on February 7, 2023, after he landed a small commercial plane in the remote, mountainous area of Nduga. 'We are pleased and relieved to confirm that Phillip Mehrtens is safe and well and has been able to talk with his family. This news must be an enormous relief for his friends and loved ones,' said New Zealand Foreign Minister Winston Peters. A range of New Zealand government agencies had been working with Indonesian authorities and others toward securing Mehrtens' release, Peters said in a statement. Indonesian Brigadier General Faizal Ramadhani, head of Cartenz 2024 Peace Operations, said, 'We are prioritizing approach through religious leaders, church leaders, traditional leaders and Egianus Kogoya's close family to minimize casualties and maintain the safety of the pilot.' Indonesian police said they would hold a press conference later Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-pilot-phillip-mehrtens-freed-from-captivity-in-indonesia-s-papua/7793082.html	2024-09-20T23:39:31-07:00	
Souls of Ancestors' display stirs new interest in Cambodian antiquity	PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA — Nhem Liza made her first visit to the National Museum of Cambodia after learning about the August return from the United States of dozens of looted Cambodian artifacts, including important Hindu and Buddhist masterpieces dating from the ninth to 14th centuries. 'Those artifacts are amazing,' said 15-year-old Nhem, a 10th grade Phnom Penh high school student. The return of the statues — viewed as divine or containing the souls of ancestors — has given younger Cambodians like Nhem an opportunity to embrace the country’s cultural heritage and history. 'I am excited to see these artifacts our government is trying to get back,' she told VOA on September 16 after viewing some of objects now on display at the museum. Cambodia has worked for years to identify and secure the return of culturally and historically important relics from private collections and museums overseas, many of which were lost to the country because of war, theft and the illegal artifact trade. Cambodia faced continuous civil unrest from the mid-1960s until the early 1990s and archeological sites from the ancient Khmer Empire, such as Angkor Wat and Koh Ker, suffered serious damage and widespread looting, Cambodian officials told VOA Khmer. In August, Cambodia celebrated the return of 70 items from museums and private collections overseas, including 14 from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. The objects include priceless stone statues such as one depicting a mythical warrior from the Hindu epic Mahabharata. There are also statues of Hindu deities Shiva and Parvati, and one of the Hindu god Ardhanarishvara from the ancient capital of Koh Ker, according to Ministry of Culture and Fine Arts. Presiding over the return ceremony, Prime Minister Hun Manet said the 70 returned objects symbolically reunited the Cambodian people with their 'ancestral souls,' adding that the government will continue working to bring more artifacts home. From 1996 to July of this year, 1,098 artifacts had been returned to Cambodia — 571 from private collections and 527 from foreign institutions and governments, Hun said. 'It is the soul of our nation,' Doeun Sokun Aly, 18, told VOA at the museum. 'The heroes of our country built those artifacts for the younger generation to know about those antiques. … I will visit museums more to see more artifacts.' National Museum Director Chhay Visoth told VOA the display is meant to stir new interest from Cambodians, especially younger Cambodians. 'Recently, we have seen a surprising increase of Cambodian visitors to the museum, especially youth,' he said by phone this week. The authorities, he said, are now planning to conduct a 'mobile exhibition' to display the artifacts at museums in provinces such as Siem Reap, Battambang and Pursat, in the northwestern part of the country. Chhay said the museum also hopes the display will send a message to private collectors and museums overseas that 'those artifacts are greatly important' and 'not for beautifying gardens, kitchens, living rooms, residents or offices of the rich.' 'For Cambodians, they are meaningful indeed. Those artifacts are the souls of Khmer ancestors,' he said. Chhay added that the museum is already planning to expand its display area to accommodate more returned artifacts. Over the years, Cambodia has received dozens of statues from the families of wealthy collectors, such as George Lindemann, a U.S. businessman and philanthropist who died in 2018. In 2021, after three years of negotiations, the family of the late British art collector Douglas Latchford agreed to return more than 100 Cambodian artifacts, according to the government. Latchford, who co-authored three books on Cambodian art and antiques, died in 2020 facing accusations that he had illegally trafficked the artifacts to his homes in Bangkok and London. In November 2019, federal prosecutors in New York charged Latchford with falsifying the provenance, invoices and shipping documents to transport valuable Khmer-era relics to private collections, museums and auction houses around the world. Other cultural objects that have found their way back to Cambodia went through processes including voluntary returns, negotiations, seizures and legal proceedings. The United States has helped secure the return of well over 150 antiques to Cambodia so far, Wesley Holzer, a U.S. Embassy spokesperson in Phnom Penh said. 'The United States is proud of its longstanding contributions to preserving and restoring Cambodia’s cultural heritage,' he told VOA in an email, adding that Cambodia is the first country in Southeast Asia to establish a bilateral property repatriation memorandum of understanding with the U.S. 'Through this MOU, the United States and Cambodia have trained heritage professionals, prevented pillaging of antiquities, and facilitated the return of looted artifacts. This agreement also makes it illegal to import certain Cambodian archeological and ethnological material into the United States,' he added. Bradley Gordon, a lawyer representing Cambodian government, said there were 'many more' that his team are searching for. 'To be clear, Cambodia does not want to empty out museums around the world, but wants many important and precious national treasures to come home. Cambodia also is open to long-term loans which they are exploring with a number of museums,' he added. A member of Gordon’s restitution team, Cambodian researcher Kunthea Chhoun, said getting the artifacts back is not easy. 'We need to investigate and collect testimonies from looters, villagers and brokers. It takes a great amount of patience and many interviews. We have used different approaches to get back our artifacts and it has taken many years,' she told VOA in a September 20 email.	https://www.voanews.com/a/souls-of-ancestors-display-stirs-new-interest-in-cambodian-antiquity/7793071.html	2024-09-20T21:57:52-07:00

Iran’s exiled prince urges Israelis to fund civil disobedience in Islamic Republic	Washington — The son of Iran’s last monarch, exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi, is urging Israelis to help fund civil disobedience movements in the Islamic Republic as part of his campaign for regime change. The U.S.-based Pahlavi made the appeal in a VOA interview after speaking on Friday at the Israeli-American Council national summit at the Washington Hilton. The event is an annual gathering of Israeli American activists, their Jewish American allies and other Israel supporters. Pahlavi drew cheers and standing ovations from the audience for urging Israelis to work with Iranians to oust the radical clerics who have ruled Iran since overthrowing his father in 1979. The speech was his most high-profile outreach to Israelis since traveling to Israel in April 2023, when he became the most prominent Iranian opposition figure to make a public visit to the Jewish state. The following transcript of Pahlavi’s interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: In your IAC speech, you urged the audience to take action. What kinds of actions do you expect to see from Israeli Americans, Israelis in general and the Israeli government when it comes to achieving regime change? Reza Pahlavi, exiled Iranian crown prince: There are two major components in this campaign. On one hand, it is important to put maximum pressure on the regime. Parallel to that is maximum support for the people of Iran. We are trying to foment civil disobedience movements within Iran, ranging from protests to labor strikes. It is important to fund them. Many diaspora Iranians would like to help. But U.S. sanctions make it almost impossible for them to, for instance, transfer money back home. Many aspects of the sanctions rules have to change to facilitate that. It requires a new U.S. policy. There also needs to be an appropriate media strategy to counter the regime's propaganda machinery. All aspects of the campaign should be coordinated with some key governments that can help. VOA: Iran and its main proxy Hezbollah are once again threatening revenge against Israel for alleged Israeli attacks on Hezbollah communications devices in Lebanon this week. What is your message to the Islamic Republic as it considers its next move? Pahlavi: There is no message to give to warmongers who stand against freedom, peace, human rights and even our national identity. Iranians, by the millions, have shown how much they despise this regime and want to tell the world that it does not represent us. Iranians are peace lovers. We want to have good relationships with our neighborhood — with Arabs, Israelis and the rest of the world. This is why I’m not going to waste my time telling the regime anything. At the end of the day, the solution is for the Iranian people themselves to put an end to this regime. But as I said in my speech, they have done all of this work alone so far. They need extra support to have a chance of success. VOA: In the audience, some Iranian Muslims waved Iran’s former Lion and Sun flag and chanted your name, reflecting the support you have in the diaspora for your friendship toward Israel. But there also are some in the diaspora who accuse you of supporting Israeli aggression toward Palestinians and others in the region. What is your message to Iranians who are skeptical of your view that they need to embrace Israel to achieve regime change? Pahlavi: I think a strategic partnership with a country like Israel brings a tremendous amount of opportunities for sharing technological knowhow. One of the reasons for my trip to Israel was to explore the possibilities of using their expertise in water management for agriculture. We are facing a drought and water crisis in Iran, so we need to have a cordial relationship with such governments. It is unfortunate that when we have such a conflict [like the Israel-Hamas war], there always are casualties. Of course, my heart goes out to many victims. The main problem is the regime itself. As long as it is there, it will not allow for normalization [of relations in the region], or for stability and peace. I’ve been insisting for years that as long as you don’t eliminate the source of the problem, which finances terrorism and forces governments to act and react, we will never be rid of it. The solution is for this regime to go. That is what the majority of the Iranian people are calling for. And what I’ve been calling for is solidarity. I think governments, including Israel, are very cognizant of, and know the difference between, the people of Iran and the regime that has nothing to do with the people’s aspirations. The regime is only there to represent its own self-interest at the expense of the Iranian people. This story was produced in collaboration with VOA’s Persian Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-exiled-prince-urges-israelis-to-fund-civil-disobedience-in-islamic-republic/7793045.html	2024-09-20T19:26:36-07:00	
X names Brazil legal representative, its lawyers say	sao paulo, brazil — Elon Musk-owned social media platform X has named a legal representative in Brazil, the firm's lawyers said Friday, in a move that would address one of the demands imposed by Brazil's top court to allow the company to operate in the country. Andre Zonaro and Sergio Rosenthal, who were recently appointed as X's lawyers in Brazil, told Reuters that colleague Rachel de Oliveira Conceicao was chosen as the firm's legal representative. In late August, Brazil's top court ordered mobile and internet service providers to block X in the nation, and users were cut off within hours. The shutdown followed a monthslong dispute between Musk and Brazilian Justice Alexandre de Moraes over X's noncompliance with court orders demanding the platform take action against the spread of hate speech. Courts have previously blocked accounts implicated in probes of allegedly spreading misinformation and hate, which Musk has denounced as censorship, and had also ordered X to name a local legal representative as required by Brazilian law, after the firm closed its offices in Brazil in mid-August. On Thursday, the lawyers representing X in Brazil said the firm would present a legal representative to the local Supreme Court 'very soon.' They also said the firm was starting to comply with the orders on removing content, which is another demand from the top court.	https://www.voanews.com/a/x-names-brazil-legal-representative-its-lawyers-say-/7793042.html	2024-09-20T18:54:14-07:00	
UN denounces Lebanon device blasts as violation of international law	United Nations — The United Nations said Friday that the detonation of handheld communication devices in Lebanon could constitute a war crime as Beirut's top diplomat accused Israel of orchestrating what he called a terror attack. The blasts that killed at least 37 people and wounded nearly 3,000 on Tuesday and Wednesday targeted communication devices used by the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. Pagers and walkie-talkies exploded as their users were shopping in supermarkets, walking on streets and attending funerals, plunging the country into panic. 'International humanitarian law prohibits the use of booby-trap devices in the form of apparently harmless portable objects,' the U.N.'s high commissioner for human rights, Volker Turk, told the Security Council during an emergency session on Lebanon requested by Algeria. 'It is a war crime to commit violence intended to spread terror among civilians,' he added, repeating his call for an 'independent, rigorous and transparent' investigation. 'I am appalled by the breadth and impact of the attacks,' said Turk. 'These attacks represent a new development in warfare, where communication tools become weapons,' he added. 'This cannot be the new normal.' Speaking at the Security Council, Lebanon's top diplomat, Abdallah Bouhabib, called the attack 'an unprecedented method of warfare in its brutality and terror.' 'Israel, through this terrorist aggression, has violated the basic principles of international humanitarian law,' he said, calling Israel a 'rogue state.' Israel has not commented on the device blasts but has said it will widen the scope of its war in Gaza to include the Lebanon front. 'We have no intention to enter a war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, but we cannot continue the way it is,' Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, told reporters Friday. Speaking at the Security Council, he said Israel would do 'whatever it takes' to restore security in northern areas. Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, said the body was 'very concerned about the heightened escalation' across the Lebanon-Israel frontier after Friday's Israeli strike on Beirut. He called for 'maximum restraint' from all sides.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-denounces-lebanon-device-blasts-as-violation-of-international-law-/7793030.html	2024-09-20T18:35:26-07:00	
Biden opens home to Quad leaders for farewell summit	Wilmington, Delaware — President Joe Biden hosted Australia's prime minister at his Delaware home Friday at the start of a weekend summit with the 'Quad' group he has pushed as a counterweight to China. Biden chose Wilmington for a summit of leaders from Australia, India and Japan — the last of his presidency after he dropped out of the 2024 election against Donald Trump and handed the Democratic campaign reins to Vice President Kamala Harris. After a one-on-one meeting at his property with Australia's Anthony Albanese on Friday night, he will welcome Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida at his home on Saturday. Biden will then host an 'intimate' dinner and full four-way summit that day at his former high school in the city. 'This will be President Biden's first time hosting foreign leaders in Wilmington as president — a reflection of his deep personal relationships with each of the Quad leaders,' said press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. Harris will not be attending, the White House said. The Quad grouping dates to 2007, but Biden has strongly pushed it as part of an emphasis on international alliances after the isolationist Trump years. China was expected to feature heavily in their discussions amid tensions with Beijing, particularly a series of recent confrontations between Chinese and Philippine vessels in the disputed South China Sea. 'It will certainly be high on the agenda,' National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said, adding that the four leaders had a 'common understanding about the challenges that the PRC [People's Republic of China] is posing.' The White House, however, faced criticism for giving only limited access to the press throughout the weekend, with reporters questioning whether it was at the request of the media-shy Modi. The prime minister was coaxed to take two questions during a state visit to the White House in 2023 but had not held an open press conference at home in his previous nine years in power. The White House insisted Biden would not shy away from addressing rights issues with Modi, who has faced accusations of growing authoritarianism. 'There's not a conversation that he has with foreign leaders where he doesn't talk about the importance of respecting human and civil rights, and that includes with Prime Minister Modi,' Kirby said. India is to host the next Quad summit in 2025. Biden is famously proud of his home in Wilmington, about 176 kilometers from Washington, and he frequently spends weekends there away from the White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-opens-home-to-quad-leaders-for-farewell-summit/7793023.html	2024-09-20T18:23:02-07:00	
US soldier who entered North Korea pleads guilty to desertion	Washington — A U.S. soldier who crossed into North Korea last year pleaded guilty to desertion on Friday as part of a plea agreement and was sentenced to 12 months of confinement, his lawyer said. Because of good behavior and time served, the soldier was released, according to the lawyer. Travis King was facing 14 charges related to him fleeing across the border from South Korea into the North in July 2023 while on a sightseeing tour of the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Korean Peninsula, and for prior incidents. But he pleaded guilty to just five — desertion, assault on a noncommissioned officer, and three counts of disobeying an officer — as part of a deal that was accepted on Friday by a military judge. 'The judge, under the terms of the plea deal, sentenced Travis to one year of confinement, reduction in rank to private (E-1), forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a dishonorable discharge,' a statement from King's attorney Franklin Rosenblatt said. 'With time already served and credit for good behavior, Travis is now free and will return home,' the statement said. 'Travis King has faced significant challenges throughout his life, including a difficult upbringing, exposure to criminal environments, and struggles with mental health,' Rosenblatt said. 'All these factors have compounded the hardships he faced in the military.' In a statement, the U.S. Army's Office of Special Trial Counsel confirmed King's guilty plea as part of a deal and said that 'pursuant to the terms of the plea agreement, all other charges and specifications were dismissed.' 'The outcome of today's court martial is a fair and just result that reflects the seriousness of the offenses committed by Pvt. King,' prosecutor Major Allyson Montgomery said in the statement. At the time of the incident, King had been stationed in South Korea, and after a drunken bar fight and a stay in South Korean jail, he was supposed to fly back to Texas to face disciplinary hearings. Instead, he walked out of the Seoul-area airport, joined a DMZ sightseeing trip and slipped over the fortified border where he was detained by the communist North's authorities. Pyongyang had said that King had defected to North Korea to escape 'mistreatment and racial discrimination in the U.S. Army.' But after completing its investigation, North Korea 'decided to expel' King in September for illegally intruding into its territory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-soldier-who-entered-north-korea-pleads-guilty-to-desertion/7793010.html	2024-09-20T18:11:13-07:00

War set to dominate agenda at UN General Assembly meeting	UNITED NATIONS — World leaders are set to descend on the United Nations in the coming days to talk about a lengthy list of global challenges. But will they spur significant action on any of them? 'We see out-of-control geopolitical divisions and runaway conflicts — not least in Ukraine, Gaza, Sudan and beyond,' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres told reporters at a news conference ahead of the annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. Those three wars are set to dominate the agenda — both in leaders' speeches before the assembly and at numerous side meetings. Gaza Getting to a cease-fire in Gaza is even more urgent now that Israel has turned its attention to its northern border with Lebanon and looks determined to build on a significant blow to Hezbollah militants there. 'We are at the start of a new phase in the war — it requires courage, determination and perseverance on our part,' Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told soldiers at the northern Ramat David Airbase on Wednesday. 'It is critical that we operate in close cooperation between the [security] organizations, at all levels.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas plan to address the General Assembly. 'President Abbas will focus on the plight of his people — he will focus on the genocide campaign that's taking place, he will warn of the danger of this conflict exploding in the West Bank, and will warn also of the dangers of this conflict not reaching a cease-fire soon, in terms of its implications for the region and regional stability,' Randa Slim, senior fellow at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, told VOA. In March, a U.N. official said there were reasonable grounds to believe genocide had been committed in Gaza. Slim continued, 'On the other hand, you are going to see the Israeli prime minister reminding people of the terror of October 7, casting the light on the fact that they are in a war of defense, and he is going to reemphasize the priorities of the war … which is the eradication of Hamas.' In March, Francesca Albanese, the U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in the occupied Palestinian territories, said there were 'reasonable grounds' to think Israel has been committing genocide against Palestinians in Gaza. Ukraine More than 2½ years after Russia invaded Ukraine, peace remains elusive. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will be in New York calling for international support at a critical time in the war, and as the conflict, in many capitals, has been superseded by the situation in Gaza. 'I think Ukrainian diplomats themselves are a bit worried that their war is going down the agenda,' Richard Gowan, U.N. director at International Crisis Group, told VOA. 'But the reality is that the battle between Israel and Hamas has torn the U.N. apart over the last year, and that is going to be the number one focus for a lot of presidents and prime ministers.' On Tuesday, Zelenskyy will address a high-level U.N. Security Council meeting on Ukraine, and the following day he will speak at the General Assembly. 'I think he will emphasize the problem of Russian aggression, and that not only Europe, but the rest of the world, must remain on guard for Russia's attempt to assert its imperial powers,' William Pomeranz, senior fellow at the Wilson Center's Kennan Institute told VOA. 'And that the support of Ukraine is a crucial part of global security at the present time.' On Thursday, Zelenskyy will head to Washington to meet with President Joe Biden at the White House. Russian President Vladimir Putin will not be coming to New York, but veteran Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is scheduled to address the General Assembly on September 28. Sudan On the African continent, two rival generals in Sudan have been mired in a brutal 17-month struggle for power that has devastated the country. Violence, famine and disease are stalking the population, and 10 million people have fled their homes in search of safety. The war's current epicenter is the North Darfur capital of El Fasher, where the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have advanced on the city and the Sudanese Armed Forces inside El Fasher have been trying to repel them. 'The lives of hundreds of thousands of people, including more than 700,000 internally displaced persons in and around El Fasher, are at immediate threat,' acting U.N. humanitarian chief Joye Msuya told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. The United States, Saudi Arabia, African Union and others have pursued a variety of peace initiatives for months. They have failed to silence the guns, but the U.S. has been successful in opening up some new routes for humanitarian relief into Sudan. On September 25, ministers will meet to discuss the humanitarian response at a session organized by officials from the U.N., U.S, European Union, African Union, Egypt and Saudi Arabia. The head of the Sudanese Armed Forces and chairman of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, General Abdel Fattah Burhan, is coming to New York. U.N. chief Guterres said he would 'express my enormous frustration' to him about the lack of a cease-fire and the start of a serious political process. Haiti While it may not grab as many global headlines as Ukraine and Gaza, there is a lot of international solidarity around helping Haiti recover from its latest cycle of insecurity. The U.N. independent expert on the human rights situation in Haiti wrapped up a visit to the country on Friday and told a news conference that human rights violations are rampant. 'Sexual violence, used as a weapon by gangs to control the population, has drastically increased in recent months,' William O'Neill said. 'Gangs have increasingly trafficked children, forcibly recruited them into gangs, and often used them to carry out attacks against public institutions and police operations.' A multinational security support mission was approved nearly a year ago in the U.N. Security Council to assist Haitian National Police in subduing criminal gangs terrorizing the capital and other regions. After many delays, the first international police contingent from Kenya deployed in June. There are now about 500 police in total on the ground — 400 from mission leader Kenya and the rest from Jamaica and Belize. Diplomats say they expect other countries will also be deploying. Haitian Prime Minister Garry Conille and his Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, are co-chairing a side meeting on Monday that will look at both the urgent humanitarian situation and longer-term development issues. 'I think we are all beginning to understand how drastic the damage in Haiti is and how devastating the current attacks by the gangs has proven to be,' Canadian Ambassador Bob Rae told VOA. 'We are doing everything we can to mobilize international attention on what we can do to turn that around.' Hello and goodbye Several new leaders will make their debut at this year's gathering, including British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian. 'I'm going to be looking for any signal he is going to give about restarting the nuclear negotiation,' MEI's Slim said of the Iranian leader, noting that his administration has indicated an interest in restarting nuclear talks. This will be Biden's final time at the General Assembly podium. 'I think his appearance will create mixed emotions among other leaders,' said Crisis Group's Gowan. 'I think there is still some respect for his engagement with multilateralism, but there is also a lot of regret that he didn't give the U.N. a greater role in dealing with the war in Gaza.' Looking to the future Two years ago, Biden announced that the United States supported expanding the number of permanent members on the 15-nation Security Council. On September 12, his U.N. envoy, Linda Thomas-Greenfield, announced that the administration would support two permanent seats for Africa and one for Latin American and Caribbean countries, in addition to India, Japan and Germany — albeit, without veto power. She said Washington is ready to begin text-based negotiations on the expansion. 'It means we're ready to work with other countries to negotiate language, prepare amendments, and ready this resolution for a vote in the General Assembly and, ultimately, amend the U.N. Charter,' Thomas-Greenfield told an audience last week at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. Security Council reform, as it is known, has for decades been a topic of much discussion but no action. U.N. chief Guterres also would like to see the council change. On Sunday, he opens his signature two-day 'Summit of the Future,' in which institutional reform will be high on the agenda. 'And one of the questions that is important in relation to the future relates exactly to the role of the P5 [permanent five members] and to the need to have a certain redistribution of power to make things more fair and more effective,' Guterres told reporters. In the seventh year of his 10-year tenure, Guterres wants to see better multilateral cooperation to resolve current conflicts, fight climate change, and ease global hunger and debt. He is also worried about emerging challenges, including the power of artificial intelligence. He is hoping for a strong 'Pact for the Future' to be adopted by consensus on Sunday. The document, a policy blueprint to address global challenges and drastic reforms to the U.N. and global financial institutions, has been mired in difficult negotiations. Germany and Namibia have been facilitating the negotiations for months and their leaders will co-chair the summit. The president of the General Assembly, Philemon Yang, has now taken over negotiations to try to get it over the finish line. Diplomats said 19 countries, including Russia, raised objections on Thursday night to some language in the latest draft, including around human rights, climate action and fossil fuels. With less than 48 hours to go until the summit opens, discussions are getting down to the wire. 'We very much hope that member states will agree in the coming hours on a way forward for the Summit of the Future, and show ambition and show courage and do whatever they can to get these documents over the finish line,' Guterres' spokesperson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/war-set-to-dominate-agenda-at-un-general-assembly-meeting/7792704.html	2024-09-20T16:32:20-07:00	
Environmentalists, Taiwanese company clash over mining in Eswatini	MBABANE, ESWATINI — Residents and environmentalists in Eswatini have arrayed against Taiwan’s Michael Lee Enterprises in a battle over mining in the country’s picturesque Malolotja Nature Reserve. The company has been accused of exploiting the park for green chert, a rare mineral found in the area, putting the park’s wildlife and natural beauty at risk. Some locals and environmentalists are calling for an unbiased investigation to determine what damage, if any, is being caused by the green chert mining by Michael Lee Enterprises in the Malalotja reserve. Government spokesperson Alpheous Nxumalo has maintained that no violations by the mining company have been confirmed and has urged community members to report any potential breaches to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Energy. 'We have spoken to both the Ministry of Natural Resources and we have spoken to the company,' Nxumalo said. 'The directors themselves, they are disputing what the community members have supposedly told you in respect to this company and its activities. 'However, the Ministry of Natural Resources and Energy has committed that they do investigations from time to time to ensure companies continue with compliance in terms of protecting environment and in terms of complying with the laws governing the mining industry in the kingdom of Eswatini.' Taken to Maputo for export Green chert is used to make jewelry and religious statues and for other religious purposes. After the chert is mined, it is trucked to Matsapha, the southern African kingdom’s main industrial town, then taken by railroad to Maputo in Mozambique for export. In a statement to VOA, Michael Lee Enterprises said it was a 'complying company that abides by the environmental regulations authority' in Eswatini. The Makhonjwa Valley, a biodiversity hot spot within the Malolotja Nature Reserve, is a world-renowned ecological, archaeological and geological treasure trove. Decades of research have uncovered rare species of trees, cicadas, birds, amphibians and butterflies. It is also home to pristine waterways, forests and a wealth of untouched natural resources. Environmentalist Dane Armstrong warns that mining in Malolotja is putting the site at severe risk. 'The company in question, the Michael Lee Enterprises, is already extracting vast quantities of rock at the head of the valley and has plans to mine an additional 400 hectares,' Armstrong said. 'This is going to have irreversible damage to the ecological integrity' of the area. 'While economic growth and job creation is critical for Eswatini and mining definitely plays an important role in this, there has to be a balance between protecting the very limited, crucially important biodiversity hot spots in our country. Malolotja Nature Reserve is a globally recognized area of extreme importance and a protected area, and it should be treated as such.' Economic growth, jobs The president of a traditional healers group, Makhanya Makhanya, disagrees, and sees the potential for economic growth and job creation as a means to combat poverty in the country, provided that the opportunities are reserved for the people of the former Swaziland. 'As a traditional healer,' he said, 'I support the government’s decision to mine the hidden wealth beneath the Earth's surface if it can bring economic opportunities to the people of Swaziland. However, I caution against outsourcing these jobs to foreigners, and instead, local employment needs to be prioritized in order to truly reap the benefits of this resource.' The government is allowing the mining project to proceed until definitive evidence of environmental risk is uncovered. It is encouraging community-company dialogues for a fair resolution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/environmentalists-taiwanese-company-clash-over-mining-in-eswatini-/7792727.html	2024-09-20T15:27:18-07:00	
Probe finds 'complacency,' shortfalls contributed to Trump assassination attempt	washington — The U.S. Secret Service says the ability of a lone gunman to fire eight shots at Donald Trump during a campaign rally in rural western Pennsylvania was partially the result of multiple failures by the agents charged with protecting the former president. A report on the agency’s own investigation into the attempted assassination of the one-time U.S. leader and current Republican presidential candidate identified problems with communication and coordination ahead of the July 13 rally in Butler, as well as an over-reliance on state and local law enforcement partners. 'We cannot abdicate or defer our responsibilities to others,' acting Secret Service Director Ronald Rowe told reporters Friday in Washington. 'The Secret Service did not give clear guidance or direction to our local law enforcement partners,' he said. 'While some members of the advance team were very diligent, there was complacency on the part of others that led to a breach of security protocols.' The attempted assassination shook much of the U.S., and it prompted the then-director of the Secret Service to resign. Law enforcement officials have said it was carried out by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks, who acted alone and saw Trump as a target of opportunity. Despite the presence of Trump’s protective detail, advance teams and local law enforcement, Crooks was able to climb to the top of a building overlooking the rally and set up with an AR-style rifle before being detected. The shots wounded Trump and two rally goers, while killing a third. The Secret Service report released Friday focuses on what the agency is describing as 'communication deficiencies' at the rally, blaming agents for failing to make sure the site and surrounding areas — including the roof of the nearby building — were properly secured. Rowe said that while there were discussions with local law enforcement about the building in particular, there were no subsequent conversations to make sure adequate protection was in place. 'We should have been more direct,' he said. 'There was an assumption that they had it covered, but there clearly was not that follow-up to make sure.' Other problems included a failure by the Secret Service to make sure local law enforcement knew how to communicate with agents on the ground, which prevented Trump’s protective detail from learning about the search for a suspicious person. Had the detail been aware, a decision could have been made to relocate the former president to a safer location. Rowe told reporters that Secret Service personnel responsible for the deficiencies will be held accountable, but he denied reports that some had been asked to resign. 'This agency has among the most robust table of penalties in the entirety of the federal government, and these penalties will be administered according to our disciplinary process,' he said. The release of the Secret Service report comes less than a week after what officials have described as a second apparent assassination attempt against former President Trump. Sheriff’s deputies in Florida arrested 58-year-old Ryan Wesley Routh, stopping him on a major highway Sunday, about an hour after he fled from the Trump International Golf Club in West Palm Beach. Officials said data gathered from Routh’s cellphone showed he lay in wait for 12 hours, hiding in some bushes along a chain-link perimeter fence between the course’s fifth and seventh holes with an AK-47-style rifle. Routh fled without firing a shot after a member of the Secret Service advance team spotted his rifle sticking out from behind the bushes and fired several shots. The agent’s reaction 'is exactly how we trained and exactly what we want our personnel to do,' Rowe said Friday. 'He identified a threat, an individual with a long gun, and he made swift decisions and took a swift action to be able to mitigate that.' Rowe also said that since the July 13 assassination attempt against Trump, the Secret Service has been providing Trump and Democratic presidential candidate Vice President Kamala Harris with the same level of protection as President Joe Biden. He also said that since Trump left office, his security detail has been 'more robust than prior former presidents.' But the acting Secret Service director said the increased levels of security are coming at a cost, asking U.S. lawmakers for more funding and personnel. 'We have finite resources,' Rowe told reporters. 'We are burning through a lot of assets and resources. 'We are stretching those resources to their maximum right now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/probe-finds-complacency-shortfalls-contributed-to-trump-assassination-attempt-/7792717.html	2024-09-20T15:04:28-07:00	
UN report: Debt crisis undermines AIDS eradication in Africa	Harare, Zimbabwe — A new report released by the main United Nations agency for action on AIDS and HIV says growing public debt is choking sub-Saharan African countries, leaving them with little fiscal room to finance critical HIV services. In the report, launched ahead of the 79th session of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, Winnie Byanyima, the executive director of UNAIDS, asks the international community for more funding to ensure Africa eliminates AIDS by 2030. She said Africa, which accounts for the largest number of people living with HIV — some 26 million out of 40 million globally — is overwhelmed by public debt. Robert Shivambu, UNAIDS communication officer, told VOA: 'The region's success in having reduced new HIV infections by 56% since 2010 will not be sustained if fiscal space is constrained.' Shivambu said the U.N. believes that when debt payments hinder countries' ability to effectively look after health care needs of their people, global health security is put at risk. Zimbabwe is one of the countries fighting to reduce the rate of HIV infection while dealing with high debt. On Friday, parliament Speaker Jacob Mudenda told colleagues that the country had made strides in fighting HIV/AIDS, starting in 1999 as a pioneer of the AIDS levy — a 3% income tax for individuals and 3% tax on profits of employers. He said that the budget of $387 million for HIV programs — largely foreign sponsored — was no longer enough and that there was need to expand the tax base. 'Let’s create wealth, when that wealth is created from our wealth, including mineral resources, we are going to be able to expand the tax base,' he said. 'From that expanded tax base we will be able as parliament to come with a very stout budget. These donations are going to dwindle, slowly but surely. This current funding level still falls far short of the estimated $500 million needed annually to achieve [the] ambitious goal of the Zimbabwe national AIDS strategic plan, especially with over 1 million people living with HIV now on anti-retroviral therapy.' Mudenda declined to say if servicing Zimbabwe’s debt — which stands at $17.5 billion, according to the African Development Bank — was one reason funding for HIV programs is falling short. Zimbabwe is battling to service its debt so that it can resume receiving loans from multilateral development banks such as the IMF and World Bank. Shivambu said, 'Public debt needs to be urgently reduced and domestic resource mobilization strengthened to enable the fiscal space to fully fund the HIV response and end AIDS. World leaders cannot let a resource crunch derail global progress to end AIDS as a public health threat by 2030.' That’s the message UNAIDS officials will take to the high-level summit of the U.N. General Assembly beginning next week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-report-debt-crisis-undermines-aids-eradication-in-africa/7792661.html	2024-09-20T14:02:28-07:00	
Fresh clashes reported between US-backed forces, government troops in eastern Syria	Washington — New clashes erupted Friday between U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces and Iran-backed Syrian government forces in the eastern province of Deir el-Zour, a war monitor and local sources reported. The fighting began when Syrian government forces and their allied militias launched mortar attacks against positions belonging to the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, in the restive province, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. A resident in the area told VOA that SDF fighters responded by firing at the source of the attacks, using mortars and light weapons. The resident, who requested anonymity for security reasons, said several SDF fighters sustained light wounds in the clashes, but the Syrian Observatory said there were no confirmed reports of casualties on either side. Control of Deir el-Zour is divided between the two sides, with the SDF ruling the eastern side of the Euphrates River, while the western side is controlled by Syrian government forces and Iranian-backed militias. Iran has been a staunch sponsor of Syrian government forces since the beginning of the country’s conflict in 2011. Deir el-Zour province was a major stronghold for the Islamic State terror group until 2019, when SDF troops, aided by a U.S.-led global coalition, ended IS’s so-called caliphate in eastern Syria. In recent weeks, there has been an increase in confrontations between the two sides. In August, a Syrian government paramilitary group called the National Defense Forces carried out an attack on SDF-controlled parts of Deir el-Zour, killing several civilians, according to local news reports. In response, the SDF launched a major attack, killing at least 20 government troops. The SDF is a Kurdish-led military alliance that has been a major U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State terror group. As part of their continued efforts to combat IS remnants, the U.S. has about 900 troops in northeast Syria, including in Deir el-Zour. Hoshang Hasan, a reporter at the local North Press agency who closely covers events in eastern Syria, said Syrian government forces and allied Iranian militias have made clear that their goal is to destabilize the situation in Deir el-Zour. 'They are determined to keep this region unstable, and to do that they have been attempting continuously to push out the U.S. forces in the area,' he told VOA. Since the beginning of the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza in October 2023, bases housing U.S. and coalition forces in eastern Syria have been targeted by Iranian-backed militias dozens of times. Jonathan Spyer, director of research at the Philadelphia-based Middle East Forum, said there was a need for increased U.S. military support to the SDF to maintain the status quo in the region. 'The goal of the Iran-supported militias in maintaining pressure on the U.S. and its allies is clearly to precipitate a U.S. withdrawal,' he told VOA, adding that 'such a withdrawal would remove a major barrier to Iranian control and smuggling and movement of forces from Iraq into Syria and Lebanon in the event of an all-out war against Israel.' 'The current uptick in pressure [in eastern Syria] can't be separated from the more general partial mobilization of Iran-supported forces in the region in the context of the Gaza war,' he underscored. This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fresh-clashes-reported-between-us-backed-forces-government-troops-in-eastern-syria/7792540.html	2024-09-20T12:33:32-07:00	
Mpox spreads at alarming rate among children in Burundi	GENEVA — The United Nations Children’s Fund, or UNICEF, warned Friday that children in Burundi are bearing the brunt of the mpox outbreak, with cases of this deadly, infectious disease spreading at an alarming rate among a young population. 'Of the nearly 600 reported cases, two-thirds are in children under 19. The situation has escalated rapidly, with a more-than-40% increase in cases over the past three weeks,' Dr. Paul Ngwakum, UNICEF’s regional health adviser for Eastern and Southern Africa, told journalists in Geneva via video link Friday. Ngwakum, who currently is on a visit to Burundi, said, 'The fear expressed by the parents and the resilience of communities in the face of this public health crisis' and the rapid escalation of the disease 'were striking.' Speaking from the capital, Bujumbura, he said the rise of mpox among children under the age of 5 is of particular concern as they represent 30% of the reported cases. This, he said, underscores the urgent need for targeted interventions to protect children from becoming infected as schools have reopened this week. 'UNICEF is supporting the Ministry of Education to implement health measures in schools, train staff to recognize early symptoms of mpox and reinforce hand hygiene. We aim to ensure that all children can safely return to school and minimize educational disruptions,' he said, noting that this was 'a rapidly evolving situation.' Even amid the grim situation, he observed that Burundi has had no deaths from mpox, formerly known as monkeypox. He said this provides 'an opportunity to end this outbreak in a very short time period.' 'The geographical area is still limited, and with concerted effort from all partners, we can limit the spread, contain the virus, and potentially end the outbreak with no lives lost,' said Ngwakum. He added that 'it was difficult to make firm statements regarding when the outbreak could be brought under control,' both in Burundi and the wider African region, a sentiment echoed by the World Health Organization. WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris told journalists, 'The response to the outbreak is made more difficult by the context, with insecurity in the affected areas, and concurrent outbreaks of other diseases including measles and chickenpox. WHO is on the ground, working to stop these outbreaks.' So far this year, the WHO reports there have been more than 25,000 suspected mpox cases and 723 deaths among suspected cases in Africa. The most heavily infected country is the Democratic Republic of Congo, with 21,835 suspected cases and 717 deaths, followed by Burundi with 1,489 suspected cases and no deaths and Nigeria with 935 suspected cases and no deaths. 'Vaccination is going to be a very useful tool, particularly for trying to break the chains of transmission,' Harris said. 'But the virus primarily spreads through close personal contact within families. And when people are living in difficult conditions, if they do not have access to the materials, to the soap, to the clean bedding, to the clean clothing, it is very, very difficult for them to not transmit. 'Many of the children who we have seen who have sadly died in the Democratic Republic of the Congo were severely malnourished, had suffered the effects of conflict, and perhaps also had other diseases at the same time. … It may indeed be that this population cannot respond immunologically to yet another threat,' she warned. While affirming the importance of vaccines in the fight against mpox, UNICEF representative Ngwakum observed that 'unfortunately,' the vaccines that are available now 'cannot be used for children.' 'I do not want to bank all our interventions on vaccines,' he said. 'Vaccines are only one tool that can be used to protect children and communities against mpox. And we are, in addition to vaccines, deploying other different tools' to keep children safe, he said. UNICEF says it is possible to halt the rapid spread of mpox if agencies act swiftly and have the means in which to do it. The U.N. children’s agency is urgently appealing for $58.8 million to scale up its humanitarian response across six African countries, including Burundi. 'These funds are essential to stop the transmission of mpox, protect children and maintain critical services like education and health care,' said Ngwakum.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mpox-spreads-at-alarming-rate-among-children-in-burundi/7792425.html	2024-09-20T11:03:37-07:00

Exit ban for Taiwanese executive reminder of risks of traveling, doing business in China	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan authorities' confirmation that a senior executive from a major Taiwanese industrial group has been banned from leaving China is raising concerns about the risks of traveling and doing business there, analysts say. The case comes amid heightened tensions between Beijing and Taipei and as a number of foreigners have been refused permission to leave China. Taiwan’s Mainland Affairs Council, or MAC, which is in charge of relations with China, confirmed Wednesday that an unidentified senior executive from Formosa Plastics Group was interrogated by local authorities after landing in the Chinese commercial capital Shanghai from Taipei on September 1. The MAC initially declined to share any details due to personal safety reasons. But late Thursday, the council said the exit ban imposed on the Taiwanese executive is likely the result of a criminal offense rather than a political or national security case. On Thursday, the Formosa Plastic Group said they were trying to gather more information about the case and that the senior executive is 'safe, free to move around, and cooperating with the Chinese authorities’ investigation.' 'We will continue to follow his case and provide the necessary assistance,' the company said in a statement. Political pressure Analysts say that while details are still forthcoming, the case does seem similar to other instances where Beijing has used political means to pressure Taiwanese or foreign businesses. 'This case reminds me of the Chinese government’s tax probe into Taiwanese tech giant Foxconn last October, which coincided with the company’s founder Terry Gou’s bid to run in Taiwan’s presidential election,' said Chen Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan. At the time, Taiwan’s former national security chief Wellington Koo said there was a 'political aspect' in Beijing’s tax probe against Foxconn. Gou eventually dropped out of the presidential election last November. Chen told VOA that it remains unclear what the Chinese government might be seeking in this case since no more details have been provided by authorities on either side. 'However, it’s clear that other Taiwanese or foreign companies have faced similar situations before,' he said. Other experts say the case could have a chilling effect within Taiwan’s business community and exacerbate Taiwanese businesses’ exodus from China. 'While some Taiwanese businesses have started to reduce the scale of their operations in China several years ago, this case will push more companies to exit the Chinese market as a way to protect their interests,' Wang Kuo-chen, an economist at the Chung-Hua Institute for Economic Research, told VOA by phone. ‘Taiwan independence forces’ crackdown Meanwhile, a 22-year-old Taiwanese man surnamed Kuo went missing in China after arriving in Shanghai on August 27, prompting his family to seek help from the Taiwanese government. During Thursday’s regular briefing, the Mainland Affairs Council’s spokesperson Liang Wen-chieh said Kuo had been traveling in China with friends. Taiwan’s Straits Exchange Foundation has also contacted its Chinese counterparts to seek more information about Kuo’s whereabouts. On September 6, China’s Taiwan Affairs Office, which manages cross-strait exchanges, said a court in China’s eastern city of Wenzhou had sentenced Taiwanese political activist Yang Chih-yuan to nine years in jail under secession charges. In June, Beijing introduced 22 new guidelines to punish what they called 'die-hard Taiwan independence activists' and the maximum punishment is the death sentence. Wu Se-chih, an assistant professor at the Taipei University of Marine Technology, told VOA that these developments reflect Beijing’s enhanced focus on national security and that the strict measures are likely to have a ripple effect. 'The more stringent inspection of the content on Taiwanese people’s electronic devices at Chinese airports, the sentencing of Yang under secession charges, and the disappearance of Kuo will cause more Taiwanese people to re-evaluate the potential risks they might face when traveling to China,' Wu told VOA in a telephone interview. Asked about the recent developments, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said, 'China is a country ruled by law and liberty is respected and protected in the country.' Exit bans In addition to Taiwanese people, foreign nationals from other countries have also faced difficulty leaving China. According to the Duihua Foundation in California, which focuses on freeing detainees through dialogue with China, around 200 Americans are held under coercive measures in the country, and more than 30 Americans are banned from leaving the country. At least 17 Japanese citizens have been detained on spying charges since China enacted its anti-espionage law in 2015 and at least five of them remain in Chinese detention as of November 2023. John Kamm, the executive director of the Duihua Foundation, told VOA that Beijing has intensified the use of coercive measures against foreign nationals since Chinese President Xi Jinping came to power in 2012. In his view, the growing number of foreigners detained under espionage charges has led to a drop in the number of tourists and foreigners traveling to China. 'China’s use of coercive measures and the imposition of exit bans on foreign nationals has damaged China’s image and that feeds into the drop in foreign direct investment and the drop in tourist arrivals in the country,' Kamm said in a phone interview. Despite Beijing’s efforts to attract more foreign investment, Wu in Taiwan said it’s unlikely that the Chinese government will ease up its efforts to safeguard national security, which he said remains a priority for the Chinese Communist Party. 'Beijing still prioritizes politics over economy, so at a time when their economic policies haven’t proved to be effective, I expect the Chinese government to keep doubling down on the importance of safeguarding national security,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exit-ban-for-taiwanese-executive-reminder-of-risks-of-traveling-doing-business-in-china-/7792181.html	2024-09-20T09:18:53-07:00	
Taliban face backlash for 'disrespecting' host nations' anthems	Islamabad — Pakistan and Iran have sharply criticized diplomats from the de facto Taliban government in neighboring Afghanistan for showing 'disrespect' to their national anthems in breach of diplomatic norms. The controversy arose earlier this week after the Taliban consul general, Mohibullah Shakir, and his colleague remained seated during the playing of the Pakistani national anthem at an official ceremony in the northwestern city of Peshawar. The move triggered public outrage in Pakistan and demands for Shakir's expulsion. Islamabad swiftly protested and officially complained to de facto Afghan authorities in Kabul, denouncing their diplomat’s 'disrespect' for the Pakistani national anthem as a 'reprehensible' act and a breach of 'diplomatic norms.' Shakir’s mission office in Peshawar defended his stance and dismissed allegations of disrespect for the anthem. It said the diplomat remained seated because the anthem had music, which the Taliban consider forbidden in line with their strict interpretation of Islam. 'Imagine a religious scholar standing up for music,' a consulate spokesperson was quoted as saying. Since regaining control of Afghanistan in 2021, the radical Taliban leaders have enforced their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia. This enforcement includes banning music, prohibiting girls' education beyond the sixth grade, and barring Afghan women from most workplaces, among other restrictions. However, the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesperson rejected the Taliban’s explanation on Thursday. At a news conference in Islamabad, Mumtaz Baloch stated that Shakir’s action 'hurt the sentiments of the people of Pakistan.' She cautioned that her government reserves the right to take further action in line with international diplomatic norms and practices. 'We expect any individual who enjoys a diplomatic status in Pakistan to respect those norms,' Baloch said. 'We have raised this with the Afghan authorities and conveyed our strong displeasure … and we also reject the explanation that the acting Council General has given for his actions.' Taliban’s conflicting stance Meanwhile, Iran also has criticized the head of a Taliban delegation, Azizurrahman Mansour, a deputy minister, for not standing during the host country’s anthem at an International Islamic Unity Conference on Thursday in Tehran, where the Iranian president was in attendance. The Foreign Ministry later summoned Taliban Acting Ambassador Fazal Mohammad Haqqani to seek clarification regarding Mansour disrespecting the national anthem. Iranian media quoted Haqqani as reaffirming his country’s respect for Iran, claiming that Mansour’s action was 'personal' and not reflective of the Afghan government’s official stance. Mansour later stated in a formal video message that he remained seated during the Iranian national anthem in line with traditions in Afghanistan. 'In our country, we sit when the song is played, and I have acted according to this custom. We apologize to the people who were upset.' The Taliban's explanation, though, failed to ease the outrage in Iran. 'Disrespecting diplomatic norms under the pretext of Sharia-based prohibition of music doesn’t make any sense,' Hassan Kazemi Qomi, Iran’s special envoy for Afghanistan, said on social media platform X, formerly known as Twitter. He wrote in the local language that listening to music should also be prohibited if music is banned. Mohammad Ali Abtahi, a prominent Iranian 'reformist and senior aide to former President Mohammad Khatami,' also joined the Iranian political denunciation of the Taliban. The London-based Iran International Persian-language television channel published a translation of Abtahi’s local language X post. 'The Taliban's disrespect toward the national anthems of Pakistan and Iran, and their refusal to stand, has ideological roots.' Abtahi further warned, 'When we say that the Taliban's ideology is more dangerous than the thousands of weapons they have, this is what we mean.' Abtahi criticized the conference organizers for inviting the Taliban and stated that 'the majority of Muslims everywhere, including in Iran, do not seek unity with the Taliban.' Iran is a majority Shi’ite Muslim country, and the Taliban represents the majority Sunni Muslim community in Afghanistan. No country has officially recognized the Taliban as the legitimate government in Kabul, mainly because of their restrictions on women’s access to education and public life at large. On Thursday, Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi said that his government controlled about 40 Afghan embassies and consulates worldwide, and that its diplomatic relations with the international community were improving. Many Western governments, including the United States, insist that formal recognition of the Taliban depends on their actions regarding women's rights, education for girls and women, and freedom of movement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-face-backlash-for-disrespecting-host-nations-anthems/7792106.html	2024-09-20T08:51:41-07:00	
Kentucky sheriff charged in killing of judge at courthouse	FRANKFORT, Ky. — A judge in a rural Kentucky county was fatally shot in his courthouse chambers Thursday, and the local sheriff was charged with murder in the killing, police said. The preliminary investigation indicates Letcher County Sheriff Shawn M. Stines shot District Judge Kevin Mullins multiple times following an argument inside the courthouse, according to Kentucky State Police. Mullins, who held the judgeship for 15 years, died at the scene, and Stines surrendered without incident. The fatal shooting in Whitesburg sent shock waves through a tight-knit Appalachian town and county seat of government with about 1,700 residents located about 235 kilometers southeast of Lexington. Lead county prosecutor Matt Butler described an outpouring of sympathy as he recused himself and his office from investigations in the shooting, citing social and family ties to Mullins. 'We all know each other here. ... Anyone from Letcher County would tell you that Judge Mullins and I married sisters and that we have children who are first cousins but act like siblings,' Butler said in statement from his office. 'For that reason, among others, I have already taken steps to recuse myself and my entire office.' Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman said his office will collaborate with a commonwealth’s attorney in the region as special prosecutors in the criminal case. 'We will fully investigate and pursue justice,' Coleman said on social media. Kentucky Supreme Court Chief Justice Laurance B. VanMeter said he was 'shocked by this act of violence' and that the court system was 'shaken by this news.' Letcher County's judge-executive signed an order closing on Friday the county courthouse where the shooting took place. Mullins, 54, was hit multiple times in the shooting, Kentucky State Police said. Stines, 43, was charged with one count of first-degree murder. The investigation is continuing, police said. It was unclear whether Stines had an attorney. Kentucky State Police referred inquiries about Stines’ legal representation Thursday to a spokesperson who did not immediately respond by email. Responding to the shooting, Governor Andy Beshear said in a social media post: 'There is far too much violence in this world, and I pray there is a path to a better tomorrow.' Mullins served as a district judge in Letcher County since he was appointed by former Gov. Steve Beshear in 2009 and elected the following year. Mullins was known for promoting substance abuse treatment for people involved in the justice system and helped hundreds of residents enter inpatient residential treatment, according to a program for a drug summit he spoke at in 2022. He also helped develop a program called Addiction Recovery Care to offer peer support services in the courthouse. The program was adopted in at least 50 counties in Kentucky. Mullins also served as a founding member of the Responsive Effort to Support Treatment in Opioid Recovery Efforts Leadership Team. After the shooting, several area schools were briefly placed on lockdown.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kentucky-sheriff-charged-in-killing-of-judge-at-courthouse-/7791922.html	2024-09-20T07:39:13-07:00	
Governor nominee vows to keep running after report on racial, sexual comments	RALEIGH, NORTH CAROLINA — North Carolina Republican gubernatorial nominee Mark Robinson vowed on Thursday to remain in the race despite a CNN report that he posted strongly worded racial and sexual comments on an online message board, saying he won't be forced out by 'salacious tabloid lies.' Robinson, the sitting lieutenant governor who decisively won his GOP gubernatorial primary in March, has been trailing in several recent polls to Democratic nominee Josh Stein, the current attorney general. 'We are staying in this race. We are in it to win it,' Robinson said in a video posted Thursday on the social media platform X. 'And we know that with your help, we will.' Robinson referenced in the video a story that he said CNN was running, but he didn't give details. 'Let me reassure you, the things that you will see in that story — those are not the words of Mark Robinson,' he said. 'You know my words. You know my character.' The CNN report describes a series of racial and sexual comments Robinson posted on the message board of a pornography website more than a decade ago. CNN reported that Robinson, who would be North Carolina's first Black governor, attacked civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. in searing terms and once referred to himself as a 'black NAZI.' CNN also reported that Robinson wrote of being aroused by a memory of 'peeping' at women in gym showers when he was 14 along with an appreciation of transgender pornography. Robinson at one point referred to himself as a 'perv,' according to CNN. The Associated Press has not independently confirmed that Robinson wrote and posted the messages. CNN said it matched details of the account on the pornographic website forum to other online accounts held by Robinson by comparing usernames, a known email address and his full name. CNN reported that details discussed by the account holder matched Robinson's age, length of marriage and other biographical information. It also compared figures of speech that came up frequently in his public Twitter profile that appeared in discussions by the account on the pornographic website. Media outlets already have reported about a 2021 speech by Robinson in a church in which he used the word 'filth' when discussing gay and transgender people. Robinson has a history of inflammatory comments that Stein has said made him too extreme to lead North Carolina, a state on the U.S. Atlantic coast. They already have contributed to the prospect that campaign struggles for Robinson would hurt former President Donald Trump’s bid to win the battleground state's 16 electoral votes, and potential other GOP down-ballot candidates. Recent polls of North Carolina voters show Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris locked in a close race. The same polls show Stein with a roughly 10-point lead over Robinson. Stein and his allies have repeatedly cited a Facebook post from 2019 in which Robinson said abortion in America was about 'killing the child because you weren't responsible enough to keep your skirt down.' The Stein campaign said in a statement after the report that 'North Carolinians already know Mark Robinson is completely unfit to be Governor.' State law says a gubernatorial nominee could withdraw as a candidate no later than the day before the first absentee ballots requested by military and overseas voters are distributed. That begins Friday, so the withdrawal deadline would be late Thursday. State Republican leaders could then pick a replacement. Trump has frequently voiced his support for Robinson, who has been considered a rising star in his party, well-known for his fiery speeches and evocative rhetoric. Ahead of the March primary, Trump at a rally in Greensboro called Robinson 'Martin Luther King on steroids' for his speaking ability. Trump's campaign appears to be distancing itself from Robinson in the wake of the report. In a statement to the AP, Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said the GOP nominee's campaign 'is focused on winning the White House and saving this country,' calling North Carolina 'a vital part of that plan.' Leavitt went on to contrast Trump's economic record with that of Harris, not mentioning Robinson by name or answering questions as to whether he would appear with Trump at a Saturday campaign rally in Wilmington or had been invited to do so. A spokesperson for Harris' campaign, Ammar Moussa, said on social media platform X that 'Donald Trump has a Mark Robinson problem' and reposted a photo of the two together. The North Carolina Republican Party defended Robinson in a statement on X, saying that despite his denial of CNN's report, it wouldn't 'stop the Left from trying to demonize him via personal attacks.' The party referred to economic and immigration policies as the predominant election issues North Carolinians will care more about instead. 'The Left needs this election to be a personality contest, not a policy contest because if voters focused on policy, Republicans win on Election Day,' the party said. Scott Lassiter, a Republican state Senate candidate in a Raleigh-area swing district, did call on Robinson to 'suspend his campaign to allow a quality candidate to finish this race.' Ed Broyhill, a North Carolina member of the Republican National Committee, said he spoke to Robinson Thursday afternoon and still supports him as the nominee. In an interview, Broyhill suggested the online details may have been fabricated. 'It seems like a dirty trick to me,' Broyhill said. On Capitol Hill, U.S. Representative Richard Hudson of North Carolina, chair of the House GOP's campaign committee, told reporters the report's findings were 'concerning.' Robinson, he said, has some reassuring to do in the state. Robinson, 56, was elected lieutenant governor in his first bid for public office in 2020. He tells a life story of childhood poverty, jobs that he blames the North American Free Trade Agreement for ending, and personal bankruptcy. His four-minute speech to the Greensboro City Council defending gun rights and lamenting the 'demonizing' of police officers went viral — and led him to a National Rifle Association board position and popularity among conservative voters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/governor-nominee-vows-to-keep-running-after-report-on-racial-sexual-comments/7791926.html	2024-09-20T06:56:25-07:00

Zelenskyy says Ukraine 'victory plan' depends on quick decisions by allies	KYIV — Ukraine's 'victory plan' in the war against Russia depends on quick decisions being taken by allies this year, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on Friday during a visit by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Zelenskyy told a joint press conference with von der Leyen that Ukraine planned to use a proposed multi-billion dollar European Union loan for air defense, energy and domestic weapons purchases. Zelenskyy singled out the importance of U.S. President Joe Biden to the victory plan, which he said the two leaders will discuss when they meet. The Ukrainian leader is travelling to the United States next week. 'Most of the decisions from the plan depend specifically on him [Biden]. On other allies too, but there are certain points which depend on the goodwill and support of the United States,' Zelenskyy said. Zelenskyy has provided regular updates on the plan's preparation but has given few clues to the contents, indicating only that it aims to create terms acceptable to Ukraine after more than 2-1/2 years of war following Russia's full-scale invasion. 'The entire plan is predicated upon quick decisions from our partners. The plan is predicated upon decisions which should take place from October to December, and not delaying these processes,' he told the press conference alongside von der Leyen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskiy-says-ukraine-victory-plan-depends-on-quick-decisions-by-allies/7791768.html	2024-09-20T04:48:24-07:00	
Morocco arrests 152 people for allegedly inciting illegal migration to Ceuta	RABAT — Morocco has arrested 152 people, who will now face trial on accusations they used social media to incite an attempt at mass illegal migration into the adjacent Spanish enclave of Ceuta, a government spokesperson said. In recent days, thousands of mostly young Moroccan men rushed to the northern city of Fnideq, bordering Ceuta, to attempt a crossing. Their efforts were thwarted by the heaviest security deployment ever seen the city, according to human rights activists there. 'All attempts have been foiled,' spokesman Mustapha Baitas said at a news conference late on Thursday. 'Some 3000 people attempted illegal migration,' he said, in a first official comment days after the crossing attempt. Spain's two enclaves on Morocco's Mediterranean coast, Ceuta and Melilla, share the only land borders between the European Union and Africa. They sporadically experience waves of attempted crossings by migrants trying to reach Europe. Morocco and Spain have strengthened their cooperation in addressing illegal migration since Madrid backed a Moroccan autonomy plan for disputed Western Sahara in 2022. Videos shared by local media showed young people throwing stones at security forces as they were prevented from getting near the Ceuta border. 'No deaths have been reported,' Baitas said, adding authorities acted in respect for the law. In the first eight months this year, Morocco stopped 45,015 people from illegally migrating to Europe, according to interior ministry figures. Last month, hundreds of migrants took advantage of a thick mist to swim to Ceuta, Spanish police said. Tighter surveillance of Morocco's northern borders has prompted an increasing number of migrants to try the riskier and longer Atlantic route to the Canary Islands.	https://www.voanews.com/a/morocco-arrests-152-people-for-allegedly-inciting-illegal-migration-to-ceuta-/7791752.html	2024-09-20T04:25:40-07:00	
German minister: VW must solve most of its problems alone	Frankfurt, Germany — Germany wants to support Volkswagen and help it avoid factory closures but the ailing car giant will have to fix most of its problems itself, Economy Minister Robert Habeck said Friday. Volkswagen said earlier this month it needed significant restructuring to stay competitive, and was considering shutting sites in Germany for the first time in its 87-year history. The announcement stunned employees and added to concerns about Germany's flagship car industry as it grapples with high costs, increased competition from China and weak demand for electric vehicles (EVs). 'The majority of the tasks will have to be solved by Volkswagen itself,' Habeck said during a visit to a VW plant in Emden in northwestern Germany. He refused to comment on media reports that thousands of jobs could be threatened at Volkswagen, saying he 'cannot interfere' in company policy. But politicians could help the car sector by looking at ways to send the right 'market signals', Habeck said, stopping short of mentioning any possible state aid for Volkswagen. He pointed in particular to efforts to boost demand for EVs, insisting that electric driving 'is the future.' Sales of battery cars have plummeted in Germany this year after the government phased out subsidies, dealing a blow to carmakers who have invested heavily in the transition away from fossil fuels. Berlin recently laid out plans for new tax breaks for electric company cars to help turn the tide, Habeck noted. The minister will on Monday host a high-level meeting with representatives from the car industry and unions to discuss the sector's woes. Underlining the current challenges for carmakers, Mercedes-Benz on Thursday lowered its outlook for 2024 on the back of weak sales in the key Chinese market. German rival BMW likewise trimmed its profit guidance earlier this month, also citing muted demand in China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-minister-vw-must-solve-most-of-its-problems-alone-/7791740.html	2024-09-20T04:03:41-07:00	
Taiwan retains death penalty but limits use to 'exceptional' cases	Taipei, Taiwan — A Taiwan court decided on Friday to retain capital punishment, but ruled its application should be 'limited to special and exceptional circumstances.' Democratic Taiwan has carried out 35 executions since a moratorium on capital punishment was lifted in 2010, with the latest — that of a 53-year-old man convicted for setting a fire that killed his family — occurring in April 2020. Campaigners against the death penalty have long argued that the practice, carried out by shooting an inmate in the heart from behind as they lie face-down on the ground, is an inhumane method of punishment. The debate was brought to Taiwan's Constitutional Court, which ruled Friday that it would retain the death penalty. 'However, the death penalty is a capital punishment after all, and its scope of application should still be limited to special and exceptional circumstances,' said chief justice Hsu Tzong-li during a lengthy readout of the court's decision. In a statement, the court said that while the right to life will be protected under Taiwan's constitution, 'such protection is not absolute.' 'The TCC emphasized that because death penalty was the most severe punishment and irreversible in nature, its application and procedural safeguard [from investigation to execution] should be reviewed under strict scrutiny,' it said in reference to the crime of murder. However, 'the judgement did not address the constitutionality of death penalty in general or imposed on other offences,' such as treason or drug-related offences. The court also ruled that imposing the death sentence be 'prohibited' for 'defendants with mental conditions, even if their mental conditions did not influence their offense in the cases in question.' Additionally, death row inmates 'should not be executed if they had mental conditions to the extent that have impeded their competency for execution,' it said. The court case had been brought by the 37 inmates currently on death row in Taiwan. There are about 50 provisions in Taiwan's criminal laws that stipulate capital punishment to be the maximum sentence, and executions are carried out without notice once all appeals have been exhausted. In 2020, the Cabinet passed new procedures in its execution of death row inmates, allowing the condemned to hold final religious rites as well as leave a farewell voice or video message for their families. Capital punishment remains popular in Taiwan, with a recent survey by the Chinese Association for Human Rights showing that 80 percent were in favor of keeping it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-retains-death-penalty-but-limits-use-to-exceptional-cases/7791716.html	2024-09-20T03:41:48-07:00	
Militants kill at least 6 Pakistan soldiers near Afghan border	Islamabad — Militant attacks against Pakistani security outposts in a northwestern border region Friday reportedly resulted in the deaths of at least six soldiers and injuries to 14 others, while seven assailants were killed in return fire. The predawn clashes occurred in separate parts of the militancy-hit South Waziristan district near the border with Afghanistan. The wounded include at least four soldiers who were described as 'seriously injured.' Multiple local security officials confirmed the casualties to VOA on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak to the media. VOA contacted the Pakistani military’s media wing for comments on the reported attacks but did not receive an immediate response. Militants affiliated with the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, are reported to have claimed responsibility for the deadly violence. The TTP routinely carries out and claims credit for staging attacks on security forces and government installations in South Waziristan and surrounding districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, which borders Afghanistan. Officials have reported the deaths of hundreds of soldiers, police personnel, and civilians in the TTP-led violence in the province and elsewhere in Pakistan this year alone. The latest report from the provincial counterterrorism department documented the deaths of at least 100 police personnel and an equal number of civilians in the first nine months of 2024, with hundreds more sustaining injuries. The Pakistani government maintains the TTP, designated as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations, is orchestrating attacks from its Afghan sanctuaries with the help of the neighboring country’s radical Taliban leaders. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch reiterated Islamabad’s concerns at her weekly news conference on Thursday. 'We have shared concrete evidence of the involvement of these entities in terror attacks in Pakistan, and we expect the Afghan authorities to take action against those individuals who are responsible for these terror attacks,' Baloch said. 'The Afghan authorities are fully aware of who these individuals are. They know the location of these individuals and entities inside Afghanistan. It is, therefore, their responsibility to ensure that their territory is not used to foment terrorism against Pakistan,' she added. The Taliban government, which is not officially recognized by any country, denies allegations that the TTP or any other foreign groups operate or are being allowed to threaten neighboring countries from Afghan soil. However, recent U.N. security assessments have contradicted Taliban claims, describing the TTP as 'the largest terrorist group' in Afghanistan, with a force of around 6,000 members being trained and equipped at al-Qaida-run camps in the country. The increase in TTP cross-border attacks since the Taliban regained power in Kabul three years ago has strained relations between the two countries. The tensions have resulted in a significant decline in bilateral and transit trade between Pakistan and landlocked Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militants-kill-at-least-6-pakistan-soldiers-near-afghan-border-/7791700.html	2024-09-20T03:28:18-07:00	
Torrential rains sweep through West and Central Africa	ABUJA, Nigeria — Houses swept away to the very last brick. Inmates frantically fleeing the city's main prison as its walls got washed away by water rising from an overflowing dam. Corpses of crocodiles and snakes floating among human bodies on what used to be main streets. As torrential rains across Central and West Africa have unleashed the most catastrophic floods in decades, residents of Maiduguri, the capital of the fragile Nigerian state of Borno — which has been at the center of an Islamic extremists' insurgency — said they have seen it all. The floods, which have killed more than 1,000 people and displaced hundreds of thousands across the region this year, have worsened existing humanitarian crises in the countries which have been impacted the most: Chad, Nigeria, Mali and Niger. Over four million people have been affected by flooding so far this year in West Africa, a threefold increase from last year, according to the U.N. With rescue operations still under way, it is impossible to get an accurate count of lives lost in the water. So far, at least 230 were reported dead in Nigeria, 265 in Niger, 487 in Chad and 55 in Mali, which has seen the most catastrophic flooding since the 1960s. While Africa is responsible for a small fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions, it is among the most vulnerable to extreme weather events, the World Meteorological Organization said earlier this month. In sub-Saharan Africa, the cost of adapting to extreme weather events is estimated at between $30 bilion-50 billion annually over the next decade, the report said. It warned that up to 118 million Africans could be impacted by extreme weather by 2030. Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state, has been under significant strain. Over the last decade, Borno has been hit by a constant string of attacks from Boko Haram militants, who want to install an Islamic state in Nigeria and have killed more than 35,000 people in the last decade. Saleh Bukar, a 28-year-old from Maiduguri, said he was woken up last week around midnight by his neighbors. 'Water is flooding everywhere!' he recalled their frantic screams in a phone interview. 'They were shouting, ’Everybody come out, everybody come out!'' Older people and people with disabilities did not know what was going on, he said, and some were left behind. Those who did not wake up on time drowned right away. Local authorities are overwhelmed by the scale of the disaster: more than 400,000 people in Nigeria have been displaced, and at least 240 people were killed. Last week, floods killed about 80% of the animals at the Borno State Museum Park and an unspecified number of reptiles escaped. The city's main prison was so damaged that hundreds of inmates escaped. The water knocked down the walls of the local police station and some of the government's offices. The World Food Program has set up kitchens providing food to the displaced in Maiduguri as well as emergency food and cash assistance to people in the most hard-hit areas. USAID said Wednesday it has provided more than $3 million in humanitarian assistance to West and Central Africa, including $1 million provided in the immediate aftermath of the floods. But many say they were left to fend for themselves. Floods in mostly arid Niger have impacted over 841,000 people, killing hundreds and displacing more than 400,000. Harira Adamou, a 50-year-old single mother of six, is one of them. She said the floods destroyed her mud hut in the northern city of Agadez. 'The rooms are destroyed; the walls fell down,' she said. 'It's a big risk to live in a mud hut but we don’t have the means to build concrete ones.' Adamou, who is unemployed and lost her husband four years ago, said she has not received any support from the state and has not had the opportunity — or the means — to relocate. She and her children are living in a temporary shelter next to their shattered hut, and fret that the torrential rains might return. 'I understood there was a change in the weather,' she said. 'I have never seen a big rain like this year here in Agadez.' In Maiduguri, 15% of the city remains under water, according to local authorities. As forecasts predicted more rains across the region, Nigerian authorities warned earlier this week that more floods are expected. Bukar said he kept going back to see whether the water that swallowed his home had receded, but that has not happened. He said he has not received any aid from authorities except for some food items handed out at the local school, where he is sheltering with 5,000 others. He is trying to stay sane by helping others. Along with his friend, he helped recover 10 bodies and rescued 25 people, rowing down the streets in a canoe. He said he's also helping out cooking meals for those that are sheltering with him. 'I am volunteering to help, but I am also a victim,' he said. 'Our people need us. They need help.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/torrential-rains-sweep-through-west-and-central-africa/7791669.html	2024-09-20T02:41:52-07:00	
Asian stocks follow Wall Street's rate cut rally higher	HONG KONG — Asian stocks surged Friday with Japan’s Nikkei leading regional gains after Wall Street romped to records following the Federal Reserve’s big cut to interest rates. U.S. futures and oil prices were lower. The Bank of Japan ended a two-day monetary policy meeting and announced it would keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.25%. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index soared 1.5% to close at 37,723.91 after the nation's key inflation data in August accelerated for a fourth consecutive month. The core consumer price index rose 2.8% year-on-year in August, exceeding the central bank’s 2% target and leaving room for further rate hikes. Markets are closely watching for hints on the pace of future rate hikes from BOJ Gov. Kazuo Ueda. 'For the BOJ, given current economic conditions and recent central bank rhetoric, further policy adjustments are not expected until later this year or early 2025,' Anderson Alves of ActivTrades said in a commentary. The U.S. dollar fell to 142.47 Japanese yen from 142.62 yen. The euro rose to $1.1178 from $1.1161. China refrained from further monetary stimulus as the central bank left key lending rates unchanged on Friday. The one-year loan prime rate (LPR), the benchmark for most corporate and household loans, stays at 3.45%, and the five-year rate, a reference for property mortgages, was held at 3.85%. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong added 1.1% to 18,211.06 while the Shanghai Composite index fell 0.2% at 2,730.00. Elsewhere, Australia’s S&P/ASX 200 rose 0.2% at 8,209.50. South Korea's Kospi was up 0.5% to 2,593.12. On Thursday, the S&P 500 jumped 1.7% to 5,713.64 for one of its best days of the year and topped its last all-time high set in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average leaped 1.3% to 42,025.19, and the Nasdaq composite led the market with a 2.5% spurt to 18,013.98. Wall Street’s gains followed rallies for markets across Europe and Asia after the Federal Reserve delivered its first cut to interest rates in more than four years on Wednesday. That closed the door on a run where the Fed kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the U.S. economy enough to stamp out high inflation. Now that inflation has fallen from its peak two summers ago, Chair Jerome Powell said the Fed can focus more on keeping the job market solid and the economy out of a recession. Wall Street’s initial reaction to Wednesday’s cut was a yawn. Markets had already run up for months on expectations for lower rates. Stocks edged lower after swinging a few times. 'Yet we come in today and have a reversal of the reversal,' said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG. He said he did not anticipate such a big jump for stocks on Thursday. The Fed is still under pressure because the job market and hiring have begun to slow under the weight of higher interest rates. Some critics say the central bank waited too long to cut rates and may have damaged the economy. Some investment banks raised their forecasts for how much the Federal Reserve will ultimately cut interest rates, anticipating even deeper reductions than Fed officials. The U.S. presidential election adds to uncertainties. One fear is that both the Democrats and Republicans could push for policies that add to the U.S. government’s debt, which could keep upward pressure on interest rates regardless of the Fed’s moves. In the bond market, the yield on the 10-year Treasury held steady at 3.71%, where it was late Wednesday. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks expectations for Fed action, fell to 3.58% from 3.63%. In other dealings, U.S. benchmark crude oil lost 7 cents to $71.09 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, declined 9 cents to $74.79 per barrel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/asian-stocks-follow-wall-street-s-rate-cut-rally-higher/7791663.html	2024-09-20T02:29:25-07:00

US General: Chad agrees to bring back US forces	Pentagon — The U.S. is returning Special Forces troops to Chad after leaving at the country’s request nearly five months ago. 'We have reached an agreement on the return of a limited number of Special Forces personnel,' Maj. General Kenneth Ekman, who oversaw the recent U.S. withdrawal from Niger at the request of U.S. Africa Command chief Gen. Michael Langley, told VOA in an exclusive interview Thursday. 'It was a presidential decision by [Chadian] President [Mahamat] Deby, but the decision is made, and now we're working through the specifics on how we return,' he added. In April, the U.S. pulled out some 70 Special Forces personnel from Chad ahead of the nation’s presidential election. Deby won that election and ultimately decided to allow U.S. forces to return, a decision that was only recently relayed to U.S. Africa Command. Ekman told VOA the U.S. military plans a smaller operation than the headquarters that forces previously maintained in Chad, whose 11,000-member counterterror force is fighting a growing number of Boko Haram and Islamic State militants around Lake Chad. 'The direction of approach from Chad is immensely important,' Ekman said, especially following the U.S. military withdrawal from Niger that officially ended on Sunday with his departure from Niamey. 'If our presence in Niger allowed us to go inside out, relative to the Sahelian-based VEO [violent extremist organization] threat, we now have to revert to going outside in.' The head of U.S. Africa Command, General Michael Langley, has said his forces are starting to 'reset and recalibrate' in the region. Before coups in Niger, the U.S. had hundreds of forces in two bases that served as major counterterrorism hubs. Burkina Faso and Mali also hosted U.S. Special Forces teams prior to coups in their countries that strained their relationship with the United States and ultimately cut off U.S. military access to prime locations from which to monitor terror groups and train local partners. Under U.S. law the coups prevent AFRICOM from direct military-to-military cooperation. Now, countries such as Ivory Coast, Nigeria, Ghana, Benin and Chad will determine the U.S. counterterror strategy and force strength in West Africa. 'Each partner has their own unique security concerns. They also have their own respective tolerance and willingness to abide the presence of U.S. forces,' Ekman said. Ghana and Nigeria have made it clear to the U.S. that they are not interested in hosting U.S. forces, according to Ekman. But as the violent militant threat spreads primarily southwest from the Sahel, some West African nations along the coast are asking for more U.S. capabilities. Even before the coup in Niger, the U.S. started refurbishing an airfield in Benin to accommodate U.S. military aircraft. After the coup in Niger, the U.S. moved Special Forces into Ivory Coast as well, Ekman told VOA. Any decision to establish a larger military presence like the one the U.S. built up in Niger will ultimately be a policy decision. 'I don’t think you’re going to see another Air Base 201,' said a senior U.S. military official who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, referring to the $100 million drone base that the U.S. built in the Nigerien desert. Instead, the U.S. will likely try to work from within partner force garrisons through strengthening base fortifications and capabilities, but the U.S. has not made this type of agreement with any West African partners since the withdrawal from Niger. 'We're not there yet,' Ekman said. Diminished access Since U.S. counterterror operations were halted in Niger, Ekman cautions that the region has become 'more opaque' as U.S. partnerships and access have 'diminished.' It is more difficult to monitor the terror threat in West Africa, which hurts the U.S. ability to counter it. Officials admit the U.S. is now 'soul searching,' its confidence shaken from broken partnerships and regional approaches that have failed to tamp down the terrorists. The U.S military has been tasked with 'treating the symptom: terrorism,' the senior military official said, acknowledging that diplomatic and economic approaches are what is needed to counter terrorism’s root causes on the continent. The U.S. military’s withdrawal appears to be a net loss for Niger, the United States and other regional partners who had benefited from U.S. intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities available through its bases in Niger. Since the July 2023 coup, extremist attacks have become more lethal as Niger has lost resources and partners. 'They’re absolutely feeling [those losses],' the senior military official said. Ekman said he believes that the U.S. and Niger’s shared security objectives will continue to link the two nations even without American forces on the ground. 'How we will pursue [those objectives], either together or apart, as a consequence of the withdrawal remains to be seen, but we wanted to make sure we kept all options on the table,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-general-chad-agrees-to-bring-back-us-forces-/7791656.html	2024-09-20T02:11:22-07:00	
VOA EXCLUSIVE: General who oversaw US military withdrawal from Niger explains US movements, partnerships in West Africa	PENTAGON — On Sunday, U.S. Africa Command’s Major General Kenneth Ekman was one of the last two U.S. service members to leave Niger as part of America’s military withdrawal, following the country’s July 2023 coup. Per an agreement reached by the U.S. and Niger in May, the only American service members that remain in the country are those securing the U.S. Embassy in the capital, Niamey. The general, who served as AFRICOM’s director of strategy, plans and programs before focusing solely on West Africa, spent the last few months methodically overseeing the withdrawal of about 1,100 American service members, along with U.S. weapons, drones and equipment that had been staged for years in two U.S. military bases in Niger. The task was completed on time and within the parameters set by the host nation, but the withdrawal has created a massive hole in the United States’ ability to monitor the growing violent extremist threat. In an exclusive interview at the Pentagon on Thursday, Ekman explained how the new U.S. footprint in West Africa is beginning to take shape to continue fighting a shared threat. Below are highlights from his discussion with VOA Pentagon correspondent Carla Babb, edited for brevity and clarity: VOA: On what Nigerians should expect in terms of a partnership with the US military: Major General Kenneth Ekman: I think that remains to be seen. ... I think the starting impetus will be reflecting on the 15 years of very mutually beneficial partnership that we had up to this point. We have shed blood together, right? We have pursued their most acute security threats together, and so you can't erase that history … It would be really helpful if the Nigerians took the first step -- they asked us to leave after all -- their first step on what that government and the military that serves them would like next in a U.S. security partnership. And then it will be bounded. What I mean by that is, it's going to take a while for it ever to be what it was on July 25, 2023, which was the day prior to the coup. There are some obstacles--everything from the request that we withdraw, to our turnover of bases and facilities and equipment, to the fact that coup sanctions, Section 7008 sanctions, have been imposed against the junta. And so all of that combines to limit the 'what next.' We still have shared security objectives. How we will pursue them, either together or apart, as a consequence of the withdrawal remains to be seen, but we wanted to make sure we kept all options on the table. VOA: On repercussions concerning military partnerships and training exercises with countries who’ve undergone a coup: Ekman: There are absolutely repercussions. Because when they're omitted, they lose everything from the chance to interact in a region that's becoming increasingly dis-integrated, right, to the chance to practice and practice at a high level within the context or the scenario of the exercise. So it is a net loss, right? It's a net loss for the region, and it's a loss for each of those individual countries as they are excluded. VOA: On increased U.S. military presence in other West African nations: Ekman: What you're talking about is that layer of forces, most of which came from Niger, that we reposition around the Sahel. If our presence in Niger allowed us to go inside out, relative to the Sahelian based VEO (violent extremist organization) threat, we now have to revert to going outside in … Countries like Cote d’Ivoire (Ivory Coast), Ghana, Benin, Chad, our access to them and the degree to which they want to partner with us will influence how we go outside in. We're at a different phase with each of those countries. What I mean is, each partner has their own unique security concerns. They also have their own respective tolerance and willingness to abide the presence of U.S. forces. So in some cases, we moved some forces well prior to the Niger coup, because that's where the threat was going. We were invited early on, and whether it was a small SOF (special operations forces) team or an ISR (intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance) platform, we moved them months ago. The larger question is, and it's a policy question, where, and if we establish significant presence of forces, probably on a partner base, serving alongside them, doing everything from command and control to projecting things like ISR and personnel recovery, to sustaining them and to medically treating them. That is something where we're not there yet, and no agreements have been made. There are some cases where, for now, we're definitely not (establishing a significant force presence). So that's true in Nigeria. We have a very clear message from them … Likewise in Ghana. The ones where things are still kind of under consideration, Chad, Cote d’Ivoire, Benin, those were, what we want to do is, within the partners’ needs, support their partner-led, U.S.-enabled counter VEO ops. VOA: On U.S. military movements, specifically, refurbishing an airfield in Benin to accommodate U.S. aircraft, sending special forces to Ivory Coast and bringing U.S. forces back to Chad: Ekman: The most lethal violent extremist organization threat in the world resides in West Africa, and it resides in the Sahel. It's also spreading. The primary direction of travel is to the southwest, so well-prior to the Niger coup we were already working with partners on what they needed with regards to U.S. presence and capabilities. In the Benin case, we started that a while ago. In the Cote d'Ivoire case, it's been really post-coup (in Niger). So each of them is on their own timeline as we work with them… We did have some forces in Mali and Burkina Faso. We had special forces teams there as well. And given our current relationship, that's just not something that we can do, and so we had some forces available who needed to move and there were requirements in other countries. The specifics beyond that kind of remain to be seen. VOA: But the Cote d'Ivoire (Ivory Coast) case, the (U.S.) special forces were moved from Niger to there? Ekman: That's correct. VOA: OK, and then the airfield (refurbishment) in Benin (to accommodate U.S. aircraft) was started a little prior, but then also worked on during. Ekman: That’s it. A consistent request that we receive from all partners is intel sharing, right? And so that's something that we can offer uniquely… It is a common currency from which everyone benefits. VOA: That has diminished. Ekman: The region has become more opaque. Absolutely. We did remove about 70 U.S. Special Forces personnel (from Chad) at the end of April. That was at their request. They asked us to leave. An election was coming and we obliged. That's what partners do. Since then, they had a successful election on May 6. And so in the aftermath of that, they've started asking us, well, what can we do together? Our goal is to do something less than we had there before. We had a headquarters there before, but we have reached an agreement on the return of a limited number of special forces personnel. It is a presidential decision. So these are big policy decisions. It was a presidential decision by President Deby, but the decision is made, and now we're working through the specifics on how we return… His decision was conveyed to us in just recent weeks. Chad is really important because… it’s an outside-in strategy. And the direction of approach from Chad is immensely important. They've also been a significant contributor to Sahelian security. VOA: On the effect that losing Niger has on region counterterrorism efforts: Ekman: If there was one country that was most important on our ability to address Sahelian VEO problems or the Sahelian VEO challenge, it was Niger. So, for one, of Niger, I talked about it as a strategic setback, (but) the degree to which that setback endures ties to how we reposition and then what our partners want to do with us… That is a snapshot in time. All is not lost. VOA: On concerns that Niger could fall to violent extremist organizations: Ekman: Their risks have definitely gone up. Their ability to confront extremist organizations, intel sharing, partnership with our and other allied forces, it's gotten worse. So they are a capable force... the degree to which they can handle the problem themselves remains to be seen. It is a fact that in Niger, violent extremist attacks have become more lethal. That's a fact. Since the coup on July 26, 2023. They've got fewer resources and fewer partners. VOA: Have you seen any evidence, or heard anything from your engagements about JNIM starting to collaborate with some of the ISIS elements (in West Africa)? Ekman: I think that one varies. For what I can talk about in here, some cases they collaborate, some cases they compete, and that often manifest down to the local level. VOA: On Russia’s military presence in Niger: Ekman: In the Nigerian case, that presence is actually quite small. The Nigerians signed a memorandum of understanding with Russia related to security cooperation two governments ago. And so they fly Russian equipment. They drive Russian equipment. There's nothing new there. The Russian trainers who showed up? Didn't see much of them while we were there. And so, to date, Russian presence in Niger has been quite limited… We caution them of the malign impacts of partnering, particularly with Russian PMCs who have yet to help anybody from a security perspective. And then their methods are abhorrent to us, OK? And so that's where we, we encourage them to draw the line. VOA: On whether terrorists in the Sahel now have the capacity to try external operations: Ekman: Given the lack of access that we have, given the lack of ISR, our ability to gage… the trend in their development of capability and will, it's become more difficult. Our access and our partnerships have diminished. It's a tough operational problem.	https://www.voanews.com/a/general-who-oversaw-us-military-withdrawal-from-niger-explains-us-movements-partnerships-in-west-africa/7791629.html	2024-09-20T00:25:17-07:00	
European Commission president says she's in Kyiv to discuss support for Ukraine	Kyiv, Ukraine — European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Friday she had arrived in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, to discuss Europe's support, winter preparedness, defense and progress on the G7 loans. 'My 8th visit to Kyiv comes as the heating season starts soon, and Russia keeps targeting energy infrastructure,' von der Leyen said on the X social network. Von der Leyen said Thursday more than $160 million from the proceeds of frozen Russian assets would be allocated to meet Ukraine's urgent humanitarian needs for this winter. Russia has knocked out about 9 gigawatts (GW) of Ukraine's energy infrastructure, which von der Leyen said was the 'power equivalent of the three Baltic states.' She also said that the EU aimed to restore 2.5 GW of power generating capacity and would increase exports to supply 2 GW of electricity to Ukraine. Von der Leyen will meet Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, and other officials.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-commission-president-says-she-s-in-kyiv-to-discuss-support-for-ukraine/7791627.html	2024-09-20T00:05:29-07:00

EU, China hold 'constructive' talks on EV tariffs	Brussels — The EU's trade chief, Valdis Dombrovskis, said Thursday he had held 'constructive' talks with China's commerce minister, Wang Wentao, as Beijing seeks a deal with Brussels to avoid steep tariffs on imported electric vehicles. The meeting was held as divisions grow in Europe over the proposed tariffs, after Spain urged the EU last week to 'reconsider' plans for duties of up to 36% on Chinese electric cars, joining Germany in opposition. 'Constructive meeting with Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao. Both sides agreed to intensify efforts to find an effective, enforceable and WTO (World Trade Organization) compatible solution,' Dombrovskis said on X. Wang also spoke to businesses in the EV sector on Wednesday in Brussels after which he said China 'will certainly persevere until the final moments of the consultations,' as quoted in a statement by the Chinese Chamber of Commerce to the EU. The European Commission in July announced plans to levy import duties on electric vehicles imported from China after an anti-subsidy investigation started last year found they were unfairly undermining European rivals. The EU wants to protect its automobile industry, a jewel in Europe's industrial crown, providing jobs to around 14 million people. The commission is in charge of trade policy for the 27-country bloc. The tariffs are currently provisional and will only become definitive for five years after a vote by member states that is expected before the end of October. China has angrily responded to the EU's plans, warning it would unleash a trade war. Last month China also filed an appeal with the WTO over the tariffs. Beijing has already launched its own investigations into European brandy and some dairy and pork products imported into China. Dombrovskis told Wang that the probes were 'unwarranted, are based on questionable allegations, and lack sufficient evidence,' the EU's trade spokesperson, Olof Gill, said. '(He) thus called for these investigations to be terminated and informed the Chinese side that the EU will do its utmost to defend the interests of its industries,' Gill added in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-china-hold-constructive-talks-on-ev-tariffs-/7791562.html	2024-09-19T19:43:19-07:00

Fires destroy crops, threaten archaeological sites in Peru	lima, peru — Peruvian authorities scrambled to roll out a plan to fight fires raging out of control across the nation, razing crops, damaging archaeological treasures, and leaving several regions in a state of disaster on Thursday. Firefighters said battling the blazes has grown increasingly difficult. 'We're tired,' said a volunteer firefighter in the forests of the northern Amazonas region who declined to give his name. 'We put the fire out, it lights back up. We put it out, the fire breaks out again.' Firefighters in the area retreated from the flames on Thursday. 'They're out of control,' said Arturo Morales, another volunteer firefighter. 'We need help.' President Dina Boluarte on Wednesday declared a 60-day state of emergency in the San Martin, Amazonas and Ucayali regions, allocating extra resources to stop the fires from spreading. 'We're rolling out everything we have,' Boluarte said in a speech. She called on farmers to stop burning grasslands, which she said caused flames to spread out of control. Forest fires in Peru are frequent from August to November, either caused by farmers or those who are looking to illegally take over land, according to the government. Around 240 fires have broken out this season in 22 of the country's 25 regions, though more than 80% had been controlled by Wednesday. Some, however, are threatening to spark up again with dry weather, winds and their remote locations making them difficult to access. The flames have reached seven archaeological sites, according to the culture ministry, and are threatening the Indigenous Shipibo-Konibo community in the Amazon. In total, nearly 2,300 hectares of farmland have burned and 140 people have been injured, according to official data through Wednesday. South America is being ravaged by fire from Brazil's Amazon rainforest through the world's largest wetlands to dry forests in Bolivia, breaking a previous record for the number of blazes seen in a year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fires-ravage-peru-destroying-crops-threatening-archaeological-sites-/7791554.html	2024-09-19T19:15:38-07:00

Board approves more non-lethal weapons for UCLA police after Israel-Hamas war protests	LOS ANGELES — The University of California board of regents approved Thursday additional non-lethal weapons requested by UCLA police, which handled some of the nation's largest student protests against the Israel-Hamas war. Clashes between protestors and counter-protestors earlier this year on the campus led to more than a dozen injuries, and more than 200 people were arrested at a demonstration the next day. The equipment UCLA police requested and the board approved included pepper balls and sponge rounds, projectile launchers and new drones. The board also signed off on equipment purchase requests for the nine other police departments on UC campuses. Student protesters at the regents meeting were cleared from the room after yelling broke out when the agenda item was presented. Faculty and students have criticized UCLA police for their use of non-lethal weapons in campus demonstrations, during which some protesters suffered injuries. During public comment, UCLA student association representative Tommy Contreras said the equipment was used against peaceful protestors and demonstrators. 'I am outraged that the University of California is prioritizing funding for military equipment while slashing resources for education,' Contreras said. 'Students, staff and faculty have been hurt by this very equipment used not for safety but to suppress voices.' California law enforcement agencies are required by state law to submit an annual report on the acquisition and use of weapons characterized as 'military equipment.' A UC spokesperson called it a 'routine' agenda item not related to any particular incidents. 'The University's use of this equipment provides UC police officers with non-lethal alternatives to standard-issue firearms, enabling them to de-escalate situations and respond without the use of deadly force,' spokesperson Stett Holbrook said. Many of the requests are replacements for training equipment, and the drones are for assisting with search and rescue missions, according to Holbrook. The equipment is 'not military surplus, nor is it military-grade or designed for military use,' Holbrook said. UCLA police are requesting 3,000 more pepper balls to add to their inventory of 1,600; 400 more sponge and foam rounds to their inventory of 200; eight more 'less lethal' projectile launchers; and three new drones. The report to the regents said there were no complaints or violations of policy found related to the use of the military equipment in 2023. History professor Robin D.G. Kelley said he spent an evening with a student in the emergency room after the student was shot in the chest during a June 11 demonstration. 'The trauma center was so concerned about the condition of his heart that they kept him overnight to the next afternoon after running two echocardiograms,' Kelley said the day after the student was injured. 'The student was very traumatized.' UC's systemwide director of community safety Jody Stiger told the board the weapons were not to be used for crowd control or peaceful protests but 'life-threatening circumstances' or violent protests where 'campus leadership have deemed the need for law enforcement to utilize force to defend themselves or others.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/board-approves-more-non-lethal-weapons-for-ucla-police-after-israel-hamas-war-protests/7791506.html	2024-09-19T17:57:50-07:00	
White House reports drop in border encounters, credits executive actions	washington — The White House this week reported a significant decrease in migrant encounters at the U.S.-Mexico border since President Joe Biden issued an executive order aimed at bolstering immigration enforcement. Migrant encounters in August were significantly lower than last year, White House spokesperson Angelo Fernández Hernández wrote in a statement Monday. Since Biden's June 4 executive order there has been a 50% drop in encounters at the border. According to U.S. Customs and Border Protection, in August there were about 58,000 migrant encounters between ports of entry along the southern border, nearly a 68% decline from the 181,000 in August 2023. The total number of southern border encounters was about 63,000. That figure includes about 5,000 migrants who came to ports of entry without a CBP One registration. CBP One is a mobile app that allows migrants to schedule appointments at ports of entry rather than cross illegally. U.S. border officials said the app has played a crucial role in streamlining border processes. In August, about 44,700 individuals were processed using CBP One. Since its introduction in January 2023, more than 813,000 people have scheduled appointments. U.S. border officials also said the June executive actions led to an increase in migrant removals, with more than 131,000 people deported to over 140 countries since June. About 400 international repatriation flights have taken place during this time. But even with the latest numbers, some Republican lawmakers criticized the Biden administration during a hearing Thursday to discuss potential terrorist threats and homeland security issues related to illegal immigration. The lawmakers argued that the perception of border officers as welcoming, rather than focused on law enforcement, is contributing to the number of migrants coming to the U.S. 'Our border patrol, law enforcement agents were transitioned from their national security role, their law enforcement role [of] repelling illegal entry and capturing those that crossed illegally as much as possible to transition to sort of reception roles and caring for and transporting, feeding, etc.,' Congressman Clay Higgins, a Republican from Alabama, said as he expressed concern about migrants who crossed illegally and evaded Border Patrol. There is no indication the Biden administration officially changed border patrol officers' law enforcement role. Alex Nowrasteh, the vice president for economic and social policy studies at the Cato Institute, testified during the hearing that the primary reason migrants come the U.S. — legally or illegally — is to work. 'It's still the economy. That's what's pulling people in, and the rapid economic recovery after COVID can explain more than any other factor,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-reports-drop-in-border-encounters-credits-executive-actions/7791479.html	2024-09-19T17:39:45-07:00

Fighting Brazil ban, X to name legal representative 'very soon,' its lawyers say	brasilia, brazil — Elon Musk's social media platform X will present a Brazil legal representative to the local Supreme Court 'very soon,' the firm's lawyers said Thursday, as the company battles a ruling that sought to shut down its operation in the country. The move would be the biggest step taken by X toward complying with the demands of Brazil's Supreme Court, which issued an order in late August suspending the social media platform over concerns about the spread of hate speech. Andre Zonaro and Sergio Rosenthal, who were recently appointed as X's lawyers in Brazil, told Reuters the firm had already sent a document to the Supreme Court saying a legal representative would be named. They added that the representative was still being chosen. In August, after a monthslong dispute between Musk and Brazilian Justice Alexandre de Moraes, the Supreme Court ordered Brazil's mobile and internet service providers to block the platform, cutting users off within hours. Despite the ban, X became accessible to many users in Brazil on Wednesday after an update to its communications network bypassed the court-ordered block. The Supreme Court ordered X on Wednesday not to circumvent its ruling, saying it was at risk of a daily fine of nearly $922,000 (5 million reais). 'There is no doubt that X, under Elon Musk's direct command, again intends to disrespect Brazil's Judiciary,' Moraes wrote in his latest order, saying the platform had a 'strategy' to circumvent the ban. X said Wednesday that a switch in network providers had resulted in 'an inadvertent and temporary service restoration' in Brazil, adding that it was maintaining efforts to work with the Brazilian government to resume service there 'very soon.' The lawyers on Thursday called the event a 'technical flaw' that allowed users to access the social media platform in the country. Courts have previously blocked accounts implicated in probes of allegedly spreading misinformation and hate, which Musk has denounced as censorship. They also ordered X to name a local legal representative as required by Brazilian law after X had closed its offices in Brazil in mid-August. The lawyers representing X in Brazil said the firm had also started to comply with the orders on removing content.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fighting-brazil-ban-x-to-name-legal-representative-very-soon-its-lawyers-say-/7791197.html	2024-09-19T16:16:11-07:00

China-connected spamouflage impersonated Dutch cartoonist	Washington — Based on the posts of an X account that bears the name of Dutch cartoonist Bart van Leeuwen, a profile picture of his face and short professional bio, one would think the Amsterdam-based artist is a staunch supporter of China and fierce critic of the United States. In one post, the account blasts what it calls Washington’s 'fallacies against the Chinese economy,' accompanied by a cartoon from the Global Times — a Beijing-controlled media outlet — showing Uncle Sam aiming but failing to hit a target emblazoned with the words 'China’s economy.' In another, the account reposts a Chinese propaganda video about the country’s rubber-stamp legislature, writing 'today’s China is closely connected with the world, blending with each other, and achieving mutual success.' But Van Leeuwen didn’t make the posts. In fact, this account doesn’t even belong to him. It belongs to a China-connected network on X of 'spamouflage' accounts, which pretend to be the work of real people but are in reality controlled by robots sending out messages designed to shape public opinion. China has repeatedly rejected reports that it seeks to influence U.S. presidential elections, describing such claims as 'fabricated.' VOA Mandarin and DoubleThink Lab (DTL), a Taiwanese social media analytics firm, uncovered the fake Van Leeuwen account during a joint investigation into a network of spamouflage accounts working on behalf of the Chinese government. The network, consisting of at least nine accounts, propagated Beijing’s talking points on issues including human rights abuses in China’s western Xinjiang province, territorial disputes with countries in the South China Sea and U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods. Fake account contradicts real artist Van Leeuwen confirmed in an interview with VOA Mandarin that he had nothing to do with and was not aware of the fake account. 'It’s ironic that my identity, being a political cartoonist, is being used for political propaganda,' he told VOA in a written statement. The real Van Leeuwen is an award-winning cartoonist whose works have been published on news outlets around the world, such as the Las Vegas Review-Journal, the Korea Times, Sing Tao Daily in Hong Kong and Gulf Today in the United Arab Emirates. He specializes in editorial cartoons, whose main subjects include global politics, elections in the U.S. and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Several of his past illustrations made fun of Chinese leader Xi Jinping’s economic policies and the opaqueness of Beijing’s inner political struggles. After being contacted by VOA Mandarin, a spokesman from X said the fake account has been suspended. Other than finding irony in being impersonated by a Chinese propaganda bot, Van Leeuwen said the incident also worries him. 'This example once again highlights the need for far-reaching measures regarding the restriction of social media,' Van Leeuwen wrote in his statement, 'especially with irresponsible people like Elon Musk at the helm.' After purchasing what was then called Twitter in 2022, the Tesla and SpaceX CEO vowed to reduce the prevalence of bots on the platform, but many users complain it has become even worse. Musk, the world’s richest person, is a so-called 'free speech absolutist,' opposing almost all censorship of people voicing their views. Critics say his policy allows racist and false information to flourish on X. Former President Donald Trump has praised Musk’s business acumen and said he plans to have the man who may become the world’s first trillionaire head a commission on government efficiency if he is reelected in November. Network of spamouflage accounts Before its suspension, the X account that impersonated Van Leeuwen had close to 1,000 followers, more than Van Leeuwen’s real X account. It was registered in 2013, but its first post came only last year. The account’s early posts were mostly encouraging and inspiring words in Chinese. It also posted many dance videos. Gradually, the account started to mix in more and more political narratives, criticizing the U.S. and defending China. It often reposted content from another spamouflage account called 'Grey World.' 'Grey World' used a photo of an attractive Asian woman as its profile picture. Most of its posts were supportive of Beijing’s talking points. It regularly posted videos and cartoons from Chinese state media. It also posted several of Van Leeuwen’s cartoons about American politics. VOA Mandarin and DTL’s investigation identified 'Grey World' as the main spamouflage account in a network of nine such accounts. Other accounts in the network, including the fake Van Leeuwen account, amplified 'Grey World' by reposting its content. But posts from 'Grey World' had limited reach on X, despite having tens of thousands of followers. For example, between August 18 and September 1, its most popular post, a diatribe against Washington’s Indo-Pacific strategy, was viewed a little over 10,000 times but only had 35 reposts and 65 likes. After the suspension of the fake Van Leeuwen account, X also shut down the 'Grey World' account. The spamouflage network is not the first linked to China. In April, British researchers released a report saying Chinese nationalist trolls were posing as American supporters of Trump on X to try to exploit domestic divisions ahead of the U.S. election. U.S. federal prosecutors in 2023 accused China’s Ministry of Public Security of having a covert social media propaganda campaign that also aimed to influence U.S. elections. Researchers at Facebook’s parent company Meta said it was the largest known covert propaganda operation ever identified on that platform and Instagram, reported Rolling Stone magazine. Network analysis firm Graphika called the pro-Chinese network 'Spamouflage Dragon,' part of a campaign it identified in early 2020 that was at the time posting content that praised Beijing’s policies and attacked those of then-President Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-connected-spamouflage-impersonated-dutch-cartoonist-/7791154.html	2024-09-19T15:47:54-07:00	
Wall Street soars to record highs in rally that sweeps world	new york — Wall Street romped to records Thursday as jubilation swept markets worldwide one day after the U.S. Federal Reserve's big cut to interest rates. The S&P 500 jumped 1.7% for one of its best days of the year and topped its last all-time high set in July. The Dow Jones Industrial Average leaped 522 points, or 1.3%, to beat its own record set on Monday, and the Nasdaq composite led the market with a 2.5% spurt. The rally was widespread, and Darden Restaurants, the company behind Olive Garden and Ruth's Chris, led the way in the S&P 500 with a jump of 8.3%. It said sales trends have been improving since a sharp step down in July, and it announced a delivery partnership with Uber. Nvidia, meanwhile, barreled 4% higher and was one of the strongest forces lifting the S&P 500. Lower interest rates weaken criticism by a bit that its shares and those of other influential Big Tech companies look too expensive following the frenzy around artificial-intelligence technology. Wall Street's gains followed rallies for markets across Europe and Asia after the Federal Reserve delivered the first cut to interest rates in more than four years late on Wednesday. It was a momentous move, closing the door on a run where the Fed kept its main interest rate at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the U.S. economy enough to stamp out high inflation. Now that inflation has come down from its peak two summers ago, Chairman Jerome Powell said the Fed can focus more on keeping the job market solid and the economy out of a recession. Wall Street's initial reaction to Wednesday's cut was a yawn, after markets had run up for months on expectations for coming reductions to rates. Stocks ended up edging lower after swinging a few times. 'Yet we come in today and have a reversal of the reversal,' said Jonathan Krinsky, chief market technician at BTIG. He said he did not anticipate such a big jump for stocks on Thursday. Some analysts said the market could be relieved that the Fed's Powell was able to thread the needle in his press conference and suggest the deeper-than-usual cut was just a recalibration of policy and not an urgent move it had to take to prevent a recession. That bolstered hopes the Federal Reserve can successfully walk its tightrope and get inflation down to its 2% target without a recession. So too did a couple reports on the economy released Thursday. One showed fewer workers applied for unemployment benefits last week, another signal that layoffs across the country remain low. Lower interest rates help financial markets in two big ways. They ease the brakes off the economy by making it easier for U.S. households and businesses to borrow money. They also give a boost to prices of all kinds of investments, from gold to bonds to cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin rose above $63,000 Thursday, up from about $27,000 a year ago. An adage suggests investors should not 'fight the Fed' and should instead ride the rising tide when the central bank is cutting interest rates. Wall Street was certainly doing that Thursday. But this economic cycle has thrown out conventional wisdom repeatedly after the COVID-19 pandemic created an instant recession that gave way to the worst inflation in generations. Wall Street is worried that inflation could remain tougher to fully subdue than in the past. And while lower rates can help goose the economy, they can also give inflation more fuel. The upcoming U.S. presidential election could also keep uncertainty reigning in the market. A fear is that both the Democrats and Republicans could push for policies that add to the U.S. government's debt, which could keep upward pressure on interest rates regardless of the Fed's moves. Indexes climbed even more across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. They rose 2.3% in France, 2.1% in Japan and 2% in Hong Kong. The FTSE 100 added 0.9% in London after the Bank of England kept interest rates there on hold. The next big move for a central bank arrives Friday, when the Bank of Japan will announce its latest decision on interest rates.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wall-street-soars-to-record-highs-in-rally-that-sweeps-world-/7791147.html	2024-09-19T15:39:35-07:00	
Fresh hope grows for Malawi banana farmers after virus attack	Blantyre, Malawi — Banana farmers in Malawi are beginning to recover from over a decade of economic hardship after the banana bunchy top virus, or BBTV, wiped out local banana varieties. Africa’s Banana Bunchy Top Disease Alliance said up to 16 countries on the continent have been hit by BBTV, which renders plants unproductive and eventually kills them. The disease leads to yield losses of 70% to 90% in the first season, with subsequent seasons seeing no bananas at all. Agriculture experts in Malawi say the virus destroyed the livelihoods of nearly 200,000 farmers in 2016, who were entirely dependent on banana farming. Samson Mulenga, one of the affected farmers in Mulanje district in southern Malawi, told VOA the disease wiped out his entire banana production and left him destitute. The retired agriculture extension coordinator said a switch to other crops like cow peas, vegetables and cassava did not earn him as much as he had earned from banana farming. But now, he said, the situation is slowly returning to normal because of collaborative programs between the U.N.'s Food and Agriculture Organization and the Malawi government aimed at revamping the banana industry. Godfrey Kayira, horticulture specialist for the Ministry of Agriculture in Mulanje district, said that under the Special Agricultural Product and Kulima programs, farmers were advised to get rid of all infected bananas and instead plant a BBTV-free variety. 'These are the new varieties, but they are also susceptible to disease and can get the disease,' he said. 'So, the only way is to manage the disease. That’s why we did some training [for] farmers so that they can manage. But if the varieties are left unmanaged, they can also get affected by the disease and also die.' Kayira said farmers were told to plant the new varieties 100 meters away from any banana plantation or orchard, and to immediately uproot and burn any plant showing signs of the disease, which include severe stunting and stumpy shoots. However, smallholder farmers say their road to recovery is hindered by an influx of imported bananas from Tanzania and Mozambique. Those bananas are cheap, but are lower quality, Kayira explained. 'Mulanje [district] is getting a lot of bananas from Mozambique,' he said. 'The challenge is that the bananas from Mulanje, the quality is good compared to those from Mozambique. As a result, the price of the bananas that we have here are much higher than those from Mozambique.' Kayira said the situation will normalize once the country’s banana production returns to its former glory. Meanwhile, Malawi is also receiving support from the Chinese government, which is carrying out a 'School Banana Orchard Establishment' initiative aimed at growing bananas at primary and secondary schools across the country. In March of this year, the initiative planted more than 100 banana plants at the Chaminade Marianist secondary school in the capital Lilongwe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fresh-hope-grows-for-malawi-banana-farmers-after-virus-attack-/7791105.html	2024-09-19T15:09:36-07:00	
Attack in Mali capital killed more than 70, security sources say	Bamako, Mali — An attack in the Malian capital, Bamako, targeting a military police training camp and airport left more than 70 people dead and 200 wounded, security sources said Thursday, one of the highest tolls suffered in recent years. The attacks Tuesday in Bamako were the first of their kind in years and dealt a forceful blow to the ruling junta, experts said. The death toll has put scrutiny on the junta's military strategy and its claims that the security situation is under control despite militants roaming the region for years. The operation claimed by the al-Qaida-linked Group to Support Islam and Muslims (JNIM) has prompted widespread shock and condemnation within the West African country. Many Malians have taken to social media to demand accountability for what they consider a security lapse. Higher reported tolls A security source, speaking on condition of anonymity, told AFP that 77 people had been killed and 255 wounded in Tuesday's attacks. An authenticated confidential official document put the toll at around 100 and identified 81 victims. The general staff acknowledged late Tuesday that 'some human lives were lost,' notably personnel at the military police center. Mali's military-led authorities have so far given no indication of any future measures in response to the attacks, which were not mentioned in the minutes of Wednesday's cabinet meeting. JNIM claimed that a few dozen of its fighters had killed and wounded hundreds from the opposing ranks, including members of the Russian paramilitary group Wagner. The attack came a day after junta-led Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso marked a year since the creation of their breakaway grouping, the Alliance of Sahel States. The three countries, which have been under military rule following a string of coups since 2020, have broken ties with former colonial ruler France and turned militarily and politically toward other partners, including Russia. Bamako is normally spared the sort of attacks that occur almost daily in some parts of Mali. The West African country has been ravaged since 2012 by different factions affiliated with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group. Volleys of gunfire interspersed with explosions broke out in Bamako around 5 a.m. local time (0500 GMT) on Tuesday. JNIM fighters attacked a military police school and stormed part of the nearby airport complex, where a military facility adjoins the civilian one. The militant group broadcast images showing fighters strolling around and firing randomly into the windows of the presidential hangar and destroying aircraft. Condemnation, condolences Condemnation poured in on Thursday, including from U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, Mali's neighbor Senegal, African Union Commission Chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat and the U.K. Embassy. The French Embassy in Bamako offered its 'condolences to the government of Mali.' Jean-Herve Jezequel, Sahel project director at the International Crisis Group, told AFP that one hypothesis could be that 'the jihadists are trying to send a message to the Malian authorities that they can hit them anywhere and therefore that the big cities must also be protected.' He said the aim could be to force the government to concentrate its resources in populated areas and have fewer troops in rural areas 'where these jihadist groups have established their strongholds.' Against a backdrop of severe restrictions on freedom of expression under the governing junta, virtually no public figures in Mali have spoken out against the alleged security lapse. The daily Nouvel Horizon, a rare dissenting voice, wrote on its front page that it was 'time to apportion blame at all levels.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/attack-in-mali-capital-killed-more-than-70-security-sources-say-/7791054.html	2024-09-19T13:39:57-07:00

New analysis of 2019 Wuhan market animals may help find COVID-19 origin	LONDON — Scientists searching for the origins of COVID-19 have zeroed in on a short list of animals that possibly helped spread it to people, an effort they hope could allow them to trace the outbreak back to its source. Researchers analyzed genetic material gathered from the Chinese market where the first outbreak was detected and found that the most likely animals were raccoon dogs, civet cats and bamboo rats. The scientists suspect infected animals were first brought to the Wuhan market in late November 2019, which then triggered the pandemic. Michael Worobey, one of the new study's authors, said they found which sub-populations of animals might have transmitted the coronavirus to humans. That may help researchers pinpoint where the virus commonly circulates in animals, known as its natural reservoir. 'For example, with the raccoon dogs, we can show that the raccoon dogs that were [at the market] … were from a sub-species that circulates more in southern parts of China,' said Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona. Knowing that might help researchers understand where those animals came from and where they were sold. Scientists might then start sampling bats in the area, which are known to be the natural reservoirs of related coronaviruses like SARS. While the research bolsters the case that COVID-19 emerged from animals, it does not resolve the polarized and political debate over whether the virus instead emerged from a research lab in China. Mark Woolhouse, a professor of infectious diseases at the University of Edinburgh, said the new genetic analysis suggested that the pandemic 'had its evolutionary roots in the market' and that it was very unlikely COVID-19 was infecting people before it was identified at the Huanan market. 'It's a significant finding and this does shift the dial more in favor of an animal origin,' said Woolhouse, who was not connected to the research. 'But it is not conclusive.' An expert group led by the World Health Organization concluded in 2021 that the virus probably spread to humans from animals and that a lab leak was 'extremely unlikely.' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus later said it was premature to rule out a lab leak. An AP investigation in April found the search for the COVID origins in China has gone dark after political infighting and missed opportunities by local and global health officials to narrow the possibilities. Scientists say they may never know for sure where exactly the virus came from. In the new study, published Thursday in the journal Cell, scientists from Europe, the U.S. and Australia analyzed data previously released by experts at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention. It included 800 samples of genetic material Chinese workers collected on Jan. 1, 2020, from the Huanan seafood market, the day after Wuhan municipal authorities first raised the alarm about an unknown respiratory virus. Chinese scientists published the genetic sequences they found last year, but did not identify any of the animals possibly infected with the coronavirus. In the new analysis, researchers used a technique that can identify specific organisms from any mixture of genetic material collected in the environment. Worobey said the information provides 'a snapshot of what was [at the market] before the pandemic began' and that genetic analyses like theirs 'helps to fill in the blanks of how the virus might have first started spreading.' Woolhouse said the new study, while significant, left some critical issues unanswered. 'There is no question COVID was circulating at that market, which was full of animals,' he said. 'The question that still remains is how it got there in the first place.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-analysis-of-2019-wuhan-market-animals-may-help-find-covid-19-origin/7790939.html	2024-09-19T13:00:41-07:00

Biden hails economic progress after Fed rate cut but avoids victory lap	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden began touting the progress in bringing down inflation and boosting employment on Thursday, a day after the Federal Reserve's interest rate cut, while vowing to keep working to lower costs for American families. Biden will use an Economic Club of Washington event to summarize how well the U.S. responded to the COVID-19 pandemic and a surge in inflation after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, his chief of staff, Jeff Zients, told reporters. Many economists had predicted a recession would be needed to lower inflation, but they were proven wrong as Biden's policies aimed at expanding domestic manufacturing, investing in clean energy and other infrastructure, and capping drug costs for seniors helped create 16 million jobs and raised wages, he said. Polls show Americans remain deeply worried about the economy and inflation, with Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic nominee when Biden bowed out of the race in July, and Republican former President Donald Trump essentially deadlocked less than seven weeks before the November 5 U.S. presidential election. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released this week showed Trump had an advantage on the issue of inflation, which surged under Biden in 2021 and 2022. Some 43% of voters in the poll said Trump would be more likely to 'lower prices for everyday things like groceries and gas,' compared with 36% who picked Harris. Biden and Harris are focused on continuing to lower costs and strengthen the economy, Zients said. 'The president knows this is no time for a victory lap, which is why he will talk about the work ahead ... to make the economy stronger, create more jobs and, importantly, lower costs,' he told reporters. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, speaking on Wednesday after the U.S. central bank cut interest rates by half a percentage point, said that the economy remained strong but that policymakers wanted to stay ahead of and stave off any weakening in the job market. The unemployment rate, now at 4.2%, is more than half a percentage point higher than it was when the Fed began an aggressive rate-hike campaign in March of 2022. National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard said the Fed's rate cut sent a 'clear signal that inflation has come back down,' noting that inflation was now at the same level seen in the month before the COVID-19 pandemic began. Mortgage rate reductions that already have happened would save the average home buyer $5,000 a year, with savings to increase as the rates declined further, she said, adding that the cuts also would save the average new car buyer nearly $1,100 over the life of the loan. But she said further work was needed to drive down housing costs, support child-care needs and sustain the gains achieved for working-class families.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-hails-economic-progress-after-fed-rate-cut-but-avoids-victory-lap/7790871.html	2024-09-19T11:37:30-07:00	
Botswana grants Canadian firm license to mine manganese	Gaborone, Botswana — Botswana has awarded a 15-year license to a Canadian firm, Giyani Metals, to mine manganese, a metal used in the manufacture of batteries for electric vehicles. According to a statement from Giyani Metals, the K-Hill project will produce battery-grade manganese. Mining will take place in Kanye, 90 kilometers (56 miles) southwest of Gaborone. Minister of Foreign Affairs Lemogang Kwape, the area’s member of parliament, told VOA he expects good things from the project. 'It is a project that envisages to mine a product that will revolutionize clean power. It is also a project that will develop Kanye and Botswana,' Kwape said. 'Giyani management promised that there will be some processing that will be done in situ. By doing processing, you are adding value, which is in line with the president's objective of adding value to products from Botswana.' The Ministry of Energy and Minerals granted Giyani Metals the mining license, which is subject to multiple renewals. In a country heavily reliant on diamonds for its economy, Minister of Energy and Minerals Lefoko Moagi said the government is accelerating research-based exploration of minerals. 'The ministry continues to advance mineral discoveries through research in order to grow and expand the country’s economic status through exploration, mining, manufacturing and processing of various mineral commodities,' Moagi said. The Botswana manganese project has a net value of $984 million, with an estimated project life span of 57 years. Tshepiso Masilonyane, programs officer at the Botswana Climate Change Network, said manganese will play a key role if the world is to move away from fossil fuels. 'The manganese project is extremely important for the green energy transition,' Masilonyane said. 'It is a critical component in battery technology, particularly in the production of lithium-ion batteries that are used in electric vehicles but also in grade-level electricity distribution, particularly the energy storage systems.' Masilonyane urged Botswana to play a bigger role in the green energy value chain. 'By becoming a key supplier of battery-grade manganese, Botswana can position itself as an important player in the renewable energy value chain helping to power electric vehicles, the solar energy storage technologies, as well as other green technologies,' Masilonyane said. 'But we think beyond extraction, it is going to be very important for us to focus on value addition as early as now.' According to the International Energy Agency, global electric car sales reached 14 million in 2023, a 35% increase from 2022. As a result, metals such as manganese are in high demand – and Botswana is in position to benefit from the boom.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-grants-canadian-firm-license-to-mine-manganese/7790835.html	2024-09-19T11:06:04-07:00

Pakistani police kill second blasphemy suspect within a week	ISLAMABAD — Police in southern Pakistan reported Thursday that a doctor facing allegations of blasphemy against Islam was killed in a shootout during a raid intended to arrest him. The overnight alleged extrajudicial killing of Shah Nawaz in the province of Sindh marked the second instance within a week in which Pakistani police fatally shot a blasphemy suspect. Nawaz, a Muslim, was an employee at the main public hospital in his native Umerkot district. He was dismissed from his job on Tuesday after area residents accused him of 'desecrating' the Prophet Muhammad by sharing 'blasphemous posts' on Facebook earlier in the week. The doctor rejected the charges and disowned the social media account. A police complaint was subsequently filed against him, however, amid citywide violent protests by religious party activists demanding his immediate arrest. An area police officer, Niaz Khoso, alleged that Nawaz and another 'armed' man were fleeing on a motorcycle to evade arrest, refused to stop at a checkpoint and instead opened fire on police. The ensuing exchange of gunfire led to the death of the blasphemy suspect, Khoso said. Such official claims are often widely disputed by critics, who point to a highly politicized and corruption-plagued Pakistani police force with a history of staged encounters. Last week, a police officer in the southwestern city of Quetta shot and killed a 52-year-old hotel owner who was being held in custody on blasphemy allegations. The victim, Abdul Ali, a Muslim, was arrested a day earlier for allegedly posting derogatory remarks on social media about the Prophet Muhammad. His killing inside the police lockup triggered outrage and calls for bringing the shooter to justice. Ali’s family announced at a news conference together with their tribal elders late on Wednesday, though, that they had 'forgiven' the police officer and would not press charges 'in the name of God.' One of the elders stated that their tribe had decided to disown the slain man for disrespecting the prophet of Islam. The country’s independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, or HRCP, said that it was 'gravely concerned by the alleged extrajudicial' killings of Shah and Ali. 'This pattern of violence in cases of blasphemy, in which law enforcement personnel are allegedly involved, is an alarming trend,' the watchdog stated in a Thursday statement. The HRCP urged authorities to conduct an independent inquiry to ascertain who was responsible for the doctor’s death in Umarkot and bring the perpetrators to justice. Blasphemy is a highly sensitive issue in majority-Muslim Pakistan, where mere allegations have led to mobs lynching scores of suspects, even some in police custody. Insulting the Quran or the Prophet is punishable by death under the country's blasphemy laws, although no one has ever been officially executed. In June, a 73-year-old Pakistani man from the minority Christian community died in a hospital a week after being violently attacked by a mob in Pakistan’s Punjab province following accusations he insulted Islam. Days later, on June 20, a Muslim man from Punjab was visiting the scenic northwestern Swat Valley when a mob violently lynched him for allegedly desecrating Islam's holy book, the Quran. The laws are persistently under international scrutiny, with critics blaming them for the recent rise in blasphemy allegations and mob lynching of suspects in Pakistan. A new report released on Monday stated that the blasphemy laws are being significantly misused, with many defendants facing baseless accusations, protracted legal battles, and lengthy pretrial prison time, as judges tread carefully to avoid offending religious groups. The findings by the U.S.-based Clooney Foundation for Justice backed long-running local and international rights groups’ concerns that the strict blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal vendettas or to persecute Pakistani minority communities. Hundreds of blasphemy suspects, mostly Muslims, are languishing in jails in Pakistan because fear of retaliation from religious groups deters judges from moving their trials forward.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-police-kill-second-blasphemy-suspect-within-a-week/7790768.html	2024-09-19T10:29:02-07:00	
Biden to meet Zelenskyy at White House Sept 26	White House — President Joe Biden will meet with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy at the White House next week (Sept 26) for talks on the ongoing Ukraine-Russia conflict, the White House announced Thursday. A statement from Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Zelenskyy will also meet separately with Vice President Kamala Harris. 'The leaders will discuss the state of the war between Russia and Ukraine, including Ukraine’s strategic planning and U.S. support for Ukraine in its defense against Russian aggression. The President and Vice President will emphasize their unshakeable commitment to stand with Ukraine until it prevails in this war, she said Zelenskyy has said that he has a plan for victory in Russia's war against his country, and that he intends to present the proposal to Biden. In a speech at the opening of the 20th Annual Yalta European Strategy Meeting in Kyiv last Friday, Zelenskyy said wars of aggression, such as the one being waged by Russia against Ukraine, can end positively by either the occupying army being pushed out on the battlefield or through diplomacy, in which the invaded country is freed from occupation and its independence is preserved. 'In both cases, Ukraine needs a strong position,' he said. 'The United States can help with this. If we, along with our key partner, equally strive for victory.' In recent weeks, Zelenskyy has expressed his frustration at not yet receiving permission from allies — specifically the United States and Britain — to use their long-range weapons against targets inside Russia. Both nations have expressed concern about being drawn into a direct confrontation with Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-meet-zelenskyy-at-white-house-sept-26/7790751.html	2024-09-19T09:58:41-07:00

Oktoberfest tightens security in wake of deadly knife attack in western Germany	Munich — Security has tightened at Oktoberfest in the wake of last month's deadly knife attack in Solingen in western Germany, and officials warned revelers to expect longer lines at entry points as metal detectors will be deployed for the first time in the Bavarian beer festival's 189-year history. Authorities say there are no specific threats to the world's largest folk festival, which begins Saturday with the traditional keg-tapping in Munich and runs through Oct. 6. Some 6 million participants, many wearing traditional lederhosen and dirndl dresses, are expected over the course of the event. The stepped-up security comes after an Aug. 23 attack in Solingen that left three dead and eight wounded. A 26-year-old Syrian suspect was arrested. He was an asylum-seeker who was supposed to be deported to Bulgaria last year but reportedly disappeared for a time and avoided deportation. The Islamic State militant group has claimed responsibility for the violence, without providing evidence. The violence left Germany shaken and pushed immigration back to the top of the country's political agenda. In response, the Interior Ministry extended temporary border controls to all nine of its frontiers this week. The controls are set to last six months and are threatening to test European unity. The effects of the Solingen attack and other recent violence across Germany will also be felt at Oktoberfest. Hand-held metal detectors will be used for the first time, with police and security staff using them on a random basis or following suspicious activity. 'We have had to react to the fact that attacks with knives have increased in recent weeks and months,' Munich Mayor Dieter Reiter told The Associated Press during a media tour of the festival grounds to highlight the new security measures. 'We will do everything we can to ensure that nobody comes to Oktoberfest with a knife or other dangerous weapons.' In addition to some 600 police officers and 2,000 security staff, more than 50 cameras will be installed across the grounds of the festival, which will be fenced off as well. Festival goers also are prohibited from bringing knives, glass bottles and backpacks. Oktoberfest is no stranger to increased security in the past. In 2016, authorities implemented tighter measures in response to a series of attacks, including when a German teenager fatally shot nine people at a Munich mall before killing himself. Peter Neumann, a professor of security studies at King's College London, said Oktoberfest officials are taking a sensible approach to security in light of Solingen, as well as other recent foiled plots across Europe. Extremists and groups like the Islamic State seek locations where an attack would garner international headlines and 'cause a lot of terror,' he said. French authorities say they thwarted three plots against the Olympic and Paralympic Games in Paris and other cities that hosted the summer events, which included plans to attack ' Israeli institutions or representatives of Israel in Paris.' And Austrian officials last month arrested a 19-year-old who had allegedly plotted to attack now-canceled Taylor Swift concerts in Vienna and kill tens of thousands of fans. 'These are all global events where you can expect to cause a lot of attention,' Neumann said. Neumann said the Islamic State has been gaining momentum during the Israel-Hamas war. The group referenced the war when it claimed responsibility for the Solingen violence, saying the attacker targeted Christians and that as a 'soldier of the Islamic State' he carried out the assaults 'to avenge Muslims in Palestine and everywhere.' Oktoberfest is a difficult event for police to secure, though authorities say there haven't been any concrete threats to the festival. 'It's an iconic event and this is exactly the kind of event that they'd want to strike,' Neumann said. 'But with millions of people — drunk people to be honest — running around, it's really difficult to control every movement.' The festival's organizer, Clemens Baumgaertner, promised a safe public space, possibly 'the safest place in Germany' during the 16 days of Oktoberfest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/oktoberfest-tightens-security-in-wake-of-deadly-knife-attack-in-western-germany/7790498.html	2024-09-19T07:33:40-07:00	
Congo gold-mining town is mpox hot spot as new strain spreads	KAMITUGA, Congo — Slumped on the ground over a mound of dirt, Divine Wisoba pulled weeds from her daughter's grave. The 1-month-old died from mpox in eastern Congo in August, but Wisoba, 21, was too traumatized to attend the funeral. In her first visit to the cemetery, she wept into her shirt for the child she lost and worried about the rest of her family. 'When she was born, it was as if God had answered our prayers — we wanted a girl,' Wisoba said of little Maombi Katengey. 'But our biggest joy was transformed into devastation.' Her daughter is one of more than 6,000 people officials suspect have contracted the disease in South Kivu province, the epicenter of the world's latest mpox outbreak, in what the World Health Organization has labeled a global health emergency. A new strain of the virus is spreading, largely through skin-to-skin contact, including but not limited to sex. A lack of funds, vaccines and information is making it difficult to stem the spread, according to alarmed disease experts. Mpox — which causes mostly mild symptoms like fever and body aches, but can trigger serious cases with prominent blisters on the face, hands, chest and genitals — had been spreading mostly undetected for years in Africa, until a 2022 outbreak reached more than 70 countries. Globally, gay and bisexual men made up the vast majority of cases in that outbreak. But officials note mpox has long disproportionately affected children in Africa, and they say cases are now rising sharply among kids, pregnant women and other vulnerable groups, with many types of close contact responsible for the spread. Health officials have zeroed in on Kamituga, a remote yet bustling gold-mining town of some 300,000 people that attracts miners, sex workers and traders who are constantly on the move. Cases from other parts of eastern Congo can be traced back here, officials say, with the first originating in the nightclub scene. Since this outbreak began, one year ago, nearly 1,000 people in Kamituga have been infected. Eight have died, half of them children. Challenges on the ground Last month, the World Health Organization said mpox outbreaks might be stopped in the next six months, with governments' leadership and cooperation. But in Kamituga, people say they face a starkly different reality. There's a daily average of five new cases at the general hospital, which is regularly near capacity. Overall in South Kivu, weekly new suspected cases have skyrocketed from about 12 in January to 600 in August, according to province health officials. Even that's likely an underestimate, they say, because of a lack of access to rural areas, the inability of many residents to seek care, and Kamituga's transient nature. Locals say they simply don't have enough information about mpox. Before her daughter got sick, Wisoba said, she was infected herself but didn't know it. Painful lesions emerged around her genitals, making walking difficult. She thought she had a common sexually transmitted infection and sought medicine at a pharmacy. Days later, she went to the hospital with her newborn and was diagnosed with mpox. She recovered, but her daughter developed lesions on her foot. Nearly a week later, Maombi died at the same hospital that treated her mother. Wisoba said she didn't know about mpox until she got it. She wants the government to invest more in teaching people protective measures. Local officials can't reach areas more than a few miles outside Kamituga to track suspected cases or inform residents. They broadcast radio messages but say that doesn't reach far enough. Kasindi Mwenyelwata goes door to door describing how to detect mpox — looking for fevers, aches or lesions. But the 42-year-old community leader said a lack of money means he doesn't have the right materials, such as posters showing images of patients, which he finds more powerful than words. ALIMA, one of the few aid groups working on mpox in Kamituga, lacks funds to set up programs or clinics that would reach some 150,000 people, with its budget set to run out at year's end, according to program coordinator Dr. Dally Muamba. If support keeps waning and mpox spreads, he said, 'there will be an impact on the economy, people will stop coming to the area as the epidemic takes its toll. ... And as the disease grows, will resources follow?' Vaccine vacuum Health experts agree: What's needed most are vaccines — even if they go only to adults, under emergency approval in Congo. None has arrived in Kamituga, though it's a priority city in South Kivu, officials said. It's unclear when or how they will. The main road into town is unpaved — barely passable by car during the ongoing rainy season. Once they make it here, it's unclear whether supply will meet demand for those who are at greatest risk and first in line: health staff, sex workers, miners and motorcycle taxi drivers. Congo's government has budgeted more than $190 million for its initial mpox response, which includes the purchase of 3 million vaccine doses, according to a draft national mpox plan, widely circulating among health experts and aid groups this month and seen by The Associated Press. But so far, just 250,000 doses have arrived in Congo and the government's given only $10 million, according to the finance ministry. Most people with mild cases recover in less than two weeks. But lesions can get infected, and children or immunocompromised people are more prone to severe cases. Doctors can ensure lesions are clean and give pain medication or antibiotics for secondary infections such as sepsis. But those who recover can get the virus again. Lack of understanding Experts say a lack of resources and knowledge about the new strain makes it difficult to advise people on protecting themselves. An internal report circulated among aid groups and agencies and seen by AP labeled confidence in the available information about mpox in eastern Congo and neighboring countries low. While the variant is known to be more easily transmissible through sex, it's unclear how long the virus remains in the system. Doctors tell recovered patients to abstain from sex for three months, but acknowledge the number is largely arbitrary. 'Studies haven't clarified if you're still contagious or not ... if you can or can't have sex with your wife,' said Dr. Steven Bilembo, of Kamituga's general hospital. Doctors say they're seeing cases they simply don't understand, such as pregnant women losing babies. Of 32 pregnant women infected since January, nearly half lost the baby through miscarriage or stillbirth, hospital statistics show. Alice Neema was among them. From the hospital's isolation ward, she told AP she'd noticed lesions around her genitals and a fever — but didn't have enough money to travel the 30 miles (50 kilometers) on motorbike for help in time. She miscarried after her diagnosis. As information trickles in, locals say fear spreads alongside the new strain. Diego Nyago said he'd brought his 2-year-old son, Emile, in for circumcision when he developed a fever and lesions. It was mpox — and today, Nyago is grateful health care workers noticed his symptoms. 'I didn't believe that children could catch this disease,' he said as doctors gently poured water over the boy to bring his temperature down. 'Some children die quickly, because their families aren't informed. 'Those who die are the ones who stay at home.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-gold-mining-town-is-mpox-hot-spot-as-new-strain-spreads-/7790474.html	2024-09-19T07:33:25-07:00	
Kim calls for North Korea to bolster weapons after testing 2 missiles	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea said Thursday that leader Kim Jong Un supervised successful tests of two types of missiles — one designed to carry a 'super-large conventional warhead' and the other likely for a nuclear warhead, as he ordered officials to bolster his country's military capabilities to repel U.S.-led threats. The tests appear to be the same as the multiple missile launches that neighboring countries said North Korea performed Wednesday, extending its run of weapons displays as confrontations with the United States and South Korea escalate. The official Korean Central News Agency said that Kim oversaw the launch of the country's newly built Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 ballistic missile tipped with a dummy '4.5-ton super-large conventional warhead.' It said the test-firing was meant to verify an ability to accurately hit a 320 kilometer-range target, suggesting it's a weapon aimed at striking sites in South Korea. KCNA said Kim also guided the launch of an improved 'strategic' cruise missile, a word implying the weapon was developed to carry a nuclear warhead. After the tests, Kim stressed the need to continue to 'bolster up the nuclear force' and acquire 'overwhelming offensive capability in the field of conventional weapons, too,' according to KCNA. It cited Kim as saying that North Korea can thwart its enemies' intentions to invade only when it has strong military power. KCNA released photos of a missile hitting a ground target. South Korea's military said later Thursday it assessed that the ballistic and cruise missiles fired by North Korea the previous day landed in the North's mountainous northeastern region. North Korea typically test-launches missiles off its east coast, and it's highly unusual for the country to fire missiles at land targets, likely because of concerns about potential damage on the ground if the weapons land in unintended areas. Jung Chang Wook, head of the Korea Defense Study Forum think tank in Seoul, said North Korea likely aims to show it's confident about the accuracy of its new ballistic missile. Jung said the missile's high-powered warhead is meant to attack ground targets, but North Korea hasn't acquired weapons that can penetrate deep into the earth and destroy underground structures. The Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 missile's first known test occurred in early July. North Korea said the July test was successful as well, but South Korea's military disputed the claim saying one of the two missiles fired by North Korea travelled abnormally during the initial stage of its flight before falling at an uninhabited area near Pyongyang, the capital. North Korea hasn't released photos on the July launches. North Korea has been pushing to introduce a variety of sophisticated weapons systems designed to attack both South Korea and the mainland U.S. to deal with what it calls its rivals' intensifying security threats. Many foreign experts say North Korea would ultimately want to use its enlarged arsenal as leverage to win greater concessions in future dealings with the U.S. Worries about North Korea deepened last week as it disclosed photos of a secretive facility to enrich uranium for nuclear weapons. KCNA said that Kim, during a visit to the facility, called for stronger efforts to 'exponentially' produce more nuclear weapons. It was unclear whether the facility is at North Korea's main Yongbyon nuclear complex. But it was the North's first unveiling of a uranium-enrichment facility since it showed one at the country's main Yongbyon nuclear complex to visiting American scholars led by nuclear physicist Siegfried Hecker in 2010. In an analytical piece jointly written with another expert, Robert Carlin, that was posted Wednesday on North Korea-focused website 38 North, Hecker said the centrifuge hall shown in the recent North Korean photos was not the same one that he saw in November 2010. Hecker and Carlin said they believe the new centrifuges provide 'only a modest increased capacity,' although North Korea could increase enrichment capacity just by building more centrifuge plants. In another joint analysis also posted Friday on 38 North, other experts said that the centrifuges shown in the photos are not the ones observed by Hecker but a more advanced design. They said the images send 'a strong message that the country has ample capacity and continued will to expand its nuclear program.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-bolsters-weapons-after-testing-2-types-of-missiles/7790468.html	2024-09-19T07:16:20-07:00

Sweden charges woman with war crimes for allegedly torturing Yazidi women, children in Syria	Copenhagen, Denmark — Swedish authorities on Thursday charged a 52-year-old woman associated with the Islamic State group with genocide, crimes against humanity and serious war crimes against Yazidi women and children in Syria — in the first such case of a person to be tried in the Scandinavian country. Lina Laina Ishaq, who's a Swedish citizen, allegedly committed the crimes from August 2014 to December 2016, in Raqqa, the former de facto capital of the self-proclaimed IS caliphate and home to about 300,000 people. The crimes 'took place under IS rule in Raqqa, and this is the first time that IS attacks against the Yazidi minority have been tried in Sweden,' senior prosecutor Reena Devgun said in a statement. In a separate statement, the Stockholm District Court said the prosecutor claims the woman detained a number of women and children belonging to the Yazidi ethnic group in her residence in Raqqa, and 'allegedly exposed them to, among other things, severe suffering, torture or other inhumane treatment as well as for persecution by depriving them of fundamental rights for cultural, religious and gender reasons contrary to general international law.' According to the indictment, the aim was 'completely or partially annihilating the Yazidi ethnic group as such and were part of or otherwise related to an armed conflict,' the court said. In 2014, IS militants stormed Yazidi towns and villages in Iraq's Sinjar region and abducted women and children. Women were forced into sexual slavery, and boys were taken to be indoctrinated in jihadi ideology. The woman earlier had been convicted in Sweden and was sentenced to three years in prison, for taking her 2-year-old son to Syria in 2014, in an area that was then controlled by IS. The woman had claimed that she had told the child's father that she and the boy were only going on a holiday to Turkey. However, once in Turkey, the two crossed into Syria and the IS-run territory. In 2017, when the Islamic State's reign began to collapse, she fled from Raqqa and was captured by Syrian Kurdish troops. She managed to escape to Turkey where she was arrested with her son and two other children, she had given birth to in the meantime, with an IS foreign fighter from Tunisia. She was extradited from Turkey to Sweden. Before her 2021 conviction, the woman lived in the southern town of Landskrona. The court said the trial was planned to start Oct. 7 and last approximately two months. Large parts of the trial are to be held behind closed doors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-charges-woman-with-war-crimes-for-allegedly-torturing-yazidi-women-children-in-syria/7790388.html	2024-09-19T05:55:51-07:00	
Analysts: Completed Afghanistan-China road not yet ready for trade	Taliban officials in the northeastern province of Badakhshan announced the completion of a gravel road connecting Afghanistan to China early this year.

Congressional hearing: US should name more Americans as 'unjustly detained' in China	Washington — A hearing to seek the release of imprisoned Americans in Beijing highlighted reasons for the U.S. to expand its list of U.S. citizens wrongly detained in China to prioritize their return. Members of Congress and witnesses argued at a congressional hearing this week that the U.S. government should expand the list of Americans that it designates as being 'unjustly detained' in China. 'More Americans should be considered to be unjustly detained by the State Department,' Representative Chris Smith, the chair of the Congressional Executive Commission on China, said Wednesday in opening remarks at the CECC hearing. China is known for a justice system lacking transparency and arbitrarily detaining foreigners as well as its own citizens. The State Department officially had three Americans listed as unjustly detained in China including American Pastor David Lin, who has now been released by Beijing, the State Department announced on Sunday. The other two are Kai Li and Mark Swidan. Li, a businessman from Long Island, was detained by China in 2016 and sentenced to 10 years in prison in 2018 for espionage, which his family denies. Swiden, a Texas businessman, was detained in 2012 and convicted on drug-related charges in 2019. His supporters say there is evidence he was not in China at the time of the alleged offense. Although estimates vary, human rights organizations assess that more U.S. citizens are wrongly detained in China. Dui Hua, a human rights group that advocates for clemency and better treatment of detainees in China, doubts about 200 Americans who are held under coercive measures in China and more than 30 who are barred from leaving the country. The James W. Foley Legacy Foundation, a group that seeks to free Americans held captive abroad, estimates that 11 U.S. nationals are wrongfully detained in China, including those subject to exit bans. In the opening statement of his testimony, Nelson Wells, the father of detained American citizen Nelson Wells, Jr., lamented that 'Nelson is not considered a political prisoner or held unjust' by the State Department. Later, he added, 'We tried to get Nelson’s name included' in the list and expressed his hope that the hearing will pave the way. Nelson Wells, Jr., from New Orleans, was arrested in 2014 in China and sentenced to life on drug-related charges, which his family denies. His term was reduced to 22 years in 2019, and he will remain in prison until 2041. The U.S. determines whether its citizens are detained 'unlawfully or wrongfully' by either 'a foreign government or a non-governmental actor' based on criteria set by the Levinson Act signed into law in 2020. Such criteria 'can include, but is not limited to, a review of whether the individual is being detained to influence U.S. policy, whether there is a lack of due process or disparate sentencing for the individuals, and whether the person is being detained due to their U.S. connections, among other criteria,' said a spokesperson for the State Department in a statement to VOA Korean on Tuesday. 'The Secretary of State has ultimate authority to determine whether a case is a wrongful detention. This determination is discretionary, based on the totality of the circumstances, and grounded in the facts of the case. We do not discuss the wrongful detention determination process in public,' the spokesperson continued. A spokesperson for the Foley Foundation told VOA that it believes 11 Americans currently detained in China meet 'the criteria for wrongful detention, as specified in Levinson Act.' Its report, published in July, says China 'remains the leading country in wrongfully detaining U.S. nationals,' based on the data collected by the Foley Foundation in the period from 2022 to 2024. Sophie Richardson, a visiting scholar at Stanford University’s Center on Democracy, Development, and the Rule of Law, told VOA China’s practice of arbitrary detention is harmful to its culture and economy. 'It’s a big part of what is deterring people from going to the country,' including students who are interested in studying Chinese as well as business executives who are 'concerned they might run afoul of certain kinds of data regulations and [be] arbitrarily detained,' said Richardson, a former China director at Human Rights Watch. A record number of approximately 15,200 high-net worth individuals are expected to leave China in 2024, according to New World Wealth, a wealth intelligence firm, cited by the Henley Private Wealth Migration Report. Harrison Li, the son of Kai Li, said, 'The Chinese government clearly wants more Americans to travel to China, but as long as our loved ones are being held, as long as there are so many people at risk, then that travel warning must be escalated.' The State Department currently advises Americans to 'reconsider' traveling to the country 'due to the arbitrary enforcement of local laws,' including exit bans and wrongful detention. The next level of advisory would say 'do not travel.' Bob Fu, the founder and president of China Aid, a human rights group that advocates for religious freedom, told VOA that 'increasing international isolation' felt by the Chinese Communist Party could have led it to the release of David Lin. He said the prospect for the release of other Americans would depend on 'how much persistent pressure from the highest level of the U.S. government' is exerted on Beijing. The State Department spokesperson told VOA Korean that the U.S. has raised the case of 'other wrongfully detained Americans' in addition to David Lin and will 'continue to push for the release of other Americans.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/congressional-hearing-us-should-name-more-americans-as-unjustly-detained-in-china/7790352.html	2024-09-19T05:32:38-07:00

Calls for better preparedness in Vietnam after Typhoon Yagi	HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM — Typhoon Yagi, which hit Vietnam earlier this month, exposed the country's lack of preparedness for extreme weather and raised concerns more storms could hit the country this rainy season, experts told VOA. The storm hit northern Vietnam September 7. It resulted in 292 deaths. Thirty-eight people remain missing and over 73,000 homes have been flooded, authorities say. In northwestern Lao Cai province, an entire hamlet was swept away in a landslide on September 12, killing 30 people, while dozens are still missing. Presiding over a conference on the aftermath of the typhoon this week, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh honed in on the need for accurate forecasting, timely communication and swift, effective decision-making. 'We have tried our best. We've sought the best solutions available in these circumstances, but no loss can compensate for the lives lost and the suffering of the people,' he said September 15. A 33-year-old Lao Cai schoolteacher called the storm's impact on his community devastating. 'My colleagues’ houses collapsed and their furniture floated away. Three or four of my students have family members who died from the landslide. Other students’ houses got flooded,' he told VOA in Vietnamese on September 18, asking to withhold his name due to the sensitivity of speaking to the media. 'After the flood receded, the mud was up to my chest,' he said. The Natural Resources and Environment Ministry said Sunday that northern and north-central Vietnam may face one or two more typhoons before the end of September and there's still danger of landslides. 'Even as rains subside, landslide risks remain high, especially on the slopes of mountainous regions in the north,' the ministry stated. With heavy rains and rising water levels in the upper Mekong region, Vietnam's Southern Institute for Water Resources Planning issued a flood warning Monday for low-lying and riverside areas in the southern provinces of An Giang, Dong Thap, and Long An. Brian Eyler, director of the Stimson Center's Southeast Asia Program in Washington and co-lead of the Mekong Dam Monitor, warned that the country will face more extreme weather. 'Storms like Yagi will only become more frequent. It's also possible that another one, two, or three will happen this wet season,' he told VOA by phone September 13. 'Communities are still not ready and it is the responsibility of governments or international aid organizations to help these communities to better prepare,' he said. Unprepared Despite more than a week of advance warning, locals were poorly prepared for the typhoon, Eyler said. 'Communities were not prepared for this and neither were government response mechanisms in any of the countries that were impacted,' he said. Eyler saw on social media that people were on boats in Halong Bay in northern Vietnam during the storm, people were standing next to glass windows and doors that could easily swing open, and in China, people stood in line at amusement parks during the storm. 'There's a large gap in emergency early-warning messaging from the government and then just a general lack of preparedness about what one should do as an individual during a time of extreme crisis,' Eyler said. The Lao Cai teacher said people in his town had been warned about the incoming typhoon but did not expect the severity of the storm. 'There was notice but the damage was not completely avoided,' he said. 'We did not predict such a strong storm. There has never been such a strong storm.' Vulnerable hit hardest Eyler said that during a climate change-intensified disaster like Typhoon Yagi, the effects are 'amplified much more on the poorer and vulnerable people.' 'Those who were killed or those who were injured were out and about during the storm,' he said. 'They couldn't afford to stop what they are doing because they need to carry on their livelihoods.' Mimi Vu, a Ho Chi Minh City-based migration and trafficking expert, said that people who depend on day-to-day earnings are at greatest risk. 'For them to stop working means that they're not able to put food on the table,' she said by phone Wednesday. 'It's a matter of survival for a lot of them and they're willing to take the risk or to support their families.' Vu said efforts to fight global warming are going too slowly to keep up with the needs of many affected by extreme weather. 'We're trying to reduce greenhouse gas emissions… but it's not happening fast enough and by enough influential entities to make a difference right now,' she said. We need to help 'these underserved communities prepare for the worst that's coming,' she added. 'Efforts have to be increased now in changing the way we live and operate in the world so that we can lessen the impact.' A woman in her 30s in Bac Giang province told VOA she is helping to get necessities to people in Van Ha commune, a village in the Viet Yen district of Bac Giang, which has been isolated by floods and without power for a week. 'I work for the government and we are helping the people here,' she said in Vietnamese on September 14, asking to withhold her name. 'My duty is supporting other relief groups such as how to get into the village and how to transport food and goods.' Eyler said that governments need to increase data sharing to mitigate the impact of natural disasters and upstream dams in China and the damming of Southeast Asia's river systems more broadly increase the dangers of storms. 'The uses of dams are often described as having the potential for flood control but when these major events happen like this I think the myth of dams as flood control really comes undone,' he said. '[Dams] exacerbate risks for vulnerable communities downstream.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/calls-for-better-preparedness-in-vietnam-after-typhoon-yagi/7790258.html	2024-09-19T03:20:37-07:00

Baby hippo Moo Deng becomes internet sensation	CHONBURI, Thailand — Only a month after Thailand's adorable baby hippo Moo Deng was unveiled on Facebook, her fame became unstoppable both domestically and internationally. Zookeeper Atthapon Nundee has been posting cute moments of the animals in his care for about five years. He never imagined Khao Kheow Open Zoo's newborn pygmy hippo would become an internet megastar within weeks. Cars started lining up outside the zoo well before it opened Thursday. Visitors traveled from near and far for a chance to see the pudgy, expressive 2-month-old in person at the zoo about 100 kilometers southeast of Bangkok. The pit where Moo Deng lives with her mom, Jona, was packed almost immediately, with people cooing and cheering every time the pink-cheeked baby animal made skittish movements. 'It was beyond expectation,' Atthapon told The Associated Press. 'I wanted people to know her. I wanted a lot of people to visit her, or watch her online, or leave fun comments. I never would’ve thought (of this).' Moo Deng, which literally means 'bouncy pork' in Thai, is a type of meatball. The name was chosen by fans via a poll on social media, and it matches her other siblings: Moo Toon (stewed pork) and Moo Waan (sweet pork). There is also a common hippo at the zoo named Kha Moo (stewed pork leg). 'She’s such a little lump. I want to ball her up and swallow her whole!' said Moo Deng fan Areeya Sripanya while visiting the zoo Thursday. Already, Moo Deng has been made into memes. Artists are drawing cartoons based on her. Social media platform X even featured her in its official account’s post. With all that fame, zoo director Narongwit Chodchoi said they have begun patenting and trademarking 'Moo Deng the hippo' to prevent the animal from being commercialized by anyone else. 'After we do this, we will have more income to support activities that will make the animals’ lives better,' he said. 'The benefits we get will return to the zoo to improve the life of all animals here.' The zoo sits on 800 hectares of land and is home to more than 2,000 animals. It runs breeder programs for many endangered species like Moo Deng's. The pygmy hippopotamus that's native to West Africa is threatened by poaching and loss of habitat. There are only 2,000-3,000 of them left in the wild. To help fund the initiative, the zoo is making Moo Deng shirts and pants that will be ready for sale at the end of the month, with more merchandise to come. Narongwit believes a factor of Moo Deng's fame is her name, which compliments her energetic and chaotic personality captured in Atthapon's creative captions and video clips. Appropriately, Moo Deng likes to 'deng,' or bounce, and Atthapon got a lot of cute and funny moments of her giddy bouncing on social media. Even when she's not bouncing, the hippo is endlessly cute — squirming as Atthapon tries to wash her, biting him while he was trying to play with her, calmly closing her eyes as he rubs her pinkish cheeks or her chubby belly. Atthapon, who has worked at the zoo for eight years taking care of hippos, sloths, capybaras and binturongs, said baby hippos are usually more playful and energetic, and they become calmer as they get older. The zoo saw a spike in visitors since Moo Deng’s fame — so much that the zoo now has to limit public access to the baby's enclosure to five-minute windows throughout the day during weekends. Narongwit said the zoo has been receiving over 4,000 visitors during a weekday, up from around just 800 people, and more than 10,000 during a weekend, up from around 3,000 people. But the fame has also brought some hostile visitors to Moo Deng, who only wakes up ready to play about two hours a day. Some videos showed visitors splashing water or throwing things at the sleeping Moo Deng to try to wake her up. The hippo pit now has a warning sign against throwing things at Moo Deng — posted prominently at the front in Thai, English and Chinese. Narongwit said the zoo would take action under the animal protection law if people mistreat the animal. But clips emerged of people treating Moo Deng poorly, and the backlash was fierce. The zoo director said that since then, they haven’t seen anyone doing it again. For fans who can't make the journey or are discouraged after seeing the crowds for Moo Deng, the Khao Kheow Open Zoo set up cameras and plan to start a 24-hour live feed of the baby hippo in the coming week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/baby-hippo-moo-deng-becomes-internet-sensation/7790233.html	2024-09-19T02:52:14-07:00	
Amid economic distress, Sri Lankans seek change through coming election	NEW DELHI — Two years after massive popular protests in Sri Lanka ousted former president Gotabaya Rajapaksa at the height of a crushing economic downturn, millions in the island nation will head to the polls Saturday to choose a new president. The rallying cry at the protest movement, called 'aragalaya,' or struggle, was for an overhaul of the political establishment that many perceived as corrupt. That anger, which continues to fester, along with economic hardship that millions suffer will influence the vote, according to political analysts. 'They want a change of the system. That means that they don’t want the old ways where there was no transparency, no accountability,' Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu, executive director of the Center for Policy Alternatives in Colombo told VOA. 'They want an alleviation of the economic hardship they are suffering.' As they seek to usher in change, the island nation’s 17 million voters will choose among three main contenders. President Ranil Wickremesinghe, who was elected by Parliament to the top post after Rajapaksa’s exit, is running as an independent candidate. His main challengers are opposition leader Sajith Premadasa and the leader of a Marxist-led alliance, Anura Kumara Dissanayake. Wickremesinghe is wooing voters with the promise of building on the country’s fragile economic recovery that he has steered. He secured a nearly $3 billion International Monetary Fund bailout, which pulled Sri Lanka back from the brink of bankruptcy, eased severe shortages of food and fuel and lowered runaway inflation. 'Like the Titanic, Sri Lanka could have sunk,' Wickremesinghe told a rally. 'There was no captain. I took responsibility for the ship.' Political analysts say he is attracting the support of people who respect him for restoring stability. 'There are those who believe that he has gone to the IMF, he has got a deal with them and that we should continue with him to get out of the terrible mess that we got ourselves in and then start to rebuild again.' Saravanamuttu said. However, people still cope with massive economic woes. Wickremesinghe slashed subsidies and imposed higher taxes as part of IMF austerity measures, which are hurting millions. Living costs have surged while incomes have stagnated. At least a quarter of the country's 20 million people are reeling under poverty. Some also see Wickremesinghe as a part of the 'old political guard' which protesters sought to overthrow. He has been accused of protecting the Rajapaksa political family and shielding them from prosecution. Tough measures he took to curb protests, including drafting new security laws, angered many. 'I am voting for systematic change, not just a change of faces or end of the political elite that have run this country to the ground,' said Marisa De Silva, an activist in Colombo who took part in the 2022 protests. 'We are proposing socialist policy changes for real change.' That deep discontent has catapulted left-wing leader Dissanayake, popularly known as AKD, from the margins to the center stage of the political race. A fiery orator, his rallies have attracted huge crowds as he taps into the anger among many voters. He has vowed to work toward ensuring that the rich pay more taxes under the IMF restructuring plan. There are no reliable polls, but he is seen as a frontrunner in the race. The National People’s Power alliance he heads is made up of different groups that include political parties, youth, civil society, women’s groups and trade unions. It is centered on the working class. 'They have never really been in power themselves, so they are presenting themselves as the party that can come in and sweep out the old guys, particularly corruption which is a big problem in Sri Lanka and which many blame for the current crisis,' Alan Keenan, a senior consultant on Sri Lanka at the International Crisis Group, told VOA, 'So he is seen as the big change agent,' he added. Opposition leader Premadasa, who also pledges to ease the burden on ordinary citizens, is also a strong contender. He wants to steer a middle path between the status quo and the radical change that Dissanayake wants to usher in. Another candidate is Namal Rajapaksa, the nephew of Gotabaya Rajapaksa, who was president when protesters stormed the presidential palace in 2022 after the economy collapsed. His father, Mahinda Rajapaksa, was also a former president. The Rajapaksas are widely blamed for the country’s financial mismanagement. Although Namal Rajapaksa is not a serious contender for power, his candidacy is a bid by the once-powerful political dynasty to win back their base, according to analysts. A significant number of people who until recently had not decided whom to vote for has made it hard to forecast the election. 'The question is do voters want a radical change with someone who is untested, do they want to stick with the current program, which is painful but perhaps might lead somewhere eventually, or do they go want to go with someone who is critical of the current approach but not quite as radical as Dissanayake?' asked Keenan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-economic-distress-sri-lankans-seek-change-through-coming-election/7790234.html	2024-09-19T02:46:42-07:00	
Far-right's fate in German regional vote could break Scholz -- or remake him	berlin — Weeks after topping a state vote for the first time and nearly winning another, Germany's far-right is taking aim at Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) in another regional election that could shape his political future. Sunday's tight-looking vote in Brandenburg, the swampy lakeland round the capital Berlin, takes place in a region the SPD has ruled since reunification more than three decades ago. The Alternative for Germany (AfD), with its nationalist demands for halts to immigration, windfarm construction and arming Ukraine, has a narrow roughly three-point lead in polls with nearly 30% of voting intentions. The SPD has been battered by the federal government's unpopularity amid high inflation, the Ukraine war impact and high migrant influxes, but it has closed the gap recently in Brandenburg polling. 'Brandenburg is historically an SPD stronghold,' said Philipp Thomeczek, politics professor at Potsdam University. 'If they don't win here that would be a massive break.' Coming a year ahead of a national election, the vote could trigger a party backlash against Scholz or, if the SPD holds the state, confirm him as their candidate for 2025. His conservative opponents are far ahead with their bloc commanding around a third of the vote in most nationwide polls, while the SPD and AfD vie for a distant second. The conservatives this week settled on their chancellor candidate for next year: Friedrich Merz, a sharp-tongued arch-conservative. But Scholz and many Social Democrats believe the gaffe-prone Merz's low personal popularity gives them a chance. Though none will yet say it openly, some in Scholz's party believe he should follow his idol Joe Biden and step aside for a more charismatic champion like defense minister Boris Pistorius. But a win in Scholz's home state -- his constituency is in the state capital Potsdam and his wife is a Brandenburg minister -- may quell the murmurs against him. The party has made barely any mention of Scholz in the campaign, relying instead on the popularity of state premier Dietmar Woidke, a trained food chemist. He said that if the AfD wins most votes he would step aside and not even offer himself as a candidate to lead any potential coalition. 'The aim is to stop the AfD from winning,' he said. 'Mordor' windmills Unable to form a coalition despite winning most votes in Thuringia state earlier this month, the AfD has almost no chance of forming a regional or federal government given every other party refuses to work with a movement security services class as extremist. The AfD has faced -- and denies -- accusations of racism and of harboring agents for China and Russia. Brandenburg presents a mixed economic picture: it is home to Tesla's first factory in Europe and has wealthy parts within the Berlin commuter belt. But some of its outlying villages and farmscapes have been shrinking for decades. As well as concern over Ukraine and migration, the AfD has channeled public anxiety over energy transition: its state head Hans-Christoph Berndt likened windfarms to 'unbearable horror landscapes like Mordor,' the fictional land of evil. He provoked mockery -- but also some approval -- when in one debate he reinterpreted religious doctrine to say: 'As a Catholic I think loving your neighbor means looking out for your own countrymen.' Should the SPD struggle on Sunday, that could open the way for Merz's Christian Democrats to form a coalition in Brandenburg, perhaps with the backing of a new party, the socially conservative, economically left Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance, and others. Unseating the SPD in its stronghold would be a boost for Merz, fresh from his anointment, and could tip an already restive SPD into open revolt against the chancellor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/far-right-s-fate-in-german-regional-vote-could-break-scholz----or-remake-him/7790224.html	2024-09-19T02:15:11-07:00	
Cuban dissident leader wins Norwegian human rights award	OSLO, Norway — A Norwegian human rights foundation gave its annual prize on Thursday to jailed Cuban dissident leader Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara for his 'fearless opposition to authoritarianism through art.' Four past laureates of the Rafto prize — Myanmar's Aung San Suu Kyi, East Timor's Jose Ramos-Horta, South Korea's Kim Dae-jung and Iran's Shirin Ebadi — later went on to win the Nobel Peace Prize. This year's Peace Prize will be announced on Oct. 11 in Oslo. 'The 2024 Rafto prize aims to highlight the importance of the work of Luis Manuel Otero Alcantara and other artists in challenging power structures and defending democracy and human rights, both in Cuba and globally,' the Norwegian foundation said in a statement. A Cuban court sentenced the artist-dissident in 2022 to five years in jail in a high-profile case that human rights groups branded a 'farce' but that Cuban state media said was a fair trial over 'common crimes.' The 36-year-old artist was a prominent member of the Havana-based San Isidro Movement, an artists collective that led a number of protests over two years. Many of the group have since left Cuba, alleging government repression. On Thursday, the Rafto foundation called on the Cuban government to release him, joining similar calls by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International. The laureate is awarded a diploma and prize money of $20,000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cuban-dissident-leader-wins-norwegian-human-rights-award/7790222.html	2024-09-19T01:43:47-07:00	
Thailand pushing for talks to repair key Myanmar highway	Bangkok — Thailand wants to work with warring sides in Myanmar to repair a key highway cutting through the conflict-ridden country as it seeks to stabilise borders areas and keep trade routes open, Thai Foreign Minister Maris Sangiampongsa said on Thursday. Thailand has the support of the ASEAN regional bloc and India in the push to rebuild parts of the Asian Highway 1 (AH-1) that has been damaged by recent fighting, he told reporters. Laos, the current chair of the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has also asked Thailand to host a regional meeting on Myanmar before the end of the year, he said, without providing further details. 'I don't think Myanmar problems can be addressed militarily, but through constructive dialogue,' Maris said. Myanmar has been in turmoil since February 2021, when its powerful generals ousted an elected civilian government, triggering a protest movement that has morphed into an armed rebellion against the ruling junta. The military government has lost control of swathes of the country and the economy has been crippled. ASEAN has barred the generals from attending its summits until progress is achieved on a 2021 peace plan devised by the bloc, which the junta agreed to but has failed to follow. That agreement includes dialogue between all sides in the conflict. An important trade route, the AH1 stretches more than 1,500 km (932 miles) from Myawaddy on the Thai-Myanmar frontier to Tamu on Myanmar's border with India. The area around Myawaddy, previously a conduit for more than $1 billion of annual border trade, saw fierce fighting earlier this year as rebel fighters pushed the junta out of the frontier town.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-pushing-for-talks-to-repair-key-myanmar-highway/7790194.html	2024-09-18T23:35:30-07:00

Crisis-hit Sri Lanka's poor hope new president will change their fortunes	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lankan housewife Lankika Dilrukshi says she is tired of the daily struggle needed to provide for her children. On Saturday, she is voting in a presidential poll she sees as key to securing a better future for herself, and her nation. Dilrukshi, 31, is one of the millions of people barely able to make ends meet since the island nation's economy in 2022 plunged into its worst financial crisis in decades. 'Life has become so difficult, we need change,' she said. 'We need a leader who will work for the poor.' The economic recovery is at the core of the three-way election battle between President Ranil Wickremesinghe, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, and Marxist-leaning politician Anura Kumara Dissanayake. The three are frontrunners and have promised new strategies to rescue the economy, lower taxes and support businesses. Sri Lanka's poor and middle class want an equitable economic recovery that will support their aspirations, said Umesh Moramudali, who teaches economics at the University of Colombo. 'The poor are really, really struggling,’’ Moramudali said. ‘’Higher prices hurt them most, especially higher food prices.' Although inflation cooled to 0.5% last month and GDP is forecast to grow 3% in 2024, for the first time in three years, the change is slow and yet to trickle down. Sri Lankans were hit hard by the 2022 economic crisis, which was triggered by a severe shortfall of foreign currency that added to problems caused by the pandemic. Inflation soared to 70%, the rupee depreciated 45% and the economy shrank by 7.3%, forcing the government to seek an International Monetary Fund bailout. The latest government data shows that in 2023, 7 million people - almost one-third of the total population - were considered poor. By mid-2023, about nearly half of all families had limited their food intake, data from 10,000 households gathered by Colombo think tank LIRNEasia showed. Rising food insecurity also led to malnutrition in children, with the number of those with stunted growth increasing to over 17% in 2023 from 12% in 2021. Burdened by new taxes and fewer high-earning jobs, migration has skyrocketed. More than 600,000 people left the country for work over the last two years, compared to 122,264 in 2021, according to government data. Fruit seller Nancy Hemalatha, 61, borrowed $495 to fund her business, and says she barely has $6.50 left every day after repaying the loan. 'My two youngest sons want to migrate. That is their focus now,' Hemalatha said. As for housewife Dilrukshi, whose laborer husband earns about $8 daily, frugality is the only way to survive. She keeps poultry and fish out of meals to funnel funds towards her 13-year-old daughter's education and borrows small amounts from neighbors. 'I want everyone to have a better future...so that my daughter can become a doctor,' she said. 'That is what I want to see happen.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/crisis-hit-sri-lanka-s-poor-hope-new-president-will-change-their-fortunes/7790183.html	2024-09-18T23:12:30-07:00	
Airbus investing in Chinese firm that supplies Myanmar military: report	BANGKOK — A new report from Burmese activist groups is calling on French-based airline manufacturer Airbus to use its influence with Aviation Industry Corporation of China, or AVIC, to pressure the Chinese firm to end its arms sales to the Myanmar junta. AVIC is one of the world’s biggest defense contractors, and the Chinese aviation firm supplies aircraft and weapons to Myanmar’s military junta that are being used in airstrikes in the war-torn country. The report, which was released Monday, says Airbus has not only maintained but increased investment in companies controlled by the Chinese firm. According to the report, Airbus is 'heavily' invested in AVIC’s Hong Kong-listed holding company, AviChina, a strategic partner of AVIC China. An Airbus spokesperson denies allegations that the company could be in violation of international sanctions. In its report titled #AIRBUSTED How Airbus’ close partner AVIC is supplying arms to the Myanmar military and what Airbus should do about it, Justice for Myanmar, and Info Birmanie, a non-profit organization in Paris that focuses on Myanmar, say they have uncovered evidence that AVIC is continuing to supply aircraft and weapons to the Myanmar military, which they say have been used to commit war crimes throughout the country. The report’s authors have called on Airbus to 'use its leverage over AVIC and its subsidiaries so they halt all ongoing and planned transfers of military aircraft, arms and associated equipment to the Myanmar military,' as well as maintenance, training and technical support for the country’s air force. 'Because of these known risks, Airbus should conduct heightened due diligence on any current and future partnerships with AVIC and its subsidiaries and make that due diligence public,' the report said. The report also called on Airbus to divest and end its relationship with AVIC if the company refuses to end its relationship and all business with Myanmar’s military. Philippe Gmerek, a spokesperson for Airbus, told VOA in an email that the French airline manufacturer is compliant with sanctions on Myanmar and within international law with its relationship with AVIC. 'Airbus has not supplied defence products to Myanmar or its armed forces. Airbus is committed to conducting its business ethically and in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. This includes the delivery of defence products in accordance with export control laws and in full transparency and alignment with authorities and relevant stakeholders,' Gmerek said in the emailed statement. He added that 'Airbus' relationship with Chinese companies, including AVIC, is fully compliant with all European and international laws and regulations, notably with regards to the existing arms embargo on China. As such, Airbus' industrial and technology partnerships in China are exclusively focused on civil aerospace and services.' AVIC, one of the world’s largest military contractors, has been under U.S. sanctions since 2020 and is listed by Washington as a potential national security threat because of its links to the Chinese military. Those sanctions prohibit any American organization or individuals from dealing with firms that have links to the Chinese PLA. Myanmar has been in chaos since military leader General Min Aung Hlaing and his military forces overthrew the democratically elected government in February 2021. The coup sparked widespread armed resistance to military rule, led by ethnic armed groups and forces loyal to a civilian-led shadow government. Upwards of 5,600 people have been killed by the military and millions displaced since the coup, according to rights groups. In a joint statement at the U.N. Security Council in February, France joined Britain, Ecuador, Japan, Malta, South Korea, Slovenia, Switzerland and the United States in strongly condemning the military’s violent attacks on civilians in Myanmar, including its 'continued use of indiscriminate airstrikes.' The governments of France, Germany and Spain all hold major shares in Airbus through holding companies. VOA reached out to Christian Lechervy, France’s ambassador to Myanmar, and AVIC for comment but has yet to receive a reply. Johanna Chardonnieras, coordinator for Info Burmie, said the French government, among others, should act. 'The French, Spanish and German governments have a responsibility and a duty to act when Airbus’ partner and investee is linked to war crimes,' Chardonnieras said. 'Today they have the opportunity to show their capacity for action, in line with their statements, values and sanctions.' Yadanar Maung, the Justice for Myanmar spokesperson, called for the U.S. to take action should Airbus continue its business ties with AVIC. 'We call on the U.S. government to conduct due diligence on any business activities and links it currently has with Airbus and encourage U.S. citizens and entities to do the same. Airbus' decision to continue its business relationship with AviChina should be subject to consequences, including restricting market opportunities in the U.S.,' she told VOA. Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington who focuses on Southeast Asia politics and security, says the report could tarnish Airbus’ reputation, though it is unclear how much of an impact it could have beyond that. 'Airbus will obviously try to make the case that they only partner with AVIC in the commercial aircraft, but obviously there’s a lot of dual use technology,' Abuza said. 'The biggest hit to the firm is reputational damage. I am not sure Myanmar is a large enough issue, or it’s a priority for European leaders, or there’s a significant and politically powerful diaspora to demand changes,' he told VOA. The U.S., Canada, Britain and the EU have all imposed a variety of sanctions on Myanmar’s military regime and its entities in recent years in a bid to end its violent crackdown.	https://www.voanews.com/a/airbus-investing-in-chinese-firm-that-supplies-myanmar-military-report/7790180.html	2024-09-18T22:52:22-07:00	
Haitian American news site faces harassment over post-debate Ohio coverage	NEW YORK — Journalists at a news site that covers the Haitian community in the United States say they've been harassed and intimidated with racist messages for covering a fake story about immigrants eating the pets of people in an Ohio town. One editor at the Haitian Times, a 25-year-old online publication, was 'swatted' this week with police turning up at her home to investigate a false report of a gruesome crime. The news site canceled a community forum it had planned for Springfield, Ohio, and has shut down public comments on its stories about the issue because of threats and vile posts. The Times, which had the Committee to Protect Journalists conduct safety training for its journalists in Haiti, has now asked for advice on how to protect staff in the United States, said Garry Pierre-Pierre, founder and publisher. 'We've never faced anything like this,' Pierre-Pierre said Wednesday. Site says it isn't backing down The Times has debunked and aggressively covered the aftermath of the story about immigrants supposedly eating the dogs and cats of other Springfield residents, as it was spread by Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Donald Trump's Republican running mate in the presidential election, and Trump himself in his debate with Democrat Kamala Harris. Despite receiving hundreds of these messages, the site isn't backing down, said Pierre-Pierre, a former reporter at The New York Times who echoed a mission statement from his old employer in making that promise. 'We do not want to hibernate,' he said. 'We're taking the precautions that are necessary. But our first duty is to tell the truth without fear or favor, and we have no fear.' Pierre-Pierre, who emigrated to the United States in 1975, started the Haitian Times to cover issues involving first- and second-generation Haitians in the United States, along with reporting on what is happening in their ancestral home. It started as a print publication that went online only in 2012 and now averages 10,000 to 15,000 visitors a day, although its readership has expanded in recent weeks. Macollvie Neel, the New York-based special projects editor, was the staff member who had police officers show up at her doorstep on Monday. It was triggered when a Haitian advocacy group received an email about a crime at Neel's address. They, in turn, notified police who showed up to investigate. Not only did the instigators know where Neel lived, they covered their tracks by funneling the report through another organization, she said. Neel said she had a feeling something like this might happen, based on hateful messages she received. But it's still intimidating, made more so because the police who responded were not aware of the concept of doxxing, or tracing people online for the purpose of harassment. She said police searched her home and left. She was always aware that journalism, by its nature, can make people unhappy with you. This takes the threat to an entirely new level. Racist hate groups who are ready to seize on any issue are sophisticated and well-funded, she said. 'This is a new form of domestic terrorism,' she said, 'and we have to treat it as such.' 'It’s outrageous’ Katherine Jacobsen, the Committee to Protect Journalists' U.S., Canada and Caribbean program coordinator, said it's a particularly acute case of journalists being harassed in retaliation for their coverage of a story. 'It's outrageous,' she said. 'We should not be having this conversation. Yet we are.' Even before Springfield received national attention in recent weeks, the Haitian Times had been covering the influx of immigrants to the Midwest in search of jobs and a lower cost of living, Pierre-Pierre said. A story currently on its site about Springfield details how the furor 'reflects America's age-old battle with newcomers it desperately needs to survive.' Another article on the site talks about the NAACP, Haitian American groups and other activists from across the country coming to the aid of Springfield residents caught in the middle of the story. Similarly, the Times has heard from several other journalists — including from Pierre-Pierre's old employer — who have offered support. 'I'm deeply touched,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haitian-american-news-site-faces-harassment-over-post-debate-ohio-coverage/7790172.html	2024-09-18T22:33:02-07:00

North Korea tests new ballistic missiles with super-large warhead, KCNA says	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea tested new tactical ballistic missiles using super-large warheads and modified cruise missiles on Wednesday as leader Kim Jong Un called for stronger conventional weapons and nuclear capabilities, state news agency KCNA reported. The tests to improve weapons capabilities are required because of the grave threat posed by outside forces to the security of the country, Kim, who led the tests, was quoted as saying. The account followed the firing of multiple short-range ballistic missiles on Wednesday reported by the South Korean military, which was the second time the North test-launched missiles in a week. Last week, North Korea also unveiled a uranium enrichment facility, in its first such public report. Kim stressed 'the need to continue to bolster the nuclear force and have the strongest military technical capability and overwhelming offensive capability in the field of conventional weapons too,' KCNA said. Wednesday's tests involved the new tactical ballistic Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 missiles, KCNA said, indicating it was part of a series of short-range ballistic missiles it had been developing. The missile was mounted with a 4.5-ton super-large conventional warhead, KCNA said. North Korea's state media reported the tests of missiles with the same name in July, which was considered a partial success. On Thursday, state media released photographs of a projectile striking a target in a hilly area. South Korea's military said on Thursday two ballistic missiles landed in a mountainous area in the North's northeast. Such a missile launch test with an intention to hit an inland target is likely unprecedented, said Shin Seung-ki, who is the head of research on North Korea's military at the state-run Korea Institute for Defense Analyses in Seoul. North Korea routinely test-launches missiles to drop in the sea or on an uninhabited island. The particular missile with the Hwasongpho-11-Da-4.5 designation is still under development but Russia may want it soon if its performance and reliability can be guaranteed through further testing, Shin said. 'North Korea will want to shorten that time as much as possible,' he said. Kyiv officials and independent experts have said there were signs some of the missiles used by Russia in the war against Ukraine were North Korean-made, including some that were produced this year. Moscow and Pyongyang both deny any illicit arms trade or shipments. The North's military also tested a strategic cruise missile that has been upgraded for combat use, KCNA said. North Korea has criticized military drills by the South Korean and U.S. militaries, including a large-scale exercise conducted this summer, as preparations for war on the Korean peninsula. The allies say the drills are defensive in nature and aimed at maintaining readiness against any North Korean aggression.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-tests-new-ballistic-missiles-with-super-large-warhead-kcna-says/7790151.html	2024-09-18T20:57:32-07:00

Lawyers question if drugged French woman was unconscious, consented	AVIGNON, France — Lawyers for some of the men accused of raping an unconscious French woman who had been drugged by her husband questioned her Wednesday about her habits, personal life and sex life, and even questioned whether she was truly unconscious during the encounters. Gisèle Pelicot's testimony came a day after her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, told the court that for nearly 10 years, he drugged her and invited dozens of men to rape her as she lay defenseless. She fiercely rejected any suggestion that she was anything but an unwitting victim. 'Since I've arrived in this courtroom, I've felt humiliated. I am treated like an alcoholic, an accomplice. ... I have heard it all,' she said at the start of the day's proceedings, breaking at times with the remarkable calm and stoicism she has shown throughout the often harrowing trial that has gripped France. Gisèle Pelicot, who was married to her husband for 50 years and shares three children with him, has become a hero to many rape victims and a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France for waiving her anonymity in the case, letting the trial be public and appearing openly in front of the media. Her ex-husband and the 50 other men on trial, who range in age from 26 to 74, face up to 20 years in prison if convicted. Many of the defendants deny having raped Gisèle Pelicot. Some claim they were tricked by Dominique Pelicot, others say they believed she was consenting, and others argue that her husband's consent was sufficient. Gisèle Pelicot and her lawyers say the preponderance of evidence — thousands of videos and photos taken by her ex-husband of men having sex with her while she appeared to be unconscious — should be enough to prove she was a victim and was entirely unaware of what Dominique Pelicot was subjecting her to from at least 2011 until 2020. But on Wednesday, defense lawyers focused their questions on the notion of consent and whether she was aware of what was happening at any point during some of the 90 sexual encounters that prosecutors believe were rapes. 'Don't you have tendencies that you are not comfortable with?' one lawyer asked Gisèle Pelicot. 'I'm not even going to answer this question, which I find insulting,' she responded, her voice breaking. 'I understand why victims of rape don't press charges. We really spill everything out into the open to humiliate the victim.' Another lawyer asked whether she was indeed unconscious during one of the encounters captured on video. 'I didn't give my consent to Mr. Pelicot or these men behind me for one second,' she said, referring to her ex-husband's co-defendants. 'In the state I was in, I could not respond to anybody. I was in a state of coma — the videos will attest to it.' The line of questioning upset her. 'Since when can a man decide for his wife?' she said, stressing that only one of her ex-husband's 50 co-defendants had refused his invitation to rape her. That man met Dominique Pelicot online and invited him to rape his own wife, who was also drugged, authorities contend. 'What are these men? Are they degenerates?' she said angrily. 'They have committed rapes. That's all I have to say.' Another questioned the time and date stamps on the videos, and whether she thought the sexual acts lasted as long as the stamps suggested. 'Rape is not a question of time,' she said. 'To talk of minutes, seconds. ... It does not matter how long they spent. It's so degrading, humiliating what I am hearing in this room,' she said. At one point, Dominique Pelicot, who already said during the trial that all of the accusations against him are true, came out in support of his ex-wife, saying, 'Stop suspecting her all the time ...

Indian-controlled Kashmir sees brisk voting for local government	SRINAGAR, India — Voting in the first phase of a staggered election to choose a local government concluded Wednesday in Indian-controlled Kashmir, the first such vote since Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government stripped the disputed region of its special status five years ago. Turnout was about 59%, the region's chief electoral officer said in a statement, as voting was 'incident-free and peaceful.' Authorities had deployed thousands of additional police and paramilitary soldiers for security in the seven southern districts of the region, which has been roiled by an insurgency against Indian rule for decades. More than 2.3 million residents are eligible to vote to choose 24 lawmakers out of 219 candidates in the first phase of the election. Wearing riot gear and carrying assault rifles, troops set up checkpoints and patrolled constituencies as long lines of voters stretched around the polling booths. The second and third phases are scheduled for September 25 and October 1. The process is staggered for logistical reasons and to allow troops to move around to stop potential violence in the Himalayan region. For the first time, authorities limited access to polling stations for foreign media and denied press credentials to most journalists working with international media, including to The Associated Press, without citing any reason. India and Pakistan each administer part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi's rule since 1989. Most Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels' goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and most Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. The vote is the first in a decade, and the first since Modi's Hindu nationalist government in 2019 scrapped the Muslim-majority region's semi-autonomy, downgraded the former state to a federally governed territory and stripped its separate constitution and inherited protections on land and jobs. It was also divided into two federal territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir, ruled directly by New Delhi, allowing it to appoint administrators to run the territories along with unelected bureaucrats and security personnel. Many people said they knew their votes won't solve the dispute over Kashmir but provided a rare window to express their frustration with direct Indian control. Aamir Ahmed, a first-time voter in Pulwama town, said it was important to elect a local representative 'who does not condone wrongdoing.' 'We have witnessed a lot of suffering in the last 10 years,' Ahmed said. Another voter, 80-year-old farmer Ali Mohammad Alai, said he had been 'reduced to penury by the Modi government' after authorities took away his land given to him decades ago for cultivation by the local administration. 'All I want is to get that land back,' he said. 'Our own government can do that.' The multistage election will allow Kashmir to have its own truncated government and a local legislature, called an assembly, instead of remaining under New Delhi's direct rule. A chief minister will head a council of ministers in the government. However, there will be a limited transition of power from New Delhi to the local assembly as Kashmir will continue to be a 'Union Territory' — directly controlled by the federal government — with India's Parliament remaining its main legislator. The elected government will have partial control over areas like education, culture and taxation but not over the police. Kashmir's statehood must be restored for the new government to have powers similar to other states of India. Multiple local parties have campaigned on promises to fight for reversal of 2019 changes and address other key issues like rising unemployment and inflation in the region where locals have struggled amid curtailed civil liberties particularly after the revocation of the special status. India's ruling BJP, however, has vowed to block any move aimed at undoing those changes but promised to help in the region's economic development.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-controlled-kashmir-sees-brisk-voting-for-local-government/7790111.html	2024-09-18T19:06:12-07:00	
At least 12 soldiers killed in recent Niger attacks, army says	Niamey, Niger — A series of ambushes and explosions across military-run Niger killed at least 12 soldiers and wounded 30 others recently, the army announced on state-run television Wednesday. In the first attack, in western Tillaberi region on Sunday, 'a horde of criminals who arrived in their hundreds' killed five soldiers and wounded 25 more, according to the army. The ground and air response killed 'more than 100' attackers, the army said, without giving further details about them. On Monday, in the restive southwest Diffa region where there are frequent attacks by Boko Haram and the West African branch of the Islamic State group, five patrolling soldiers were killed by an improvised explosive device. A 'surgical strike' in retaliation 'killed several terrorists' responsible, the army said. In the latest attack, militants from a new resistance group called the Patriotic Movement for Freedom and Justice (MPLJ) claimed an operation against a military outpost in the Agadez region in the north. The army said two soldiers were killed and six wounded in Tuesday's attack. 'A pursuit operation was immediately launched to track down the fleeing assailants, who were heading for the Libyan border,' the army added. The MPLJ claimed to have killed 14 soldiers and two gendarmes in the attack, and to have lost two of its own fighters. Created in August, the MPLJ is an offshoot of the Patriotic Liberation Front (FPL) armed group, which is fighting the junta for the release of ousted President Mohamed Bazoum. Democratically elected Bazoum was overthrown in a coup in July 2023 and has since then been held at the presidential palace. While the military justified its power grab by citing the deteriorating security situation, violence persists. According to the independent Armed Conflict Location and Event Data project, about 1,500 civilians and soldiers in Niger have been killed in militant attacks over the past year, compared with 650 between July 2022 and 2023 when Bazoum was in charge.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-12-soldiers-killed-in-recent-niger-attacks-army-says-/7790105.html	2024-09-18T18:56:08-07:00	
Uzbekistan opens free economic zone on Afghan border	Termez, Uzbekistan — Afghans longing for closer connections with the outside world are finding an outlet in the border city of Termez, where neighboring Uzbekistan invites them to visit a new international trade center aimed at boosting regional trade and creating business opportunities. 'It’s uplifting to be here, as we’ve been dreaming about creating a common market for so long. Perhaps this is the beginning of it, despite all the challenges,' said Ajmalik Nader Saghpi, a visitor from Afghanistan’s Laghman Province. Nearby, other Afghan men approach along a dedicated corridor leading from the border control area and lounge on a green lawn in front of a prayer hall. Branded as the Airitom Free Zone, the facility sits on the banks of the Amu Darya, a river marking the border between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan and feeding much of Central Asia. Airitom is a neighborhood in Termez, the administrative center of Uzbekistan’s Surkhandarya region, which also borders Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Built at a cost of around $70 million, the zone spans 36 hectares and is guarded by special forces and police. It features a customs office and storage area capable of handling 100,000 trucks and 900,000 tons of goods a year. It also includes a Hilton Garden Inn, a high-tech hospital, an academic campus, Uzbek and Turkish restaurants, and 50,000 square meters of business space, along with banking and legal services. It is separate from the nearby Termez Cargo Center, an international transport and logistics hub. When VOA toured the zone in August and saw the model, managers said the site, once fully functional, is projected to generate $1.2 billion in trade and attract 1.5 million visitors a year. 'We’re not fantasizing,' said Bakhtiyor Rahimov, the zone’s manager, acknowledging challenges in the region. 'We believe this is realistic because we have studied the neighboring country and others around us, surveyed businesses, and discussed our vision with Afghan leaders. We know they are keen to work with us.' Those high hopes have been echoed by high-profile visitors including Uzbek Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov, Taliban’s acting Prime Minister Abdul Ghani Baradar, and cabinet members from Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan. Any foreigner can stay in the zone for two weeks visa-free. Visitors can conduct commerce in any currency, customs-free. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev instructed that 40% of the space be allocated to Afghan manufacturers and traders, and up to 30% of the projected 5,000 jobs can go to them. Hakim Yar, a businessman from Balkh, the nearby Afghan province, plans to open a couple of offices here for export-import and for an agricultural firm he runs in the Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif. He is satisfied with what’s available in the zone and is among those Afghans already occupying 5% of the space. Qari Shergulan, from Nangarhar, envisions that more Afghans will come if entrepreneurs like him return home with positive experiences. He says his people are eager to seize opportunities wherever they find them and won’t waste any chance to grow. 'We have not lost our potential. We can still work, build, trade, earn, expand, and invest,' Shergulan told VOA when asked about the economic conditions in Afghanistan. None of the Afghan visitors VOA spoke with complained about the Taliban. Instead, they praised Kabul’s cooperation with the Uzbek government and its support for efforts like the new trade center. However, they mentioned electricity shortages, unemployment, diminishing manufacturing, and lack of opportunities across Afghanistan, particularly for youth. Tashkent-based Central Asian University is opening a campus in the zone, promising free education and residence for 200 Afghans, as well as business training for others. 'We will soon have a visa office here,' said Mirkhamid Mirpulatov, the zone’s CEO. 'Foreigners seeking work, study, or services here for a longer period can apply for visas. 'The special corridor on the border, once you cross the bridge over the Amu Darya, is only for our zone. The access is limited to this area. Those interested in doing business outside the Airitom Free Zone need additional permissions,' Mirpulatov explained. Airitom is on the main transportation route linking Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia. This is a key factor for landlocked Uzbekistan, which is eager for access to ports on the Indian Ocean. The zone is also starting daily bus service between Airitom and Mazar-i-Sharif, about 60 kilometers away. The private hospital in the zone is a branch of Tashkent-based Akfa Medline. 'The costs here are lower than in the capital,' Mirpulatov said. 'Afghans have been patients for years, so offering health care here on the border simplifies everything for them.' With 315 staff members and state-of-the-art operating and treatment facilities, Akfa Medline has adjusted its services to mainly cater to Afghans, creating separate units for men and women, something it does not do in Tashkent. 'We’re doing this out of respect for our neighbor’s culture, just as we’re not allowing alcohol in the zone,' Mirpulatov said, denying that Airitom is run under Taliban rules. 'We do discuss business with them but make our own decisions.' Uzbek tycoon behind enterprise Jahongir Artikkhodjayev, an Uzbek business tycoon and former mayor of Tashkent, is the mastermind behind the Airitom Free Zone. Mirpulatov confirmed that the zone is under Akfa Group, one of the largest Uzbek industrial holdings, founded and run by Artikkhodjayev. As with other major projects in the country, President Mirziyoyev entrusted Artikkhodjayev with delivering this trade center, according to Mirpulatov, who calls Artikkhodjayev his mentor. Akfa Group secured the funds for the zone. There is no Western involvement so far, though South Asians, Russians, Chinese and Arabs have shown interest. US view on development When VOA asked U.S. Ambassador to Uzbekistan Jonathan Henick about the Airitom Free Zone, he underscored America’s overall position on Afghanistan and the Taliban. 'Broadly speaking, we support anything that helps ordinary Afghan people and contributes to stability along the border. We recognize that Uzbekistan has legitimate economic concerns that need to be addressed,' he said. 'That should be separate from the question of the Taliban’s desire for international recognition and access to funds. These issues must continue to be handled collectively by the international community through the Doha process,' under which some 30 countries have been discussing how to advance international engagement on Afghanistan. Henick added, 'We have a very strong dialogue with Uzbekistan about Afghanistan. Uzbekistan is an active participant in the Doha process. Our interests are closely aligned.' Other Western diplomats in Tashkent agreed with Henick that recognizing the regime in Kabul, based on human rights and governance conditions, is key to normalizing relations and attracting investment. The Taliban remain angry over a recent deal under which several dozen U.S. aircraft that were flown to Uzbekistan as the Taliban seized control in Afghanistan have been transferred to Uzbek control. But, Henick said, Washington and Tashkent maintain 'a robust military and security relationship.' At the same time, Henick told VOA: 'The U.S. is the largest contributor of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan to this day. We provide enormous amounts of aid because, like Uzbekistan, we have an interest in ensuring there is no humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uzbekistan-opens-free-economic-zone-on-afghan-border/7789564.html	2024-09-18T18:41:48-07:00	
Biden to host Quad leaders at Delaware home	washington — President Joe Biden has made it a priority to elevate the relationship of the Quad, four countries touched by the Indo-Pacific region, the White House said, as he prepares to host the leaders of Japan, India and Australia on Saturday at his Delaware home. The region stretches from the U.S. West Coast to the shores of India to the northeast waters of Japan to the waters around Australia, and includes the many tiny, diffuse islands of the Pacific. That swath of the globe, the U.S. Commerce Department says, holds more than half the world's people and two-thirds of its economy. And, administration officials said, this summit is personally important to Biden, as demonstrated by his decision to host the visitors in his private home in Wilmington, about 160 kilometers from the White House. 'The Biden-Harris administration has made elevating and institutionalizing the Quad a top priority,' White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said. 'And this leaders' summit will focus on bolstering the strategic convergence among our countries, advancing our shared vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific region, and delivering concrete benefits for our partners in the Indo-Pacific in key areas.' Officials say the leaders will act on the region's concerns and will announce moves on illegal fishing in Southeast Asia and the Pacific. 'We've moved forward substantially on efforts that basically allow for the Pacific and Southeast Asia to track — largely untracked to this point — illegal fishing fleets that are the scourge of these extraordinarily important fishing areas,' U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell told reporters Wednesday. 'Vast majority of those fishing fleets are Chinese. We think these capacities will be indeed very helpful in helping local governments repel illegal fishing in their home waters.' Biden often likes to say that the U.S. is at an inflection point — a fact he has stressed recently as American voters face a tense November election with two very different presidential candidates. Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump disagree on how to maintain the crucial U.S.-China relationship. Trump is campaigning hard on harsh tariffs on China, saying, in a recent rally, 'I'm putting a 200% tariff on them,' while making false claims that Chinese automakers are putting up large factories in Mexico. And Harris is expected to continue Biden's more cautious policy of keeping lines of communication open even while competing forcefully in many areas. Beijing recently showed its sensitivity to hearing its name in U.S. election rhetoric, with Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning saying last week: 'The election is an internal affair of the U.S. I won't comment on election remarks. But we oppose the U.S. using the election to criticize China.' Analysts say pulling the leaders of four powerful democracies into one room gives them space to talk freely. 'So really, I think the real agenda is not spoken about. It's China,' said Rafiq Dossani, a senior economist at the RAND research corporation and a professor of policy analysis. 'It's how to manage the rivalry with China.' 'Each has their concerns about China,' he told VOA. 'That becomes, then, the text of the subtext or the background story.' But this group's interests extend far beyond China, analysts say. 'This is certainly not a Contain China club,' said Kathryn Paik of the Center for Strategic and International Studies. 'The primary objectives of the Quad have focused on health, on delivering infrastructure needs, on enhancing countries' ability to monitor their maritime domains and their maritime resources, and on people-to-people ties between these countries.' VOA State Department Bureau Chief Nike Ching and Kim Lewis contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-host-quad-leaders-at-delaware-home/7790088.html	2024-09-18T18:31:01-07:00	
Musk's X skirts Brazil ban, returns to some users with change to server access	RIO DE JANEIRO — Some Brazilian users regained access to X on Wednesday despite a nationwide ban put in place by the country's Supreme Court, a reunion apparently resulting from a change in the way the social network's servers are accessed. But the renewed access may be short-lived. Late last month, Justice Alexandre de Moraes ordered X blocked nationwide after months of tension with the site's billionaire owner, Elon Musk, over free speech, far-right accounts and misinformation. De Moraes also set fines for anyone using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to access the platform. That rendered X effectively inaccessible in the country until Wednesday, when an Associated Press journalist was among those who regained access. The number of X posts made in Brazil rose from 939,000 Tuesday to more than 2 million by late afternoon Wednesday, data analysis company Bites said. Experts examining X's IP addresses — numeric designations that identify sites' locations on the internet — said there are indications the company has begun routing users through the servers of Cloudflare, a content delivery network, en route to its own. 'The service that Elon Musk's social network has started using works like a 'digital shield' that protects the company's servers,' said Pedro Diogenes, Latin America's technical director for CLM, a distributor that focuses on cybersecurity. It acts as a proxy between users and X's servers, filtering traffic and preventing the original IP address from being recognized, Diogenes told the AP. Brazilian telecommunications regulator Anatel said it is looking into the situation and will report its findings to the Supreme Court, noting that there has been no change to de Moraes' ruling. A panel of fellow justices later upheld his decision, though it hasn't yet gone before the court's full bench. His fine for VPN users in particular has faced blowback, including from the nation's bar association. The Supreme Court declined to comment on possible actions it could take. Musk, who often uses his platform to disparage de Moraes, hadn't commented on X by late afternoon. Former President Jair Bolsonaro celebrated the return of the social network. He has sided with Musk in the feud with de Moraes and sought to portray the ban as censorship from an overzealous judge. 'I congratulate you all for the pressure that makes the wheels turn in defense of democracy in Brazil,' Bolsonaro posted Wednesday on X. Some Brazilian X users trumpeted the platform's return — with several addressing de Moraes directly, vowing that they weren't using a VPN. There have been no reports of fines being levied against people using VPNs. Protection of controversial sites Cloudflare, a security company that prides itself on providing services to websites regardless of their content, has a history of protecting sites other companies won't touch — up to a point. In 2017, for instance, it dropped the neo-Nazi website Daily Stormer as a customer following a deadly clash at a white-nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia. And in 2022, it dropped the notorious stalking and harassment site Kiwi Farms, citing an 'immediate threat to human life.' But X is a mainstream social media platform — even if it may be home to some extremist content — and it is not yet clear whether Brazil's ban would be enough for San Francisco-based Cloudflare to abandon it. Cloudflare has a reputation for cooperating with governments, however, and so may comply with an order from the Supreme Court to cease serving as X's proxy, David Nemer, who specializes in the anthropology of technology at the University of Virginia, told the AP. Ordering internet service providers to block Cloudflare would be impossible since thousands of Brazilian companies depend on it, Nemer previously wrote on Bluesky, another social media platform. A person close to Cloudflare, who was not authorized to speak publicly about a business relationship, said the network services provider did not do anything specifically to help X get around Brazil's ban. Rather, X recently switched to Cloudflare from another provider, which could be a reason the block is not working. This person added that the workaround likely won't last long. De Moraes could also attempt to force Musk's hand by going after his satellite-based internet service provider Starlink, as he has done since the ban, said Rafael Mafei, a law professor at the University of Sao Paulo. On Friday, de Moraes seized about $3 million from bank accounts belonging to X and Starlink to collect what X owed in fines. Legal analysts have questioned de Moraes' prior decision to freeze Starlink's bank account until it paid for X's fines. While Musk owns both X and SpaceX, which operates Starlink, the two companies are separate entities. But de Moraes has shown that he considers the two companies to belong to the same economic group, Mafei said. 'Under normal circumstances, anyone else who openly took active steps to obstruct judicial measures and investigations, as Musk is doing, would possibly have already had their arrest decreed in Brazil,' Mafei said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/musk-s-x-skirts-brazil-ban-returns-to-some-users-with-change-to-server-access/7790072.html	2024-09-18T17:59:35-07:00	
UN: 'Immediate action' needed to halt fighting in Sudan's Darfur	united nations — A senior United Nations official warned Wednesday that 'immediate action' is needed to halt the fighting in the capital of Sudan's North Darfur region, where hundreds of thousands of civilians are at risk. 'We urge members of the Security Council to employ their collective leverage to help protect the population caught in the crossfire,' Martha Pobee, U.N. assistant secretary-general for Africa, told council members. A round of large-scale fighting erupted on September 12 between the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, who advanced on the capital of El Fasher from multiple directions, and the Sudanese Armed Forces, who are positioned inside the city. El Fasher is the only capital in the Darfur region that has not yet fallen to the rebel paramilitary. Civilians inside the large city, including an estimated 700,000 people displaced from other parts of Sudan, have been under siege for months with little outside assistance. Pobee urged exploring the possibility of local cease-fires. 'Prior to the deterioration of the situation in El Fasher, a local cease-fire protected the city's population for close to a year,' she said. 'A return to such an arrangement in El Fasher and similar short-term solutions in other locations must continue to be pursued.' War causes humanitarian crisis Sudan is experiencing a massive humanitarian crisis because of the war between two rival generals that began in April 2023. More than 10 million people have fled their homes in search of safety, and last month, international monitors confirmed famine in North Darfur. According to the United Nations, 26 million people are in crisis levels of hunger across the country. In June, the 15-nation Security Council adopted a resolution calling for 'an immediate halt to the fighting and for de-escalation in and around El Fasher,' but it has been totally ignored. During a news conference Wednesday, U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres expressed his frustration with the intransigence of Sudan's warring generals. 'I mean, the truth is that you have two generals, and you have two groups, one army and one paramilitary institution, that are fighting each other, without any consideration for the needs and the dramatic impacts of their people,' he said. 'The level of hunger is spreading terribly in Sudan. The number of people killed and maimed is increasing dramatically. And as a matter of fact, all this is done with total impunity.' On Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said in a statement that both sides must pull back their forces, facilitate unhindered humanitarian access and re-engage in negotiations to end the war. The United States, Saudi Arabia and other partners have pressed for peace for months. While the U.S. and its partners have been successful in opening up some routes for humanitarian relief into Sudan, they so far have failed to silence the guns. Diplomats continue seeking solutions Next week, the head of the Sudanese Armed Forces and chairman of the Transitional Sovereignty Council, General Abdel Fattah Burhan, will be in New York for the annual U.N. General Assembly meetings. Diplomats say there will be multiple meetings on the sidelines of the General Assembly gathering to discuss the situation in Sudan, including a ministerial-level meeting to be hosted by the United States, France, Germany and the European Union. Burhan said Wednesday that the government 'remains resolute and fully committed to ending the suffering of our citizens' and is open to all constructive efforts aimed at ending the war. He said he looks forward to discussing it further during his trip to New York.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-immediate-action-needed-to-halt-fighting-in-sudan-s-darfur/7789778.html	2024-09-18T17:35:33-07:00	
US House Republicans fail to pass funding bill as shutdown approaches	washington — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives failed on Wednesday to pass a funding bill that included a controversial voting measure backed by Donald Trump, complicating efforts to avert a possible government shutdown at the end of the month. Despite urging from Trump, the Republican candidate in the Nov. 5 presidential election, House Republicans were unable to muster enough votes to pass the package and send it on the Democratic-controlled Senate. With Democrats mostly united in opposition, the bill failed by a vote of 202-220, with 14 Republicans voting against and three Democrats in favor. House Speaker Mike Johnson said afterward that he would craft a new temporary spending bill that would keep the government running beyond Oct. 1, when current funding is set to expire. He did not provide details. 'Now we go back to the playbook, draw up another play and we'll come up with another solution,' Johnson said. 'I'm already talking to colleagues.' Democrats in the House and the Senate say they are eager to pass a stopgap spending bill to avert a disruptive shutdown that would furlough hundreds of thousands of federal workers. However, they opposed the version that Johnson brought to a vote on Wednesday, because it was paired with an unrelated voting bill that would require Americans to provide proof of citizenship when they register to vote and require states to purge non-citizens from their registration lists. Johnson also has to contend with a contingent of Republicans who typically vote against stopgap funding bills. Trump has made illegal immigration a central issue in his re-election bid and has falsely claimed that Democrats are registering illegal immigrants to vote, the latest in a long line of lies about election fraud. House Republicans say their bill is needed to ensure that only American citizens vote. It is already illegal for a noncitizen to vote in federal elections and in state elections in every state, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. 'It's already illegal for a minor to purchase alcohol, yet we still card them. We still enforce the law,' said Republican Representative Aaron Bean. Senate Democrats have refused to consider the Republican voting bill, saying it would risk disenfranchising legitimate voters while doing nothing to bolster election security. A 2017 study found 30 instances of suspected illegal immigrant votes out of more than 25 million cast. Democratic Representative Steny Hoyer predicted that Johnson would ultimately bring up a straightforward spending bill that could attract Democratic support — a dynamic that has played out repeatedly over the past year as Republicans have been paralyzed by infighting. 'We've seen this film before. Let's just skip to the ending today,' he said. Congress faces an even more critical deadline on Jan. 1, by which time lawmakers will have to raise the nation's debt ceiling or risk defaulting on more than $35 trillion in federal government debt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-republicans-fail-to-pass-funding-bill-as-shutdown-approaches/7790053.html	2024-09-18T17:15:57-07:00	
Intelligence suggests Iran sought to ensnare Trump, Biden in hack-and-leak	washington — Iran’s efforts to upend U.S. politics ahead of November’s presidential election by targeting the campaign of former President Donald Trump went well beyond a standard hack-and-leak operation. According to U.S. intelligence officials, Tehran sought to ensnare the campaign of Trump’s then-opponent, incumbent U.S. President Joe Biden. Information released late Wednesday by U.S. intelligence officials indicates Iranian cyber actors not only tried to leak stolen Trump campaign documents to media organizations but also tried to feed them to Biden campaign officials, hoping the Biden team might try to use them. 'Iranian malicious cyber actors in late June and early July sent unsolicited emails to individuals then associated with President Biden’s campaign that contained an excerpt taken from stolen, nonpublic material from former President Trump’s campaign as text in the emails,' according to a statement by the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency. 'There is currently no information indicating those recipients replied,' the statement added, noting the Iranian hackers have continued to peddle the stolen information to U.S. media organizations. 'The FBI has been tracking this activity, has been in contact with the victims, and will continue to investigate and gather information in order to pursue and disrupt the threat actors responsible,' the statement said. Earlier this month, a U.S. intelligence official warned that Tehran is 'making a greater effort than in the past to influence this year's elections.' Those efforts included what the official described as a 'multipronged approach to stoke internal divisions and undermine voter confidence' that has included attacks on Trump, the Republican presidential nominee, as well as Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democrats’ presidential nominee after Biden ended his campaign in late July. Iran's mission to the United Nations has not yet responded to a request from VOA for comment. It has previously denied involvement in any attempts to interfere with U.S. elections. In an email to VOA, Trump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt raised the possibility, without providing supporting evidence, that Harris and Biden may have used hacked material obtained from Iranians to try to hurt the Trump campaign. The Harris campaign told VOA in an email that it has cooperated with law enforcement since it was made aware of the Iranian activities. 'We’re not aware of any material being sent directly to the campaign,' said campaign spokesperson Morgan Finkelstein. 'A few individuals were targeted on their personal emails with what looked like a spam or phishing attempt,' Finkelstein said. 'We condemn in the strongest terms any effort by foreign actors to interfere in U.S. elections, including this unwelcome and unacceptable malicious activity.' The Trump campaign first announced the suspected hack last month, initially blaming 'foreign sources hostile to the United States.' U.S. intelligence officials attributed the attack to Iran about a week later. An unclassified U.S. assessment issued earlier this month cautioned, 'Iran has a suite of tools at its disposal.' 'Beyond attempts to hack and leak information, Iran is conducting covert social media operations using fake personas and using AI to help publish inauthentic news articles,' it added. Private technology companies have likewise warned about Iran’s activities. In a report issued just days before the Trump campaign said it had been hacked by Iran, Microsoft said Tehran-linked actors were already seeding the online space for influence operations and potential cyberattacks. But Microsoft President Brad Smith on Wednesday indicated Iranian preparations began even earlier. 'We've seen, starting in May, increasingly sophisticated Iranian activity to penetrate network accounts,' Smith told a cyber summit in Washington. 'It's a classic prelude to hack-and-leak operations. If you can steal the email in June, you can use it in October and you can even change the email.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/intelligence-suggests-iran-sought-to-ensnare-trump-biden-in-hack-and-leak/7789781.html	2024-09-18T17:12:02-07:00	
Pakistan, Russia expand economic ties amid Western sanctions	Islamabad/Washington — Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk met with Pakistani officials in Islamabad on Wednesday to deepen economic ties and expand cooperation 'across multiple sectors,' as Moscow grapples with U.S. and EU economic sanctions over its war against Ukraine. Overchuk’s visit comes after two days of meetings between John Bass, U.S. acting undersecretary of state for political affairs, and Pakistani army chief General Asim Munir and Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar in Islamabad. During a joint press conference with his Russian counterpart Wednesday in Islamabad, Dar said discussions centered on expanding economic ties between the two countries. Pakistan’s bilateral trade with Russia reached an unprecedented $1 billion last year. The countries are committed to expanding trade ties by addressing logistical and related issues, Dar said. According to Dar, Pakistan and Russia are expanding ties in many fields, including liquefied natural gas (LNG) purchases. However, sanctions against Russia restrict cooperation between the two countries. 'Even today, we looked at how to expand our relationship, and overcome this constraint of the banking system, which you know are facing sanctions, which obviously constrains our relationship, the volume of our relationship could have been much bigger,' Dar said Dar said Pakistan and the U.S. Department of State had detailed discussions in October 2023, and American officials agreed to Pakistan's request to purchase Russian LNG, as long as a committee of U.S. trade officials determines the price. According to Dar, Pakistan views Russia as an important player in West, South and Central Asia. He said Pakistan aims to work with Moscow toward peace and stability in Afghanistan. Pakistan’s army media wing said in a statement on Wednesday that Russia’s Overchuk spoke with General Syed Asim Munir, chief of the army staff (COAS), in Rawalpindi. 'Both reiterated Pakistan's commitment to fostering traditional defense ties with Russia. Both sides reaffirmed their resolve to strengthen security and defense cooperation in multiple domains,' the statement says. Analysts say the Russian deputy prime minister's visit and the expansion of cooperation shows Moscow is expanding its influence in the region. 'In my view, a vacuum has emerged after the U.S. exit from Afghanistan, and Russia is positioning itself to fill that void. China is also making efforts in this direction. As a result, Pakistan is working under this policy framework to improve its relations with regional countries, including Russia,' professor Manzoor Afridi, a Pakistani academic on international relations, told VOA. Muhammad Taimur Fahad Khan, a Pakistani international affairs expert at Institute of Strategic Studies, Islamabad, told VOA, 'The primary goal during this period is to enhance trade, strengthen diplomatic ties, and develop infrastructure, particularly in the energy sector. However, the United States has restricted certain aspects of Pakistan's ballistic missile program, while tensions between Russia and Ukraine have escalated. In this context, Pakistan's relationship with Russia holds significance.' Pakistan received its first shipment of Russian liquefied petroleum gas in 2023. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif discussed the possibility of liquefied natural gas supplies earlier in July on the sidelines of a Shanghai Cooperation Organization summit at Astana, Kazakhstan.

Russia pledges to back Pakistan's BRICS membership	islamabad — Russia expressed support Wednesday for Pakistan's entry into the BRICS intergovernmental group of major emerging economies from the Global South. Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk made the pledge after holding delegation-level talks in Islamabad with Pakistani Foreign Minister Ishaq Dar, who is also the deputy prime minister. Pakistan announced last November that it had formally requested to join BRICS, which stands for Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. 'We are happy that Pakistan has applied … and we would be supportive of that,' said the Russian deputy prime minister during a joint news conference with Dar when asked about Moscow’s position on Pakistan’s bid to join BRICS. 'At the same time, there is a consensus that needs to be built within the organization to make those decisions,' Overchuk said, noting that 'we have shared a very good relationship with Pakistan.' Moscow initially launched BRICS in 2009 to provide members with a conduit for challenging the world order dominated by the U.S. and its Western allies. South Africa joined in 2010, and the group expanded this year with new members from the Middle East and Africa. The Russian deputy prime minister said Wednesday that the organization acts as a platform for discussions 'based on quality, mutual respect and consensus' among member countries. 'It’s actually what is attracting many countries from throughout the world to BRICS,' he stated. Russia will host the 2024 BRICS Summit in Kazan on October 22-24. Overchuk said that Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin would attend the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, or SCO, heads of government meeting in the Pakistani capital next month. The SCO is a security, political and economic grouping launched by China, Russia and Central Asian states in 2001 as a counterweight to Western alliances. It expanded to nine countries after archrivals Pakistan and India joined in 2017 and Iran in 2023. In a post-talks statement Wednesday, the Pakistan Foreign Ministry quoted Dar as conveying to Overchuk Islamabad’s 'desire to intensify bilateral, political, economic and defense dialogue' with Moscow. The statement said the two sides 'agreed to pursue robust dialogue and cooperation' in trade, industry, energy, connectivity, science, technology and education.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-pledges-to-back-pakistan-s-brics-membership/7789762.html	2024-09-18T16:37:24-07:00	
Africa needs its own medical research for its health issues, experts say	Addis Ababa, Ethiopia — One of the hurdles to improving health care systems for African countries is the shortage of scientists and lack of meaningful medical research on the continent, experts say. An organization hopes to change that by enabling researchers and policymakers in three large African countries to develop more extensive and relevant research. According to a 2017 report by the World Economic Forum, Africa is home to 15% of the world’s population and 25% of the world’s disease burden — but produces just 2% of the world’s medical research. The report said of the medical research that does occur, much of it fails to prioritize diseases or health problems most pressing for Africans. A group of African health researchers and institutions are now pushing for the continent’s medical research to be more focused on the continent’s own medical problems. The African Population and Health Research Center is bringing together scientists, academics, policymakers and government officials from Ethiopia, Kenya and Nigeria. Their goal is to strengthen African leadership in research and development, ensuring that the findings from these researchers are relevant and accessible to decision-makers, leading to better health care systems across the continent. Catherine Kyobutungi, head of the organization, said African-led research can help solve health problems on the continent much more easily and quickly. 'If we want the research to be done by Africans in Africa on African issues, that is [how] the priorities for what research should be done are defined, not just by academics, but by the people who are going to use that research for decision-making,' she said. 'What we are trying to achieve is to shift what research is and what it is for and to create an army of African scientists that do research to solve African problems in real time, not after 50 years,' Kyobutungi said. Dr. Hadiza Galadanci, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Bayero University in Nigeria, said her country accounts for about 28% of maternal deaths worldwide each year. She and researchers from four African countries, Birmingham University in the United Kingdom and the World Health Organization published research on the best way to save women who were dying from postpartum hemorrhage, or excessive bleeding after childbirth. Their innovation — a calibrated obstetric drape, which is placed beneath a birthing mother — allows physicians to collect and precisely measure blood and fluid loss. 'The drape is just put under ... the woman when she's going to deliver. And then, as soon as she delivers, any blood that comes out goes to the drape. So, we have an objective assessment,' Galadanci explained, saying that the process allows for more specific treatment. 'When we did this, we found out that we could reduce the rate of severe [postpartum hemorrhage] leading to maternal death by 60%.' African researchers face challenges ranging from a lack of reliable data and funding to poor infrastructure to cultural and religious issues. With the support of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Africa Research Connect was developed to connect and enhance the visibility of scientists, institutions, policymakers and donors. Jude Igumbor, an associate professor at Wits School of Public Health in South Africa, wants to improve the visibility of African scientists and their work. 'What we give African scientists is they are able to find each other for collaboration,' he said. The African Population and Health Research Center is calling on donors to fund African institutions and researchers directly instead of going through other organizations, saying that doing so helps the money create opportunities and hone the skills of researchers on the continent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-needs-its-own-medical-research-for-its-health-issues-experts-say/7789676.html	2024-09-18T15:04:35-07:00	
Uzbekistan free economic zone opens door for Afghan entrepreneurs	Termez, Uzbekistan — Afghans longing for closer connections with the outside world are finding an outlet in the border city of Termez, where neighboring Uzbekistan invites them to visit a new international trade center aimed at boosting regional trade and creating business opportunities. 'It’s uplifting to be here, as we’ve been dreaming about creating a common market for so long. Perhaps this is the beginning of it, despite all the challenges,' said Ajmalik Nader Saghpi, a visitor from Afghanistan’s Laghman Province. Nearby, other Afghan men approach along a dedicated corridor leading from the border control area and lounge on a green lawn in front of a prayer hall. Branded as the Airitom Free Zone, the facility sits on the banks of the Amu Darya, a river marking the border between Uzbekistan and Afghanistan and feeding much of Central Asia. Airitom is a neighborhood in Termez, the administrative center of Uzbekistan’s Surkhandarya region, which also borders Tajikistan and Turkmenistan. Built at a cost of around $70 million, the zone spans 36 hectares and is guarded by special forces and police. It features a customs office and storage area capable of handling 100,000 trucks and 900,000 tons of goods a year. It also includes a Hilton Garden Inn, a high-tech hospital, an academic campus, Uzbek and Turkish restaurants, and 50,000 square meters of business space, along with banking and legal services. It is separate from the nearby Termez Cargo Center, an international transport and logistics hub. When VOA toured the zone in August and saw the model, managers said the site, once fully functional, is projected to generate $1.2 billion in trade and attract 1.5 million visitors a year. 'We’re not fantasizing,' said Bakhtiyor Rahimov, the zone’s manager, acknowledging challenges in the region. 'We believe this is realistic because we have studied the neighboring country and others around us, surveyed businesses, and discussed our vision with Afghan leaders. We know they are keen to work with us.' Those high hopes have been echoed by high-profile visitors including Uzbek Prime Minister Abdulla Aripov, Taliban’s acting Prime Minister Abdul Ghani Baradar, and cabinet members from Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan. Any foreigner can stay in the zone for two weeks visa-free. Visitors can conduct commerce in any currency, customs-free. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev instructed that 40% of the space be allocated to Afghan manufacturers and traders, and up to 30% of the projected 5,000 jobs can go to them. Hakim Yar, a businessman from Balkh, the nearby Afghan province, plans to open a couple of offices here for export-import and for an agricultural firm he runs in the Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif. He is satisfied with what’s available in the zone and is among those Afghans already occupying 5% of the space. Qari Shergulan, from Nangarhar, envisions that more Afghans will come if entrepreneurs like him return home with positive experiences. He says his people are eager to seize opportunities wherever they find them and won’t waste any chance to grow. 'We have not lost our potential. We can still work, build, trade, earn, expand, and invest,' Shergulan told VOA when asked about the economic conditions in Afghanistan. None of the Afghan visitors VOA spoke with complained about the Taliban. Instead, they praised Kabul’s cooperation with the Uzbek government and its support for efforts like the new trade center. However, they mentioned electricity shortages, unemployment, diminishing manufacturing, and lack of opportunities across Afghanistan, particularly for youth. Tashkent-based Central Asian University is opening a campus in the zone, promising free education and residence for 200 Afghans, as well as business training for others. 'We will soon have a visa office here,' said Mirkhamid Mirpulatov, the zone’s CEO. 'Foreigners seeking work, study, or services here for a longer period can apply for visas. 'The special corridor on the border, once you cross the bridge over the Amu Darya, is only for our zone. The access is limited to this area. Those interested in doing business outside the Airitom Free Zone need additional permissions,' Mirpulatov explained. Airitom is on the main transportation route linking Pakistan, Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Russia. This is a key factor for landlocked Uzbekistan, which is eager for access to ports on the Indian Ocean. The zone is also starting daily bus service between Airitom and Mazar-i-Sharif, about 60 kilometers away. The private hospital in the zone is a branch of Tashkent-based Akfa Medline. 'The costs here are lower than in the capital,' Mirpulatov said. 'Afghans have been patients for years, so offering health care here on the border simplifies everything for them.' With 315 staff members and state-of-the-art operating and treatment facilities, Akfa Medline has adjusted its services to mainly cater to Afghans, creating separate units for men and women, something it does not do in Tashkent. 'We’re doing this out of respect for our neighbor’s culture, just as we’re not allowing alcohol in the zone,' Mirpulatov said, denying that Airitom is run under Taliban rules. 'We do discuss business with them but make our own decisions.' Jahongir Artikkhodjayev, an Uzbek business tycoon and former mayor of Tashkent, is the mastermind behind the Airitom Free Zone. Mirpulatov confirmed that the zone is under Akfa Group, one of the largest Uzbek industrial holdings, founded and run by Artikkhodjayev. As with other major projects in the country, President Mirziyoyev entrusted Artikkhodjayev with delivering this trade center, according to Mirpulatov, who calls Artikkhodjayev his mentor. Akfa Group secured the funds for the zone. There is no Western involvement so far, though South Asians, Russians, Chinese and Arabs have shown interest. US view on development When VOA asked U.S. Ambassador to Uzbekistan Jonathan Henick about the Airitom Free Zone, he underscored America’s overall position on Afghanistan and the Taliban. 'Broadly speaking, we support anything that helps ordinary Afghan people and contributes to stability along the border. We recognize that Uzbekistan has legitimate economic concerns that need to be addressed,' he said. 'That should be separate from the question of the Taliban’s desire for international recognition and access to funds. These issues must continue to be handled collectively by the international community through the Doha process,' under which some 30 countries have been discussing how to advance international engagement on Afghanistan. Henick added, 'We have a very strong dialogue with Uzbekistan about Afghanistan. Uzbekistan is an active participant in the Doha process. Our interests are closely aligned.' Other Western diplomats in Tashkent agreed with Henick that recognizing the regime in Kabul, based on human rights and governance conditions, is key to normalizing relations and attracting investment. The Taliban remain angry over a recent deal under which several dozen U.S. aircraft that were flown to Uzbekistan as the Taliban seized control in Afghanistan have been transferred to Uzbek control. But, Henick said, Washington and Tashkent maintain 'a robust military and security relationship.' At the same time, Henick told VOA: 'The U.S. is the largest contributor of humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan to this day. We provide enormous amounts of aid because, like Uzbekistan, we have an interest in ensuring there is no humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uzbekistan-free-economic-zone-opens-door-for-afghan-entrepreneurs/7789564.html	2024-09-18T15:01:20-07:00	
US official: China's support for Russia's war effort in Ukraine 'comes from very top'	state department — A senior U.S. State Department official said Wednesday that Beijing's support for Moscow’s defense industry comes directly from the top leadership of the People’s Republic of China, or PRC. The official also pointed out that chips supplied by China have significantly bolstered Russia's battlefield capabilities in its war against Ukraine. For months, U.S. officials have accused the PRC of actively aiding Russia's war effort. Washington has sanctioned Chinese firms providing crucial components to Russia's defense industry. On Wednesday, Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell told lawmakers that the U.S. had been slow to fully grasp the 'absolute intensity of engagement' between Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping. 'The most worrisome thing is that it [China’s support for Russia] comes from the very top,' Campbell said during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing. He added that 'chips, some design features, some capacities associated with the making of explosives' have been enhancing Russia's battlefield operations. 'We see the role of UAVs [unmanned aerial vehicles, or drones] and other capacities that are penetrating the Ukrainian airspace. Much of that has been supported surreptitiously by China, and it raises real concerns.' Chinese officials rejected Washington’s accusations, asserting that the U.S. should not 'smear or attack the normal relations between China and Russia' or infringe upon 'the legitimate rights and interests' of China and its companies. Beijing also continues to call for peace talks between Russia and Ukraine leading to a political settlement, more than two and a half years into the war. Some members of Congress have urged President Joe Biden’s administration to sanction Chinese banks for supporting Russia’s war on Ukraine. 'We've put many of their [PRC] financial institutions on watch. … We've got to have Europeans with us. I think we're beginning to make headway,' said Campbell. The State Department’s second-ranking diplomat said the challenges posed to the U.S. by the PRC exceed those of the Cold War, following a large-scale joint military exercise between China and Russia. Dubbed 'Ocean-2024,' the massive naval and air drills spanned a huge swath of ocean and involved more than 400 naval vessels, at least 120 military aircraft and upward of 90,000 troops, according to the Russian Defense Ministry. Without naming specific countries, Chinese officials said that the military exercise between the two allies, which concluded Monday, was intended to address joint threats. Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, elaborated during a recent briefing in Beijing, saying, 'China and Russia [held] this joint exercise in order to deepen their mil-to-mil strategic coordination and strengthen the capacity to jointly address security threats.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-official-china-s-support-for-russia-s-war-effort-in-ukraine-comes-from-very-top/7789660.html	2024-09-18T14:25:30-07:00	
Haiti creates provisional electoral council to prepare for first vote since 2016	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — Haiti's government on Wednesday created a provisional electoral council long sought by the international community to prepare the troubled Caribbean country for its first general elections since 2016. Smith Augustin, a member of the country's transitional presidential council, confirmed to The Associated Press that the electoral council was created, albeit with only seven of what by law is supposed to be a nine-member panel. He said the two other members would likely be announced in upcoming days. The electoral council, which represents groups including farmers, journalists, human rights activists and the Vodou community, is tasked with organizing the elections and helping create the legal framework to hold them. Haiti, which has not had a president since July 2021, last held elections in 2016. The previous electoral council had been dissolved in September 2021 by former Prime Minister Ariel Henry, who accused it of being 'partisan.' His move delayed elections planned for November 2021 and prompted critics to accuse him of holding on to power, accusations he rejected. A transitional leader, Henry was sworn in as prime minister roughly two weeks after former President Jovenel Moise was assassinated at his private home in July 2021. Henry repeatedly pledged to hold elections but blamed worsening gang violence for his failure to do so. Earlier this year, gangs that control 80% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, launched coordinated attacks on critical government infrastructure, a move that eventually led to Henry's resignation. A transitional presidential council was then created and tasked with holding presidential elections by February 2026. The assassination of Moise had left a political vacuum. In addition, the terms of 10 remaining senators expired in January 2023, stripping Haiti of its last democratically elected institution. The country had failed to hold legislative elections since October 2019, with Moise ruling by decree before he was killed. The newly formed provisional electoral council faces numerous obstacles, including persistent gang violence blamed for the killing of more than 3,200 people from January to May. Turf wars among gangs also have left more than half a million people homeless in recent years, with thousands of Haitians forced to flee their homes, abandoning essential documents including ID's needed to vote. Government officials have been visiting makeshift shelters to provide new IDs, but many Haitians remain without one. To help quell gang violence, nearly 400 Kenyan police arrived in Haiti earlier this year as part of a U.N.-backed mission that also expects to see the pledged deployment of soldiers and police from Jamaica, the Bahamas, Chad, Benin and Bangladesh.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-creates-provisional-electoral-council-to-prepare-for-first-vote-since-2016/7789665.html	2024-09-18T14:21:01-07:00	
Venezuela's Gonzalez says he was forced to sign letter accepting court ruling of Maduro victory	caracas, venezuela — Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, who stood against President Nicolas Maduro in July's election, on Wednesday said he was forced to sign a letter accepting a ruling from the country's top court that recognized Maduro's victory. 'Either I signed or I faced the consequences,' he said in a statement. Gonzalez is currently in Spain, where he was granted political asylum earlier this month following the issue of a warrant for his arrest in Venezuela. The national electoral council proclaimed Maduro the victor of the July 28 presidential election, prompting allegations of fraud and widespread protest as the opposition published vote tallies online that they said showed Gonzalez had won. Earlier this week, a U.N. report said Maduro's government escalated repressive tactics to crush peaceful protests and keep power in the aftermath of the South American country's disputed election. The declaration by Venezuela's top electoral authority was approved by the country's Supreme Court, even though officials have not published vote tallies showing Maduro's victory. Gonzalez said he was met at the Spanish embassy in Caracas by Venezuelan Vice President Delcy Rodriguez and her brother Jorge Rodriguez, president of the National Assembly, who gave him the letter to sign. 'There followed very tense hours of coercion, blackmail and pressure,' Gonzalez said, adding he felt he would be more useful in freedom than locked up. 'A document produced under duress is totally worthless, due to a serious lack of consent,' the statement added. In Caracas, Jorge Rodriguez presented a two-page letter signed by Gonzalez and said the former presidential candidate, 75, had 24 hours to retract his claims. 'If you don't deny that in 24 hours, I'm going to release the audios, it's up to you, Mr. Gonzalez,' Rodriguez said, referring to the meetings he and his sister held with Gonzalez.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-s-gonzalez-says-he-was-forced-to-sign-letter-accepting-court-ruling-of-maduro-victory-/7789652.html	2024-09-18T14:19:55-07:00	
Man who sold fentanyl-laced pill liable for $5.8 million in death of young female customer	LOS ANGELES — In 2019, Brandon McDowell was contacted by a sophomore in college who asked to buy Percocet, a prescription painkiller. What the 20-year-old sold her instead were counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl, a deadly synthetic opioid that can be lethal in a dose as small as 2 milligrams. Hours later, Alexandra Capelouto, also 20, was dead in her Temecula, California, home. It is an increasingly common scenario as fentanyl overdoses have become a leading cause of death for minors in the last five years, with more than 74,000 people dying in the U.S. from a synthetic opioid in 2023, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. McDowell has been behind bars since 2022 with a fentanyl possession conviction. But the Capeloutos have now won an additional $5.8 million judgment against him for the death of their daughter. 'We've won the battle but not the war,' said Matt Capelouto, Alexandra's father. 'We still have a long ways to go in terms of holding drug dealers accountable for deaths.' Baruch Cohen, the Capeloutos' lawyer, said this was the first time a drug dealer has been held liable civilly for someone's death, to his knowledge. 'Here's the hope that this judgment will be the shot that's heard around the world, so to speak,' Cohen said. 'Because if it inhibits another drug deal from going down, where the drug dealer ... realizes that, besides the jail sentence, he is liable for millions of dollars of damages, maybe he'll think twice.' McDowell, now 25, first pleaded guilty in California federal court in 2022 for possession with intent to distribute fentanyl, a charge that carries a 20-year minimum sentence if linked to death or serious injury and convicted by a jury. McDowell was sentenced to nine years in prison. Alexandra's father felt that wasn't enough. He and his wife, who was diagnosed with stage four breast cancer that year and has been battling it since, decided to sue McDowell for wrongful death. 'For taking somebody's life, that was not a fair sentence,' he said. 'I was going to pursue every means possible to make sure justice was served.' While McDowell filed for bankruptcy, the Capeloutos won a judgment of about $5 million against him. The Superior Court of Riverside County found he sold harmful narcotics with 'willful and malicious' intent that led to Alexandra Capelouto's death. A few months later, the Capeloutos filed another case in federal bankruptcy court to ensure that McDowell could not escape his debt under bankruptcy. 'Bankruptcy is designed for honest debtors, not crooked criminal debtors,' Cohen said. 'This judgment will haunt him the rest of his life, and when he does make money, we'll garnish it. When he does buy property, we'll put a lien on it.' Judge Mark Houle ruled in the Capeloutos' favor, ordering a $5.8 million judgment against Brandon McDowell that includes a year and half of interest in addition to the initial $5 million. Since his daughter's death, Matt Capelouto founded the non-profit Stop Drug Homicide to advocate for families and push for more legislation to hold drug dealers accountable. One is Alexandra's Law, which would require a formal warning be given to anyone with a drug-related conviction to inform them of the dangers of dealing drugs and that they could be charged with murder if they distribute drugs that lead to someone's death. In California, it can be difficult for prosecutors to charge drug dealers with someone's death because they must prove the dealer had knowledge that the drugs could cause death, Capelouto said. Having an admonishment on the record for dealers who have been convicted of a drug-related crime could be used as evidence in future cases if someone dies from the drugs they sold. Alexandra's Law is included in Proposition 36, a tough-on-crime ballot measure that Californians will vote on in November. Capelouto is also part of a group of 60 families suing Snapchat for its role in the distribution of deadly narcotics. Alexandra Capelouto and Brandon McDowell had communicated over Snapchat when she bought pills from him. Justin McDowell, Brandon's father, said it is unfair for his son to take all the blame. He said his son was struggling with drug abuse and had been in rehab, and he didn't live with him at the time because the McDowells had younger children. 'My son is no drug dealer at all. They were both users. They both had an addiction,' he said. 'He was a stupid 20-year-old kid.' Justin McDowell said he felt like the Capeloutos were seeking revenge through their lawsuits, and he did not have the money and resources to fight on his son's behalf in court. Brandon McDowell was being held at the federal prison in San Pedro during the lawsuit and did not have lawyers to defend himself in civil or bankruptcy court. 'I think that's sad, that shouldn't be allowed,' Justin McDowell said. 'We'll wait for him to get out of prison, give him a hug, and figure out how to deal with the situation ... the kid's never going to make $5.8 million in his life.' Matt Capelouto said there was no evidence of his daughter having a drug addiction, and Brandon McDowell's addiction does not absolve him of responsibility in her death. 'When you go from drug user to drug dealer, you cross a line from needing help to needing to be held accountable,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-who-sold-fentanyl-laced-pill-liable-for-5-8-million-in-death-of-young-female-customer/7789604.html	2024-09-18T13:07:09-07:00	
Teamsters union declines to endorse Trump or Harris	WASHINGTON — The International Brotherhood of Teamsters declined Wednesday to endorse Kamala Harris or Donald Trump for president, saying neither candidate had sufficient support from the 1.3 million-member union. 'Unfortunately, neither major candidate was able to make serious commitments to our union to ensure the interests of working people are always put before big business,' Teamsters President Sean O'Brien said in a statement. 'We sought commitments from both Trump and Harris not to interfere in critical union campaigns or core Teamsters industries — and to honor our members' right to strike — but were unable to secure those pledges.' Harris met Monday with a panel of Teamsters, having long courted organized labor and made support for the middle class her central policy goal. Trump also met with a panel of Teamsters and even invited O'Brien to speak at the Republican National Convention, where the union leader railed against corporate greed. The Teamsters said Wednesday that internal polling of its members showed Trump with an advantage over Harris. The Teamsters' choice to not endorse came just weeks ahead of the November 5 election, far later than other large unions such as the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers, which have chosen to back Harris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/teamsters-union-declines-to-endorse-trump-or-harris/7789592.html	2024-09-18T12:59:26-07:00

Iran nuclear chief says country has no 'covert objectives'	Vienna, Austria — Iran has no 'covert objectives' when it comes to its nuclear program and the country is ready to resume its nuclear commitments once Western sanctions are lifted, the head of the country's Atomic Energy Organization told AFP. 'Uranium enrichment is not necessarily for weapons purposes,' Mohammad Eslami said on Wednesday in an interview with AFP on the sidelines of the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) general conference in Vienna. 'We are doing it for research and the production of various isotopes for nuclear industry applications,' he said. Tensions between Iran and the IAEA have repeatedly flared since a 2015 deal curbing Tehran's nuclear program in exchange for sanction relief fell apart. In recent years, Tehran has decreased its cooperation with the IAEA, while significantly ramping up its nuclear program, including amassing large stockpiles of uranium enriched to 60%, which is close to the 90% needed to develop an atomic bomb. The rapid expansion of Iran's nuclear program has no 'credible civilian justification,' according to the U.N. nuclear watchdog. Amid the impasse, the IAEA's board of governors in June adopted a resolution critical of Iran. Despite the restrictions on inspections since 2021 and the barring of U.N. inspectors, the IAEA continues to 'daily monitor' Iran's nuclear program, at a level that exists 'nowhere else in the world,' Eslami stressed. 'Our work is completely transparent. It is not as if we were producing a material with covert objectives,' Eslami told AFP. He said Iran was in discussions with IAEA chief Rafael Grossi to organize his visit to the country in the near future, where he is expected to meet President Masoud Pezeshkian. Since Pezeshkian's election in July, Iran has said it was willing to relaunch talks to revive the Iran nuclear deal it reached with world powers in 2015. The landmark deal — also known by the acronym JCPOA — started to unravel in 2018 when then U.S. President Donald Trump unilaterally withdrew from it and reimposed sanctions, and Iran retaliated by stepping up its nuclear activities. Efforts to revive the deal — bringing the United States back on board and Iran back into compliance — have so far been fruitless. Eslami, however, told AFP that 'the JCPOA is not dead.' 'As soon as the others resume their obligations, we will act accordingly,' he said, stressing that 'it is not possible for them to expect us to keep our commitments' when they themselves have reinstated sanctions. But Western powers have deplored the 'absence' of positive concrete signs from Tehran. 'Patience has its limits, and we will not stand by while Iran continues to obfuscate,' the United States, Britain, France and Germany warned in a joint statement last week. Experts say resumption of talks seems unlikely before the U.S. presidential elections, amid a sharp deterioration in Iran's relations with Europe and the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-nuclear-chief-says-country-has-no-covert-objectives-/7789543.html	2024-09-18T12:29:04-07:00	
Pressure grows on Britain ahead of Commonwealth summit to pay slavery reparations	London — Britain is facing growing pressure to address the issue of reparations for the transatlantic slave trade and other atrocities, as the former colonial power and many of its former colonies prepare to gather for the biennial Commonwealth heads of government meeting next month. The Commonwealth emerged from the ashes of Britain’s empire after World War II. The vast majority of its 56 members are former British colonies. The organization is set to choose a new secretary-general at its heads of government meeting October 21-25 in Samoa, as the term of incumbent Patricia Scotland comes to an end. All three candidates vying for the job — all of whom are from Africa — voiced strong support for reparations at a recent event at London’s Chatham House. Ghanaian Foreign Minister Shirley Botchwey said reparations could take various forms. 'Financial reparations is good. However, the conversation is now moving to other reparations in kind. And so, either way it's fine, but I stand for reparations,' she said. 'Whether or not the Commonwealth has a role to play will depend on the heads of government who will give the secretary-general her marching orders: that we want you involved in the conversation of reparations, we want you to put forward a common voice on behalf of all Commonwealth countries,' Botchwey added. Joshua Setipa, a candidate from Lesotho, said the Commonwealth was the right forum to address the issue. 'I support the idea of reparative justice, and I would not wait to be asked to participate,' said Setipa, a former trade minister. 'More than half of the members around the table are calling for this to be addressed.' Mamadou Tangara, Gambia’s candidate for Commonwealth secretary-general who is currently serving as the country’s foreign minister, agreed. 'I am fully in support of reparatory justice. But this is a cause, a noble cause, that has to be championed by member states. And the Commonwealth can use its convenient power to facilitate the dialogue and make it happen,' he said. At the last Commonwealth summit, in Rwanda in 2022, Britain’s then-Prince Charles — who is now king and therefore head of the Commonwealth — spoke of his deep sorrow over the slave trade. 'I want to acknowledge that the roots of our contemporary association run deep into the most painful period of our history,' Charles told delegates in Kigali. 'I cannot describe the depths of my personal sorrow at the suffering of so many as I continue to deepen my own understanding of slavery's enduring impact.' Britain, however, has rejected any form of reparations. The issue can no longer be dismissed, said Kingsley Abbott, director of the Institute of Commonwealth Studies at the University of London. 'In my view, sitting here in 2024, the fact of transatlantic slavery, the harm it caused, the harm it continues to cause, and the need for this to be addressed in some way meaningfully, can't really be ignored any longer. And these expressions of support from the candidates I think mirror the fact that the global movement for reparations is growing,' Abbott said. 'Reparations doesn't just equal monetary compensation under international law. It can take many forms, like restitution and compensation and rehabilitation and satisfaction, things like meaningful apologies, public acknowledgement, memorialization and things like that,' Abbott told VOA. 'And so, therefore, of course the Commonwealth has a role to play. What the Commonwealth can benefit from is the tremendous amount of very important, thoughtful work that's been done by people, including from Commonwealth states, on this very issue.' Former British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak argued in 2023 that 'trying to unpick our history is not the right way forward.' His successor, Keir Starmer, is yet to make his position on reparations clear. The pressure will likely grow, as officials from Britain and many of its former colonies gather, as equals, at the Commonwealth summit next month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pressure-grows-on-britain-ahead-of-commonwealth-summit-to-pay-slavery-reparations/7789535.html	2024-09-18T12:28:54-07:00	
Climate week talks to include critical minerals and seabed mining debate	Washington — When activists, policymakers and representatives from across the globe gather next week in New York to participate in climate week, one pressing issue on the agenda that is less frequently discussed and known will be the environmental impact of seabed mining. As countries look for ways to lower emissions, critical minerals are playing a key role in that transition. Critical minerals are used in all kinds of green technologies, from solar panels and wind turbines to batteries in electric vehicles. And one place where those mineral resources are abundant is deep under the sea. The debate over accessing seabed resources is heated. Supporters say the technology exists to safely access these critical minerals undersea, but environmentalists and activists say the potential of undiscovered biodiversity on the seafloor is too important to endanger. During climate week, which will take place on the sidelines of U.N. General Assembly meetings, organizers are expected to host a roundtable on the environmental impact of seabed mining and other discussions about critical minerals. The World Economic Forum says that if the globe wants to reach net-zero emissions by 2050, two-thirds of vehicles must be powered by electric batteries. And the International Energy Agency says that to reach that goal, the world needs six times more mineral resources by 2040 than it has today. Some of the largest mineral deposits are found on the ocean floor in the form of polymetallic nodules, or rocks. Ocean of resources According to the International Seabed Authority, or ISA, there are 21 billion tons of polymetallic nodules strewn across the seabed of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, or CCZ. Each nodule contains a combination of electric vehicle battery components such as nickel, manganese, copper and cobalt. The ISA plans to release regulations for mining in the international waters of the CCZ by 2025. The ISA has already awarded 17 exploration contracts for polymetallic nodules in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone – a large swath of the Pacific Ocean the size of the continental United States which sits between Hawaii and Mexico. Three of those exploration contracts went to The Metals Company, a Canadian deep-sea mining company. The Pacific Island Nations of Nauru, Kiribati and Tonga have sponsored The Metals Company’s efforts to develop a portion of the seabed. In an interview with VOA, CEO Gerard Barron said the company is ready to begin as soon as the ISA allows mining. 'Our collector methodology is to put a robot on the seafloor which crawls around the ocean floor and fires a jet of water at the nodule and it creates an inverse pressure and lifts the nodule up, and so we don’t go down and scour the seafloor,' said Barron via Zoom, adding that TMC has spent the past decade focused on testing this equipment and collecting data on its environmental impact as part of its permit application to the ISA. Moratorium needed Critics worry scooping up these mineral-rich rocks will disrupt important biodiversity – much of it still unnamed and some of it undiscovered. Researchers have found that 90% of the more than 5,000 species in the zone are new to science. Eddie Palu, president of the Tonga Fishery Association, wants a pause for more research. 'We demand a moratorium on the seabed mining until the environmental, economic and social risk are comprehensively understood,' he said during a panel discussion at the recent Pacific Islands Forum in Tonga. Shiva Gounden from Greenpeace Australia Pacific, who also sat on the panel, agreed. 'We know only very little of the deep sea, and the race for the final frontier could cause irreversible damages to the people and to the communities of our Pacific,' Gounden said. But scientists say no light and very little oxygen reaches the deep sea – limiting the life there to mostly bacteria and small invertebrates. The Metals Company’s Barron said combating climate change is a bigger threat to the planet than undersea mining, adding that the company’s environmental impact studies show that 'we can safely collect these nodules' and turn them into battery metals without having 'a negative impact on the ocean.' 'The notion that we can do any extraction with zero impact is a dream,' added Barron. 'The oceans are impacted by every single thing we do today, especially global warming. So, we need to address the main driver for climate change and reduce emissions.' Fueling innovation Still, the quest to do just that – access minerals on the seabed with minimal impact to the environment – has created competition between technology companies. U.S. tech startup Impossible Metals is testing a robot which can avoid nodules where it detects life and harvests those where it does not. 'The vehicle hovers above the seabed, uses the camera and it actually picks up the nodules one by one. So this really minimizes all of the negative concerns around big sediment plumes,' CEO Oliver Gunasekra told VOA in an interview. Gunaskera’s company spun off Viridian Biometals. Its technology bypasses energy-intensive processes such as smelting with bacteria which can separate metal ore from the rock around it. The process creates no emissions or waste. 'The bacteria need oxygen just like we do to breathe. And when there's not enough oxygen in the water around them, the bacteria have learned that there's oxygen in the rocks, and they have adapted to breathe that oxygen,' said Viridian CEO Eric Macris. Impossible Metals and Viridian Biometals say they are two to three years out from commercializing their technology, depending on funding. TMC says it could be ready to begin its collection operations as soon as international regulations are released next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/climate-week-talks-to-include-critical-minerals-and-seabed-mining-debate/7789523.html	2024-09-18T12:21:23-07:00	
Mississippi town moves Confederate monument that became an eyesore	grenada, mississippi — A Mississippi town has taken down a Confederate monument that stood on the courthouse square since 1910 — a figure that was tightly wrapped in tarps the past four years, symbolizing the community's enduring division over how to commemorate the past. Grenada's first Black mayor in two decades seems determined to follow through on the city's plans to relocate the monument to other public land, a concrete slab behind a fire station about 5.6 kilometers from the square. But a new fight might be developing. A Republican lawmaker from another part of Mississippi wrote to Grenada officials saying she believes the city is violating a state law that restricts the relocation of war memorials or monuments. The Grenada City Council voted to move the monument in 2020, weeks after police killed George Floyd in Minneapolis. The vote seemed timely: Mississippi legislators had just retired the last state flag in the U.S. that prominently featured the Confederate battle emblem. The tarps went up soon after the vote, shrouding the Confederate soldier and the pedestal he stood on. But even as people complained about the eyesore, the move was delayed by tight budgets, state bureaucracy or political foot-dragging. A new mayor and city council took office in May, prepared to take action. On Sept. 11, with little advance notice, police blocked traffic and a work crew disassembled and removed the 6.1-meter stone structure. 'I'm glad to see it move to a different location,' said Robin Whitfield, an artist with a studio just off Grenada's historic square. 'This represents that something has changed.' Still, Whitfield, who is white, said she wishes Grenada leaders had invited the community to engage in a discussion about the symbol, to bridge the gap between those who think moving it is erasing history and those who see it as a daily reminder of white supremacy. She was among the few people watching as a crane lifted parts of the monument onto a flatbed truck. 'No one ever talked about it, other than yelling on Facebook,' Whitfield said. Mayor Charles Latham said the monument has been 'quite a divisive figure' in the town of 12,300, where about 57% of residents are Black and 40% are white. 'I understand people had family ... fight and die in that war, and they should be proud of their family,' Latham said. 'But you've got to understand that there were those who were oppressed by this, by the Confederate flag on there. There's been a lot of hate and violence perpetrated against people of color, under the color of that flag.' The city received permission from the Mississippi Department of Archives and History to move the Confederate monument, as required. But Representative Stacey Hobgood-Wilkes of Picayune said the fire station site is inappropriate. 'We are prepared to pursue such avenues that may be necessary to ensure that the statue is relocated to a more suitable and appropriate location,' she wrote, suggesting a Confederate cemetery closer to the courthouse square as an alternative. She said the Ladies Cemetery Association is willing to deed a parcel to the city to make it happen. The Confederate monument in Grenada is one of hundreds in the South, most of which were dedicated during the early 20th century when groups such as the United Daughters of the Confederacy sought to shape the historical narrative by valorizing the Lost Cause mythology of the Civil War. The monuments, many of them outside courthouses, came under fresh scrutiny after an avowed white supremacist who had posed with Confederate flags in photos posted online killed nine Black people inside the historic Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South Carolina, in 2015.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mississippi-town-moves-confederate-monument-that-became-an-eyesore-/7789486.html	2024-09-18T11:51:39-07:00	
AI enhances maternal health care in Kenya, experts say	Nairobi, Kenya — University students are developing technology that incorporates artificial intelligence to help reduce the maternal mortality rate in Kenya. Maternal mortality remains a key issue affecting women of reproductive age in Kenya. The Ministry of Health says more than 6,000 women die each year due to poor access to maternal health facilities. The new technology allows health care workers to remotely monitor the conditions of pregnant women and their fetuses without physical visits to a hospital. David Saruni, a computer science student at Kabarak University in Kenya’s Rift Valley region, is involved in developing the application, known as Mama’s Hub. 'The project objective is to prevent the onset of pre-eclampsia, which may cause death to mothers and even infants after their delivery,' Saruni said. 'So, this project is going to save lives.' The World Health Organization defines maternal health as the health of women during pregnancy, childbirth and the postnatal period. Despite a global decline in maternal mortality ratio over the past two decades, the WHO says the African region still lags. Africa accounts for more than two-thirds of maternal deaths worldwide. With the Mama’s Hub application, the expectant mother wears a smartwatch that monitors vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and temperature. The monitor is connected to a mobile phone that relays the information to a database. Health care workers at Mama’s Hub can review that information and refer women to nearby doctors if they are concerned. Artificial intelligence enters the picture here, as patients will also be able to obtain prescriptions through a chatbot, which is now in the testing stages. Moses Thiga, principal investigator of the Mama’s Hub project, said, 'If the onset of the condition is detected before 20 weeks, then there are interventions that can be instituted. The same case with others like gestation or diabetes. 'All this boils down to timely and accurate information about the mother.' The National Research Fund-supported technology also enables digitization of the prenatal care records of patients for easier access. It has been tested in prenatal clinics in the Rift Valley city of Nakuru, with the aim of rolling out to the rest of the country. Nakuru County chief nursing officer Wendy Tirop said the digitization has improved record tracing. 'It makes it very [easy] for the health care provider to be able to trace and identify mothers who have failed to come to the clinic and do a follow-up,' Tirop said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-enhances-maternal-health-care-in-kenya-experts-say/7789467.html	2024-09-18T11:51:29-07:00

US Federal Reserve cuts key rate by sizable half-point, signaling end to its inflation fight	Washington — The U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday cut its benchmark interest rate by an unusually large half-point, a dramatic shift after more than two years of high rates helped tame inflation but that also made borrowing painfully expensive for American consumers. The rate cut, the Fed's first in more than four years, reflects its new focus on bolstering the job market, which has shown clear signs of slowing. Coming just weeks before the presidential election, the Fed's move also has the potential to scramble the economic landscape just as Americans prepare to vote. The central bank's action lowered its key rate to roughly 4.8%, down from a two-decade high of 5.3%, where it had stood for 14 months as it struggled to curb the worst inflation streak in four decades. Inflation has tumbled from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022 to a three-year low of 2.5% in August, not far above the Fed's 2% target. The Fed's policymakers also signaled that they expect to cut their key rate by an additional half-point in their final two meetings this year, in November and December. And they envision four more rate cuts in 2025 and two in 2026. In a statement, the Fed came closer than it has before to declaring victory over inflation: It said it 'has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2%.' Though the central bank now believes inflation is largely defeated, many Americans remain upset with still-high prices for groceries, gas, rent and other necessities. Former President Donald Trump blames the Biden-Harris administration for sparking an inflationary surge. Vice President Kamala Harris, in turn, has charged that Trump's promise to slap tariffs on all imports would raise prices for consumers even further. Rate cuts by the Fed should, over time, lower borrowing costs for mortgages, auto loans and credit cards, boosting Americans' finances and supporting more spending and growth. Homeowners will be able to refinance mortgages at lower rates, saving on monthly payments, and even shift credit card debt to lower-cost personal loans or home equity lines. Businesses may also borrow and invest more. Average mortgage rates have already dropped to an 18-month low of 6.2%, according to Freddie Mac, spurring a jump in demand for refinancings. The Fed's next policy meeting is Nov. 6-7 — immediately after the presidential election. By cutting rates this week, soon before the election, the Fed is risking attacks from Trump, who has argued that lowering rates now amounts to political interference. Yet Politico has reported that even some key Senate Republicans who were interviewed have expressed support for a Fed rate cut this week. The central bank's officials fought against high inflation by raising their key rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Wage growth has since slowed, removing a potential source of inflationary pressure. And oil and gas prices are falling, a sign that inflation should continue to cool in the months ahead. Consumers are also pushing back against high prices, forcing such companies as Target and McDonald's to dangle deals and discounts. Yet after several years of strong job growth, employers have slowed hiring, and the unemployment rate has risen nearly a full percentage point from its half-century low in April 2023 to a still-low 4.2%. Once unemployment rises that much, it tends to keep climbing. Fed officials and many economists note, though, that the rise in unemployment this time largely reflects an influx of people seeking jobs — notably new immigrants and recent college graduates — rather than layoffs. At issue in the Fed's deliberations is how fast it wants to lower its benchmark rate to a point where it's no longer acting as a brake on the economy — nor as an accelerant. Where that so-called 'neutral' level falls isn't clear, though many analysts peg it at 3% to 3.5%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-federal-reserve-cuts-key-rate-by-sizable-half-point-signaling-end-to-its-inflation-fight/7789466.html	2024-09-18T11:40:56-07:00	
Sean 'Diddy' Combs makes fresh bid for bail in sex trafficking, conspiracy case	New York — Lawyers for Sean 'Diddy' Combs asked a judge Wednesday to let him await his sex trafficking trial at his luxury home on an island near Miami Beach, rather than a grim federal jail in Brooklyn. Combs' lawyers offered a $50 million bail package — using his mansion as collateral — in exchange for releasing him to home detention with GPS monitoring. A hearing on the request was scheduled for Wednesday afternoon. On Tuesday, a U.S. magistrate judge in Manhattan ordered Combs held without bail. The hip-hop mogul whose career blossomed in the 1990s was arrested on Monday on charges contained in an indictment that accuses Combs of using his 'power and prestige' for 'sex trafficking, forced labor, interstate transportation for purposes of prostitution, drug offenses, kidnapping, arson, bribery and obstruction of justice.' It describes the inducement of female victims and male sex workers into drugged-up, elaborately produced sexual performances dubbed 'Freak Offs' that Combs arranged, directed, masturbated during and often recorded. The events would sometimes last days and require IVs to recover from, the indictment said. It alleges he coerced and abused women for years while using blackmail, including the videos he shot, and shocking acts of violence to keep his victims in line, coordinated and facilitated from the top down by a network of associates and employees. Combs' attorney Marc Agnifilo submitted a letter to Judge Andrew L. Carter on Wednesday seeking the release of Combs, 54, on conditions including home detention with GPS monitoring, along with a restriction on all visitors to his residences except for family, property caretakers and friends who are not considered co-conspirators. Combs' house is on Star Island, a man-made dollop of land in Biscayne Bay, reachable only by a causeway or boat. It is among the most expensive places to live in the United States. Combs' request echoes that of a long line of wealthy defendants who have offered to pay multimillion-dollar bails in exchange for home detention in luxurious surroundings. 'Sean Combs has never evaded, avoided, eluded or run from a challenge in his life,' the defense said in a court filing. 'He will not start now.' Combs was expected to reenter his not guilty plea in his initial appearance before Carter. So far, prosecutors have successfully argued that he is a danger to the community and a flight risk and should remain incarcerated until trial. For all the revelations that came with the unsealing of the indictment Tuesday, most of what it outlines had been described in a November lawsuit filed by his former longtime girlfriend and protege, the R&B singer Cassie, whose legal name is Cassandra Ventura. The suit was settled the following day, but its allegations have followed Combs since. Its descriptions of beatings, sexual assaults, silencing tactics and 'Freak Offs' were echoed throughout the criminal indictment, though it did not use her name or the names of any other women. Agnifilo, also without naming Ventura but clearly referring to her, argued at Tuesday's arraignment that the entire criminal case is an outgrowth of one long-term, troubled-but-consensual relationship that faltered amid infidelity. The 'Freak Offs,' Agnifilo contended, were an expansion of that relationship, and not coercive. 'Is it sex trafficking?' Agnifilo asked. 'Not if everybody wants to be there.' Prosecutors, however, portrayed the scope as far larger. They said in court papers that they had interviewed more than 50 victims and witnesses and expect the number to grow. Like many aging hip-hop figures — including many of those he beefed with in the bicoastal rap feuds of the 1990s alongside the Notorious B.I.G. — the Bad Boy Records founder Combs had established a gentler, more worldly public image. The doting father of seven children was a respected international businessman, whose annual 'White Party' in the Hamptons was once a must-have invitation for the jet-setting elite. But prosecutors said he used the same companies, people and methods he used to build his business and cultural power to facilitate his crimes. They said they would prove it with financial, travel and billing records, electronic data and communications and videos of the 'Freak Offs' to prove their case. The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Ventura did. Combs was arrested late Monday in a Manhattan hotel, roughly six months after federal authorities raided his luxurious homes in Los Angeles and Miami and revealed they were conducting a sex trafficking investigation. During the searches, law enforcement seized narcotics, videos of the 'Freak Offs' and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil and lubricant, according to prosecutors. They said agents also seized firearms and ammunition, including three AR-15s with defaced serial numbers. The indictment portrays Combs as so violent that he caused injuries that often took days or weeks to heal. His employees and associates sometimes witnessed his violence and kept victims from leaving or tracked down those who tried, the indictment said. A conviction on every charge in the indictment would require a mandatory 15 years in prison with the possibility of a life sentence. Combs and his attorneys denied similar allegations made by others in a string of lawsuits filed after Ventura's.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sean-diddy-combs-makes-fresh-bid-for-bail-in-his-sex-trafficking-conspiracy-case/7789355.html	2024-09-18T10:33:50-07:00

False reports of explosives found in car near Trump rally spread online	New York — Law enforcement officials on Long Island worked quickly on Wednesday to publicly knock down social media posts falsely reporting that explosives had been found in a car near former President Donald Trump's planned rally in New York. The false reports of an explosive began circulating hours before the Republican presidential nominee's campaign event at Nassau Coliseum in Uniondale, just days after he was apparently the target of a second possible assassination attempt. Nassau County Police Commissioner Patrick Ryder said police questioned and detained a person who 'may have been training a bomb detection dog,' near the site of the rally and 'falsely reported explosives being found.' Lt. Scott Skrynecki, a spokesperson for the county police, said in follow-up messages that the person, who police have not yet identified, was a civilian and not a member of a law enforcement agency. He also said the person was not working at or affiliated with the event, which is expected to draw thousands of Trump supporters to the arena that was formerly the home of the NHL's New York Islanders. The rally is Trump's first on Long Island, a suburban area just east of New York City, since 2017. In 2020, President Joe Biden defeated Trump by a roughly 4% margin on Long Island, besting him in Nassau County by about 60,000 votes, though Trump carried neighboring Suffolk County by more than 200 votes. Earlier Wednesday, Skrynecki and other county officials responded swiftly to knock down the online line claims, which appear to have started with a post from a reporter citing unnamed sources in the local police department. The claims were then shared widely on X, formerly Twitter, by a number of prominent accounts, including that of the company's owner, Elon Musk, which has nearly 200 million followers. Spokespersons for X didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. 'False,' Skrynecki texted the AP as the claims spread. 'No. Ridiculous. Zero validity,' said Christopher Boyle, spokesperson for Nassau County Executive Bruce Blakeman.	https://www.voanews.com/a/false-reports-of-explosives-found-in-a-car-near-trump-rally-spread-online/7789325.html	2024-09-18T10:14:35-07:00

Taiwan's coastal defenses questioned after Chinese man's illegal entry attempt	Taipei, Taiwan — A recent attempt by a Chinese man to illegally enter Taiwan after crossing the 180-kilometer-wide Taiwan Strait in a rubber boat is raising concerns on the island about its coastal defense capabilities and overall preparedness amid rising tensions between Beijing and Taipei. Last Saturday, a 30-year-old Chinese man surnamed Wang was spotted in a dinghy about 100 meters offshore near Taiwan’s northern Linkou District in New Taipei City at about 6:30 in the morning. After being treated for severe dehydration at a nearby hospital, Wang was detained by local authorities for illegally entering Taiwan. Wang told authorities that he was in debt in China and wanted to start a new life in Taiwan. Wang is one of 18 Chinese nationals who have tried to illegally enter Taiwan since July of last year. When reached for comment on the cases, Taiwan’s Coast Guard Administration declined to share how many of them were able to reach Taiwan’s shores, like Wang. In June, a former Chinese naval captain was able to reach the Tamsui ferry pier in Northern Taiwan on a speedboat, shocking many because of how far he was able to get before being detected. At the time, a Chinese man surnamed Ruan said he was fleeing to Taiwan seeking freedom after being threatened by Chinese police for sharing articles critical of the Chinese government. On Wednesday, however, a court in Taipei sentenced Ruan to eight months in prison for illegally entering Taiwan. He confessed to the crime but claimed his deep knowledge of the Chinese military could help Taiwan cope with threats posed by Beijing. Some experts say the two Chinese men’s attempts to illegally enter Taiwan expose loopholes in Taiwan’s coastal defense capabilities. 'Even though Taiwan’s defense ministry has highlighted the strategic importance of defending coastal areas in northern Taiwan, Taiwan’s coast guard, which is in charge of coastal defense, has not prioritized setting up advanced surveillance technologies, such as infrared thermal cameras, in these areas, which lead to their failure of detecting the two Chinese men before they reach Taiwanese shores,' said Chieh Chung, a military researcher at the National Policy Foundation in Taiwan. Some lawmakers from Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang, who favor friendly relations with China, say the two incidents show the Taiwanese government has failed to provide the coast guard with adequate funding and the right equipment to monitor attempted illegal entry. In response to opposition lawmakers’ criticism of underfunding the coast guard, Taiwan’s Premier Cho Jung-tai vowed to accelerate the review of the recent incidents and determine whether the coast guard needs more advanced technologies or personnel to support their work. Apart from accelerating the installation of advanced surveillance technologies along coastal areas in northern Taiwan, Chieh said Taiwan’s coast guard should consider strengthening coastal patrols by purchasing commercial drones and increasing coordination with Taiwanese fishermen. 'Taiwan’s coast guard can use commercial drones to help conduct patrols along coastal areas during the day and Taiwanese fishermen could immediately inform the coast guard if they spot any unusual vessels in waters near Taiwanese shores,' he told VOA in a phone interview. Growing gray zone challenges Intrusions into Taiwanese waters by Chinese coast guard vessels also are posing a problem for Taiwan’s Coast Guard Administration and raising questions about preparedness. This is particularly true in waters off Taiwan’s outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands, which are just a few kilometers from China’s coast. Late last week, Taiwan said four Chinese coast guard vessels entered restricted waters near Kinmen, prompting Taipei to deploy four coast guard vessels to drive away the Chinese vessels. The incident was the 39th incursion carried out by Chinese coast guard vessels this year, officials said. While Beijing describes the incursions, which include boarding Taiwanese vessels, as being part of 'law enforcement patrols,' analysts in Taiwan say they challenge Taipei’s territorial claims around its outlying islands and are unilaterally seeking to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait. Chieh said since the Taiwanese government has focused on enhancing wartime coordination between the coast guard and the navy over the last few years, it has overlooked the need to strengthen the Taiwanese coast guard’s maritime law enforcement capabilities and upgrade its vessels and training. 'Some of the coast guard vessels that Taiwan purchased in previous years are not suitable to engage in close-range encounters with Chinese coast guard vessels because the structure of those vessels is not solid enough,' he told VOA. Some analysts suggest Taiwan should carry out a series of reforms to rapidly enhance the coast guard’s capabilities. 'The Taiwanese government should enhance the coast guard’s budget, increase their manpower, and strengthen their law enforcement capabilities by arranging exchanges with other countries’ coast guard,' Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research, told VOA by phone. Military analysts say China likely will maintain high-level pressure on Taiwan through repeated coast guard incursions in the coming months, and Taipei should ensure its coast guard has enough support to cope with the wide range of challenges that Beijing poses. 'Instead of letting the coast guard oversee both Taiwan’s maritime defense and coastal defense, the Taiwanese government should consider assigning some of the responsibilities to the army or the navy,' Lin Ying-yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-coastal-defenses-questioned-after-chinese-man-illegal-entry-attempt/7789300.html	2024-09-18T09:56:30-07:00	
Boeing to start temporary furloughs amid Seattle strike	New York — Boeing said Wednesday it would start temporary furloughs of professional and white-collar staff as it seeks to conserve cash amid a labor strike that has shuttered Seattle manufacturing plants. The furloughs, which pertain to executives, managers and workers, will be initiated in the coming days and affect tens of thousands of Boeing employees, company officials said. Boeing plans for 'selected employees to take one week of furlough every four weeks on a rolling basis for the duration of the strike,' said a message to employees from CEO Kelly Ortberg. The new Boeing boss added that he and the rest of the leadership team 'will take a commensurate pay reduction for the duration of the strike.' Boeing had said that furloughs were on the table earlier in the week when it announced a hiring freeze, travel budget austerity measures and a reduction of supplier expenditures. About 33,000 Seattle-area Boeing workers with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers District 751 walked off the job Friday after overwhelmingly rejecting a contract renewal. The two sides resumed talks Tuesday with the assistance of mediators from the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. The IAM blasted Boeing in a bargaining update posted late Tuesday. 'We are frustrated,' the IAM said. 'The company was not prepared and was unwilling to address the issues you've made clear are essential for ending this strike: Wages and Pension. The company doesn't seem to be taking mediation seriously.' Ortberg's message to employees reiterated his commitment to 'resetting our relationship with our represented employees and continuing discussions with the union to reach a new agreement that is good for all of our teammates and our company as soon as possible.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-to-start-temporary-furloughs-amid-seattle-strike/7789296.html	2024-09-18T09:54:06-07:00	
Two years after Mahsa Amini death, Western allies sanction a dozen Iranian officials	Washington — The U.S., Canada and Australia hit a group of Iranian officials with sanctions Wednesday for their participation in suppressing protests and detaining people in relation to the death of Mahsa Amini, an Iranian woman who died in the custody of Iran's morality police two years ago for improperly wearing a mandatory headscarf. Amini, 22, died on Sept. 16, 2022, in a hospital after being arrested for allegedly not wearing her mandatory headscarf, or hijab, to the liking of the authorities. Her death sparked nationwide protests against the country's hijab laws and its ruling theocracy. Included in Wednesday's sanctions are a dozen officials accused of killing and detaining protesters, suppressing protests in 2019 and 2022 and arresting journalists. The country's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on a promise to halt the harassment of women by morality police. Still, since Amini's death, videos have emerged of women and girls being roughed up by officers. In 2023, a teenage Iranian girl was injured in a mysterious incident on Tehran's Metro while not wearing a headscarf and later died in the hospital. In July, activists say police opened fire on a woman fleeing a checkpoint in an attempt to avoid her car being impounded for her not wearing the hijab. U.S. Treasury official Bradley T. Smith said, 'Despite the Iranian people's peaceful calls for reform, Iran's leaders have doubled down on the regime's well-worn tactics of violence and coercion.' The U.S. and its allies 'will continue to take action to expose and hold accountable those responsible for carrying out the Iranian regime's cruel agenda,' Smith said. The sanctions, which block access to U.S. property and bank accounts and prevent the targeted people and companies from doing business with the U.S. are largely symbolic since many of the individuals do not interact with the U.S. In March, a United Nations fact-finding mission determined that Iran is responsible for the 'physical violence' that led to the death of Amini. It also found that the Islamic Republic employed 'unnecessary and disproportionate use of lethal force' to put down the demonstrations that erupted following Amini's death and that Iranian security forces sexually assaulted detainees. Increasingly, on the streets of Iranian cities, it's becoming more common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-years-after-mahsa-amini-death-western-allies-sanction-a-dozen-iranian-officials-/7789207.html	2024-09-18T09:06:49-07:00	
Youth group exposes Turkey's Israel trade	A group of young activists in Turkey known as 1000 Youth for Palestine is posing a rare and potent challenge to Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan by using social media to expose Turkey's ongoing trade with Israel.

US targets second major Chinese hacking group	Washington — The United States has identified and taken down a botnet campaign by China-directed hackers to further infiltrate American infrastructure as well as a variety of internet-connected devices. FBI Director Christopher Wray announced the disruption of what he called Flax Typhoon during a cyber summit Wednesday in Washington, describing it as part of a much larger campaign by Beijing. 'Flax Typhoon hijacked Internet-of-Things devices like cameras, video recorders and storage devices — things typically found across both big and small organizations,' Wray said. 'And about half of those hijacked devices were located here in the U.S.' Wray said the hackers, working under the guise of an information security company called the Integrity Technology Group, collected information from corporations, media organizations, universities and government agencies. 'They used internet-connected devices — this time, hundreds of thousands of them — to create a botnet that helped them compromise systems and exfiltrate confidential data,' he said. But Flax Typhoon’s operations were disrupted last week when the FBI, working with allies and under court orders, took control of the botnet and pursued the hackers when they tried to switch to a backup system. 'We think the bad guys finally realized that it was the FBI and our partners that they were up against,' Wray said. 'And with that realization, they essentially burned down their new infrastructure and abandoned their botnet.' Wray said Flax Typhoon appeared to build on the exploits and tactics of another China-linked hacking group, known as Volt Typhoon, which was identified by Microsoft in May of last year. Volt Typhoon used office network equipment, including routers, firewalls and VPN hardware, to infiltrate and disrupt communications infrastructure in Guam, home to key U.S. military facilities. VOA has reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Washington for comment. The FBI and the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency have previously warned that Chinese-government directed hackers, like Volt Typhoon, have been positioning themselves to launch destructive cyberattacks that could jeopardize the physical safety of Americans. Following Wednesday’s announcement by the FBI, the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA) issued an advisory encouraging anyone with a device that was compromised by Flax Typhoon to apply needed patches. It said that as of this past June, the Flax Typhoon botnet was making use of more than 260,000 devices in North America, Europe, Africa and Southeast East. The NSA said almost half of the compromised devices were in the U.S. Another 18 countries, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Albania, China, South Africa and India, were also impacted.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-targets-second-major-chinese-hacking-group-/7789181.html	2024-09-18T08:41:05-07:00	
Frenchwoman in mass rape case calls husband, other suspects 'degenerates'	AVIGNON, France — Gisele Pelicot, who was drugged and raped by dozens of men recruited by her husband, said on Wednesday 'forgiveness does not exist,' rejecting claims by him and one of his chief accomplices that they regretted harming the women they loved. The trial in the southern French town of Avignon of Dominique Pelicot and 50 other men accused of raping his wife has shocked the world. The case has also triggered protests across France in support of Gisele Pelicot, who has become a symbol of the fight against sexual violence. 'These men are degenerates. They committed rape,' Gisele Pelicot, 72, told the court after her now ex-husband Dominique and the accomplice, Jean-Pierre Marechal, gave testimony on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. 'When they see a woman sleeping on her bed, no one thought to ask themselves a question? They don't have brains?' Dominique Pelicot, 71, is also accused of having raped Marechal's wife at her home after drugging her, with the collaboration of her husband. Gisele Pelicot insisted on a public trial to expose her former husband and the 50 men he is accused of inviting to rape her in a small village in southern France. 'Today forgiveness does not exist,' Gisele Pelicot told the court as she described how her former husband had taken mistresses without hiding the fact from her, and she defended herself from some of the criticisms leveled against her. 'I have felt humiliated while I've been in this courtroom. I have been called an alcoholic, a conspirator of Mr. Pelicot,' she said, adding her life had been 'destroyed' for 10 years. 'In the state I was in, I absolutely could not respond. I was in a comatose state; the videos show that.' The Pelicots' daughter Caroline, whose photographs were found on her father's devices along with images of her mother being raped, was on the verge of tears in the courtroom as her mother spoke. Dominique Pelicot has denied drugging or sexually abusing Caroline. She has told French media that she started publicly campaigning to fight drug-induced sexual assault to cope with the shock following her father's arrest. In court, Dominique Pelicot admitted orchestrating the mass rape of his then-wife. He asked for forgiveness and said he ultimately hoped to win back his former partner, who filed for divorce after learning of the rapes from investigators. Because of a skirmish between some supporters of Gisele Pelicot and some of the accused on Tuesday evening, the court told attendees not to boo the suspects in the case, telling them they were innocent until proven guilty. But the court also said it was not a problem if supporters applauded Gisele Pelicot when she emerged from the courtroom, as some have been doing. Earlier on Wednesday, Marechal, 63, admitted to working with Dominique Pelicot to drug and both rape Marechal's wife, Cilia, after the men met on a now-shuttered website. Marechal blamed his mentor and a troubled childhood for his actions. Marechal is not among those accused of raping Gisele Pelicot. 'I regret my actions. I love my wife,' Marechal said in the courtroom. 'If I had not met Mr. Pelicot, I would have never committed this act.' Marechal met Dominique Pelicot on a website called Coco, where Pelicot shared with him images of the rapes of his wife by the men he had recruited, describing how he had drugged her. Marechal said in the courtroom he stumbled across the website by accident and initially refused Pelicot's request to rape his own wife before acquiescing. Prosecutors say Pelicot drugged Marechal's wife and raped her while Marechal watched. Gisele Pelicot said Marechal's explanation of his childhood was insufficient to explain his actions. 'I've had trauma but I have not committed crimes,' she said. Dominique Pelicot acknowledged his guilt in raping Marechal's wife and said he regretted his actions, adding that he cut contact with them after she woke up while he was in her room. Prosecutors say Dominique Pelicot was recorded in at least three of 12 assaults against Marechal's wife Cilia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/frenchwoman-in-mass-rape-case-calls-husband-other-suspects-degenerates-/7789132.html	2024-09-18T08:13:23-07:00

US Justice Department sues over Baltimore bridge collapse and seeks $100 million in cleanup costs	BALTIMORE — The U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday sued the owner and manager of the cargo ship that caused the Baltimore bridge collapse, seeking to recover more than $100 million that the government spent to clear the underwater debris and reopen the city's port. The lawsuit filed in Maryland alleges that the electrical and mechanical systems on the ship, the Dali, were improperly maintained, causing it to lose power and veer off course before striking a support column on the Francis Scott Key Bridge in March. 'This tragedy was entirely avoidable,' according to the lawsuit. The collapse snarled commercial shipping traffic through the Port of Baltimore for months before the channel was fully opened in June. 'With this civil claim, the Justice Department is working to ensure that the costs of clearing the channel and reopening the Port of Baltimore are borne by the companies that caused the crash, not by the American taxpayer,' Attorney General Merrick Garland said in written statement. The case was filed against Dali owner Grace Ocean Private Ltd. and manager Synergy Marine Group, both of Singapore. The companies filed a court petition days after the collapse seeking to limit their legal liability in what could become the most expensive marine casualty case in history. The ship was leaving Baltimore bound for Sri Lanka when its steering failed because of the power loss. Six members of a road work crew on the bridge were killed in the collapse. The men were working an overnight shift filling potholes on the bridge deck when it suddenly crumbled beneath them, sending them tumbling into the water. 'This accident happened because of the careless and grossly negligent decisions made by Grace Ocean and Synergy, who recklessly chose to send an unseaworthy vessel to navigate a critical waterway and ignored the risks to American lives and the nation's infrastructure,' said Chetan Patil, the acting deputy assistant attorney general. On Tuesday, the victims' families declared their intent to file a claim seeking to hold the ship's owner and manager fully liable for the disaster. Several other interested parties, including city officials and local businesses, have filed opposing claims accusing the companies of negligence. The families are also calling for more robust workplace protections, especially for immigrant workers. All the victims were Latino immigrants who came to the United States in search of better-paying jobs and opportunities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-justice-department-sues-over-baltimore-bridge-collapse-and-seeks-100-million-in-cleanup-costs-/7789092.html	2024-09-18T07:58:10-07:00

US now allows passport renewals online	WASHINGTON — Americans can now renew their passports online, bypassing a cumbersome mail-in paper application process that often caused delays. The U.S. State Department announced Wednesday that its online passport renewal system is now fully operational. 'By offering this online alternative to the traditional paper application process, the Department is embracing digital transformation to offer the most efficient and convenient passport renewal experience possible,' Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement. After staffing shortages caused mainly by the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in lengthy passport processing delays, the department ramped up hiring and introduced other technological improvements that have reduced wait times by about one-third over last year. It says most applications are now completed in far less than the advertised six to eight weeks. The online renewal system is expected to further reduce that. The system will allow renewal applicants to skip the current process, which requires them to print out and send paper applications and a check by mail and submit their documents and payment through a secure website, www.Travel.State.Gov/renewonline.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-now-allows-passport-renewals-online/7788978.html	2024-09-18T06:34:23-07:00

Nigeria flags flood risk in 11 states as Cameroon releases dam water	LAGOS — Nigeria's hydrological services agency has warned of potential flooding in 11 states after neighboring Cameroon said it was starting to release water from one of its largest dams following recent heavy rainfall in West and Central Africa. The warning comes as Nigeria is already grappling with severe floods in northeastern Borno state where a dam burst its walls after heavy rains that have also caused floods in Cameroon, Chad, Mali and Niger — all part of Africa's Sahel region that usually receives little rain. The Nigeria Hydrological Services Agency (NIHSA) said it had been notified by authorities in Cameroon on Tuesday that they had started controlled water releases from Lagdo dam. Cameroon has several dams on the Benue River, which flows downstream to Nigeria. A spokesperson for Cameroon's utility ENEO, which manages the dam, told Reuters there was a possibility that the dam could be flooded, but the reservoirs had not been opened on Wednesday morning. The NIHSA said Lagdo dam managers would gradually release water in a way not to exceed the capacity of the Benue river downstream to prevent flooding. But 11 states, including Benue, Nasarawa and Kogi in the food producing central belt region and southern oil producing states of Bayelsa, Delta and Rivers were at risk, said NIHSA. It urged federal and state authorities in Nigeria 'to step up vigilance and deploy adequate preparedness measures to reduce possible impacts of flooding that may occur as a result of increase in flow levels of our major rivers at this period.' In 2022, Nigeria lost more than 600 people and farmlands to the worst flooding in a decade following heavy rain and after Cameroon released water from Lagdo dam. Experts said then that Nigeria's failure to complete a dam of its own that was supposed to backstop the Cameroonian one worsened the disaster. Nigeria, the most populous nation in Africa, is prone to flooding but critics say defective infrastructure and poor planning worsen the situation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-flags-flood-risk-in-11-states-as-cameroon-releases-dam-water-/7788860.html	2024-09-18T04:40:29-07:00	
France's new PM warns of 'very serious' financial situation	Paris — France's budgetary situation is 'very serious,' Prime Minister Michel Barnier told AFP on Wednesday, saying more information was needed to gauge the 'precise reality' of French public finances. France was placed on a formal procedure for violating European Union budgetary rules before Barnier was picked as head of government this month by President Emmanuel Macron. And the Bank of France warned this week that a projected return to EU deficit rules by 2027 was 'not realistic.' France's public-sector deficit is projected to reach around 5.6 percent of GDP this year and go over six percent in 2025, which compares with EU rules calling for a three-percent ceiling on deficits. 'I am discovering that the country's budgetary situation is very serious,' Barnier said in a statement to AFP. 'This situation requires more than just pretty statements. It requires responsible action,' he said. The new prime minister, who has yet to appoint a cabinet, is scheduled to submit a 2025 budget to parliament next month, in what is expected to be the first major test for the incoming administration. 'Out of the question' Within days of taking office in early September, Barnier said in an interview that 'French people want more justice' in terms of fiscal policy, while several politicians have reported the prime minister mentioning possible tax increases in private conversations. Such a move would be a red rag to allies of Macron, who oversaw cuts in the corporate tax rate from 33.3% to 25% as well as tax reductions for households, including the wealthiest taxpayers. Macron has claimed a reduction in the overall tax burden by 50 billion euros ($56 billion) since he became president in 2017. Interior Minister Gerald Darmanin, a staunch Macron ally, said Wednesday that it was 'out of the question' to join, or even back, a government that raised taxes. But years of extra spending during the Covid pandemic combined with sluggish growth have caused the French deficit to balloon, sparking the 'excessive deficit procedure' by the EU, which is designed to force a country to negotiate a plan with Brussels to get their deficit or debt levels back on track. Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, who is to be replaced soon, promised to bring the deficit back below three percent by 2027 but many analysts have dismissed the plan as implausible. France's central bank governor, Francois Villeroy de Galhau, said this week that the objective was 'not realistic' unless the government was willing to risk 'stopping growth in its tracks.' Apparently backing Barnier's approach, Villeroy de Galhau called for an 'exceptional and reasonable effort asked of some major companies and wealthy taxpayers' to help a recovery in finances. France, he said, could no longer afford 'unfunded' tax cuts. But tighter fiscal policies could put Barnier on a collision course with Macron, who appointed the experienced politician — best known internationally as the EU's former chief Brexit negotiator — in the hope that he can survive an early no-confidence vote in parliament. 'Dreadful error to go back' 'We want a stable fiscal policy that does not undermine policies that caused unemployment to fall and our country's attractiveness to rise,' said Jean-Rene Cazeneuve, a National Assembly deputy and Macron ally. 'It would be a dreadful error to go back on this.' Laurent Wauquiez, head of the conservative Les Republican (LR) parliamentary group on whom Barnier will depend for support, said last week that 'our conviction is that in a certain number of areas we need rightist policies'. This, he said, meant 'no tax rises.' The tax question is likely to deepen budding tensions between Macron and Barnier, who is said to have been irritated that the president did not consult him about nominating Foreign Minister Stephane Sejourne to the EU Commission. 'Knowing where Michel Barnier stands on Europe and the loss of French influence, I think he's just suffered his first humiliation,' said one LR deputy on condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-new-pm-warns-of-very-serious-financial-situation/7788844.html	2024-09-18T04:23:06-07:00	
Deadly Portugal wildfires force new evacuations	Lisbon — Deadly wildfires raging in Portugal have forced more people to evacuate their homes as crews battled dozens of blazes on Wednesday in the nation's north. Stifling heat and strong winds have fanned a spate of forest fires across the north and centre of the country that have killed seven people dead since the weekend. Civil protection authorities listed 42 active fires on its website on Wednesday and said they had mobilized around 3,900 firefighters and over 1,000 vehicles. In the Gondomar municipality, just outside Porto, authorities carried out more evacuations on Tuesday night. Firefighters battling blazes in Arouca in the hard-hit Aveiro region told local media outlets the situation there was 'uncontrollable.' Around 20,000 hectares (49,400 acres) of vegetation have burned in the region, south of Porto, since Monday, according to data from the European Forest Fire Information System (Effis). A total of 15 separate fires have passed the 1,000-hectare threshold since the fires began over the weekend, Effis data also showed. Authorities in Aveiro said Tuesday evening that firefighters were on the verge of bringing one group of fires that had spread across a 100-kilometre (60-mile) perimeter under control. Three firefighters died on Tuesday when their vehicle was trapped by the flames, civil protection authorities said, bringing the fire-related toll up to seven, with some 50 injured. A 28-year-old Brazilian who worked for a forestry company died after he become trapped by the flames as he tried to collect some times. Two others suffered heart attacks and a volunteer firefighter died while taking a break from battling the flames. Lisbon has upped fire prevention funding ten-fold and doubled the budget to fight wildfires since deadly blazes in 2017 claimed hundreds of lives. The Iberian peninsula is particularly vulnerable to global warming, with heatwaves and drought exposing the region to blazes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-portugal-wildfires-force-new-evacuations/7788826.html	2024-09-18T04:05:45-07:00	
End of an era': UK to shut last coal-fired power plant	Ratcliffe on Soar, United Kingdom — Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station has dominated the landscape of the English East Midlands for nearly 60 years, looming over the small town of the same name and a landmark on the M1 motorway bisecting Derby and Nottingham. At the mainline railway station serving the nearby East Midlands Airport, its giant cooling towers rise up seemingly within touching distance of the track and platform. But at the end of this month, the site in central England will close its doors, signaling the end to polluting coal-powered electricity in the UK, in a landmark first for any G7 nation. 'It'll seem very strange because it has always been there,' said David Reynolds, a 74-year-old retiree who saw the site being built as a child before it began operations in 1967. 'When I was younger you could go down certain parts and you saw nothing but coal pits,' he told AFP. Energy transition Coal has played a vital part in British economic history, powering the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries that made the country a global superpower, and creating London's infamous choking smog. Even into the 1980s, it still represented 70% of the country's electricity mix before its share declined in the 1990s. In the last decade the fall has been even sharper, slumping to 38% in 2013, 5.0% in 2018 then just 1.0% last year. In 2015, the then Conservative government said that it intended to shut all coal-fired power stations by 2025 to reduce carbon emissions. Jess Ralston, head of energy at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think-tank, said the UK's 2030 clean-energy target was 'very ambitious.' But she added: 'It sends a very strong message that the UK is taking climate change as a matter of great importance and also that this is only the first step.' By last year, natural gas represented a third of the UK's electricity production, while a quarter came from wind power and 13 percent from nuclear power, according to electricity operator National Grid ESO. 'The UK managed to phase coal out so quickly largely through a combination of economics and then regulations,' Ralston said. 'So larger power plants like coal plants had regulations put on them because of all the sulphur dioxide, nitrous oxides, all the emissions coming from the plant and that meant that it was no longer economically attractive to invest in those sorts of plants.' The new Labour government launched its flagship green energy plan after its election win in July, with the creation of a publicly owned body to invest in offshore wind, tidal power and nuclear power. The aim is to make Britain a superpower once more, this time in 'clean energy.' As such, Ratcliffe-on-Soar's closure on September 30 is a symbolic step in the UK's ambition to decarbonize electricity by 2030, and become carbon neutral by 2050. It will make the country the first in the G7 of rich nations to do away entirely with coal power electricity. Italy plans to do so by next year, France in 2027, Canada in 2030 and Germany in 2038. Japan and the United States have no set dates. - 'End of an era' - In recent years, Ratcliffe-on-Soar Power Station, which had the potential to power two million homes, has been used only when big spikes in electricity use were expected, such as during a cold snap in 2022 or the 2023 heatwave. Its last delivery of 1,650 tons of coal at the start of this summer barely supplied 500,000 homes for eight hours. 'It's like the end of a era,' said Becky, 25, serving £4 pints behind the bar of the Red Lion pub in nearby Kegworth. Her father works at the power station and will be out of a job. September 30 is likely to stir up strong emotions for him and the other 350 remaining employees. 'It's their life,' she said. Nothing remains of the world's first coal-fired power station, which was built by Thomas Edison in central London in 1882, three years after his invention of the electric light bulb. The same fate is slated for Ratcliffe-on-Soar: the site's German owner, Uniper, said it will be completely dismantled 'by the end of the decade.'

EU court confirms Qualcomm's antitrust fine, with minor reduction	brussels — Europe's second-top court largely confirmed on Wednesday an EU antitrust fine imposed on U.S. chipmaker Qualcomm, revising it down slightly to $265.5 million from an initial $2.7 million. The European Commission imposed the fine in 2019, saying that Qualcomm sold its chipsets below cost between 2009 and 2011, in a practice known as predatory pricing, to thwart British phone software maker Icera, which is now part of Nvidia Corp. Qualcomm had argued that the 3G baseband chipsets singled out in the case accounted for just 0.7% of the Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS) market and so it was not possible for it to exclude rivals from the chipset market. The Court made 'a detailed examination of all the pleas put forward by Qualcomm, rejecting them all in their entirety, with the exception of a plea concerning the calculation of the amount of the fine, which it finds to be well founded in part,' the Luxembourg-based General Court said. Qualcomm can appeal on points of law to the EU Court of Justice, Europe's highest. The chipmaker did not immediately reply to an emailed Reuters request for comment. The company convinced the same court two years ago to throw out a $1.1 billion antitrust fine handed down in 2018 for paying billions of dollars to Apple from 2011 to 2016 to use only its chips in all its iPhones and iPads in order to block out rivals such as Intel Corp. The EU watchdog subsequently declined to appeal the judgment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-court-confirms-qualcomm-s-antitrust-fine-with-minor-reduction/7788763.html	2024-09-18T02:35:16-07:00	
Google wins challenge against $1.66B EU antitrust fine	BRUSSELS — Alphabet unit Google won its challenge on Wednesday against a $1.66 billion antitrust fine imposed five years ago for hindering rivals in online search advertising, a week after it lost a much bigger case. The European Commission, in its 2019 decision, said Google had abused its dominance to prevent websites from using brokers other than its AdSense platform that provided search adverts. The practices it said were illegal took place from 2006 to 2016. The Luxembourg-based General Court mostly agreed with the European Union competition enforcer's assessments of the case, but annulled the fine. 'The court (...) upheld most of the commission's assessments, but annulled the decision imposing a fine of almost 1.5 billion euros ($1.66 billion) on Google, on the grounds in particular that it had failed to take into account all the relevant circumstances in its assessment of the duration of the contractual clauses that it had found to be unfair,' the judges said. The AdSense fine, one of a trio of fines that have cost Google a total of some $9 billion, was triggered by a complaint from Microsoft in 2010. Google has said it changed the targeted contracts in 2016 before the Commission's decision. The company last week lost its final fight against a $2.6 billion fine levied for using its price comparison shopping service to gain an unfair advantage over smaller European rivals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-wins-challenge-against-1-66b-eu-antitrust-fine/7788759.html	2024-09-18T02:30:32-07:00	
Sri Lanka's plantation workers live on the margins, but politicians want their votes	SPRING VALLEY, Sri Lanka — Whoever Sri Lanka's next president is, Muthuthevarkittan Manohari isn't expecting much to change in her daily struggle to feed the four children and elderly mother with whom she lives in a dilapidated room in a tea plantation. Both leading candidates in Saturday's presidential election are promising to give land to the country's hundreds of thousands of plantation workers, but Manohari says she's heard it all before. Sri Lanka's plantation workers are a long-marginalized group who frequently live in dire poverty, but they can swing elections by voting as a bloc. Mahohari and her family are descended from Indian indentured laborers who were brought in by the British during colonial rule to work on plantations that grew first coffee, and later tea and rubber. Those crops are still Sri Lanka's leading foreign exchange earners. For 200 years, the community has lived on the margins of Sri Lankan society. Soon after the country became independent in 1948, the new government stripped them of citizenship and voting rights. Around 400,000 people were deported to India under an agreement with Delhi, separating many families. The community fought for its rights, winning in stages until achieving full recognition as citizens in 2003. There are around 1.5 million descendants of plantation workers living in Sri Lanka today, including about 3.5% of the electorate, and some 470,000 people still live on plantations. The plantation community has the highest levels of poverty, malnutrition, anemia among women and alcoholism in the country, and some of the lowest levels of education. They're an important voting bloc, turned out by unions that double as political parties that ally with the country's major parties. Despite speaking the Tamil language, they’re treated as a distinct group from the island’s indigenous Tamils, who live mostly in the north and east. Still, they suffered during the 26-year civil war between government forces and Tamil Tiger separatists. Plantation workers and their descendants faced mob violence, arrests and imprisonment because of their ethnicity. Most plantation workers live in crowded dwellings called 'line houses,' owned by plantation companies. Tomoya Obokata, a U.N. special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, said after a visit in 2022 that five to ten people often share a single 3.05-by-3.6 meter room, often without windows, a proper kitchen, running water or electricity. Several families frequently share a single basic latrine. There are no proper medical facilities in the plantations, and the sick are attended to by so-called estate medical assistants who do not have medical degrees. 'These substandard living conditions, combined with the harsh working conditions, represent clear indicators of forced labor and may also amount to serfdom in some instances,' Obokata wrote in a report to the U.N. high commissioner for human rights. The government has made some efforts to improve conditions for the planation workers, but years of fiscal crisis and the resistance of powerful plantation companies have blunted progress. Access to education has improved, and a small group of entrepreneurs, professionals and academics descended from planation workers has emerged. This year, the government negotiated a raise in the minimum daily wage for a plantation worker to $4.50 per day, plus an additional dollar if a worker picks more than 22 kilos in a day. Workers say this target is almost impossible to achieve, in part because tea bushes are often neglected and grow sparsely. The government has built better houses for some families and the Indian government is helping to build more, said Periyasamy Muthulingam, executive director of Sri Lanka's Institute of Social Development, which works on plantation worker rights. But many promises have gone unfulfilled. 'All political parties have promised to build better houses during elections but they don’t implement it when they are in power,' Muthulingam said. Muthulingam says more than 90% of the plantation community is landless because they have been left out of the government's land distribution programs. In this election, sitting President Ranil Wickremesinghe, standing as an independent candidate, has promised to give the line houses and the land they stand on to the people who live in them, and help develop them into villages. The main opposition candidate, Sajith Premadasa, has promised to break up the plantations and distribute the land to the workers as small holdings. Both proposals will face resistance from the plantation companies. Manohari says she's not holding out hope. She's more concerned with what's going to happen to her 16-year-old son after he was forced to drop out of school due to lack of funds. 'The union leaders come every time promising us houses and land and I would like to have them,' she said. 'But they never happen as promised.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-s-plantation-workers-live-on-the-margins-but-politicians-want-their-votes-/7788751.html	2024-09-18T02:23:02-07:00	
Japan says Chinese carrier entered its contiguous waters for first time	TOKYO/TAIPEI — A Chinese aircraft carrier entered Japan's contiguous waters for the first time on Wednesday, Japan's defense ministry said, the latest in a string of military maneuvers that has ratcheted up tensions between the neighbors. The carrier, accompanied by two destroyers, sailed between Japan's southern Yonaguni and Iriomote islands, entering an area that extends up to 24 nautical miles from its coastline where Japan can exert some controls as defined by the United Nations. Japan's Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Moriya said Tokyo had conveyed its 'serious concerns' to Beijing, describing the incident as 'utterly unacceptable from the perspective of the security environment of Japan and the region.' 'We will continue to closely monitor Chinese naval vessels' activities in the waters around our country and will take all possible measures to gather information and conduct vigilance and surveillance,' Moriya told a news conference. Japan last month lodged a protest with China after one of its naval survey vessels entered Japanese waters, shortly after an airspace breach. In July, a Japanese navy destroyer made a rare entry into China's territorial waters near Taiwan, according to the Japanese media. An uptick in Chinese military activity near Japan and around Taiwan in recent years has stoked concerns in Tokyo. Japan has responded with a defense buildup it says aims to deter China from using military force to push its territorial claims in the region. Earlier on Wednesday, Taiwan's defense ministry said it had spotted the same Chinese aircraft carrier group sailing through waters off its east coast in the direction of Yonaguni, Japan's southernmost island, which is about 110 km east of Taiwan. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its territory, has been staging regular exercises around the island for five years to pressure it to accept Beijing's claim of sovereignty, despite Taipei's strong objections. The ministry said the Chinese ships, led by Liaoning, the oldest of China's three aircraft carriers, were spotted in the early hours of the morning on Wednesday sailing through waters to the northeast of Taiwan. Taiwan tracked the ships and sent its forces to monitor, it said. China's defense ministry did not answer calls seeking comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-says-chinese-carrier-entered-its-contiguous-waters-for-first-time/7788746.html	2024-09-18T02:09:52-07:00

Britain looks to Italy for help amid surge in Channel migrants	LONDON — Human rights groups have urged Britain not to copy Italy’s approach in trying to reduce the number of migrants arriving on its shores. Their comments come after British Prime Minister Keir Starmer traveled to Rome this week to learn more about the country’s success in tackling irregular migration across the Mediterranean Sea. There has been a surge of migrants arriving in small boats from France on Britain’s southern shores. More than 800 people arrived on Saturday, pushing the total for the year so far to more than 22,000. Eight migrants drowned that same day after their inflatable dinghy hit rocks off the French coastline. The high number of migrant arrivals has become a major political issue that successive governments have struggled to solve. Starmer traveled to Italy on Monday for talks with his counterpart, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, to learn more about her country’s recent success in tackling migration across the Mediterranean Sea from north Africa. 'You've made remarkable progress working with countries along migration routes as equals, to address the drivers of migration at [the] source and to tackle the gangs. As a result, irregular arrivals to Italy by sea are down 60% since 2022. So, I am pleased that we are deepening our cooperation here,' Starmer told Meloni at a press conference after their meeting. Italy has struck deals with Libya and Tunisia worth millions of dollars to keep migrants from leaving their shores, through tougher policing on land and through the interception of boats offshore. Human rights groups accuse those countries of committing widespread abuses against migrants. Rome also signed an agreement with Albania last year to send up to 36,000 asylum-seekers annually to the Balkan country for processing. 'The model that the Italian Government has conceived of is based on centers to process asylum applications for those immigrants who disembark within Italian or EU jurisdiction, in a foreign country,' Meloni told reporters in Rome. 'That is a model that was never experimented with before. If it works — as I hope it will — everybody can understand that this can become a new way to deal with migration flow,' she added. Questions remain over the legality of Italy’s approach, said Sacha Deshmukh, CEO of the human rights group Amnesty International UK. 'Keir Starmer needs to be very careful about what lessons he thinks he should learn from Italy’s experience. Amnesty International has some deep concerns as to whether Italy is being compliant with its international legal obligations and its human rights obligations in elements of its approach, both in terms of its own practice, for example, of its migrant camps, but also in terms of Italy's deal that it struck with Albania,' Deshmukh told VOA. 'What we would hope for would be countries like the UK to have a functioning asylum system, one that considered claims properly but swiftly, and dealt humanely with people who are fleeing terrible situations in many cases,' he added. There are also doubts about whether Britain could replicate Italy’s agreement with Albania, according to Raphael Bossong, a migration expert at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs. 'To think that this can be reproduced in other settings where you don't have these particular things coming together, and to expect that there are many other countries lining up? Albania already officially said ‘no’ to various other countries who tried to follow suit. Never say never, but I think it's a highly doubtful proposition,' Bossong told VOA. Britain is giving France nearly $600 million over three years to boost the policing of French shores. Despite increased patrols along the French coast, the number of migrants who have made the journey so far this year is higher than at the same point in 2023. Prime Minister Starmer said his focus would be on returning failed asylum-seekers to their countries of origin and on better intelligence and policing to break up the smuggling gangs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-looks-to-italy-for-help-amid-surge-in-channel-migrants-/7788738.html	2024-09-18T01:52:50-07:00	
Malaysia's king to visit China Thursday	BEIJING — Malaysia's king Sultan Ibrahim will visit China starting Thursday, the first by a Malaysian monarch in a decade, where he will meet President Xi Jinping and likely seek support for projects boosting connectivity to neighboring Singapore. The ceremonial ruler from the southern state of Johor, will be accompanied by Malaysia's transport and housing ministers, a statement from the country's foreign ministry said on Wednesday. 'His Majesty's visit provides an excellent opportunity for both sides to reaffirm a shared commitment in ensuring that Malaysia-China relations continue to remain forward-looking, dynamic and prosperous,' Malaysia's foreign ministry said. Sultan Ibrahim was installed as the country's 17th king in January, under a unique system of monarchy where the heads of Malaysia's nine royal families take turns to sit on the throne every five years and are supposed to stay above politics. But the 65-year-old has indicated he intends to weigh in on the country's political issues and proposed in a media interview before his ascension that Malaysia's state oil firm Petronas and the country's anti-corruption agency report directly to the king. The last time a Malaysian king visited China was in 2014. Ibrahim will also meet China's second-ranking official, Premier Li Qiang, Malaysia's foreign ministry said. Li visited Kuala Lumpur in June and backed Malaysian plans to develop its connectivity through a $10-billion rail link to other China-backed railway projects in Laos and Thailand. Li said that the initiative would realize plans for a proposed Pan-Asia railway running from Kunming in China to Singapore, presumably through Johor, which is where the outspoken Sultan wants to develop a rail link, too. Ibrahim has spoken of plans to revive a stalled high-speed rail project between Malaysia and Singapore, with a border crossing in Forest City, a $100-billion joint venture between China's Country Garden 2007. HK and a private Malaysian company backed by the Sultan. Data compiled by the American Enterprise Institute shows the embattled Chinese developer had invested just $110 million out of the total $26 billion Chinese firms have directed to Malaysia since 2010, the bulk of which was in its metals, energy and transport sectors. The two countries' commercial ties came under the spotlight earlier this month when Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said China had protest notes to stop Malaysia's oil exploration activities in the South China Sea, but stressed the two sides continued to communicate over the issue. China claims almost the entire South China Sea as its territory based on historic maps, including parts of the exclusive economic zones of Malaysia the Philippines, Brunei, Taiwan and Vietnam. An international arbitration tribunal in 2016 said China's claim had no basis under international law, a ruling Beijing does not recognize.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-s-king-to-visit-china-thursday/7788736.html	2024-09-18T01:42:53-07:00	
Iconic US container firm Tupperware files for bankruptcy	WASHINGTON — Tupperware Brands and some of its subsidiaries filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Tuesday, the food container firm said in a statement. The company, known for its trademark food storage containers, has been hit by dwindling sales in recent years. Last year the New York Stock Exchange-listed firm warned of 'substantial doubt' about its ability to keep operating in light of its poor financial position. 'Over the last several years, the company's financial position has been severely impacted by the challenging macroeconomic environment,' president and CEO Laurie Ann Goldman said in a statement announcing the bankruptcy filing. 'As a result, we explored numerous strategic options and determined this is the best path forward,' added Goldman. The company said it would seek court approval for a sale process for the business to protect its brand and 'further advance Tupperware's transformation into a digital-first, technology-led company.' The Orlando, Florida-based firm said it would also seek approval to continue operating during bankruptcy proceedings and would continue to pay its employees and suppliers. 'We plan to continue serving our valued customers with the high-quality products they love and trust throughout this process,' Goldman said. The firm's shares were trading at $0.5099 Monday, well down from $2.55 in December last year. Tupperware said it had implemented a strategic plan to modernize its operations and drive efficiencies to ignite growth following the appointment of a new management team last year. 'The company has made significant progress and intends to continue this important transformation work.' In its filing with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, Tupperware listed assets of between $500 million and $1 billion and liabilities of between $1 billion and $10 billion. The filing also said it had between 50,000 and 100,000 creditors. Tupperware, whose name became synonymous with its airtight plastic containers, in recent years lost popularity with consumers and an initiative to gain distribution through big-box chain store Target failed to reverse its fortunes. The company's roots date to 1946, when chemist Earl Tupper 'had a spark of inspiration while creating molds at a plastics factory shortly after the Great Depression,' according to Tupperware's website. 'If he could design an airtight seal for plastic storage containers, like those on a paint can, he could help war-weary families save money on costly food waste.' Over time, Tupper's hermetically sealed plastic containers also became associated with 'Tupperware Parties,' where friends would gather with food and drink as a company representative demonstrated the items.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iconic-us-container-firm-tupperware-files-for-bankruptcy-/7788733.html	2024-09-18T01:36:11-07:00	
US decision on Nippon bid for US Steel pushed to after election, sources say	WASHINGTON/TOKYO — The U.S. national security panel reviewing Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel let the companies refile their application for approval of the deal, a person familiar with the matter said, delaying a decision on the politically sensitive merger until after the Nov. 5 presidential election. The move offers a ray of hope for the companies, whose proposed tie-up appeared set to be blocked when the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) alleged on Aug. 31 the transaction posed a risk to national security by threatening the steel supply chain for critical U.S. industries. CFIUS needs more time to understand the deal's impact on national security and engage with the parties, the person said on Tuesday. Refiling sets a new 90-day clock to review the proposed tie-up and make a decision. The review was expected to take close to the full 90 days, another person familiar with the matter said. Nippon Steel declined to comment. CFIUS and U.S. Steel did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Reuters. 'Extending the timeline takes pressure off the parties and, importantly, pushes the decision past the election in November,' said Nick Klein, a CFIUS lawyer with DLA Piper. The deal has become a political hot potato. This month, Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said at a rally in Pennsylvania, the swing state where U.S. Steel is headquartered, that she wants U.S. Steel to remain 'American owned and operated,' echoing a view held by President Joe Biden. The White House reiterated that position on Tuesday. Harris' Republican rival Donald Trump has pledged to block the deal if elected. Both candidates have sought to woo union votes. Postponing the decision to after the U.S. elections will 'dial down' the political temperature but does not guarantee approval, said David Boling, a former U.S. trade official who is now an analyst at Eurasia Group. 'Regardless of the CFIUS review, Nippon Steel still must reach an agreement with the United Steelworkers,' Boling said. 'Without that, it's very hard to see this deal happening.' The United Steelworkers Union, which vehemently opposes the deal, said on Tuesday 'nothing has changed regarding the risks that Nippon's acquisition would pose to national security or the critical supply chain concerns that have already been identified.' The deal is being closely watched in Japan, a close U.S. ally and its biggest foreign investor. 'Further strengthening economic relations, including expanding mutual investment between Japan and the U.S., are essential for both countries,' Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Hiroshi Moriya told reporters on Wednesday. Nippon Steel shares were up 1.1% in afternoon trading in Tokyo. U.S. Steel shares closed down 0.4% on Tuesday. CFIUS is concerned Nippon Steel's merger could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects, it said in its August letter to the companies, exclusively obtained by Reuters. It also cited a global glut of cheap Chinese steel, and said that under Nippon, a Japanese company, U.S. Steel would be less likely to seek tariffs on foreign steel importers. It added that decisions by Nippon could 'lead to a reduction in domestic steel production capacity.' In a 100-page response letter to CFIUS, also exclusively obtained by Reuters, Nippon Steel said it will invest billions of dollars in U.S. Steel facilities that otherwise would have been idled, 'indisputably' allowing it to 'maintain and potentially increase domestic steelmaking capacity in the United States.' The company also reaffirmed a promise not to transfer any U.S. Steel production capacity or jobs outside the U.S. and would not interfere in any of U.S. Steel's decisions on trade matters, including decisions to pursue trade measures under U.S. law against unfair trade practices. The deal, Nippon added, would 'create a stronger global competitor to China grounded in the close relationship between the United States and Japan.' Robust CFIUS reviews take 90 days but it is common for companies to withdraw their filings and resubmit them to give them more time to address the panel's concerns. According to CFIUS's 2023 annual report, 18% of companies seeking deal approval refiled their applications last year. Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed for the review in March, and CFIUS allowed them to refile in June, starting a second 90-day clock that runs out on Sept. 23, Reuters reported on Friday. In December, CFIUS could approve the deal, possibly with measures to address national security concerns, recommend that the president block it, or extend the timetable again.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-decision-on-nippon-bid-for-us-steel-pushed-to-after-election-sources-say/7788729.html	2024-09-18T01:24:45-07:00

China piles extra work on weary youth to ease pension crisis	BEIJING — China's decision to raise the retirement age will give a brief boost to its strained pension system but risks further discouraging weary young workers and cannot arrest long-term demographic decline, experts say. The ruling Communist Party last week announced a gradual increase in the statutory retirement age starting next year — rising from 60 to 63 for men, from 55 to 58 for white-collar women workers, and from 50 to 55 for blue-collar female employees. The government said the changes would bring a system that has changed little since the 1950s into line with decades of improvements in public health, life expectancy and education, and help society adapt to a shrinking population and workforce. Analysts told AFP that growing concerns over the sustainability of the nationwide pension system pushed Beijing to act. 'The pension system is under a lot of strain,' said Zhao Litao, a senior research fellow at the National University of Singapore's East Asian Institute. 'It is... clear to the leadership that the stakes for postponing the reform (were) getting increasingly high,' he said. China's retirement age had been among the youngest in the world, and officials have discussed raising it for more than a decade. Opposition from lower-wage workers, a slowing economy and high youth unemployment had thwarted change, experts said. Officials could wait no longer, Zhao said, partly because 'the pace of population-aging and population-decline is faster than previously anticipated.' Pension tension China's sprawling pension system has three pillars: basic state pensions, mandatory plans for company employees, and voluntary plans for private personal schemes. But the state-led scheme lacks coordination at a national level, while the latter two pillars remain underdeveloped, critics say. A top government think tank said in a 2019 report that one main state pension fund may dry up by 2035 as the workforce shrinks. Around a third of Chinese provinces already run pension deficits, and local finances have come under more stress since the COVID-19 pandemic. Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Australia's Victoria University, said the higher retirement age would ease pressure on the system 'in the short and medium term.' Under the new rules, the age will rise incrementally over 15 years from 2025, so younger people will end up working for longer than those currently close to retiring. Workers will eventually need to make a minimum of 20 years of contributions to draw their basic pension, up from the current 15 years. 'After the government increases the retirement age, this decline (in the number of workers) will become... slower,' Peng told AFP. But, she added, 'the labor force is still declining — this is a (longer-term) trend.' Working harder, longer But economic necessity has not necessarily bred widespread acceptance. Many posts on Chinese social media have pointed to a perceived lack of transparency over how workers born from the 1990s onwards would be impacted. Those generations already face widespread joblessness or an intense work culture that leaves many feeling overwhelmed or burnt out. 'For many Chinese individuals, these changes in retirement policies feel like a reneged commitment of social welfare provision — kicking the problem down an already murky road,' Yun Zhou, a sociologist at the University of Michigan, told AFP. 'As gender- and age-based discriminations remain deeply entrenched in the Chinese labor market, it remains to be seen to what extent workers... can enjoy effective labor rights protection,' she said. Dali Yang, professor of political science at the University of Chicago, said the government faced a 'loss of credibility' on pensions. Recent economic challenges have already prompted many Chinese to prioritize short-term cash over saving for retirement, Yang told AFP. Demography is destiny Chinese state media has said a rise in the retirement age was 'inevitable' given the country's development. The current age was set decades ago when scarcity and poverty were common, before market reforms brought rapid gains in living standards. Life expectancy rose from around 50 in the early 1960s to 79 by 2022, according to World Bank data. But development coincided with families having fewer children, hastened by decades of birth restrictions under the former one-child policy. Now, China is stuck with a growing senior population and fewer young people to fill the gap. Experts said only a suite of bold policies — from creating high-quality jobs to raising productivity, expanding public healthcare, fostering better work-life balance and raising the social position of women — could help Beijing adapt to its alarming demographic destiny. Several told AFP that last week's announcement was unlikely to be the last of its kind. 'There is still considerable room to further increase the retirement age,' Zhao, of NUS, said. But, he added, 'if (younger people) have to work longer and contribute more... they want to get answers for questions like job security and quality, and the level of future pension benefits.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-piles-extra-work-on-weary-youth-to-ease-pension-crisis/7788694.html	2024-09-17T23:36:06-07:00	
In Indonesia, Uganda and Ecuador, environmental activists risk lives for planet	PARIS — Almost 200 environmental activists were murdered last year, with the toll especially heavy in South America, according to rights group Global Witness. Here are the stories of three campaigners who have faced violence and repression trying to stop wildcat gold mining in Ecuador, illegal shrimp farming in Indonesia and a controversial oil project in Uganda. 'We have a responsibility' Daniel Frits Maurits Tangkilisan has been assaulted, arrested and prosecuted for his activism to protect a national park, but he is unbowed. 'Why be afraid? Why back down? Your home should be defended,' the 51-year-old told AFP in Jakarta, where he is awaiting a new ruling in legal proceedings against him. Born and raised in the Indonesian capital, he 'fell in love at first sight' with the remote Karimunjawa Islands National Park off Java, on his first visit in 2011. He later settled there. Daniel began to notice the growing impact of illegal shrimp farms, which began to proliferate around 2017. Run-off from the farms killed seaweed and forced marine life to move further from shore, impacting the livelihoods of fishing communities, he said. In 2022, Daniel helped start the #SaveKarimunjawa movement, which pushed for a local zoning law banning the shrimp farms. But his activism made him a target — he was threatened, assaulted and put in a chokehold, and fellow environmentalists received death threats. He was arrested in December 2023 over allegations of hate speech stemming from a Facebook post criticizing illegal shrimp farming. A local court sentenced him in April to seven months behind bars. The conviction was overturned on appeal but prosecutors took the case to the Supreme Court, insisting he should not be recognized as an environmental activist. 'This is a price that must be paid,' Daniel said of the threats and legal battles. And his activism has had some success, with recent government inspections forcing many illegal operations to shut. 'We have a responsibility to our children, grandchildren and future generations,' he said. 'If you give up... you say goodbye to your future.' 'Hell on Earth' Abdulaziz Bweete grew up in Kawempe, a shanty town in the Ugandan capital Kampala, and saw first-hand the devastating impact of environmental change in poorer communities. 'I have grown up seeing floods around but I had not interested myself in what is causing floods,' he told AFP. It took two things to galvanize the 26-year-old — going to university, and seeing the Uganda government's response to climate protests. Bweete was among a group of student organizers who marched on parliament in July with a petition opposing a multi-billion-dollar oil project that campaigners say will badly affect a delicate environment. He and several other young activists were arrested, charged with illegal assembly, and held in Kampala's maximum-security Luzira prison until August. He told AFP he and fellow protesters were beaten by police. The activist was previously imprisoned and arrested following rallies in the capital. 'All I can say is prison is a hell on Earth,' he said. 'We don't have freedom of protest in this country,' he said, glancing around nervously in Kyambogo University's lush campus setting. Demonstrations in Uganda, ruled with an iron fist by President Yoweri Museveni for four decades, are often met with a heavy-handed police response. Bweete said politics and climate change go hand in hand. 'If we have good leaders, we can have good climate policies. This is a long struggle, but we are determined to win,' he insisted. 'Defend life' Alex Lucitante, a leader of the Cofan Indigenous people on the border between Ecuador and Colombia, won a historic legal victory in 2018 over mining companies in the Amazon, striking out 52 gold mine concessions. It helped win him the Goldman Environmental Prize — the Nobel of environmental defenders — two years ago. But despite setting up a system of patrols and even drone surveillance, it has not stopped gold prospectors violating their territory. 'The destruction is still going on all around our land, and the threat is stronger,' he told AFP, telling of illegal mining, deforestation and threats from armed groups. 'Today, the situation is particularly critical in our territories,' said Lucitante. 'It all happens in plain sight and with the knowledge of the authorities,' which are 'sometimes linked to illegal actors operating in the area,' he added. The environmentalist has urged global leaders to listen to the 'voice of Indigenous communities' and hear their plea to 'defend life.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-indonesia-uganda-and-ecuador-environmental-activists-risk-lives-for-planet/7788689.html	2024-09-17T23:27:58-07:00

Gold Apollo says it did not make pagers used in Lebanon blasts	NEW TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan's Gold Apollo said on Wednesday the pagers that were used in the detonations in Lebanon on Tuesday were not made by it but by a company called BAC which has a license to use its brand. At least nine people were killed and nearly 3,000 wounded when pagers used by Hezbollah members detonated simultaneously across Lebanon on Tuesday. Images of destroyed pagers analyzed by Reuters showed a format and stickers on the back that were consistent with pagers made by Gold Apollo. A senior Lebanese security source told Reuters that Hezbollah had ordered 5,000 pagers from Taiwan-based Gold Apollo. 'The product was not ours. It was only that it had our brand on it,' Gold Apollo founder and president, Hsu Ching-Kuang, told reporters at the company's offices in the northern Taiwanese city of New Taipei on Wednesday. The company said in a statement that the AR-924 model was produced and sold by BAC. 'We only provide brand trademark authorization and have no involvement in the design or manufacturing of this product,' the statement said. Hsu earlier said that the firm with the license was based in Europe but later declined to comment on BAC's location. While Hsu was meeting with reporters, police officials arrived at the company. Hezbollah fighters began using pagers in the belief they would be able to evade Israeli tracking of their locations, two sources familiar with the group's operations told Reuters this year. Hsu said did not know how the pagers could have been rigged to explode. Iran-backed Hezbollah said it was carrying out a 'security and scientific investigation' into the causes of the blasts. Israel's Mossad spy agency planted explosives inside 5,000 pagers imported by Lebanese group Hezbollah months before Tuesday's detonations, according to a senior Lebanese security source and another source. Hsu said Gold Apollo was also a victim of the incident. 'We may not be a large company but we are a responsible one,' he said. 'This is very embarrassing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/gold-apollo-says-it-did-not-make-pagers-used-in-lebanon-blasts/7788663.html	2024-09-17T21:57:09-07:00

US Air Force general: Russia military larger, better than before Ukraine invasion	PENTAGON — Russia's military is bigger and stronger than it was prior to invading Ukraine in February 2022, the commander of United States Air Forces in Europe and Africa cautioned Tuesday. 'Russia is getting larger, and they're getting better than they were before. … They are actually larger than they were when [the invasion] kicked off,' Air Force General James Hecker told reporters at the Air & Space Forces Association's annual Air, Space & Cyber Conference. The improvements come despite heavy casualties inflicted by Ukraine. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has estimated that since 2022, more than 350,000 Russian troops have been killed or wounded. 'The rates of casualties that they're experiencing are staggering,' Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday in response to a question from VOA. On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered that the Russian army grow by 180,000 active-duty troops for a total of 1.5 million soldiers, making Russia's military the second largest in the world, behind China's. 'Russia is going to be something that we're going to have to deal with for a long time, no matter how this thing ends,' Hecker said. However, William Pomeranz, a senior scholar at the Kennan Institute, told VOA that 'this move suggests that Vladimir Putin is losing the war.' 'This is an open signal from Vladimir Putin that his army and his military is in trouble and doesn't have the resources to maintain troops in the field,' Pomeranz said. Despite Russian improvements on the battlefield, Ukraine has continued to put chinks in Russia's armor, shooting down more than 100 Russian aircraft since Moscow began its full-scale invasion, which amounts to dozens more aircraft than Russia has been able to down on the Ukrainian side, according to General Hecker. 'So what we see is the aircraft are kind of staying on their own side of the line, if you will, and when that happens, you have a war like we're seeing today, with massive attrition, cities just being demolished, a lot of civilian casualties,' he said. To gain even the slightest advantages in a war where no clear side dominates the skies, Ukraine has turned to low-cost solutions that also appeal to the U.S. military. 'We have to get on the right side of the cost curve with this. Taking down $10,000, $15,000, $20,000 one-way UAVs [drones] with $1 million missiles, we just can't afford to do that in the long-term,' the general told reporters. General Chance Saltzman, the chief of the U.S. Space Force, announced Tuesday that a Space Force pilot program that uses commercial satellite imagery and related analytics to create more situational awareness for military leaders has proven very cost-effective when compared with traditional intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance collection via U.S. MQ-9 drones, which are expensive and limited in number. AFRICOM was able to use the $40 million Tactical Surveillance, Reconnaissance and Tracking Program to maintain situational awareness during the full withdrawal of U.S. forces from two air bases in Niger in July and August. The drawback, however, was that instead of real-time situational awareness, the data took one to four hours to get to the security team. 'Not as good as real time, right? With MQ-9 that you would have, but it's better than nothing, right?' Hecker said. Hecker also said the U.S. was looking into more cost-effective ways to sense incoming threats around bases, including methods like Ukraine's Sky Fortress system that uses thousands of inexpensive sensors to identify aerial threats. He says the technology has been demonstrated in Romania and other countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-air-force-general-russia-military-larger-better-than-before-ukraine-invasion/7788601.html	2024-09-17T18:38:40-07:00	
North Korea fires short-range ballistic missiles for second time in a week	SEOUL/TOKYO — North Korea fired multiple short-range ballistic missiles Wednesday that landed in the sea off its east coast, South Korea and Japan said. The missiles lifted off from Kaechon, north of the capital, Pyongyang, around 6:50 a.m. local time and flew in a northeast direction, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, without specifying how many were fired. 'Our military is maintaining full readiness posture while strengthening surveillance and vigilance in preparation for additional launches and closely sharing information with the U.S. and Japan side,' it said in a statement. About 30 minutes after the first missile notice, Japan's coast guard said North Korea fired another ballistic missile, noting the projectiles appeared to have fallen. The U.S. Indo-Pacific Command said on X that it was aware of the launches and consulting closely with Seoul and Tokyo. The North fired several short-range ballistic missiles last Thursday, the first such launch in more than two months, which it later described as a test of a new 600 mm multiple-launch rocket system. South Korea's JCS has said the launch might have been to test the weapons for export to Russia, amid intensifying military cooperation between the two countries. The United States, South Korea and Ukraine, among other countries, have accused Pyongyang of supplying rockets and missiles to Moscow for use in the war in Ukraine, in return for economic and other military assistance. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui, who is visiting Russia this week to attend conferences, met her counterpart Sergey Lavrov in Moscow on Tuesday and discussed ways to promote bilateral ties, the Russian foreign ministry said on its website. Wednesday's missile launches also came days after the isolated country for the first time showed images of centrifuges that produce fuel for its nuclear bombs, as leader Kim Jong Un visited a uranium enrichment facility and called for more weapons-grade material to boost the arsenal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-fires-short-range-ballistic-missiles-for-second-time-in-a-week/7788598.html	2024-09-17T18:29:10-07:00	
China’s influence campaign intensifies as US election nears	washington — At first glance, Noah R. Smith might seem like your typical social media user. His bio says he’s a father, a former 'Track and Field representative,' and a current member of the PanAm Sports organization. On July 14, a day after the first assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump, Smith shared three posts from an account named 'TRUMP WON.' One post declared, 'AMERICA was attacked today … we must get it together. It’s literally a matter of life and death,' accompanied by an image depicting a divine hand halting a bullet aimed at Trump. Another post urged 'all MAGA GOD Fearing Patriots' to connect, stating, 'Grow These Accounts, UNITED We Are Strong.' While it might seem that Smith is a devoted Trump supporter, closer inspection suggests otherwise. His cover photo features Chinese watermarks, his profile picture is sourced from a company that provides photos, videos and music, and his bio is lifted from an authentic account named Laurel R. Smith. In reality, Noah R. Smith is impersonating a U.S. voter who supports Trump. A joint investigation by VOA Mandarin and Doublethink Lab (DTL), a Taiwanese social media analytics firm, uncovered 10 such accounts on X. These accounts are linked to China’s Spamouflage network — a state-sponsored operation aimed at supporting the Chinese government and undermining its critics. This network was first identified by social media analytics company Graphika in 2019 and was used to target Hong Kong pro-democracy protesters at that time. Following the assassination attempt on July 14, the accounts began promoting pro-Trump content. Previously, they shared material consistent with Spamouflage’s broader interests: defending China, criticizing U.S. foreign policy, and exploiting divisive domestic issues such as gun violence and racial tensions. DTL labeled this network of accounts posing as Americans 'MAGAflage 1,' because they all seem to be promoting Trump’s slogan 'Make America Great Again [MAGA].' 'The MAGAflage accounts are different because they are not just criticizing stuff. They are amplifying positive content about Trump,' Jasper Hewitt, a digital intelligence analyst at Doublethink Lab, told VOA Mandarin. He added that it’s too early to draw conclusions about whom China is supporting, as researchers are still tracking accounts that criticize both Republican candidate Donald Trump and Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. 'Engaging with the MAGA movement, or any part of the political spectrum, might merely be a new attempt to generate authentic traffic,' Hewitt told VOA. The first MAGAflage network was discovered by Elise Thomas, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue, in April 2024. This network focuses on promoting positive content of Trump. She told VOA earlier that by wrapping a topic in a U.S. partisan political frame, these accounts got 'a reasonable amount of engagement from real American users.' Limited influence The VOA Mandarin investigation revealed that the accounts operate in coordination. Six out of the 10 accounts were created in 2015 but had their first visible posts on May 18 or May 19, 2022. The batch accounts — the 10 new accounts — are not very active. Each account has roughly 100 posts or reposts over the last two years. The batch accounts were inactive for one year but were awoken after the first Trump assassination attempt. Additionally, these accounts occasionally post or repost Chinese content. For example, an account named Super-Rabbit shared praise for China's political and economic model from state-linked influencers like Shanghai Panda and Xinhua News Agency’s reporter Li Zexin. One post from September 3 contrasted U.S. President Joe Biden’s inactivity with China’s President Xi Jinping’s engagement in Africa. 'When Joe Biden is sitting on the beach wasted away, China’s President Xi is shaking hands with various African leaders and making a better impact in Africa,' the post said. VOA contacted the Trump and Harris campaigns for comment but did not receive a response as of publication time. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in a statement that 'China has no intention and will not interfere in the U.S. election, and we hope that the U.S. side will not make an issue of China in the election.' So far, the newly discovered MAGAflage 1 accounts have had limited influence, with only a handful of followers and minimal interactions. U.S. intelligence agencies issued their latest assessment earlier this month, warning that Russia, Iran, and China are intensifying efforts to influence the U.S. presidential election. While Russia remains the primary concern, officials noted that Chinese online influence actors have 'continued small scale efforts on social media to engage U.S. audiences on divisive political issues, including protests about the Israel-Gaza conflict and promote negative stories about both political parties.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-influence-campaign-intensifies-as-us-election-nears/7788292.html	2024-09-17T18:22:02-07:00	
Senate Republicans again block legislation to guarantee rights to IVF	WASHINGTON — Republicans have blocked for a second time this year legislation to establish a nationwide right to in vitro fertilization, arguing that the vote is an election-year stunt after Democrats forced a vote on the issue. The Senate vote was Democrats' latest attempt to force Republicans into a defensive stance on women's health issues and highlight policy differences between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in the presidential race, especially as Trump has called himself a 'leader on IVF.' The 51-44 vote was short of the 60 votes needed to move forward on the bill, with only two Republicans voting in favor. Democrats say Republicans who insist they support IVF are being hypocritical because they won't support legislation guaranteeing a right to it. 'They say they support IVF — here you go, vote on this,' said Illinois Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the bill's lead sponsor and a military veteran who has used the fertility treatment to have her two children. The Democratic push started earlier this year after the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that frozen embryos can be considered children under state law. Several clinics in the state suspended IVF treatments until the GOP-led legislature rushed to enact a law to provide legal protections for the clinics. Democrats quickly capitalized, holding a vote in June on Duckworth's bill and warning that the U.S. Supreme Court could go after the procedure after it overturned the right to an abortion in 2022. The bill would establish a nationwide right for patients to access IVF and other assisted reproductive technologies and a right for doctors and insurance companies to provide it, an effort to pre-empt state efforts to limit the services. It would also require more health insurers to cover it and expand coverage for military service members and veterans. In a statement after the vote, Harris said Republicans in Congress 'have once again made clear that they will not protect access to the fertility treatments many couples need to fulfill their dream of having a child.' Republican vice presidential candidate and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, who missed the vote because he was campaigning, said during a stop in Wisconsin that the measure was not a serious IVF bill, but a measure designed to make Republicans look bad. 'The Senate blocked a ridiculous showboat bill that had no chance of passing,' Vance said. Republicans argued that the federal government shouldn't tell states what to do and that the bill was an unserious effort. Only Republican Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska voted with Democrats to move forward on the bill both times. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the No. 2 Senate Republican, said that Democrats are trying to create a political issue 'where there isn't one.' 'Let me remind everybody that Republicans support IVF, full stop,' Thune said just before the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-republicans-again-block-legislation-to-guarantee-rights-to-ivf/7788589.html	2024-09-17T18:06:40-07:00	
Separatists in Indian Kashmir turn to mainstream politics	Beerwah, Kulgam and Srinagar, Indian administered Kashmir — Several Kashmiri political figures, including former members of banned separatist groups, have abandoned long-held separatist leanings and joined mainstream Indian politics. This shift in the disputed Himalayan region’s political landscape comes as three weeks of voting begin on Wednesday in the first legislative assembly election since 2019 when India stripped Jammu and Kashmir, or J&K, of its limited autonomy. One such Kashmiri figure is Sarjan Ahmad Wagay, a prominent cleric whose anti-India anthems became popular during a 2016 uprising. Wagay is running simultaneously from prison in two central Kashmir constituencies known as Ganderbal and Beerwah. His family says that Wagay’s decision to run was inspired by the success of Sheikh Abdul Rashid, who while imprisoned in New Delhi’s Tihar Jail won a J&K seat in the Indian parliament during national elections earlier this year. 'Rashid’s victory gave his family a hope that winning the election could help get him out of prison,' a family member, Rehbar Ahmad, told VOA. 'People from Beerwah and Ganderbal visited our home and assured us of their support,' Ahmad said. 'He was popular in these areas because he used to deliver religious sermons there. He is getting a lot of support from the like-minded people who want to see political prisoners out of jail.' In the heart of Kulgam district, Sayar Ahmad Reshi, a member of the banned Jamaat-e-Islami, is campaigning door-to-door. The socio-religious organization was banned by the Indian government in early 2019, accused of engaging in activities that 'threatened India’s security, integrity and sovereignty.' More than three decades ago, Jamaat-e-Islami participated in the Indian elections of 1987, but the group attributed its defeat to vote-rigging and has boycotted subsequent elections. This year, Jamaat-e-Islami decided to again participate in the elections but could not field candidates as a party because of the ban. Instead, they encouraged at least 10 members of their organization to run as independent candidates across the Kashmir Valley. 'Jamaat-e-Islami has never had issues with India, yet the organization is accused of promoting anti-India activities,' Reshi told VOA. 'If any individual was involved in such a movement, it was their own doing because there were no directives from our leadership,' he added. 'If Jamaat-e-Islami hadn’t been banned, I would have contested under its banner with a clear manifesto for social reform and justice,' Reshi said. 'I am hopeful that independent candidates of Jamaat-e-Islami will emerge victorious.' Political analyst Muzamil Maqbool told VOA that many people who long opposed the integration of Kashmir with central India have changed their minds since the region’s special autonomy was repealed in 2019. 'Kashmiri people are a leader-driven population, and all those leaders have deceived people through and through,' he said. 'Now the same people are exercising their power under democracy through voting and taking part in elections.' The candidacies of individuals previously associated with separatism have caused alarm among the region’s strongest traditional parties, the National Conference, or NC, and the Peoples Democratic Party, or PDP. Both parties suspect that the nationally ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has encouraged the trend in a bid to divide the vote and marginalize the regional parties. 'New Delhi always wanted to create an alternative here through the newly registered political parties which failed to score ... in the recently held parliamentary elections,' Maqbool said. 'However, there has been an entire paradigm shift where the focus has been shifted to many individuals, young faces and religious leaders to create an independent alternative force against regional mainstream parties.' Earlier, veteran separatist leader Salim Geelani, switched to mainstream politics after spending 35 years in Hurriyat Conference, an amalgam of separatist political parties in the Valley. He said that his decision to join PDP was driven by common goals including promoting infrastructure development and resolving Kashmir’s status within India. 'How can I deny the fact that I carry an Indian passport and use Indian currency? J&K remains a conflict zone and the people who lost their lives over the years, regardless of their identities, were our children,' he told VOA. 'Had there been no Kashmir issue the situation would be different today. I favored dialogue between all stakeholders of the region to resolve the Kashmir issue and I shall be in its favor forever,' he added. BJP national spokesperson Shazia Ilmi welcomed the decision of those who have chosen to show faith in Indian democracy rather than pursue separatist goals. 'Everyone has a right to contest elections in a democracy and our democracy allows that. Nobody has a right to make statements that are secessionist in nature that promote any kind of disintegration of the country,' Ilmi told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/separatists-in-indian-kashmir-turn-to-mainstream-politics/7788585.html	2024-09-17T17:59:26-07:00	
US lawmakers welcome Russian activist freed in August prisoner swap	WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers welcomed Vladimir Kara-Murza to Capitol Hill Tuesday, celebrating the release of the Russian activist from a Kremlin prison last month. Kara-Murza was part of the biggest prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Russia since the end of the Cold War. Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Ben Cardin said Tuesday that Kara-Murza 'was at the forefront of the human rights struggle and an inspiration for so many people around the world.' In a letter written upon Kara-Murza's release, Cardin said, 'Your return home is both a personal victory and a testament to the unwavering strength of the human spirit.' Democratic Representative Bill Keating described Kara-Murza as one of the people Russian President Vladimir Putin most despises because of his ability to speak directly to the Russian people. Kara-Murza has twice survived suspected poisoning attempts. Kara-Murza, a deputy leader of the People's Freedom Party, was arrested in Russia in April 2022 and later faced charges of treason and spreading disinformation about the Russian military. Russian prosecutors suggested he face the maximum 25-year sentence in a prison colony. Kara-Murza was awarded the Václav Havel Human Rights Prize by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe in October 2022 and the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 2024. 'Surreal doesn't come close to describing what I feel — just a few weeks ago sitting in a maximum-security prison in Siberia and now seeing so many friends in the halls of the U.S. Congress,' Kara-Murza told a gathering of lawmakers, journalists and activists on Capitol Hill. Kara-Murza thanked the public for keeping their attention focused on his situation. 'The only way we will be able to achieve long-term peace, stability, security and democracy on the European continent will be with a peaceful, free and democratic Russia,' he said. The Biden administration secured the release of 16 detainees in return for the release of eight detainees and two minors on Aug. 1. James O'Brien, assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs, thanked Kara-Murza for his work on the Global Magnitsky Act, bipartisan legislation that authorizes the U.S. government to sanction government officials throughout the world who are human rights offenders. 'Vladimir, you gave us one of the main tools that we use to focus our advocacy for your freedom in the Global Magnitsky Act, and your work on that, I'm sure you didn't do it as a tool for yourself, but your work on that has helped us enormously as we work to free prisoners in the Western Hemisphere, in other countries across the world,' O'Brien said. Democratic Senator Chris Coons said Putin is still holding untold numbers of political prisoners in Russia. 'We must realize [Putin] does that, like all authoritarians, because he's afraid, afraid of his own people, afraid of accountability, afraid of the Ukrainians who just on the border of Russia are fighting with determination,' Coons said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-welcome-russian-activist-freed-in-august-prisoner-swap-/7788568.html	2024-09-17T17:25:01-07:00	
North Korea seen likely to escalate tensions ahead of US election	WASHINGTON — As the U.S. presidential election approaches, North Korea will likely escalate tensions on the Korean Peninsula in an attempt to get attention and increase leverage for future negotiations with the United States, analysts said. On Friday, North Korea’s official Korean Central News Agency (KCNA) and Rodong Sinmum newspaper released several photos showing leader Kim Jong Un visiting what the North’s media said is a uranium enrichment facility. It was the first time the North has disclosed a uranium enrichment facility publicly. In a recent speech marking the 76th anniversary of the founding of his government, Kim said North Korea will 'redouble its measures and efforts to make all the armed forces of the state, including the nuclear force, fully ready for combat.' Kim said he was acting because of the 'grave threat' posed by 'the reckless expansion' of a U.S.-led regional military bloc, according to KCNA. It remains unclear what the revelation means for the North’s nuclear capability, but it drew international attention. Nuclear escalation Despite the disclosure, the European Union said Monday that North Korea will never have the status of an acknowledged nuclear weapon state. 'The EU position is that the DPRK must immediately comply with UN Security Council resolutions by abandoning all its nuclear weapons, other weapons of mass destruction, ballistic missile programmes and existing nuclear programmes, in a complete, verifiable and irreversible manner and cease all related activities,' said a spokesperson for the EU in an email to VOA Korean. Evans Revere, who served as acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said Kim probably believes that Trump, of the two presidential candidates, is more likely to help North Korea advance its agenda. 'Pyongyang wants to be accepted as a nuclear state and it is trying to undermine and eventually end the U.S.-ROK [South Korea] alliance and get rid of U.S. forces who are stationed on and around the Korean Peninsula,' Revere told VOA Korean Friday on the phone. 'Which of the two U.S. presidential candidates does North Korea see as more likely to help achieve its goals?' he asked. Revere, however, said he does not view North Korea’s recent actions as aimed at swaying the U.S. presidential election, stressing that what North Korea does and says is 'not always about us.' Sydney Seiler, who was the national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council from 2020-2023, told VOA Korean in a Zoom interview Thursday it may be 'a step too far' to assume North Korea is trying to influence the upcoming election in the U.S. through its provocative behaviors. However, Seiler said, Pyongyang could be tweaking the timing of its actions 'to remain on everybody’s radar screen.' Seiler predicted that North Korea will hold off on its next major provocations, such as a seventh nuclear test, until after the next U.S. president is elected. North Korea’s intention Park Won-gon, a professor in the Department of North Korean Studies of Ewha Womans University in Seoul, told VOA Korean Friday that the North Korean regime may have considered testing its nuclear weapons for a seventh time to show that President Joe Biden’s North Korea policy has not worked and to 'turn it to Trump’s advantage.' 'The situation, however, has now changed,' Park said. 'Trump has been touting his close relationship with Kim Jong Un, so Pyongyang may have concluded that another nuclear test will not help Trump.' Hong Min, a senior research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul, agreed that North Korea is not likely to conduct the seventh nuclear test before the November election. 'None of the countries that possess nuclear weapons have disclosed their nuclear facilities, especially enriched uranium facilities, but making such an unprecedented disclosure was to replace the nuclear test card,' Hong told VOA Korean Friday. Kim In-tae, senior research fellow at South Korea’s Institute for National Security Strategy, said a seventh nuclear test is still a possibility. 'North Korea’s foreign ministry declared it will prepare itself for a long-term nuclear confrontation with the United States,' Kim told VOA Korean Friday, referring to a Sept. 9 statement released by Pyongyang. 'They are now saying that they will strengthen their nuclear offensive from a longer-term perspective, regardless of the U.S. presidential election,' Kim said there is a possibility that North Korea will gradually ramp up its provocations, up to the test of a nuclear weapon. North Korea conducted its sixth nuclear test in September 2017. VOA’s Kim Hyungjin contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-seen-likely-to-escalate-tensions-ahead-of-us-election/7788564.html	2024-09-17T17:12:38-07:00	
Experts say voters should feel confident in US elections this year	washington — American voters face a challenging duality as they count down the days until November's presidential election: a security landscape that officials say has become ever more dangerous even as the infrastructure to hold elections has become ever-more secure. The run-up to the 2024 election has seen the 'most complex threat landscape yet,' according to Cait Conley, a senior adviser at the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), the government body responsible for overseeing election security. 'We do see a growing and diverse array of foreign adversaries, foreign actors, trying to disrupt our elections,' Conley said Tuesday, speaking at Politico's AI and Tech Summit in Washington. But U.S. voters should feel confident, she added. 'We have been surging resources,' Conley said. 'We have seen tremendous investment and progress in ensuring the full spectrum of security and resilience of our election infrastructure.' Nevertheless, Conley and other U.S. officials acknowledge the dangers are widespread, often extending beyond the voting booth. Physical threats The FBI and U.S. Postal Service said Tuesday they are investigating suspicious packages sent to election workers in at least 12 states. CISA officials have reported a growing number of swatting incidents — false reports to emergency services about violence or an emergency at a home or other location — targeting election workers. And the number of direct threats is rising rapidly. 'We are seeing an unprecedented and extremely disturbing level of threats of violence, and violence, against public officials,' said U.S. Deputy General Lisa Monaco, also speaking at the summit in Washington. 'For sure weekly and, sometimes, daily,' Monaco said of the frequency of the threats. Many of the threats target officials responsible for conducting elections. 'These are people who are simply volunteering their time to help all of us undertake the most fundamental right,' she said. 'These are people who are being threatened simply for doing their job.' Officials also warn that other public servants are getting a growing number of threats, including law enforcement officers, prosecutors and elected officials and candidates. 'It's serious,' said Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, citing Sunday's apparent assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump as he played golf at his course in West Palm Beach, Florida. He also pointed to the rash of threats in Springfield, Ohio, following the spread of unsubstantiated rumors about Haitian immigrants eating pets. 'We are in a heightened threat environment … a threat environment that is of deep concern,' Mayorkas said. 'It requires vigilance at every level of government and frankly on every block of each community across this country.' Concerns about the heightened threat environment are not new. Homeland Security officials have been warning of the dangers since at least January 2021, saying lone offenders or small groups could be motivated to carry out attacks motivated by a range of political and personal grievances. Only now, high emotions over the election combined with efforts by U.S. adversaries are fueling discontent and anger that could lead to more attacks. Cyber operations 'When it comes to malign influence campaigns, we are seeing a very aggressive set of actors,' Monaco said. Many of the efforts to sow discord have originated in Russia and Iran, and to a lesser extent China. But they are far from alone. 'We're seeing more actors in this space acting more aggressively in a more polarized environment and doing more with technologies, in particular AI,' Monaco said. Earlier this month, the U.S. Justice Department took action against what it said were two Russian plots to spread disinformation, taking down 32 fake news websites while bringing charges against two employees of Russia-backed media outlet RT, accusing them of funneling nearly $10 million to a U.S. company to promote material favorable to the Russian government. And last week, the U.S. State Department accused a number of Russian media companies, including RT, of working directly for Russia's intelligence agencies – charges Russia and RT denied. US preparations The best defense, Monaco said, is for U.S. voters to be careful about where they get their information. 'We have to be very vigilant on what we are consuming,' she said. Experts like Margaret Talev, who directs the Syracuse University Institute for Democracy, Journalism and Citizenship in Washington, agree. Voters should 'take a pause. Take a minute,' Talev told VOA. 'It involves all of us teaching ourselves, taking our time and trying to verify information from multiple sources rather than just believing the first thing that we see.' The National Association of Secretaries of State (NASS), whose members play key roles in running elections, has also sought to make getting verified information easier, pushing a social media campaign it calls #TrustedInfo2024. NASS says its goal is 'to promote election officials as the trusted sources of election information during the 2024 election cycle and beyond.' And CISA, the cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency, has been working with election officials across the country to make sure they are ready for almost any contingency. CISA officials have also tried to rein in the hype about the dangers of AI, or artificial intelligence, blamed for helping U.S. adversaries to spread disinformation more effectively. 'Generative AI is not going to fundamentally introduce new threats to this election cycle,' the agency's Conley told VOA earlier this month. While AI is exacerbating existing threats, so far it has not produced anything elections officials have not already seen. 'This threat vector is not new to them,' Conley said. 'And they have taken the measures to ensure they're prepared to respond effectively.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-say-voters-should-feel-confident-in-us-elections-this-year/7788251.html	2024-09-17T17:11:53-07:00	
Partial lunar eclipse will be visible during September's supermoon	new york — Get ready for a partial lunar eclipse and supermoon, all rolled into one. The spectacle will be visible in clear skies across North America and South America Tuesday night and in Africa and Europe Wednesday morning. A partial lunar eclipse happens when the Earth passes between the sun and moon, casting a shadow that darkens a sliver of the moon and appears to take a bite out of it. Since the moon will inch closer to Earth than usual, it'll appear a bit larger in the sky. The supermoon is one of three remaining this year. 'A little bit of the sun's light is being blocked so the moon will be slightly dimmer,' said Valerie Rapson, an astronomer at the State University of New York at Oneonta. The Earth, moon and sun line up to produce a solar or lunar eclipse anywhere from four to seven times a year, according to NASA. This lunar eclipse is the second and final of the year after a slight darkening in March. In April, a total solar eclipse plunged select cities into darkness across North America. No special eye protection is needed to view a lunar eclipse. Viewers can stare at the moon with the naked eye or opt for binoculars and telescopes to get a closer look. To spot the moon's subtle shrinkage over time, hang outside for a few hours or take multiple peeks over the course of the evening, said KaChun Yu, curator at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. 'From one minute to the next, you might not see much happening,' said Yu. For a more striking lunar sight, skywatchers can set their calendars for March 13. The moon will be totally eclipsed by the Earth's shadow and will be painted red by stray bits of sunlight filtering through Earth's atmosphere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/partial-lunar-eclipse-will-be-visible-during-september-s-supermoon-/7788213.html	2024-09-17T15:13:35-07:00	
Tariffs in U.S.-China trade war may impact U.S. consumers, experts say	The Biden and Trump administrations have accused China of unfair trade practices and flooding international markets with artificially cheap goods.

Iranian president pledges deeper ties with Moscow, state media says	Moscow — Iran's president committed his country to deeper ties with Russia to counter Western sanctions on Tuesday, state media reported, amid U.S. worries that Tehran is supplying Moscow missiles to hit Ukraine. Russia's top security official Sergei Shoigu arrived in the Iranian capital days after meeting North Korean leader Kim Jong Un in Pyongyang. More than two and a half years into its conflict with Ukraine, Moscow has been seeking to develop ties with the two nations, both hostile to the United States. 'My government will seriously follow ongoing cooperation and measures to upgrade the level of relations between the two countries,' the state IRNA news agency quoted Iranian president Masoud Pezeshkian as telling Shoigu, Secretary of Russia's Security Council. 'Relations between Tehran and Moscow will develop in a permanent, continuous and lasting way. Deepening and strengthening relations and cooperation between Iran and Russia will reduce the impact of sanctions.' The United States views Moscow's growing relationships with Pyongyang and Tehran with concern and says both are supplying Russia with ballistic missiles for use in the conflict in Ukraine. Iran has denied sending ballistic missiles to Russia. Moscow has said only that Iran is Russia's partner in all possible areas. Shoigu's trips are taking place at a crucial moment in the war, as Kyiv presses the United States and its allies to let it use Western-supplied long-range weapons to strike targets such as airfields deep inside Russian territory. President Vladimir Putin said last week that Western countries would be fighting Russia directly if they gave the green light, and that Moscow would respond. The Nour news agency, affiliated to Iran's Supreme National Security Council, said Shoigu met his Iranian opposite number, Ali Akbar Ahmadian. There was no immediate information on the outcome of the meeting. Russia has repeatedly said it is close to signing a major agreement with Iran to seal a strategic partnership between the two countries. Shoigu was Russian defense minister until May, when he was appointed secretary of the Security Council that brings together President Vladimir Putin's military and intelligence chiefs and other senior officials. Apart from meeting North Korea's Kim last week, he also held talks in St. Petersburg with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iranian-president-pledges-deeper-ties-with-moscow-state-media-says/7788086.html	2024-09-17T12:51:14-07:00	
Myanmar diaspora protests at Chinese Embassy in Washington	Washington — More than 50 Burmese Americans gathered in front of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, protesting China's alleged interference in Myanmar's internal affairs. The protest on Saturday, part of a global campaign, called on China to withdraw its support for Myanmar's military junta and respect the will of the people, who have been fighting for democracy since the February 2021 coup. The protest — with demonstrators waving banners that read 'Reject Junta's Sham Elections' and 'Solidarity With the People of Myanmar' — was sparked by a statement released earlier Saturday by the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar, saying that China was not interfering in the country's affairs and would continue to promote peace and stability. 'We reject the Chinese Embassy's statement that they're not interfering in Myanmar's internal matters,' said Yin Aye, a protest leader who has been organizing demonstrations in the Washington area since the 2021 coup. 'If they would stop supporting sham elections and truly pressure the military to stop causing so much pain to our people, we might believe them.' Yin Aye referred to China's close ties with Myanmar's military junta and its alleged interference in the operations of ethnic resistance forces in northern Shan State, actions that have drawn widespread criticism from Burmese and pro-democracy groups. On August 29, the Ta'ang National Liberation Army, or TNLA, an armed ethnic group fighting against the junta in northeastern Myanmar, said it had received a letter from Chinese authorities in the border town of Ruili warning the group to halt its offensive in northern Shan State, where key Belt and Road Initiative projects are located, or face consequences. Hla Kyaw Zaw, a veteran observer of China-Myanmar relations, said China's recent actions, particularly its warning to the TNLA, have sparked outrage among the Myanmar public, who view it as a direct threat to ethnic resistance forces fighting for democracy. 'The language used in the letter was undiplomatic and threatening,' Hla Kyaw Zaw told VOA’s Burmese Service. A spokesperson for the TNLA told VOA that Chinese authorities had warned the group in the letter to stop fighting, maintain stability along the China-Myanmar border and protect Chinese citizens. The letter warned that failure to comply would result in China 'teaching them a lesson' and holding the group responsible for any consequences. When asked about the letter at a regular press briefing in late August, China’s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Liu Jian did not confirm or deny Beijing had sent the letter. 'China is closely following the situation in Myanmar and the developments of the conflict in northern Myanmar and has been working to promote peacetalks and ceasefire,' spokesperson Liu Jian said. 'As Myanmar’s biggest neighboring country, China has all along sincerely hoped that Myanmar will achieve stability and development and has worked actively to this end.' Since then, members of the Myanmar diaspora have intensified protests outside Chinese embassies worldwide, accusing China of supporting Myanmar's military coup. Protests worldwide Saturday's protest in Washington was part of a series of coordinated demonstrations by Burmese diaspora communities worldwide. In July, activists in Washington, New York, San Francisco, London and Tokyo protested outside Chinese embassies and consulates. In the July protest in Washington, protesters attempted to hand deliver an open letter to Chinese authorities, urging Beijing to halt its support for Myanmar's military junta. However, the letter went unanswered. 'When we handed the letter to the Chinese embassy here in D.C., they refused to accept it. They didn't even acknowledge our demands,' said Yin Aye. Activists were instructed to send the letter by post, but previous attempts to mail similar letters to the Chinese Embassy were returned undelivered. Despite the lack of formal response, Myanmar activists say the Chinese Embassy in Washington has been monitoring their protest activities in recent weeks. 'Now, we see them videotaping our protests,' Yin Aye said. Voice of America reached out to the Chinese embassies in Washington and Yangon for comment about the protests but did not receive a response by the time of publication. War crimes allegations The Myanmar diaspora argues that China's support for Myanmar's military is not only undermining the will of the people but also enabling war crimes, including aerial bombardments and the targeting of internally displaced persons. Minmin Berwald, an activist of Myanmar descent, was compelled to participate in the protest on Saturday. 'I want to ask China to immediately stop supporting this military regime and interfering in Burma's internal affairs,' Berwald said. 'It's not just homes being set on fire. Internally displaced people who have fled war are being bombarded.' China's contradictory stance China has maintained a complex position toward Myanmar since the February 2021 coup, balancing its own interests with regional stability, Hla Kyaw Zaw said. She noted that China has sent high officials to Myanmar, called for peace in the country and sponsored mediating talks between the junta and the armed ethnic groups. After the coup, however, China's official Xinhua news agency described the military's takeover and replacement of elected ministers as a 'major cabinet reshuffle,' avoiding the use of the term 'coup.' Beijing called for all parties in Myanmar to 'resolve their differences' and refrained from condemning the military. In 2022, China also abstained from voting on U.N. Security Council Resolution 2669, which called for an end to violence in Myanmar. However, critics argue that China's actions on the ground suggest deeper involvement. A veteran China-Myanmar affairs expert in Yangon, who requested anonymity for security reasons, said China's statements often appear contradictory. 'It's clear that China wants to control the situation to its advantage,' the expert said, referring to China's public calls for peace while its actions suggest otherwise. China, for its part, has denied interfering in Myanmar's internal affairs on multiple occasions. In its statement Saturday, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar reiterated its position of noninterference and called for a peaceful resolution to the conflict. The embassy also condemned what it called 'unjustified accusations' from individuals and media. The fight continues Protesters also called for China to take a more active role in cutting off support to Myanmar's junta, including halting the supply of jet fuel used in airstrikes against civilians. Amnesty International has documented multiple cases of the Myanmar military using airpower to target civilian areas, and activists argue that China's continued engagement with the junta implicates them in these atrocities. For now, the protesters have vowed to keep returning to the Chinese Embassy in Washington. 'We will continue to protest, continue to speak out,' said Yin Aye.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-diaspora-protests-at-chinese-embassy-in-washington/7788046.html	2024-09-17T12:33:41-07:00	
Zimbabwe starts providing free treatment for women with obstetric fistula	Chinhoyi, Zimbabwe — Zimbabwe's government has given in to pressure from rights groups and is now providing free treatment to women with obstetric fistula, a condition that makes it hard for mothers who went through difficult labor to control their bowels. For a closer look, VOA visited Chinhoyi, a farming and mining area about 150 kilometers west of Harare, where early marriages are common, and where the treatment is being offered. Among the first beneficiaries of the treatment were young women at Chinhoyi Provincial Hospital after government gynecologists had performed surgery to address their cases of obstetric fistula. Twenty-three-year old Chiedza, not her real name as she requested that VOA protect her identity, was visibly happy as she had not been able to control her bowels since giving birth to her son seven years ago. 'When I gave birth I tore my private parts, so I couldn’t hold my feces,' she said. 'It would just come out on its own. I would just feel something on my body flowing. I stayed like that because I did not have money to seek services of gynecologists to correct my condition. So, when I heard about this free service on a WhatsApp group for women, I called a toll-free number which was there and I came here. So I am now going to live a comfortable life. I can now perform even house chores comfortably.' Another woman who asked to be called Tendai ruptured her bladder after protracted labor at home while giving birth at the age of 16. 'I would share nappies with my baby so as to block my smell from others,' she said. 'At one time I almost committed suicide because people kept on laughing at my condition. I thought I had been bewitched till I came here and saw that there are some people in my condition. I am grateful for this procedure for it has given me hope.' The World Health Organization estimates that between 50,000 and 100,000 women experience obstetric fistula every year and that about 2 million women in sub-Saharan Africa are living with the condition. Dr. Stanley Ngwaru, a senior gynecologist in Zimbabwe’s ministry of health, says the condition is an abnormal communication between the woman's genital tract and the urinary tract or the rectum. 'They suffer shame and they suffer social segregation,' he said. 'It's very common in young women, because the genital tract is not well developed and when they go into labor, they are more likely to suffer from obstruction and this can lead to these communications are developing between the genital tract and the unit tract and the rectum.' Lucia Masuka, head of Amnesty International in Zimbabwe, says she commends the government for offering the free service. However, she believes authorities needs to develop a strategy to help prevent this condition from afflicting young women in the first place. 'If we therefore facilitate access to sexual reproductive health services for this group, it will reduce instances of early pregnancies, and in turn, reduce cases of obstetrics fistula,' she said. 'Whilst treatment is a positive development, it's akin to trying to mop water from an open tap; you will never really be able to mop that water as long as the tap is open.' Amnesty International in Zimbabwe last year pleaded with parliament to push the government to make obstetric fistula treatment a national issue after its research had revealed that the condition was rampant among young women in Zimbabwe and was not getting enough attention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-starts-providing-free-treatment-for-women-with-obstetric-fistula/7788024.html	2024-09-17T11:57:36-07:00	
Pentagon inspector general: Ukraine is 'job one' for defense oversight	Washington — Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the U.S. Congress has appropriated $174 billion, including U.S. weapons and materiel, to respond to the crisis and help Ukraine defend itself against Russia’s aggression. U.S. Department of Defense Inspector General Robert Storch calls the oversight of U.S. security assistance to Ukraine his office’s 'job one,' with more than 200 people assigned to that task. In an interview with Voice of America’s Ukrainian Service, Storch discussed the challenges in obtaining the information necessary for such oversight in a country that is fighting a war, suffers from endemic corruption and has no large-scale U.S. military presence. According to the most recent quarterly Special Inspector General report to the U.S. Congress on Operation Atlantic Resolve (the name of the U.S. military response to Russian operations in Ukraine), issued in mid-August, there were 57 open investigations as of June 30, 2024. They involved 'grant and procurement fraud, corruption, theft, program irregularities, and diversion and counter-proliferation of technology of weapons systems components.' In January, Ukraine’s SBU security service reported that it had uncovered a $40 million corruption scheme, implicating defense ministry officials and arms supplier managers, that involved the embezzlement of funds for purchase of 100,000 mortar shells. That case did not involve U.S.-provided materiel. However, in September 2023, Oleksii Reznikov was removed as Ukraine’s defense minister 'over various corruption cases despite enjoying a solid reputation in representing Ukraine in its discussions with Western allies,' Reuters reported. Storch told VOA that the Pentagon is working with Ukraine’s military to ensure that it provides timely and accurate information, and with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s government to fight corruption. He said that in the days immediately following Russia’s full-scale invasion, Ukraine’s armed forces were delinquent in providing information, but that the situation has improved, in part thanks to oversight. While corruption remains endemic in Ukraine, Storch said that Ukraine’s anti-corruption institutions are maturing and that the oversight community is working to ensure that such progress continues. The following has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: You are overseeing numerous Pentagon programs. How robust is oversight of the delivery of weapons to Ukraine? Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Defense Robert Storch: We are leading a robust, comprehensive oversight effort that really covers all aspects of U.S. assistance to Ukraine. I have responsibility over the security assistance that's provided, and we partner very closely, hand-in-glove, with our great colleagues from the State Department Office of Inspector General and the U.S. Agency for International Development Office of Inspector General to make sure we're covering all aspects of humanitarian or other assistance that's being provided to Ukraine. VOA: How large is your team that is overseeing the Ukrainian program? Storch: We have a lot of things pulling at us and lots going on in the world with the Department of Defense. But Ukraine is very much job one. I always say it's really a matter of the highest priority for my office and for my colleagues’ offices as well. So, in the case of the Department of Defense Office of Inspector General, we have over 200 people who are engaged in one aspect or another of oversight over U.S. security assistance to Ukraine. That includes about 30 people who were forward deployed in the region. We have several offices in Germany. We have folks in Poland. And we have both investigators and programmatic oversight personnel at the [U.S.] Embassy in Kyiv. If you take all of our partners from State and AID in oversight entities, it is between 300 and 400 people who are engaged in oversight in this whole-of-government effort. VOA: When you talk to Ukrainian officials, do they appreciate the importance of reporting? Storch: Without exception, they acknowledge the importance of making sure that we get the information we need to be able to do our oversight to make sure there's accountability, and frankly to be able to tell the decision-makers here in Washington that that's going on. … I go up to the Hill [Capitol Hill, location of the U.S. Congress] not infrequently. And you know, I'm not a policymaker. It's up to the administration and the Congress to set what the policies are. But one of the things I get asked all the time is, ‘Are we getting the information we need to carry out our work?’ and we have been getting that, and we're going to work to make sure we continue to. VOA: The Pentagon transfers materiel to the Ukrainian armed forces. Do they understand the importance of oversight, and do they provide timely self-reporting? Storch: We work really closely to make sure that's the case. That's one of the big lines of effort with regard to our oversight. We've done a number of reports looking at the monitoring and the reporting. There are obligations that the Ukrainian armed forces have for reporting on the status of the equipment, and U.S. personnel keep track and there's a database. When things are lost or destroyed, they have to be reported in a certain way. … [T]hat's one area where I like to think that our oversight has really made a difference. When we first started on that, the level of delinquency in that reporting was really pretty high, and some of that was because, when the war started, the U.S. personnel had to leave the country. There was equipment being provided and really no one doing that sort of accountability and inventory. So, a lot of it has been playing catch-up. And … there are challenges with a wartime setting and a lot of this equipment is being used on the front lines and [in] really difficult and sad situations. And so being able to maintain accountability is difficult, but we do a lot of work on that. VOA: In one of your reports, you mentioned endemic corruption in Ukraine. You worked in Ukraine in 2007 to 2009 to help the country overcome corruption. Can you compare the situation in Ukraine now to what you saw back then? Storch: I actually had the opportunity to work and live in Ukraine back in 2007 to 2009, when I was with the Department of Justice working with the Ukrainians to help them develop measures to address official corruption. And I had the opportunity to go back on a number of occasions and provide assistance in the drafting of the anti-corruption legislation, and that created the National Anti-Corruption Bureau and the Office of the Special Anti-Corruption Prosecutor, so I have had a lot of experience out there and have seen the way these institutions have matured. The Ukrainians made it happen ... But Ukraine has had long-standing issues with corruption, obviously, and people are working to address it. One of the things we talk about in our quarterly reporting … is that they're continuing to make efforts to address it, and we continue as the United States both to provide assistance in that, and then, in the oversight community, to do oversight over that to make sure that progress is being made. VOA: Your report mentions that there are 57 investigations ongoing into allegations ranging from irregularities in procurement to corruption, diversion and theft. Have any of those allegations been substantiated? Storch: At this point, based on our completed work, we haven't substantiated those allegations, but obviously the investigations continue, right? VOA: About half of the allegations involve the proliferation of weapons. How high is the risk of diversion? Storch: Sure, there's a significant risk there, but we always want to make sure we're doing everything we can to address it, and that's why I mention the programmatic oversight. We have a website [with] links to the hotlines that my office and our counterparts operate. I really encourage folks to take advantage of that to report that information. So, people can look into it. VOA: There is reporting that the Pentagon overestimated the value of some of the U.S. equipment destined for Ukraine. Do you think this accounting error will persist or is it being corrected? Storch: We're doing everything we can to help the [Defense] Department to address it. We became concerned about that pretty early on and consulted with the department about it and, without getting too complex, basically the department was using a methodology to value the materiel that was being provided that resulted in an overvaluation of it. If you were donating your car, you probably wouldn't be able to donate the cost of buying a new car like that, right? It's a little more complicated than that, but basically it resulted in an overvaluation. Initially the Department looking into it found about $6.2 billion that they thought was overstated. We came in and did additional oversight, which is reflected in our reporting, and found about $1.9 billion additionally. So, the answer to your question is we made recommendations to help the Department address the issues, and we're going to keep working to make sure those recommendations are carried out and the problems addressed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-inspector-general-ukraine-is-job-one-for-defense-oversight/7787995.html	2024-09-17T11:57:25-07:00

US court upholds British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's sex trafficking conviction	new york — A U.S. court on Tuesday upheld disgraced British socialite Ghislaine Maxwell's conviction on sex trafficking charges for helping the late financier Jeffrey Epstein abuse underage girls. Maxwell's lawyers had argued that her convictions violated an agreement Epstein reached with federal prosecutors 15 years ago and violated the statute of limitations. They also cited judicial error and a miscalculation of the federal sentencing guidelines range as reason to reject her conviction and sentence. But the ruling by the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said Epstein's non-prosecution agreement with federal prosecutors in Florida didn't bar federal prosecutors in New York from bringing a case. They also found that Maxwell's indictment was within the statute of limitations. Maxwell, 62, was found guilty in December 2021 of luring young girls to Epstein so he could molest them, between 1994 and 2004. She was sentenced to 20 years in prison in June 2022. Epstein sexually abused children hundreds of times over more than a decade, exploiting vulnerable girls as young as 14. Prosecutors said Maxwell, his longtime companion, helped him and made the abuse possible. He killed himself in 2019 while awaiting trial. Epstein and Maxwell's associations with royals, presidents and billionaires were not a prominent part of her trial but mentions of friends such as Bill Clinton and Donald Trump showed how the pair exploited their connections to impress their prey. The trial revolved around allegations from only a handful of Epstein's accusers. Four testified that they were abused in the 1990s and early 2000s at Epstein's mansions in Florida, New York, New Mexico and the Virgin Islands. Maxwell is serving her sentence at a low-security federal prison in Tallahassee, Florida.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-court-upholds-british-socialite-ghislaine-maxwell-s-sex-trafficking-conviction-/7787757.html	2024-09-17T09:39:55-07:00	
Dozens wounded after pagers detonate in Lebanon, media and security officials say	BEIRUT — Dozens of people were wounded in Beirut's suburbs and other parts of Lebanon after their handheld pagers exploded Tuesday, Lebanese state media and security officials said. A senior military intelligence official and an official with a Lebanese group with knowledge of the situation, both of whom spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the situation, said that pagers carried by Hezbollah members were detonated. The second official said it was believed to be an Israeli attack. The state-run National News Agency reported that in Beirut's southern suburbs and other areas 'the handheld pagers system was detonated using advanced technology, and dozens of injuries were reported.' It wasn't immediately clear if people were killed. A Hezbollah official said that at least 150 people, including members of the group, were wounded in different parts of Lebanon when the pagers they were carrying exploded. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media, said the explosions were the result of 'a security operation that targeted the devices.' 'The enemy (Israel) stands behind this security incident,' the official said, without elaborating. He added that the new pagers that Hezbollah members were carrying had lithium batteries that apparently exploded. Lithium batteries, when overheated, can smoke, melt and even catch on fire. The Associated Press reached out to the Israeli military and they declined to comment. The incident comes at a time of heightened tensions between Lebanon and Israel. The Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and Israeli forces have been clashing near-daily for more than 11 months against the backdrop of war between Israel and Hezbollah ally Hamas in Gaza. The clashes have killed hundreds in Lebanon and dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. Photos and videos from Beirut's southern suburbs circulating on social media and in local media showed people lying on the pavement with wounds on their hands or near their pants pockets. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah previously warned the group's members not to carry cellphones, saying that they could be used by Israel to track their movements and to carry out targeted strikes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-wounded-after-pagers-detonate-in-lebanon-media-and-security-officials-say-/7787548.html	2024-09-17T07:30:21-07:00	
Facebook owner Meta bans Russia state media outlets over 'foreign interference'	London — Meta said it's banning Russia state media organization from its social media platforms, alleging that the outlets used deceptive tactics to amplify Moscow's propaganda. The announcement drew a rebuke from the Kremlin on Tuesday. The company, which owns Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram, said late Monday that it will roll out the ban over the next few days in an escalation of its efforts to counter Russia's covert influence operations. 'After careful consideration, we expanded our ongoing enforcement against Russian state media outlets: Rossiya Segodnya, RT and other related entities are now banned from our apps globally for foreign interference activity,' Meta said in a prepared statement. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov lashed out, saying that 'such selective actions against Russian media are unacceptable,' and that 'Meta with these actions are discrediting themselves.' 'We have an extremely negative attitude towards this. And this, of course, complicates the prospects for normalizing our relations with Meta,' Peskov told reporters during his daily conference call. RT was formerly known as Russia Today. Rossiya Segodnya is the parent company behind state news agency RIA Novosti and news brands like Sputnik. 'It's cute how there's a competition in the West — who can try to spank RT the hardest, in order to make themselves look better,' RT said in a release. Rossiya Segodnya did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Meta's actions comes days after the United States announced new sanctions on RT, accusing the Kremlin news outlet of being a key part of Russia's war machine and its efforts to undermine its democratic adversaries. U.S. officials alleged last week that RT was working hand-in-hand with the Russian military and running fundraising campaigns to pay for sniper rifles, body armor and other equipment for soldiers fighting in Ukraine. They also said RT websites masqueraded as legitimate news sites but were used to spread disinformation and propaganda in Europe, Africa, South America and elsewhere. Earlier this month, the Biden administration seized Kremlin-run websites and charged two RT employees of covertly providing millions of dollars in funding to a Tennessee-based content creation company to publish English-language social media videos pushing pro-Kremlin messages. Moscow has rejected the allegations. Meta had already taken steps to limit Moscow's online reach. Since 2020 it has been labeling posts and content from state media. Two years later, it blocked state media from running ads and putting their content lower in people's feeds, and the company, along with other other social media sites like YouTube and TikTok, blocked RT's channels for European users. Also in 2022 Meta also took down a sprawling Russia-based disinformation network spreading Kremlin talking points about the invasion of Ukraine. Meta and Facebook 'already blocked RT in Europe two years ago, now they're censoring information flow to the rest of the world,' RT said in its statement. Moscow has fought back, designating Meta as an extremist group in March 2022, shortly after sending troops into Ukraine, and blocking Facebook and Instagram. Both platforms — as well as Elon Musk's X, formerly known as Twitter, which is also blocked — were popular with Russians before the invasion and the subsequent crackdown on independent media and other forms of critical speech. The social media platforms are now only accessible through virtual private networks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/facebook-owner-meta-bans-russia-state-media-outlets-over-foreign-interference-/7787477.html	2024-09-17T06:48:43-07:00	
French man admits to drugging wife so he and dozens of men could rape her	AVIGNON, France — A 71-year-old French man acknowledged in court on Tuesday that over nearly a decade, he was drugging his wife at the time and inviting dozens of men to rape her, as well as raping her himself. He pleaded with her and their three children for forgiveness. 'Today I maintain that, along with the other men here, I am a rapist,' Dominique Pelicot told the court. 'They knew everything. They can't say otherwise.' Pelicot's testimony is the most important moment so far in a trial that has shocked and gripped France and raised awareness about sexual violence. Many also hope his testimony will shed some light — to try to understand the unthinkable. While he previously confessed to investigators, the court testimony will be crucial for the panel of judges to decide on the fate of some 50 other men standing trial alongside him. Many deny having raped Gisele Pelicot, saying they were manipulated by her then-husband or claiming they believed she was consenting. Gisele Pelicot has become a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France for agreeing to waive her anonymity in the case, letting the trial be public and appearing openly in front of the media. She is expected to speak in court after her ex-husband's testimony on Tuesday. Under French law, the proceedings inside the courtroom cannot be filmed or photographed. Dominique Pelicot is brought to the court through a special entrance inaccessible for the media, because he and some other defendants are being held in custody during the trial. Defendants who are not in custody come to the trial wearing surgical masks or hoods to avoid having their faces filmed or photographed. After days of uncertainty due to his medical state, Dominique Pelicot appeared in court Tuesday and told judges he acknowledged all the charges against him. His much-awaited testimony was delayed by days after he fell ill, suffering from a kidney stone and urinary infection, his lawyers said. Seated in a wheelchair, Pelicot spoke to the court for an hour, from his early life to years of abuse against his now ex-wife. Expressing remorse, his voice trembling and at times barely audible, he sought to explain events that he said scarred his childhood and planted the seed of vice in him. 'One is not born a pervert; one becomes a pervert,' Pelicot told judges, after recounting, sometimes in tears, being raped by a male nurse in a hospital when he was 9 years old and then being forced to take part in a gang rape at age 14. Pelicot also spoke of the trauma endured when his parents took a young girl in the family, and witnessing his father's inappropriate behavior toward her. 'My father used to do the same thing with the little girl,'' he said. 'After my father's death, my brother said that men used to come to our house.' At 14, he said, he asked his mother if he could leave the house, but 'she didn't let me.' 'I don't really want to talk about this, I am just ashamed of my father. In the end, I didn't do any better,' he said. Asked about his feelings toward his wife, Pelicot said she did not deserve what he did. 'From my youth, I remember only shocks and traumas, forgotten partly thanks to her. She did not deserve this, I acknowledge it,' he said in tears. At that moment, Gisele Pelicot, standing across the room, facing him across a group of dozens of defendants sitting in between them, put her sunglasses back on. Later, Dominique Pelicot said, 'I was crazy about her. She replaced everything. I ruined everything.' A security agent caught Pelicot in 2020 filming videos under women's skirts in a supermarket, according to court documents. Police searched Pelicot's house and electronic devices and found thousands of photos and videos of men engaging in sexual acts with Gisele Pelicot while she appears to lie unconscious on their bed. With the recordings, police were able to track down a majority of the 72 suspects they were seeking. Gisele Pelicot and her husband of 50 years had three children. When they retired, the couple left the Paris region to move into a house in Mazan, a small town in Provence. When police officers called her in for questioning in late 2020, she initially told them her husband was 'a great guy,' according to legal documents. They then showed her some photos. She left her husband, and they are now divorced. He faces 20 years in prison if convicted. Besides Pelicot, 50 other men, ages 26 to 74, are standing trial.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-man-admits-to-drugging-wife-so-he-and-dozens-of-men-could-rape-her/7787468.html	2024-09-17T06:47:31-07:00	
Sean 'Diddy' Combs arrested; indictment expected to be unsealed	NEW YORK — Sean 'Diddy' Combs was expected to appear before a federal judge in New York on Tuesday after his indictment on undisclosed criminal charges. The music mogul was arrested late Monday in Manhattan, roughly six months after federal authorities conducting a sex trafficking investigation raided his luxurious homes in Los Angeles and Miami. The indictment detailing the charges was expected to be unsealed Tuesday morning, according to U.S. Attorney Damian Williams. Over the past year, Combs has been sued by people who say he subjected them to physical or sexual abuse. He has denied many of those allegations and his lawyer, Marc Agnifilo, called the new indictment an 'unjust prosecution.' 'He is an imperfect person, but he is not a criminal,' Agnifilo said in a statement late Monday. Combs, 54, was recognized as one of the most influential figures in hip-hop before a flood of allegations that emerged over the past year turned him into an industry pariah. In November, his former girlfriend, the R&B singer Cassie, whose legal name is Casandra Ventura, filed a lawsuit saying he had beaten and raped her for years. She accused Combs of coercing her and others into unwanted sex in drug-fueled settings. The suit was settled in one day, but months later CNN aired hotel security footage showing Combs punching and kicking Cassie and throwing her on the floor. After the video aired, Combs apologized, saying, 'I was disgusted when I did it.' Combs and his attorneys, however, denied similar allegations made by others in a string of lawsuits. Douglas Wigdor, a lawyer for Cassie, said in a statement Tuesday that 'neither Ms. Ventura nor I have any comment. We appreciate your understanding and if that changes, we will certainly let you know.' A woman said Combs raped her two decades ago when she was 17. A music producer sued, saying Combs forced him to have sex with prostitutes. Another woman, April Lampros, said Combs subjected her to 'terrifying sexual encounters,' starting when she was a college student in 1994. The AP does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly, as Cassie and Lampros did. Combs, the founder of Bad Boy Records, has gotten out of legal trouble before. In 2001, he was acquitted of charges related to a Manhattan nightclub shooting two years earlier that injured three people. His then-protege, Shyne, was convicted of assault and other charges and served about eight years in prison.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sean-diddy-combs-arrested-indictment-expected-to-be-unsealed/7787440.html	2024-09-17T06:19:22-07:00

US boosts military ties with Southeast Asian countries	The United States has deepened its cooperation with allies in the Indo-Pacific region in recent years, including Japan and South Korea. But it has also reached out to non-allies, including non-aligned countries of Southeast Asia like Indonesia. VOA's Virginia Gunawan reports. Camera: Ahadian Utama, Hafizh Sahadeva.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-boosts-military-ties-with-southeast-asian-countries/7787394.html	2024-09-17T05:43:05-07:00	
Analysts say Vietnam official's US trip could set path to C-130 deal	HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam — Analysts say this week’s visit to Washington by Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang shows advances in cooperation between the two countries, despite rising Vietnamese nationalism that may indicate rising anti-American sentiment in Vietnam. A U.S.-based analyst told VOA on September 12 that Giang’s trip set the groundwork for Hanoi to potentially purchase military cargo planes from the United States this year. Giang met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin at the Pentagon on Monday. [September 9] Both leaders 'reaffirmed the importance of the U.S.-Vietnam partnership,' the Defense Department said in a statement, and noted the one-year anniversary of the elevation of the countries’ ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership, the highest tier in Hanoi's diplomatic hierarchy. The leaders also underscored the importance of working together to address the lasting impacts of the U.S.-Vietnam War. Austin announced that the U.S. would budget $65 million over the next five years to complete the decontamination of Bien Hoa airbase of dioxin, bringing the total from department to $215 million. The airbase was the primary storage site for the toxic chemical Agent Orange during the U.S.-Vietnam War and remains an environmental and public health hazard for those nearby. Andrew Wells-Dang, who leads the Vietnam War Legacies and Reconciliation Initiative at the United States Institute of Peace, told VOA by phone on September 5 that diplomatic visits are key to advancing war-remediation efforts, including finding and identifying the remains of missing soldiers. He said that along with the U.S. visit of Deputy Defense Minister Vo Minh Luong in July, visits from authorities provide 'opportunity for them to have high level support.' Zachary Abuza, a professor at the National War College in Washington and an expert on Southeast Asia, said joint war-reconciliation efforts also set the groundwork for defense cooperation more broadly. 'The United States is very pleased with the growth in bilateral defense relations, and it started from very low levels and was built on humanitarian missions,' Abuza said during the August 29 call. 'We've just continued to build on that,' he added. Cargo planes Reuters reported in July that Hanoi was considering purchasing Lockheed Martin C-130 cargo planes from the U.S., according to unnamed sources. The U.S.-based analyst, who asked that his name to be withheld because he has not been cleared to discuss the topic, said the C-130 deal was discussed but not finalized during Giang's visit. The analyst said the deal was held back by the 'massive [U.S.] bureaucracy' and because solidifying the purchase during the Washington visit would be 'too inflammatory for the Chinese.' Ian Storey, senior fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, noted Vietnam's delicate diplomatic balancing act, illustrated by Giang's travel itinerary before the Washington trip. 'Vietnam aims to keep its relations with the major powers in balance,' he wrote in an email on August 30. 'As such, Vietnamese Defense Minister Phan Van Giang visited Russia and China in August.' Storey added that the purchase of C-130 planes would not pose a threat to China in its maritime territorial disputes with Vietnam. 'C-130 aircraft would enable the Vietnamese to transport troops and supplies to its occupied atolls in the South China Sea, but these assets are non-strategic and won't shift the dynamics in the South China Sea,' he wrote. Nguyen The Phuong, a maritime security expert at the University of New South Wales Canberra, said the C-130 purchase would be a 'symbolic move.' 'Vietnam will try to explore more areas of security and defense cooperation between Vietnam and the United States to upgrade to a higher, more meaningful level,' he told VOA on August 30. 'The C-130 would be the symbol of that kind of evolving relationship,' he said. Phuong said a C-130 is a likely entry point as there is still mistrust between the former foes regarding lethal weapons, and the deal would not rankle China too much. 'It could be quite advantageous for Vietnam,' he said of a potential C-130 purchase. 'Vietnam can improve its relationship with the United States, and at the same time, we could not anger China because Vietnam would just buy non-lethal weapons.' Rising nationalism Although there are positive signs to improving Hanoi-Washington relations, there have also been recent instances of anti-Western sentiment that could be an impediment to the countries relations, Phuong said. Fulbright University Vietnam, which has significant backing from the United States, is facing accusations of fomenting a 'color revolution,' similar to the popular uprisings in former Soviet republics. On August 21, Vietnam National Defense TV aired a critique of Fulbright for allegedly not displaying the Vietnamese flag at a graduation ceremony and facilitating a color revolution. The report has since been taken down, but Phuong said the Fulbright issue and other recent incidents show tension between Vietnam's conservative and liberal factions. 'It's a presentation of a continuous struggle between different factions, one conservative and one liberal,' Phuong said. Abuza said that Vietnamese authorities may be attempting to tighten control ahead of the anniversary of the end of the Vietnam War in 1975. 'Next April is the 50th anniversary of the fall of Saigon,' he said. 'The Vietnamese want to control that narrative 100%. There are a lot of sensitivities.' Along with the Fulbright incident, Phuong pointed to recent uproar around Vietnamese celebrities who were pictured with the South Vietnam flag while traveling to the United States. In addition, a Vietnamese high school student faced cyber bullying and was summoned by police after posting in September that he wanted to leave the country and would 'probably never see the [Communist] Party positively again.' 'There's extreme nationalism in Vietnam at the moment,' Phuong said. 'It's against Western values.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-say-vietnam-officials-us-trip-could-set-path-to-c-130-deal/7782903.html	2024-09-17T05:25:29-07:00	
China says it tailed a US spy plane through the sensitive Taiwan Strait	TAIPEI, Taiwan — Chinese warplanes tailed a U.S. military aircraft through the sensitive Taiwan Strait on Tuesday, China's military said. The U.S. aircraft was a P-8A Poseidon patrol and reconnaissance plane, capable of conducting long-range anti-submarine warfare, according to a statement by the People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command. Chinese military forces 'organized warplanes to tail and monitor the U.S. aircraft's flight and handled it in accordance with the law,' said Li Xi, a senior colonel and spokesperson for the command. 'Theater command troops will remain on constant high alert and resolutely safeguard national sovereignty and security as well as regional peace and stability,' he added. The U.S. Navy didn't immediately comment on the incident. China claims the self-ruled island of Taiwan as its own territory and bristles at other countries' patrolling the body of water separating it from the island. On Friday, Germany sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait in its first transit of the disputed waters in more than two decades, drawing criticism from Beijing. In 2001, a U.S. surveillance plane and a Chinese navy fighter collided mid-air near the Chinese island province of Hainan, resulting in the Chinese pilot's death. The U.S. said its plane was in international airspace and the accident was the result of reckless flying by the Chinese side.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-tailed-a-us-spy-plane-through-the-sensitive-taiwan-strait-/7787330.html	2024-09-17T04:44:12-07:00	
Casualties in Myanmar push Southeast Asia's death toll from Typhoon Yagi past 500	BANGKOK — Floods and landslides in Myanmar triggered by last week’s Typhoon Yagi and seasonal monsoon rains have claimed at least 226 lives, with 77 people missing, state-run media reported Tuesday. The new figures push the total number of dead in Southeast Asia from the storm past 500. The accounting of casualties has been slow, in part due to communication difficulties with the affected areas. Myanmar is wracked by a civil war that began in 2021 after the army seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi. Independent analysts believe the ruling military controls much less than half of the country’s territory. Typhoon Yagi earlier hit Vietnam, northern Thailand and Laos, killing almost 300 people in Vietnam, 42 in Thailand and four in Laos, according to the ASEAN Coordinating Center for Humanitarian Assistance. It said 21 people were killed in the Philippines, with another 26 missing. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, said on Monday that an estimated 631,000 people may have been affected by flooding across Myanmar. There were already 3.4 million displaced people in Myanmar at the beginning of September, according to the U.N. refugee agency, mostly because of war and unrest in recent years. Heavy rains from the typhoon and the seasonal monsoon brought widespread flash floods to Myanmar, especially the central regions of Mandalay, Magway, Bago and the Ayeyarwaddy Delta; the eastern states Shan, Kayah, Kayin and Mon; and the country’s capital, Naypyitaw. Some flooded areas have started to see water levels recede but others in the Shan and Kayah states remain critical. More than 160,000 houses have been damaged and 438 temporary relief camps have been opened for more than 160,000 flood victims, Myanma Alinn reported. The military government announced that nearly 240,000 people have been displaced. Myanma Alinn said 117 government offices and buildings, 1,040 schools, 386 religious buildings, roads, bridges, power towers, and telecom towers were damaged by the floods in 56 townships. It also said nearly 130,000 animals were killed and more than 259,000 hectares of agricultural land were damaged by the floods. The U.N.’s humanitarian affairs agency said food, drinking water, medicine, clothes, dignity kits, and shelters are urgent needs for the flood victims but alleviation efforts are hampered by blocked roads, damaged bridges and ongoing armed clashes. Vice Senior Gen. Soe Win, the second-ranking member of Myanmar’s ruling military council, said the country had received relief aid from other countries, and some humanitarian assistance from the Association of Southeast Asia, will arrive soon. Soe Win, speaking at a meeting of the National Disaster Management Committee on Monday, said that the extent of flooding in the capital was unprecedented, and cleaning and rehabilitation activities in the flooded areas began Thursday as the water level declined. Myanmar experiences extreme weather during the monsoon virtually every year. In 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed more than 138,000 people around the Irrawaddy River delta. The then-military government was harshly discredited when it delayed acceptance of outside aid. ​	https://www.voanews.com/a/casualties-in-myanmar-push-southeast-asia-s-death-toll-from-typhoon-yagi-past-500-/7787322.html	2024-09-17T04:32:32-07:00

Big Tech, calls for looser rules await new EU antitrust chief	Brussels — Teresa Ribera will have to square up to Big Tech, banks and airlines if confirmed as Europe's new antitrust chief, while juggling calls for looser rules to help create EU champions. Nominated Tuesday by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for the high-profile antitrust post, Ribera has been Spain's minister for ecological transition since 2018. The 55-year-old Spanish socialist, one of Europe's most ambitious policymakers on climate change, will have to secure European Parliament approval before taking up her post. As competition commissioner, she will be able to approve or veto multi-billion euro mergers or slap hefty fines on companies seeking to bolster their market power by throttling smaller rivals or illegally teaming up to fix prices. One of her biggest challenges will be to ensure that Amazon, Apple, Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Meta comply with landmark rules aimed at reining in their power and giving consumers more choice. Apple, Google and Meta are firmly in outgoing EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager's crosshairs for falling short of complying with the Digital Markets Act. Another challenge will be how to deal with the increasing popularity of artificial intelligence amid concerns about Big Tech leveraging its existing dominance. Ribera may ramp up a crackdown on non-EU state subsidies begun by Vestager aimed at preventing foreign companies from acquiring EU businesses or taking part in EU public tenders with unfair state support. Recent rulings from Europe's highest court, which backed the Commission's $14.5 billion tax order to Apple, and its $2.7 billion antitrust fine against Google, could embolden Ribera to take a tough line against antitrust violations. That would mean she would be in no hurry to ease up on antitrust rules, despite Mario Draghi's call to boost EU industrial champions so that they are able to compete with U.S. and Chinese competitors. Ribera was also named on Tuesday as executive vice president of a clean, just and competitive energy transition, tasked with ensuring that Europe achieves its green goals. Her credentials include negotiating deals last year among EU countries on emissions limits for trucks and a contentious upgrade of EU power market rules.	https://www.voanews.com/a/big-tech-calls-for-looser-rules-await-new-eu-antitrust-chief-/7787303.html	2024-09-17T04:10:20-07:00

Jailed Iranian Nobel laureate urges action against oppression of women	PARIS — Jailed Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi on Monday urged the international community to act to end the oppression of women in Iran, two years after the start of a women-led protest movement. 'I call on international institutions and people around the world... to take active action,' she said in a letter written in Tehran's Evin prison on Saturday, and published by her foundation on Monday. 'I urge the United Nations to end its silence and inaction in the face of the devastating oppression and discrimination by theocratic and authoritarian governments against women by criminalizing gender apartheid,' she said. The 'Woman, Life, Freedom' protests were sparked by the death in custody of a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd called Mahsa Amini on September 16, 2022, after she was arrested for allegedly breaching the country's strict dress code for her gender. Mohammadi — who has campaigned against the compulsory wearing of the headscarf for women and the death penalty in Iran — has been in Tehran's Evin prison since November 2021. She has spent much of the past decade in and out of jail. On Sunday she was one of 34 women in the Evin prison to stage a 24-hour symbolic hunger strike on the second anniversary of the protest movement 'in solidarity with the protesting people of Iran, against the government's oppressive policies,' her foundation said. Mohammadi's children received the Nobel Peace Prize on her behalf in 2023 while she was incarcerated. Since the Islamic revolution of 1979, women in Iran have to cover their hair and neck in public. The 'Woman, Life, Freedom' demonstrations were crushed by the authorities, with rights group Amnesty International saying security forces used assault rifles and shotguns in the crackdown. Human rights groups say at least 551 people were killed. Thousands more were arrested, according to the United Nations. But Mohammadi was defiant. 'Despite the challenging road ahead, we all know that nothing is as it was before,' she wrote. 'The people feel the greatest change in their beliefs, lives, and society. A change that, while it has not yet toppled the Islamic Republic regime, has shaken the foundations of religious tyranny.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jailed-iranian-nobel-laureate-urges-action-against-oppression-of-women/7787264.html	2024-09-17T03:01:57-07:00	
Venezuela ramped up repression after disputed vote, UN says	CARACAS/GENEVA — President Nicolas Maduro's government escalated repressive tactics to crush peaceful protests and keep power after Venezuela's disputed election in July, a U.N. report said on Tuesday. Electoral authorities awarded the vote to Maduro, without showing all tallies, but the opposition said its candidate Edmundo Gonzalez won by a landslide with counts proving that. More than two dozen people died in protests with 2,400 arrested. The U.N. fact-finding mission, which interviewed several hundred people remotely or in third countries as it is denied access to Venezuela, said authorities tried to dismantle the opposition, block independent information, and stop protests. 'We are facing a systematic, coordinated and deliberate repression by the Venezuelan government, which responds by a conscious plan to silence any form of dissent,' mission head Marta Valinas told journalists in Geneva. 'The government has instrumentalized the entire state apparatus, including especially the justice system, with a view to silencing any difference of opinion that opposes its scheme and to staying in power at any price.' According to the mission, 24 out of 25 deaths were caused by gunshot wounds, mostly to the neck. Arrests under the feared 'knock knock' operation - referring to the unexpected arrival at houses of government critics - often affected ordinary citizens in poor neighborhoods. The Maduro government has blamed right-wing, foreign-instigated 'extremists' and 'fascists' for the latest bout of violence in the South American oil producer that has seen waves of protests crushed during his more than decade-long rule. There was no immediate statement from Venezuelan authorities in response to the U.N. mission, which said it had tried to contact them for its investigation to no avail. The U.N. report said repression around the election was orchestrated from Maduro down and marked a new milestone in the deterioration of rule of law in Venezuela. 'The main public authorities abandoned all semblance of independence and openly deferred to the executive,' it said, noting that a climate of fear had been created. Allegations of disappearances, torture and other cruel treatment have increased since 2019, the report said. Opposition candidate Gonzalez has gone to Spain and requested asylum after a warrant was issued for his arrest in Venezuela. U.N.-mandated investigations do not have legally binding powers but the abuses they document are sometimes used in international courts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-ramped-up-repression-after-disputed-vote-un-says/7787258.html	2024-09-17T02:51:46-07:00	
COP29 leaders unveil climate funding and energy storage goals	LONDON — Less than two months ahead of the COP29 United Nations Climate Summit, the Azerbaijani leadership laid out its plans on Tuesday for what it hoped to achieve, as countries continue to wrestle with how to raise ambitions for a new financing target. The main task for the November summit is for countries to agree on a new annual target for funding that wealthy countries will pay to help poorer nations cope with climate change. Many developing countries say they cannot upgrade their targets to cut emissions faster without first receiving more financial support to invest in doing this. With countries remaining far from agreement on the financing goal, the COP29 presidency this week outlined more than a dozen side initiatives that could raise ambitions, but do not require party negotiation and building consensus which can hamper progress. These take the form of new funds, pledges, and declarations that national governments can adopt. Notably, this includes a fund with voluntary contributions from fossil fuel producing countries and companies for the public and private sectors working on climate issues, as well as grants that can be doled out to assist with climate-fueled natural disasters in developing countries. Such side agendas use 'the convening power of COP and the hosts’ respective national capabilities to form coalitions and drive progress,' said Mukhtar Babayev, who holds the rotating COP presidency, in a letter to all parties and stakeholders. Over 120 countries pledged at last year's COP28 summit in Dubai, for example, to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030. The COP29 presidency also hopes to build support around a pledge to increase global energy storage capacity six times above 2022 levels, reaching 1,500 gigawatts by 2030. This would include a commitment to scale up investments in energy grids, adding or refurbishing more than 80 million km by 2040. Babayev, who is Azerbaijan's minister of ecology and natural resources, said the agenda would 'help to enhance ambition by bringing stakeholders together around common principles and goals.' 'We hope to address some of the most pressing issues while also highlighting remaining priorities,' he said. Another declaration would see countries and companies create a global market for clean hydrogen, addressing regulatory, technological, financing and standardization barriers. COP29 leaders have also appealed for a 'COP Truce' that would highlight the importance of peace and climate action. Despite countries' existing climate commitments, carbon dioxide emissions from burning fossil fuels hit a record high last year, and the world just registered its hottest summer on record as temperatures climb.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cop29-leaders-unveil-climate-funding-and-energy-storage-goals/7787233.html	2024-09-17T01:31:36-07:00	
France uses tough, untested cybercrime law to target Telegram's Durov	PARIS — When French prosecutors took aim at Telegram boss Pavel Durov, they had a trump card to wield - a tough new law with no international equivalent that criminalizes tech titans whose platforms allow illegal products or activities. The so-called LOPMI law, enacted in January 2023, has placed France at the forefront of a group of nations taking a sterner stance on crime-ridden websites. But the law is so recent that prosecutors have yet to secure a conviction. With the law still untested in court, France's pioneering push to prosecute figures like Durov could backfire if its judges balk at penalizing tech bosses for alleged criminality on their platforms. A French judge placed Durov under formal investigation last month, charging him with various crimes, including the 2023 offence: 'Complicity in the administration of an online platform to allow an illicit transaction, in an organized gang,' which carries a maximum 10-year sentence and a $556,300 fine. Being under formal investigation does not imply guilt or necessarily lead to trial, but indicates judges think there's enough evidence to proceed with the probe. Investigations can last years before being sent to trial or dropped. Durov, out on bail, denies Telegram was an 'anarchic paradise.' Telegram has said it 'abides by EU laws,' and that it's 'absurd to claim that a platform or its owner are responsible for abuse of that platform.' In a radio interview last week, Paris Prosecutor Laure Beccuau hailed the 2023 law as a powerful tool for battling organized crime groups who are increasingly operating online. The law appears to be unique. Eight lawyers and academics told Reuters they were unaware of any other country with a similar statute. 'There is no crime in U.S. law directly analogous to that and none that I'm aware of in the Western world,' said Adam Hickey, a former U.S. deputy assistant attorney general who established the Justice Department's (DOJ) national security cyber program. Hickey, now at U.S. law firm Mayer Brown, said U.S. prosecutors could charge a tech boss as a 'co-conspirator or an aider and abettor of the crimes committed by users' but only if there was evidence the 'operator intends that its users engage in, and himself facilitates, criminal activities.' He cited the 2015 conviction of Ross Ulbricht, whose Silk Road website hosted drug sales. U.S. prosecutors argued Ulbricht 'deliberately operated Silk Road as an online criminal marketplace ... outside the reach of law enforcement,' according to the DOJ. Ulbricht got a life sentence. Timothy Howard, a former U.S. federal prosecutor who put Ulbricht behind bars, was 'skeptical' Durov could be convicted in the United States without proof he knew about the crimes on Telegram, and actively facilitated them - especially given Telegram's vast, mainly law-abiding user base. 'Coming from my experience of the U.S. legal system,' he said, the French law appears 'an aggressive theory.' Michel Séjean, a French professor of cyber law, said the toughened legislation in France came after authorities grew exasperated with companies like Telegram. 'It's not a nuclear weapon,' he said. 'It's a weapon to prevent you from being impotent when faced with platforms that don't cooperate.' Tougher laws The 2023 law traces its origins to a 2020 French interior ministry white paper, which called for major investment in technology to tackle growing cyber threats. It was followed by a similar law in November 2023, which included a measure for the real-time geolocation of people suspected of serious crimes by remotely activating their devices. A proposal to turn on their devices' cameras and mouthpieces so that investigators could watch or listen in was shot down by France's Constitutional Council. These new laws have given France some of the world's toughest tools for tackling cybercrime, with the proof being the arrest of Durov on French soil, said Sadry Porlon, a French lawyer specialized in communication technology law. Tom Holt, a cybercrime professor at Michigan State University, said LOPMI 'is a potentially powerful and effective tool if used properly,' particularly in probes into child sexual abuse images, credit card trafficking and distributed denial of service attacks, which target businesses or governments. Armed with fresh legislative powers, the ambitious J3 cybercrime unit at the Paris prosecutor's office, which is overseeing the Durov probe, is now involved in some of France's most high-profile cases. In June, the J3 unit shut down Coco, an anonymized chat forum cited in over 23,000 legal proceedings since 2021 for crimes including prostitution, rape and homicide. Coco played a central role in a current trial that has shocked France. Dominique Pelicot, 71, is accused of recruiting dozens of men on Coco to rape his wife, whom he had knocked out with drugs. Pelicot, who is expected to testify this week, has admitted his guilt, while 50 other men are on trial for rape. Coco's owner, Isaac Steidel, is suspected of a similar crime as Durov: 'Provision of an online platform to allow an illicit transaction by an organized gang.' Steidel's lawyer, Julien Zanatta, declined to comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-uses-tough-untested-cybercrime-law-to-target-telegram-s-durov/7787218.html	2024-09-17T00:44:03-07:00	
Global index for free and fair elections suffers biggest decline on record in 2023, democracy watchdog says	STOCKHOLM — Lower voter turnout and increasingly contested results globally are threatening the credibility of elections, an intergovernmental watchdog warned on Tuesday, as its sub-index for free and fair elections suffered its biggest decline on record in 2023. In its report, the Stockholm-based International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance (IDEA) said 2023 was the eighth consecutive year with a net decline in overall democratic performance, the longest consecutive fall since records began in 1975. The watchdog bases its Global State of Democracy indexes on more than 100 variables and is using four main categories - representation, rights, rule of law and participation - to categorize performance. The category of democracy related to free and fair elections and parliamentary oversight, a sub-category of representation, suffered its worst year on record in 2023. 'This report is a call for action to protect democratic elections,' IDEA's Secretary-General Kevin Casas-Zamora said in the report. 'The success of democracy depends on many things, but it becomes utterly impossible if elections fail.' The think-tank said government intimidation and electoral process irregularities, such as fraudulent voter registration and vote-counting, were increasing. It also said that threats of foreign interference, disinformation and the use of artificial intelligence in campaigns added to challenges. It also said that global voter participation had fallen to 55.5% of eligible voters in 2023 from 65.2% in 2008. Globally, in almost 20% of elections between 2020 and 2024, one of the losing candidates or parties rejected the results. IDEA said that the democratic performance in the U.S., which holds a presidential election this year, had recovered somewhat in the past two years, but the assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump in July highlighted continued risks. 'Less than half (47%) of the Americans said the 2020 election was 'free and fair' and the country remains deeply polarized,' IDEA said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-index-for-free-and-fair-elections-suffers-biggest-decline-on-record-in-2023-democracy-watchdog-says/7787215.html	2024-09-17T00:34:05-07:00	
Turkey’s BRICS bid ahead of Russia summit plays both sides	TEL AVIV — Ahead of Russia hosting the 2024 BRICS Summit from Oct. 22-24, Turkey’s application to join the group of major emerging economies is coming under scrutiny. The BRIC, or Brazil, Russia, India and China, platform was initiated by Russia in 2009 as an informal club to provide members with a conduit for challenging the world order dominated by the U.S. and its Western allies. South Africa joined in 2010, making them BRICS. While analysts say Turkey’s membership bid is more about playing both sides than challenging its Western allies, some also voice concerns that Ankara is moving away from the West. 'Turkey’s BRICS bid is one more example of the country’s drift away from the Transatlantic community,' Asli Aydintasbas, visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution’s Center on the United States and Europe, told VOA Mandarin. Turkey’s formal application last week for membership in the BRICS bloc of emerging economies confirmed speculation of the plan after the Kremlin in June welcomed 'Turkey’s interest in the work of BRICS' and promised to support Ankara’s aspirations to join it. Ankara’s move marks the first time a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and a candidate to join the European Union has applied to join a group dominated by Russia and China. NATO is a political and military alliance of 32 countries created by the U.S. for collective security against the former Soviet Union. The body also serves as a medium for member-state consultation, cooperation, dispute resolution and crisis management. BRICS aims to challenge the political and economic dominance of mainly Western, developed nations. Critics say it struggles to accomplish much and is uniting authoritarian and corrupt governments that seek to silence opposition. In January 2024, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates were formally added to the group. 'There’s a process of enlarging BRICS that China and Russia are engaged in,' Gallia Lindenstrauss, a fellow at the Tel Aviv-based Institute for National Security Studies Turkey Policy Research, told VOA Mandarin. 'This bid announcement is directly tied to the S-400 sales to Turkey, and it comes as a prelude to the upcoming October BRICS meeting in Russia.' In 2020, the Trump administration slapped sanctions on Turkey for a $2.5 billion acquisition of the Russian S-400 missile system, which is said to pose a risk to the NATO alliance and to U.S. F-35 fighter jets. Despite the Russian missile deal, Turkey still has clear differences with the BRICS members and summit host concerning Moscow’s war on Ukraine, a key NATO concern. While most BRICS members have taken a neutral or Russia-leaning stance on Moscow’s invasion, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week expressed 'unwavering' support for Ukraine's territorial integrity and said Russia must return annexed Crimea to Kyiv, prompting a mild rebuke from Moscow. 'Turkey is going through an anti-Western mood at the moment,' Aydintasbas says. 'This is made worse by events in Gaza.' Turkey, whose citizens are mostly Muslims, has been an outspoken critic of U.S. ally Israel’s fight against Hamas in Gaza. The conflict began after Hamas’ attack on Israel, which killed 1,200 and took as hostages 250 people. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 42,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Analysts say Turkey’s impatience over stalled negotiations to join the EU has also fueled its desire to form closer relations with BRICS. Ankara’s EU bid launched in 2005 has been delayed by concerns about its crackdown on Turkish opposition. Muhdan Saglam, Ankara-based Russian Energy and Russia-Turkey relations commentator, told VOA Mandarin that Turkey’s BRICS bid is a way to show it has different faces — one for the East and another facing West. 'Erdogan is using this to show the West Turkey has alternatives,' Saglam explains. 'But BRICS is not an alternative and Western authorities know that. It is important, though, because not one NATO member has applied for membership in a different organization. In this case, the political impact may be more important than economic or defense implications.' But Saglam says the BRICS bid is also a means for facilitating deals with business partners like China. BRICS member countries make up about 45% of the world’s population and 28% of the global economy. BRICS countries produce more than a third of the world’s crude oil. If Saudi Arabia joins the group, which it has indicated it may, BRICS nations would produce some 43% of global crude oil. But analysts note while Turkey’s trade with China has grown, to more than $48 billion in 2023, the vast majority were imports from China while Ankara has a more balanced trade with its top partner — the European Union. 'Turkey may ultimately be in BRICS,' Lindenstrauss said. 'But there’s no practical serious meaning here in terms of trade partners and it doesn’t change export/import trade factors.' In June, Turkish Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, during a talk at London’s Chatham House think tank, referred to BRICS as 'a dialogue platform' versus a formal economic bloc like the EU. 'The EU remains our core partner in terms of trade investments, tourism flows ... so we remain focused (on the EU), but that doesn’t mean we do not look at alternatives if they present value,' he told the forum. Aydintasbas, of the Brookings Institution, said Turkey’s bid to join BRICS should not be dismissed. 'BRICS membership may not mean much in practical terms and Turkey is still keen to retain its NATO membership. But it is gradually, inch-by-inch, drifting from the West — and that requires greater strategic thinking on the part of U.S. and other NATO allies, given Turkey’s regional heft and geographic location. Is this an outcome we want?' The presidents of China and Iran have already confirmed they will attend the October summit in Russia. Although Russian and Chinse state media report the Turkish president has said he will attend the summit, Erdogan’s office has to make an official confirmation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-s-brics-bid-ahead-of-russia-summit-plays-both-sides/7787210.html	2024-09-17T00:05:20-07:00

Brazil confirms potential $18 bln deal with miners involved in deadly dam disaster	RIO DE JANEIRO — The Brazilian government confirmed on Monday it was in talks on a potential $18 billion payout from a trio of miners involved in a deadly 2015 dam collapse, saying the deal could also involve further repair work by the companies themselves. Earlier this month, Reuters reported that Brazilian mining giant Vale and Australia's BHP, together with their joint venture Samarco, could soon reach a deal to pay around $18.2 billion in additional funds for repairs, with final terms of the agreement expected in October. Energy and Mining Minister Alexandre Silveira confirmed the story in a Monday interview with local radio broadcaster Itatiaia, based in Minas Gerais state where the toxic spill took place. Beyond the reparations under discussion, Silveira said the talks also cover some $7 billion in remediation the firms would implement themselves, such as removing toxic mining waste from a local river. The collapse of the dam at a Samarco iron ore mine near the city of Mariana nine years ago unleashed a wave of toxic tailings that killed 19 people, left hundreds homeless, flooded forests and polluted the length of the Doce River. The miners have already paid out some $8 billion on remediation and compensation for the collapse of the tailings dam, Silveira said. A previous proposal from the miners, which was not fully accepted by officials, had set a $15 billion payout to authorities in new resources plus another $3.7 billion in repairs the miners would implement. Vale did not mention the amount of a potential deal in a response to a request for comment on Monday but repeated that it expected to reach a deal in October. BHP and Samarco, meanwhile, confirmed the talks were ongoing in separate statements, adding they believe an agreement could be reached soon.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-confirms-potential-18-bln-deal-with-miners-involved-in-deadly-dam-disaster/7787207.html	2024-09-16T23:20:24-07:00	
India condemns Iran supreme leader's comments on treatment of minorities	NEW DELHI — India has condemned comments made by Iran's Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei on the treatment of Muslims in the South Asian nation, calling his remarks 'misinformed and unacceptable.' 'We cannot consider ourselves to be Muslims if we are oblivious to the suffering that a Muslim is enduring in Myanmar, Gaza, India, or any other place,' Khamenei said in a social media post on Monday. In response, India's foreign ministry said it 'strongly deplored' the comments. 'Countries commenting on minorities are advised to look at their own record before making any observations about others,' the foreign ministry spokesperson said. The two countries have typically shared a strong relationship, and signed a 10-year contract in May to develop and operate the Iranian port of Chabahar. India has been developing the port in Chabahar on Iran's southeastern coast along the Gulf of Oman as a way to transport goods to Iran, Afghanistan and central Asian countries, bypassing the ports of Karachi and Gwadar in its rival Pakistan. Khamenei, however, has been critical of India in the past over issues involving Indian Muslims and the troubled Muslim-majority region of Kashmir.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-condemns-iran-supreme-leader-s-comments-on-treatment-of-minorities/7787183.html	2024-09-16T20:59:03-07:00	
Judge rejects former Trump aide's bid to move Arizona case to federal court	PHOENIX — A judge has rejected a bid by Mark Meadows, a former chief of staff to President Donald Trump, to move his charges in Arizona's fake elector case to federal court, marking the second time he has failed in trying to get his charges out of state court. In a decision Monday, U.S. District Judge John Tuchi said Meadows missed a deadline for asking for his charges to be moved to federal court, didn't offer a good reason for doing so and failed to show that the allegations against him related to his official duties as chief of staff to the president. Meadows faces charges in Arizona and Georgia in what authorities allege was an illegal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results in Trump's favor. He had unsuccessfully tried to move charges in the Georgia case last year. It's unknown whether Meadows will appeal the decision. The Associated Press left phone and email messages for two of Meadows' attorneys. While not a fake elector in Arizona, prosecutors said Meadows, while chief of staff, worked with other Trump campaign members to submit names of fake electors from Arizona and other states to Congress in a bid to keep Trump in office despite his November 2020 defeat. Meadows has pleaded not guilty to the charges in Arizona and Georgia. In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden won Arizona by 10,457 votes. The decision sends Meadows' case back down to Maricopa County Superior Court. In both Arizona and Georgia, Meadows argued his charges should be moved to federal court because his actions were taken when he was a federal official working as Trump's chief of staff and that he has immunity under the supremacy clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says federal law trumps state law. Arizona prosecutors said Meadows' electioneering efforts weren't part of his official duties at the White House. Meadows last year tried to get his Georgia charges moved but his request was rejected by a judge whose ruling was later affirmed by an appeals court. Meadows has since asked the U.S. Supreme Court to review the ruling. The Arizona indictment says Meadows confided to a White House staff member in early November 2020 that Trump had lost the election. Prosecutors say Meadows also had arranged meetings and calls with state officials to discuss the fake elector conspiracy. Meadows and other defendants are seeking a dismissal of the Arizona case. Meadows' attorneys said nothing their client is alleged to have done in Arizona was criminal. They said the indictment consists of allegations that he received messages from people trying to get ideas in front of Trump — or 'seeking to inform Mr. Meadows about the strategy and status of various legal efforts by the president's campaign.' In all, 18 Republicans were charged in late April in Arizona's fake electors case. The defendants include 11 Republicans who had submitted a document falsely claiming Trump had won Arizona, another Trump aide and five lawyers connected to the former president. In August, Trump's campaign attorney Jenna Ellis, who worked closely with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, signed a cooperation agreement with prosecutors that led to the dismissal of her charges. Republican activist Loraine Pellegrino became the first person to be convicted in the Arizona case when she pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge and was sentenced to probation. The remaining defendants have pleaded not guilty to the forgery, fraud and conspiracy charges in Arizona. Trump wasn't charged in Arizona, but the indictment refers to him as an unindicted coconspirator. The 11 people who were nominated to be Arizona's Republican electors met in Phoenix on Dec. 14, 2020, to sign a certificate saying they were 'duly elected and qualified' electors and claimed Trump had carried the state. A one-minute video of the signing ceremony was posted on social media by the Arizona Republican Party at the time. The document was later sent to Congress and the National Archives, where it was ignored. Prosecutors in Michigan, Nevada, Georgia and Wisconsin have also filed criminal charges related to the fake electors scheme.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-rejects-former-trump-aide-s-bid-to-move-arizona-case-to-federal-court/7787177.html	2024-09-16T20:34:24-07:00

AI videos of US leaders singing Chinese go viral in China	WASHINGTON — 'I love you, China. My dear mother,' former U.S. President Donald Trump, standing in front of a mic at a lectern, appears to sing in perfect Mandarin. 'I cry for you, and I also feel proud for you,' Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump’s Democratic opponent in this year’s election, appears to respond, also in perfect Mandarin. Trump lets out a smile as he listens to the lyric. The video has received thousands of likes and tens of thousands of reposts on Douyin, China’s variation of TikTok. 'These two are almost as Chinese as it gets,' one comment says. Neither Trump nor Harris knows Mandarin. And the duet shown in the video has never happened. But recently, deepfake videos, frequently featuring top U.S. leaders, including President Joe Biden, singing Chinese pop songs, have gone viral on the Chinese internet. Some of the videos have found their way to social media platforms not available in China, such as Instagram, TikTok and X. U.S. intelligence officials and experts have long warned about how China and other foreign adversaries have been implementing generative AI in their disinformation effort to disrupt and influence the 2024 presidential election. 'There has been an increased use of Chinese AI-generated content in recent months, attempting to influence and sow division in the U.S. and elsewhere,' a Microsoft report on China’s disinformation threat said in April. Few of the people who saw the videos of the American leaders singing in Chinese, however, were convinced that they were real, based on what users wrote in the comments. The videos themselves do not contain misinformation, either. Instead, these videos and their popularity reflect, at least in part, a sense of cultural confidence in Chinese netizens in the age of perpetually intensifying U.S.-China competitions, observers told VOA Mandarin. By making the likes of Biden and Trump sing whatever Chinese songs the creators of the videos want them to sing, they can 'culturally domesticate powerful Americans,' said Alexa Pan, a researcher on China’s AI industry for ChinaTalk, an influential newsletter about China and technology. 'Making fun of U.S. leaders might be especially politically acceptable to and popular with Chinese viewers,' she said. Political opponents sing about friendship Videos of American leaders singing in Chinese started to spread on Chinese social media in May. In many of the videos featuring Biden and Trump, creators made the two politically opposed men sing songs about friendship. After Biden announced his withdrawal from the presidential race in July, one viral video had him sing to Trump, 'Actually I don’t want to leave. Actually, I want to stay. I want to stay with you through every spring, summer, autumn and winter,' to which Trump appeared to sing, 'You have to believe me. It won’t take long before we can spend our whole life together.' 'Crying eyes,' one Chinese netizen commented sarcastically. 'They must have gotten along really well.' Another such video posted on Instagram received mostly positive reactions. Some users said it was a stark contrast to the bitterness that has permeated U.S. politics. 'Made me laugh,' an Instagram user wrote. 'Wouldn't that be so refreshing to actually have them sing like that together?' Easy to make After reviewing some of the videos, Pan, of ChinaTalk, told VOA Mandarin that she believes they were quite easy to make. Obvious flaws in the videos, including body parts occasionally blending into the background, suggest they were created with simple AI technology, Pan said. 'One could generate these videos on the many AI text-to-video generation platforms available in China,' she wrote in an e-mail. On the Chinese internet, there are countless tutorials on how to make AI-generated videos using popular lip-syncing AI models, such as MuseTalk, released by Chinese tech giant Tencent, and SadTalker, developed by Xi'an Jiaotong University, a research-focused university in northwestern China. One Douyin account reviewed by VOA Mandarin has pumped out over 200 videos of American leaders singing in Chinese since May. One of the account’s videos was even reposted by the Iranian embassy. Chinese leaders off-limits The release of ChatGPT by OpenAI in 2022 has triggered a global AI frenzy, with China being one of the leading countries developing the technology. The United Nations said in July that China had requested the most patents on generative AI, with the U.S. being a distant second. On the Chinese internet, the obsession has been particularly strong with deepfakes, which can be used to manipulate videos, images and audio of people to make them appear to say or sing things that they have not actually uttered. Some deepfake videos are made mostly for fun, such is the case with Biden and Trump singing Chinese songs. But there have also been abuses of the technology. Earlier this year, web users in China stole a Ukrainian girl’s image and turned her into a 'Russian beauty' to sell goods online. China has released strict regulations on deepfakes. A 2022 law states that the technology cannot be used to 'endanger the national security and interests, harm the image of the nation, harm the societal public interest, disturb economic or social order, or harm the lawful rights and interests of others.' Yang Han, an Australian commentator who used to work for China’s Foreign Ministry, told VOA Mandarin that the prominence of U.S leaders and the absence of Chinese leaders in these viral AI videos reflects a lack of political free speech in China. He said that it reminds him of a joke that former U.S. President Ronald Reagan used to tell during the Cold War. 'An American and a Russian compare with each other whose country has more freedom,' Yang said, relaying the joke. 'The American says he can stand in front of the White House and call Reagan stupid. The Russian dismisses it and says he can also stand in front of the Kremlin and call Reagan stupid.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-videos-of-us-leaders-singing-chinese-go-viral-in-china/7787160.html	2024-09-16T19:46:15-07:00	
Next generation of Buffetts is poised to become one of the biggest forces in philanthropy	OMAHA, Neb. — The next generation of Buffetts — Howard, Susie and Peter — is poised to become one of the most powerful forces in philanthropy when their 94-year-old father, the legendary businessman and leader of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett, eventually passes away. But it wasn't always going to be that way. Buffett announced in June that he would donate his fortune, now valued at nearly $144 billion, to a charitable trust managed by his three children when he dies, instead of giving it to the Gates Foundation, as he indicated 18 years ago. The next generation of Buffetts will then have 10 years to give the money away, Warren Buffett said. In the meantime, the elder Buffett continues to make huge annual donations to the Gates Foundation and his four family foundations, which will continue throughout his lifetime. He first mentioned plans for a new charitable trust in November. Howard Buffett told The Associated Press he's learned what his father told him and his siblings about philanthropy was true: 'It's not so easy to give away money if you want to do it smart, if you want to be intelligent about it.' The middle Buffett child, Howard said his father is as sharp as ever and that he hopes he lives a long time, adding: 'It's pretty amazing that he's giving us this opportunity.' Buffett has entrusted Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates with significant annual gifts to their foundation since 2006 — a remarkable $43 billion to date. 'Wealthy people don't tend to give their money to other people to give away,' said James Ferris, founding director of The Center on Philanthropy and Public Policy at the University of Southern California. But many of the wealthiest people are also hesitant to hand over their fortunes to the next generation over concerns that it hampers their ingenuity, he said. Ferris thinks the story of Buffett's changing philanthropic intentions is a positive one. 'It shows how a donor is making choices and is adapting to circumstances,' he said. The Gates Foundation did not say when it learned of Buffett's decision or what the impact will be on its budget. It previously said in a statement that 'Warren Buffett has been exceedingly generous,' and that he has 'played an invaluable role in championing and shaping the foundation's work to create a world where every person can live a healthy, productive life.' Over the years, Buffett gave the Gates Foundation large annual donations, but also donated billions to foundations run by his three children and a fourth family foundation. Their work offers some insight into the priorities of the next generation of Buffetts. The Susan Thompson Buffett Foundation, named after Warren Buffett's first wife, is the largest in terms of donations. It supports organizations that provide reproductive health care and access to contraception and abortion around the world. Susie Buffett, 71, is its board chair and Peter Buffett, 66, is a board member. Susie Buffett also leads The Sherwood Foundation, a major supporter of early childhood development nationally that gives grants to organizations and projects within Omaha, Nebraska, the Buffetts' hometown. Peter Buffett's NoVo Foundation has been an important funder of organizations advocating for the autonomy of girls and women and against gender-based violence. In 2020, Peter and his wife, Jennifer, decided to reorient their focus, expanding their support for Native American communities and projects to build sustainable, local communities with a focus on agriculture and food access. The Howard G. Buffett Foundation has focused on conflict mitigation and agriculture around the world. Since 2022, it has donated some $800 million — more than most countries — to humanitarian initiatives in Ukraine during the country's war with Russia. These include supporting food distribution at schools, demining activities, and the rebuilding of a major publishing company and a key bridge transporting grain. In a relatively rare interview for a family that seldom makes time to speak with the media, Howard Buffett, 69, said he couldn't predict exactly how he and his siblings would give away their father's fortune. However, he said they would continue to take risks and find ways to make the biggest difference as their father recommended. 'I can tell you, we'll sit down in a room when the time comes, and we'll get it figured out pretty quickly,' he said, acknowledging that the directive to donate all the money within 10 years was a challenge. The siblings' different ways of thinking and approaches to giving are assets, he said. 'What this is going to do is we're going to bring all of our collective experience together,' he said. But don't expect to find the family name on a lot of buildings, which the siblings have largely avoid even as they've given away more than $15 billion of their father's money since 2006. Kathleen Enright, president and CEO of the Council on Foundations, said the Buffetts have effectively made philanthropy a family business, with the next generation now seasoned donors who have built enduring institutions in their foundations. 'It is a big deal,' she said, of the amount of money that the Buffetts are poised to give away, noting that because the fortune will likely continue to grow, they will have to give away highly visible sums to spend it down. The tight timeframe to give away his fortune after his death reflects one of Warren Buffett's longstanding conditions for receiving charitable funding. He has instructed the Gates Foundation and his family's foundations to grant out the full amount they received within a year. The next generation of Buffetts have run their foundations with tiny staffs — much like how Warren Buffett oversees his massive Berkshire Hathaway conglomerate with only about two dozen people at its headquarters in Omaha. Howard Buffett said his foundation employs just 22 staff members. It granted $458.1 million in 2023, according to tax documents. He acknowledged that his 'lean' staff puts some limits on their capacity, but said the way they've scaled their work is through creating strong and enduring relationships with other organizations to help implement their ideas. In contrast, the Gates Foundation has one of the largest endowments at $75.2 billion, funded by donations from Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. It employs more than 2,000 people, many of them technical experts all over the world, and is known for making highly directed grants with rigorous reporting requirements. The foundation has said it will wind down its operations within 25 years after its founders' deaths. Howard Buffett said he likes a challenge and thinks that in general, wealthy people should give their money away within their lifetimes, rather than holding it in perpetual foundations. 'Somebody is going to spend that money. Somebody is going to give that money away,' he said. 'So, I would rather do that with my brother and sister and do it together, as a partnership, than see it done any other way.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/next-generation-of-buffetts-is-poised-to-become-one-of-the-biggest-forces-in-philanthropy/7787147.html	2024-09-16T18:46:01-07:00	
US will ‘continue to push’ for release of detainees in China, State Department says	WASHINGTON — On Monday, after the U.S. State Department announced the release of David Lin, an American pastor, from nearly two decades of imprisonment in China, officials said more work remains to secure the freedom of other Americans held in China. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters that the U.S. government had been working to secure Lin's release for some time. 'When it comes to David Lin, we are glad to see he is released. We welcome it. We’ll continue to push the release of other Americans,' Miller said during a regular press briefing. Lin, 68, was detained in 2006 after entering China. He was later convicted of contract fraud and given a life sentence in 2009. After Chinese courts reduced his sentence, he was set to be released from Beijing in 2029. Bob Fu, a pastor and founder of ChinaAid, a nonprofit dedicated to religious freedom in China, called the original charges against Lin a 'scam' and said they were facilitated by the Chinese government as a gambit to unjustly take hostages. The imprisonment and now release of Lin, Fu told VOA, is especially significant as China is increasingly cracking down on religious practices within the country, with human rights violations in Xinjiang and Tibet and growing governmental restrictions on Christian traditions. Despite this, Fu said that the success of Lin’s release could be attributed to two factors: the souring of the global public opinion on China and the hard work of U.S. officials. 'This shows that if our top political leaders really take this seriously and persistently, it will bear fruits for our citizens' freedom,' he said. According to the Dui Hua Foundation, a nonprofit dedicated to freeing detainees through dialogue with China, over 200 American nationals in China under coercive measures, including wrongful detentions and exit bans. The State Department has listed two other detained individuals as priority cases: Businessman Kai Li, accused of espionage in 2016, and Mark Swidan, convicted of drug trafficking in 2019. 'We’ll continue to push the release of other Americans,' Miller said. 'It’s something that we have been working on for some time.' Miller declined to say if Lin's release had been the result of a swap, according to a report by Reuters. China's embassy in Washington declined to comment when asked if Beijing had received anything from the U.S. in return for Lin's release, according to Reuters. The embassy also told Reuters that Chinese authorities handle criminal suspects in accordance with the law and 'treat them equally regardless of their nationality.' Later this week, a U.S. congressional hearing is set to be held on Americans who have been arbitrarily imprisoned in China. Some material for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-will-continue-to-push-for-release-of-detainees-in-china-state-department-says/7787144.html	2024-09-16T18:32:50-07:00	
Turkish-backed group besieges Syrian-Kurdish village after protest	Northern Syria/Washington — A village in northwestern Syria has been under siege by a Turkish-backed group of armed militants following a women-led protest against ongoing abuses carried out by the Syrian faction. The Kurdish village of Kakhira in Syria’s Afrin district came under siege Sunday after fighters affiliated with the Suleiman Shah Brigade cut off internet access and set up additional checkpoints in and around the community, Kurdish news network Rudaw reported on Monday. The village and other parts of Afrin came under the control of Turkish military and Turkish-backed Syrian groups in March 2018 following a major military offensive against Kurdish forces. Many armed factions operating in the area, including the Suleiman Shah Brigade, are extremist groups that have imposed stringent restrictions on the local Kurdish population. International rights groups, such as Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, have accused these groups of carrying out violations against civilian residents of Afrin. The recent protest in Kakhira was sparked by the announcement of a new set of taxation against olive farmers and the subsequent arrests of several residents who had opposed the new levy, according to local sources. 'The demonstrators were met with harsh beatings and live bullets by the armed group, leaving at least six people wounded, including four women,' said Sozdar Rizgar, a former village resident who currently lives in a displacement camp elsewhere in northern Syria. She told VOA that the militiamen have restricted all access to and from the village. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory of Human Rights, which has researchers throughout the war-torn country, put the number of those wounded at eight. Another source inside Afrin, who insisted on anonymity for fear of retribution, told VOA that fighters linked to the Suleiman Shah Brigade have in recent weeks seized several properties belonging to Kakhira villagers. 'The most recent example was last week, when the fighters confiscated a civilian house whose owner later died of a heart attack,' the source said. Last year, the U.S. Treasury imposed sanctions on the Suleiman Shah Brigade and another armed group called the Hamza Division for 'serious human rights abuses against those residing in the Afrin region of northern Syria.' In a report released last week, the U.N. Syria Commission of Inquiry said armed groups in northwest Syria use brutal torture tactics in their detention centers that are like those of the Syrian government. Ahmed Qitme, a researcher at the Paris-based advocacy group Syrians for Truth and Justice, said such international designations and condemnations have not deterred armed groups in Afrin from carrying out these abuses. 'They act with impunity because they feel that nobody could stop them as long as they have the backing of Turkey,' he told VOA. The Kurdish National Council in Syria, an opposition group based in northern Syria, has called on Turkish authorities to exert pressure on armed factions and put an end to rights violations in Afrin. The Turkish government has not publicly commented on the ongoing events in northwest Syria. Officials at Turkey's Foreign Ministry did not respond to VOA's requests for comment in time for publication. The Syrian National Army — an umbrella group for all armed factions in northwest Syria, including Suleiman Shah Brigade — also did not respond to VOA's request for comment. This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-backed-group-besiege-syrian-kurdish-village-after-protest/7787117.html	2024-09-16T17:52:45-07:00

Boeing says it's weighing temporary layoffs to save cash during machinists strike	seattle — Boeing plans to freeze hiring and reduce travel and is considering temporary layoffs to save cash during a factory worker strike that began last week, the company told employees Monday. The company said the moves, which include reduced spending on suppliers, were necessary because 'our business is in a difficult period.' Chief financial officer Brian West detailed 10 immediate cutbacks in a memo to employees. They include a freeze on hiring across all levels, a pause in pay increases for managers and executives who get promoted, and a cancellation of all travel that isn't critical. 'We are also considering the difficult step of temporary furloughs for many employees, managers and executives in the coming weeks,' West said. Boeing's business is in a difficult spot, he said, adding: 'This strike jeopardizes our recovery in a significant way.' About 33,000 workers represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers began a strike early Friday. The walkout came after workers rejected an offer of a 25% increase in pay over four years. The union originally sought a pay hike of at least 40%. Representatives of the company and the union are scheduled to meet Tuesday with federal mediators. The union has started to survey its members to learn what they want most in a new contract. Striking workers are picketing at several locations around Washington state, Oregon and California. Outside Boeing's huge factory in Everett, Washington, Nancie Browning, a materials-management specialist at Boeing for more than 17 years, said last week's offer was worse than the one that prompted a two-month strike in 2008. She said that without annual bonuses that workers have come to depend on, the proposed pay increase was more like 9%, not 25%. 'We just want a piece of the pie like everybody else,' she said. 'Why should we work all this overtime and bust our backs while these guys [Boeing executives] are sitting up in their suites just raking in the cash?' The bonuses have emerged as a flash point for union members. Workers say they range from $3,000 to $5,000 a year. Boeing says it is hard to calculate bonuses in a way that is fair to 33,000 people who perform different jobs. So instead, the company proposes to ditch the payouts and replace them with automatic contributions of $4,160 per year to each employee's 401(k) retirement account. Workers are bitter that in contract extensions over the past 16 years, Boeing ended its traditional pension plan and lowered health care benefits. 'We want our pension back,' said Jacob Bustad, a machinist with Boeing for 14 years who was also on the picket line in Everett. 'We just keep losing and we never gain, while the people at the top just get more and more money. Boeing has done really good for me and my family, but these last years have been hard.' Boeing has lost more than $25 billion since the start of 2019 and burned through $4.3 billion in the second quarter of 2024 alone as it stood poised to post another money-losing year. The strike will delay deliveries of new planes, which are an important source of cash for the company. Stephanie Pope, the head of Boeing's commercial airplanes division, cited the company's $60 billion in total debt in urging blue-collar workers to accept the contract offer last week. She called it the best offer Boeing had ever made — and it was endorsed by the union's local president and negotiators. But workers rejected the recommendation of their own leaders, which had not happened since 1995. Additional cost-cutting moves spelled out in the chief financial officer's memo included eliminating first- and business-class service for anyone on travel that is deemed critical and stopping spending on outside consultants. West also said Boeing plans to make 'significant reductions in supplier expenditures' and will stop most supplier purchase orders related to the 737, 767 and 777 airplane models. After the strike started, Moody's put Boeing on review for a possible credit downgrade, and Fitch said a strike longer than two weeks would make a downgrade more likely. Both agencies rate Boeing debt one notch above noninvestment or junk status.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-says-it-s-weighing-temporary-layoffs-to-save-cash-during-machinists-strike-/7787107.html	2024-09-16T17:30:16-07:00	
As election for IOC president looms, what is the job and who are the 7 candidates?	geneva — Seven candidates are competing for one of the biggest and best jobs in world sports that traditionally becomes available only every 12 years. The International Olympic Committee announced on Monday which of its members in a most exclusive and discreet club have entered the race to be its next president. The election by secret ballot is in March. The winner will replace Thomas Bach, a German lawyer who steps down in June upon reaching the maximum 12 years in office. The 10th IOC president could be its first female leader, or its first from Africa or Asia. Or even its first from Britain. They will take over a financially stable organization that demands deft skills in the challenging arenas of sports and real-world politics. Who are the candidates? - Prince Feisal al Hussein, an IOC member since 2010, on its executive board since 2019. Founder of the Generations for Peace sports charity. His older brother is King Abdullah II of Jordan. - Sebastian Coe, IOC member since 2020. President of World Athletics since 2015. Olympic champion in men's 1,500 meters in 1980 and 1984. Elected lawmaker in British Parliament from 1992 to 1997. Led the 2012 London Olympics organizing committee. - Kirsty Coventry, IOC member since 2013, on executive board for a second time since 2023. Olympic champion in women's 200-meter backstroke in 2004 and 2008. Appointed sports minister in Zimbabwe government since 2018. Chairs IOC panel overseeing the 2032 Brisbane Olympics. - Johan Eliasch, IOC member since August. President of International Ski and Snowboard Federation since 2021. Owner of Head sports equipment brand, CEO until 2021. Swedish-British citizen. - David Lappartient, IOC member since 2022. President of International Cycling Union since 2017. President of France's Olympic committee and leader of French Alps bid that will host 2030 Winter Games. Chair of IOC esports panel that steered the Esports Olympic Games to Saudi Arabia. - Juan Antonio Samaranch Jr., IOC member since 2001, vice president since 2022, and member of the executive board from 2012 to 2020. Founder of a Spain-based investment bank. Created Samaranch Foundation to promote the Olympics in China in honor of his father, who was IOC president from 1980 to 2001. - Morinari Watanabe, IOC member since 2018. Japanese president of the International Gymnastics Federation since 2017. When is the election and who votes? The IOC election meeting is on March 18-21 at a resort hotel in Greece, near the site of Ancient Olympia. Candidates and their compatriots cannot vote, leaving about 95 eligible to take part in March. Among them, members of European and Asian royal families, including the Emir of Qatar; diplomats and lawmakers, including a former president of Croatia, Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović; businesspeople, including Nita Ambani, whose husband is India's richest man; leaders of sports bodies; current and former Olympic athletes. What is the IOC president's job? It's an executive role running a not-for-profit organization that employs hundreds of staff at a modern lakeside headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland. The IOC earns several billion dollars in revenue every four years from selling broadcasting and sponsor rights for the Summer Games and Winter Games. Most of the money is distributed to the Olympic family: organizers of upcoming Games, including youth editions, governing bodies of Olympic sports, more than 200 national Olympic bodies, scholarships for potential Olympic athletes and special projects. The job ideally calls for a deep knowledge of managing sports, understanding athletes' needs and political skills. How long can IOC presidents stay in the job? A maximum of 12 years, with a first term of eight years and the chance for one re-election for a further four. However, the IOC has an age limit of 70 and complex rules around membership status. It means some of the seven candidates could have to seek a special exemption while in office to complete a full eight-year mandate. What are the challenges and big decisions ahead? - Picking a host for the 2036 Summer Games, with India and Qatar as strong contenders. - Renewing the United States broadcast deal that has typically underwritten Olympic finances. Bach moved quickly in 2014 to renew NBC's deal through 2032. The next deal starts with the 2034 Winter Games in Salt Lake City. - Both decisions factor into wider questions in regard to drafting the global sports calendar. July-August has been the optimal Summer Games slot since 2004. But a 2036 Doha Olympics could not be held in those months, and where could Games be comfortably held after another decade of climate change? - When and how can Russia be reintegrated fully into international sports with no end to its invasion of Ukraine in sight? Coe's world track and field body currently excludes Russian athletes entirely.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-election-for-ioc-president-looms-what-is-the-job-and-who-are-the-7-candidates-/7786765.html	2024-09-16T16:47:57-07:00

Eswatini activists say park rangers shoot suspected poachers with impunity	Mbabane, Eswatini — Some Eswatini legislators, backed by human rights activists, are calling for an urgent review of the Game Act of 1991, a law they say allows wildlife park rangers to shoot and kill suspected poachers with little or no accountability. Game park owners have defended these shootings for years as necessary to protect animals. But critics contend that the Game Act instead jeopardizes human life. Human rights lawyer Thabiso Mavuso of the Law Society of Swaziland, who has represented the families of shooting victims, says the law not only allows game rangers to use lethal force with impunity but also shields them from legal accountability. 'We have seen here in Eswatini the killing, injury and torture of people, some as young as 13 years and some in their 60s, but nothing has been done against the perpetrators ... ,' Mavuso said. 'This law needs reform. It must be aligned with human rights and general principles of constitutionalism such as accountability and responsibility.' No one has exact numbers for how many suspected poachers have been killed in Eswatini’s game parks, but the Ministry of Tourism and Environmental Affairs estimates dozens are slain each year. Game ranger Mandla Motsa told VOA that it is rangers who need protection and that the Game Law should not be altered. 'We have lost a lot of rangers - some have been killed and others injured,' Motsa said. 'Almost all the time, the poachers shoot at rangers first. There has been a wrong narrative that we value the lives of animals more than that of humans. What people are forgetting is that there are two sides of lives involved in this issue and that is that of the ranger and the poacher. So, amending the Game Act would be to make it seem that our lives as rangers are also not important.' However, political analyst Mandla Hlatshwayo said the killings in the parks are a consequence of the government’s abuse of power under the guise of environmental protection. 'What's happening in the country in my view has nothing to do with environmental protection,' Hlatshwayo said. 'The killing of so-called poachers in the manner that it's actually taking place is wrong and must be condemned in the strongest of terms. We are witnessing the cold-blooded execution of suspects under circumstances that are very questionable. This is simple murder that is being condoned by the authorities, mainly because the victims are poor people with no power to fight back.' Former Senator Ngomayayona Gamedze, whose family has suffered losses at the hands of game rangers, says the act must be amended to prioritize the sanctity of human life. 'Wildlife in Eswatini is now accorded higher status and greater protection than human beings,' Gamedze said. 'This must be addressed by our legislators before human lives are further disregarded. Game rangers hold immense power over ordinary Swazis who love hunting, yet are penalized to the extent of death without trial. It is an injustice that the people of Eswatini are treated as less than animals, and a review of the Game Act is needed to prevent further loss of life.' Government spokesperson Alpheous Nxumalo said a motion from senators to amend the Gaming Act was being debated and that a vote was pending.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eswatini-activists-say-park-rangers-shoot-suspected-poachers-with-impunity-/7786760.html	2024-09-16T15:28:02-07:00	
Trial starts for Frenchman accused of unlawfully collecting military information in Russia	MOSCOW — The trial of a French citizen arrested in Russia on charges of unlawfully collecting information on military issues started Monday but was quickly adjourned for a month. Laurent Vinatier, arrested in Moscow in June, had earlier admitted guilt, setting the stage for a fast-track trial without a detailed examination of evidence. But quickly after the trial opened on Monday, the judge adjourned the hearing until October 14 when prosecutors will declare the sentence they will seek. Vinatier's lawyer, Aleksey Sinitsyn, said the trial was adjourned because the prosecution needed more time to prepare for final arguments. If convicted, Vinatier could face up to five years in prison. Detentions on charges of spying and collecting sensitive data have become increasingly frequent in Russia since it sent troops into Ukraine in February 2022. Vinatier's arrest came as tensions flared between Moscow and Paris following President Emmanuel Macron's comments about the possibility of deploying French troops in Ukraine. Russian authorities accused Vinatier of failing to register as a 'foreign agent' while collecting information about Russia's 'military and military-technical activities' that could be used to the detriment of the country's security. The prosecutors accused Vinatier of collecting military information during his meetings with three Russian citizens in Moscow in 2021-2022. The Russian citizens weren't named in the indictment. Vinatier is an adviser with the Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue, a Switzerland-based nongovernmental organization. The NGO in June said it was doing 'everything possible to assist' him. The charges against Vinatier relate to a law that requires anyone collecting information on military issues to register with authorities as a foreign agent. Human rights activists have criticized the law and other recent legislation as part of a Kremlin crackdown on independent media and political activists intended to stifle criticism of its actions in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-starts-for-frenchman-accused-of-unlawfully-collecting-military-information-in-russia-/7786766.html	2024-09-16T15:17:16-07:00	
US military completes withdrawal from junta-ruled Niger	DAKAR, Senegal — The withdrawal of U.S. troops from Niger is complete, an American official said Monday. A small number of military personnel assigned to guard the U.S. Embassy remain, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh told reporters. Earlier this year, Niger's ruling junta ended an agreement that allowed U.S. troops to operate in the West African country. A few months later, officials from both countries said in a joint statement that U.S. troops would complete their withdrawal by the middle of September. The U.S. handed over its last military bases in Niger to local authorities last month, but about two dozen American soldiers had remained in Niger, largely for administrative duties related to the withdrawal, Singh said. Niger's ouster of American troops following a coup last year has broad ramifications for Washington because it's forcing troops to abandon critical bases that were used for counterterrorism missions in the Sahel. groups linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group operate in the vast region south of the Sahara desert. One of those groups, Jama'a Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin, known as JNIM, is active in Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, and is looking to expand into Benin and Togo. Niger had been seen as one of the last nations in the restive region that Western nations could partner with to beat back growing jihadi insurgencies. The U.S. and France had more than 2,500 military personnel in the region until recently, and together with other European countries had invested hundreds of millions of dollars in military assistance and training. In recent months Niger has pulled away from its Western partners, turning instead to Russia for security. In April, Russian military trainers arrived in Niger to reinforce the country's air defenses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-completes-withdrawal-from-junta-ruled-niger-/7786759.html	2024-09-16T14:55:52-07:00

UN diverts $8 million in humanitarian funding to Nigeria flood response	Maiduguri, Nigeria — The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs has approved the immediate release of $8 million dollars to support victims in flood ravaged Maiduguri, in Nigeria's Borno state. Severe flooding there last week killed dozens of people and displaced hundreds of thousands of others. Mohammed Malick Fall, the U.N. resident coordinator, announced the new funding to journalists in Maiduguri while visiting flood victims over the weekend. The visit was to assess the extent of damage caused by the flooding and to ramp up lifesaving assistance. Fall announced the allocation of $8 million from the humanitarian fund to support disaster response and management. 'We're all behind you not only in sympathy but in solidarity. We will not spare any of our resources in this response,' Fall said. 'Probably we might not be where we want it to be in terms of resources, but as we speak, we'll try to refocus resources that have been designed for some other intervention to see how we can bring them toward scaling up and speeding up this response. We'll prioritize our response around the immediate need.' The U.N. has provided hot meals and facilitated food air drops in hard-to-reach areas cut off by flood waters. Last Thursday, a dam burst caused millions of liters of water to pour into communities in Maiduguri. State authorities say the flood killed dozens of people and affected more than 1 million others. Many are taking shelter in camps. The disaster follows an alarming malnutrition crisis caused by conflict, climate change and inflation in the region. Local residents say food prices have skyrocketed as a result of flood waters washing out access roads and markets and farms. Borno state Governor Babagana Umara Zulum told journalists the full extent of damage remains unknown. 'The unfortunate flood incident is perhaps the most devastating acute disaster that our state has suffered as far as we can remember,' Zulum said. 'Many bridges are damaged and we're yet to assess the integrity of the bridges that form the main link between the two major parts of the city.' Zulum added that the flood hit the University of Maiduguri Teaching Hospital, which has the most up-to-date medical diagnostic and therapeutic equipment in West Africa. The status and function of the equipment has yet to be ascertained. Borno state is the heartland region of the Boko Haram terror group. The group's 15-year insurgency has sparked one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. But the U.N. said Nigeria's Humanitarian Response Plan for Nigeria, seeking $927 million dollars, is only about 46% funded. In 2022, Nigeria's worst flooding in a decade killed more than 600 people and displaced 1.4 million. On Monday, the Nigerian Correctional Services announced a manhunt for more than 280 escapees from a prison destroyed by the flooding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-diverts-8-million-in-humanitarian-funding-to-nigeria-flood-response-/7786705.html	2024-09-16T14:06:35-07:00	
Ohio city cancels cultural festival after political furor over Haitians	Springfield, Ohio — An Ohio city at the center of a political furor over Haitian migrants canceled its annual celebration of cultural diversity on Monday in response to days of violent threats that have closed schools and government offices. The governor, meanwhile, said resources would be surged to Springfield to help city officials deal with the fallout. Springfield's two-day CultureFest, which highlights diversity, arts and culture, had been scheduled to begin Sept. 27 but was canceled 'in light of recent threats and safety concerns,' the city announced. 'We deeply regret having to cancel CultureFest, as we know it is a beloved event for our community,' City Manager Bryan Heck said in a statement. 'However, the safety of our residents and visitors must come first.' Springfield has been the focus of intense attention in recent days after former President Donald Trump, his running mate JD Vance, and the Republican presidential campaign have amplified debunked claims about Haitian immigrants eating domestic pets and waterfowl. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, has denounced the false rumors, saying there is no evidence of it. He said at a news conference in Springfield on Monday that dozens of members of the Ohio State Highway Patrol will be stationed in Springfield schools starting Tuesday, sweeping each building every morning before the arrival of faculty or students. Security cameras have also been stationed at various spots in the city. Springfield City Hall, several schools, and state motor vehicle offices in Springfield were forced to evacuate last week after receiving bomb threats. At least 33 separate bomb threats were made in recent days, all of them hoaxes, DeWine said. He said some of the threats came from overseas but declined to name the country. 'We cannot let the bad guys win. Our schools must remain open. They are going to remain open,' DeWine said. Two colleges in Springfield held classes virtually on Monday. Wittenberg University said it received two threats over the weekend, 'both of which were targeted toward members of the Haitian Community.' Clark State College said it would operate virtually through Friday 'due to recent events in Springfield.' Thousands of Haitian immigrants have settled in recent years in the predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000, about 45 miles (70 kilometers) from the state capital of Columbus, where they have found work in factories and warehouses that had been struggling to fill job openings. The sudden influx has strained schools, health care facilities and city services and driven up the cost of housing. President Joe Biden, appearing in Philadelphia at the National HBCU Week Conference on Monday, addressed the situation in Springfield, condemning what he called the 'lies and hate.' 'It's wrong. It's simply wrong. And it must stop,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ohio-city-cancels-cultural-festival-after-political-furor-over-haitians/7786688.html	2024-09-16T13:52:58-07:00	
Electricity in short supply as Zambia deals with drought-driven energy crisis	Lusaka, Zambia — As Zambia deals with its worst drought in 20 years, businesses and households are going for days without electricity. Experts say the severe energy crisis could worsen Zambia ‘s already fragile economy and lead to massive job losses. On an average day, millions of people across the country are enduring up to 21 hours of power cuts, locally known as load shedding. Taonga Zulu, a Lusaka resident who runs a family farm business, told VOA that her livelihood has been hurt by the power cuts. 'It has been nearly impossible to manage the chicken run properly as we rely on electricity for various aspects of their care,' she said. 'The lack of power has also prevented us from pumping water, which means our farm is slowly turning into a desert.' The Zambia Association of Manufacturers is a business association representing the interests of the country’s factories. Association president Ashu Sagar said his members have not been spared by the energy crisis. He said big companies are struggling with the cost of running alternative diesel-powered generators, while smaller companies have no energy source at all. Sagar added that some of the association‘s members have failed to meet contractual obligations with buyers due to the drought-induced energy crisis. 'So, the impact on the manufacturing sector is quite big in that small companies that probably could have no capacity to invest in alternative energy solutions like diesel generators have had to curtail their manufacturing operations,' he said. Zambia‘s only public power utility company, the Zambia Electricity Supply Corporation, or ZESCO, said Monday that it does not have enough power to supply all hospitals. Media reports say some hospitals are turning patients away due to lack of electricity and water. ZESCO spokesperson Matongo Maumbi said the country‘s heavy reliance on hydropower generation has led to a national shortfall of almost 1,300 megawatts as the various water sources are drying up. Economist Emmanuel Zulu says the energy crisis is dragging down the economy and pushing up unemployment. 'There is a slump in output and productivity in the economy and this is going to affect our GDP as well as employment because most people will be left with nothing to do,' he said. Worsened by climate change and the El Nino weather pattern, the energy crisis threatens national food security, water and energy supply, Zambia’s President Hakainde Hichilema said earlier this year. In his state of the nation address to parliament Friday, Hichilema said his government is working around the clock to address the energy crisis. 'Government is implementing a number of interventions in a bid to enhance resilience and reduce our dependence on hydroelectric power,' he said. 'We are promoting alternative sources of energy.' Energy expert Johnstone Chikwanda is optimistic that new measures, like the removal of bureaucratic hurdles that discouraged private companies from investing in energy production, will yield results in the near future. 'Looking at the extent of the measures which are currently being implemented and the strong praxis of leadership driving the energy sector reforms, I am convinced that this crisis is being invested better than how we previously handled the previous crisis,' he said. According to the United Nations, Zambia, Zimbabwe and Malawi are among the countries in Southern Africa most affected by the regional drought that began early this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/electricity-in-short-supply-as-zambia-deals-with-drought-driven-energy-crisis/7786511.html	2024-09-16T12:06:58-07:00	
Pakistan defendants face 'grueling' legal battles over blasphemy allegations, says new report	ISLAMABAD — A new report finds Pakistan’s blasphemy laws are being significantly misused, with many defendants facing baseless accusations, protracted legal battles and lengthy pre-trial prison time as judges tread carefully to avoid offending religious groups. The U.S.-based Clooney Foundation for Justice (CFJ) on Monday released its findings after monitoring 24 blasphemy lawsuits for six months during 2022 in Lahore, the capital of Pakistan's most populous province, Punjab. The CJF said 15 of the accused are facing mandatory death sentences if convicted. However, the report said its monitors had noted little progress in most cases, with 217 out of 252 hearings adjourned, leaving many defendants stuck in pre-trial detention. 'This report shows a process fraught with significant delays and unfairness, exacerbating the widespread climate of misuse, discrimination, and intimidation that has developed around Pakistan’s blasphemy law,' said Zimran Samuel, a CFJ legal expert and visiting professor in practice at the London School of Economics. 'Pakistan’s blasphemy provisions in their current form and as they are being implemented are in urgent need of reform and reconsideration,' Samuel said. Making derogatory remarks against Islam or the Prophet Muhammad in Muslim-majority Pakistan is punishable by death under the country’s blasphemy laws, though no one has ever been executed under the laws. The CFJ’s report criticized the country’s blasphemy laws for being inconsistent with international standards, especially the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). The study noted that many blasphemy accusations lack evidence, with complainants often not witnessing the alleged acts. In some cases, it added that the specific blasphemous words are not even identified. Despite safeguards in place, such as the requirement for government approval of charges, these are often disregarded, the report alleged. The CFJ stated that defendants are often arrested without warrants, denied bail, and subjected to repeated adjournments due to missing witnesses, prolonging their legal ordeals. It called for Pakistan to repeal its blasphemy laws, raise the standards for filing allegations, deter false accusations, and reform court procedures to prevent endless delays. 'The judicial system in Pakistan has completely failed in preventing the abuse and malafide (bad faith) use of the blasphemy laws in Pakistan,' the report quoted Hina Jilani, a leading human rights lawyer and activist in Pakistan. 'While there are concerns regarding the laws as they are currently framed, the way that courts disregard the few procedural safeguards that were added to the legal framework has rendered prosecution in such cases farcical and an epitome of injustice,' stated Jilani, a recipient of the American Society of International Law award. The report highlighted that some cases do not even go to trial, with mob violence against those accused of blasphemy on the rise. Pakistani officials did not immediately respond to the CFJ findings, which came ahead of the United Nations Human Rights Committee's review of the country, scheduled for October 17. Islamabad has consistently rejected foreign criticism of its blasphemy laws, calling it an internal matter for Pakistan to deal with. The report came just days after a police officer in the southwestern province of Balochistan shot and killed a man who was being held in custody on blasphemy allegations. The victim, a Muslim, was arrested a day earlier for allegedly making derogatory remarks about the Prophet Muhammad. In June, a 73-year-old Pakistani man from the minority Christian community died in a hospital a week after being violently attacked by a mob in his native Sargodha district in Punjab following accusations he insulted Islam. Days later, on June 20, a Muslim man from Punjab was visiting the scenic Swat Valley in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa when a mob violently lynched him for allegedly desecrating Islam's holy book, the Quran. Hundreds of suspects, mostly Muslims, are languishing in jails in Pakistan because fear of retaliation from religious groups deters judges from moving their trials forward. The CFJ report backed long-running local and international rights groups’ concerns that the strict blasphemy laws are often misused to settle personal vendettas or to persecute Pakistani minority communities. The organization says its CFJ legal experts are tasked to monitor criminal trials globally against those who are most vulnerable, particularly journalists, democracy defenders, women and girls, LGBTQ+ persons, and minorities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-defendants-face-grueling-legal-battles-over-blasphemy-allegations-says-new-report/7786497.html	2024-09-16T11:53:20-07:00

Pakistani man pleads not guilty to US assassination plot charges	NEW YORK — A Pakistani man with alleged ties to Iran pleaded not guilty on Monday to charges stemming from an alleged plot to assassinate an American politician in retaliation for the killing of Iran's Revolutionary Guards top commander Qassem Soleimani. Asif Merchant, 46, entered his plea to one count of attempting to commit terrorism across national boundaries and one count of murder for hire at a hearing before U.S. Magistrate Judge Robert Levy in Brooklyn. The judge ordered that Merchant be detained pending trial. Federal prosecutors say Merchant spent time in Iran before traveling to the United States to recruit people for the plot. Merchant told a confidential informant he also planned to steal documents from one target and organize protests in the United States, prosecutors said. The defendant named Donald Trump as a potential target but had not conceived the scheme as a plan to assassinate the former president, according to a person familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity. Court papers do not name the alleged targets, and no attacks were made. As president, Trump had in 2020 approved the drone strike on Soleimani. There are no suggestions that Merchant was tied to an apparent assassination attempt on Trump at his Florida golf course on Sunday, or a separate shooting of the Republican presidential candidate at a rally in Pennsylvania in July. Merchant was arrested in Texas on July 15. Iran's mission to the United Nations said in August that the 'modus operandi' described in Merchant's court papers ran contrary to Tehran's policy of 'legally prosecuting the murder of General Soleimani.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistani-man-pleads-not-guilty-to-us-assassination-plot-charges/7786386.html	2024-09-16T10:30:39-07:00

Thousands protest in France as high-profile rape cases rock country	Paris — Thousands of people protested sexual violence across France this past weekend, as two high-profile cases rock the country: one involving a woman who was allegedly drugged and raped by dozens of men for years; the other targeting a once-beloved French clergyman, who fought for the rights of the homeless. In French cities like Marseille and Nantes, both men and women took part in demonstrations calling for an end to sexual violence. They carried signs with messages like 'No, to the culture of rape,' and 'Gisele, we believe you' — in support of 72-year-old Gisele Pelicot. Pelicot’s former husband is on trial in the southern city of Avignon, accused of drugging her and recruiting dozens of men to rape her over nearly a decade. Speaking to reporters on Monday, Pelicot thanked the protesters and other supporters. They have given her force, she said, to fight for all those who are victims of sexual violence. The Avignon trial is only the latest of a raft of sexual violence accusations targeting famous French actors and other figures. Most recently, the spotlight has been on Abbe Pierre, once a crusader for the homeless. For years one of the most popular personalities in France, the priest died in 2007 at the age of 94. But in recent weeks, multiple allegations have surfaced that he sexually assaulted women in France and other countries over the decades. There are now efforts to strike his name from the charities he founded, as well as from parks and streets named after him. Speaking to reporters Friday, Pope Francis said Abbe Pierre did a lot of good, but was also a sinner — and such things must be spoken about, not hidden. The head of the French bishop’s association has since said that at least some French bishops had known about the cleric’s alleged abuses for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-protest-in-france-as-high-profile-rape-cases-rock-country/7786330.html	2024-09-16T10:03:18-07:00

US imposes sanctions on 4 Georgians over protest crackdowns	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department imposed on Monday sanctions on two Georgian government officials and two members of the country’s pro-Russian far-right movement who it said were involved in violent crackdowns on protests. Large street protests erupted in Georgia over a 'foreign agent' law, which the South Caucasus country's parliament passed in May despite criticism, including from U.S. officials, that it was Kremlin-inspired and authoritarian. A Treasury statement said the financial sanctions on Monday targeted Georgia's Chief of the Special Task Department Zviad Kharazishvili and his deputy, Mileri Lagazauri, who oversaw security forces who violently suppressed the spring protests. 'The violence perpetuated by the Special Task Department included the brutal beatings of many attendees of the non-violent protests against the new foreign influence law, including Georgian citizens and opposition politicians,' the Treasury said. It added that Kharazishvili was personally involved in the physical and verbal abuse of protesters. Also targeted were Konstantine Morgoshia, founder of media company Alt-Info, and associated media personality Zurab Makharadze, Treasury said, accusing them of amplifying disinformation and spreading hate speech and threats. The dispute around the foreign agents law was seen as a test of whether Georgia, for three decades among the more pro-Western of the Soviet Union's successor states, would maintain its Western orientation or move closer to Russia. The Georgian Dream party that controls parliament said the legislation was needed to ensure transparency in foreign funding of NGOs and protect the country's sovereignty. Washington has long criticized the law and launched a review into bilateral cooperation with Georgia. The Biden administration has previously imposed visa bans on members of Georgian Dream, members of parliament, law enforcement and private citizens over the law and the protests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-sanctions-on-4-georgians-over-protest-crackdowns-/7786183.html	2024-09-16T08:47:39-07:00	
Postal Service chief 'fully committed' to timely US ballot deliveries	Washington — U.S. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy said on Monday he is 'personally fully committed' to ensuring all 2024 presidential election ballots are delivered in a timely fashion and vowed to respond to concerns raised by state and local officials. A group of about three dozen election officials from the National Association of State Election Directors and other groups on Wednesday raised serious concerns about USPS's ability to deliver millions of ballots for the 2024 presidential election, citing questions 'about processing facility operations, lost or delayed election mail, and front-line training deficiencies impacting USPS’s ability to deliver election mail in a timely and accurate manner.' DeJoy said in a letter released on Monday that he would hold a call with state officials to address specific concerns. The officials said that, despite repeated meetings with USPS election staff, 'we have not seen improvement or concerted efforts to remediate our concerns.' DeJoy said the USPS Office of Inspector General is auditing its plants and delivery units and will report any election mail issues they discover 'and we will address those issues expeditiously.' Starting Oct. 1, USPS will deploy ballot monitors and others in processing, retail and delivery units 'to reinforce and amplify our policies and procedures on the ground' USPS said on average it is currently delivering mail in 2.7 days but continues 'to recommend as a common-sense measure that voters should mail their completed ballot before Election Day, and at least one week prior to their state’s deadline.' The inspector general has said 46% of votes were cast by mail in the November 2020 presidential election, compared with 21% in the 2016 election. USPS said in the 2020 general election, it delivered 99.89% of ballots from voters to election officials within seven days. Voting by mail in some states is set to start in the coming weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/postal-service-chief-fully-committed-to-timely-us-ballot-deliveries/7786105.html	2024-09-16T08:02:25-07:00	
Nearly 300 inmates escape after floods bring down prison walls in northeast Nigeria	Abuja, Nigeria — Nigerian authorities said 281 inmates escaped after devastating floods brought down a prison’s walls in the country's northeast. A major dam collapsed on Sept. 10, unleashing severe flooding that left 30 people dead and over a million displaced, and prompted evacuations across the state of Borno. Officers attempted to evacuate the city of Maiduguri's main prison last week when they found out that the prisoners had escaped, Umar Abubakar, spokesperson for the Nigeria Correctional Services said in a statement Sunday night. 'The floods brought down the walls of the correctional facilities including the Medium Security Custodial Centre, as well as the staff quarters in the city,' Abubakar said. Security personnel were able to recapture seven of the inmates and an operation is still ongoing to locate the rest, he said. The collapse caused some of the state’s worst flooding since the same dam collapsed 30 years ago. The state government said the dam was at capacity due to unusually high rains. Two years ago, heavy flooding in Nigeria killed more than 600 people across the country. West Africa has experienced some of the heaviest flooding in decades this year, affecting over 2.3 million people, a threefold increase from 2023, according to the U.N.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nearly-300-inmates-escape-after-floods-bring-down-prison-walls-in-northeast-nigeria/7786033.html	2024-09-16T06:59:06-07:00	
Saudi Arabia plans to allow tougher nuclear oversight by IAEA this year	Vienna — Saudi Arabia plans to scrap light-touch oversight of its nuclear facilities by the U.N. atomic watchdog and switch to regular safeguards by the end of this year, the kingdom said on Monday, a step the watchdog has long been calling for. Saudi Arabia has a nascent nuclear program that it wants to expand to eventually include activities like proliferation-sensitive uranium enrichment. It is unclear where its ambitions end, since Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has said for years it will develop nuclear weapons if regional rival Iran does. Riyadh has yet to fire up its first nuclear reactor, which allows its program to still be monitored under the Small Quantities Protocol (SQP), an agreement with the International Atomic Energy Agency that exempts less advanced states from many reporting obligations and inspections. 'The kingdom ... has submitted a request to the agency in July 2024 to rescind the Small Quantities Protocol and implement to the full Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement,' Saudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman told the IAEA's annual General Conference, speaking through an interpreter. 'We are currently working with the agency to finalize all necessary subsidiary agreements for the SQP to be effectively rescinded by the end of December of this year.' Prince Abdulaziz announced a year ago that his country had decided to scrap the SQP but he did not say when it would switch and there were no immediate signs that it was following through. IAEA chief Rafael Grossi has been calling on the dozens of states that still have SQPs to amend or rescind them, calling them a 'weakness' in the global non-proliferation regime. The IAEA has for years been in talks with Riyadh on making the switch to a Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement that covers issues like inspections in countries that have ratified the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. 'Saudi Arabia's decision to rescind its Small Quantities Protocol increases [the IAEA]'s ability to verify the peaceful use of nuclear material in the country,' Grossi said on social media platform X, adding he commended Riyadh for the move. Neither Grossi nor Prince Abdulaziz mentioned the Additional Protocol, a supplementary agreement that allows more thorough oversight than the CSA, including snap inspections by the agency. While the IAEA would like Saudi Arabia to sign the Additional Protocol, it has been unclear whether it will.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-arabia-plans-to-allow-tougher-nuclear-oversight-by-iaea-this-year-/7786015.html	2024-09-16T06:49:05-07:00	
Coe among 7 candidates to succeed Bach as IOC president	Lausanne, Switzerland — World Athletics chief Sebastian Coe is the highest profile of the seven candidates to have declared on Monday their bid to succeed International Olympic Committee president Thomas Bach. Coe will face stiff opposition from, among others, Kirsty Coventry, bidding to become the first woman and African to head the IOC, and cycling boss David Lappartient. The election will be at the IOC Session in Athens, which runs from March 18-21 next year. Bach, 70, is standing down after serving 12 years. The German announced at the end of the Paris Games that he would not be seeking another term. The other four candidates include two from Asia another continent never to have had an IOC president — Jordan's Prince Faisal al-Hussein and gymnastics chief Morinari Watanabe. Juan Antonio Samaranch Junior, whose father of the same name was IOC president from 1980-2001 and transformed it into a commercial powerhouse, and a surprise entrant, ski federation president Johan Eliasch, round up the candidates. First up for the septet is presenting their respective programs to the IOC members at the turn of the year. 'The candidates will present their programs, in camera, to the full IOC membership on the occasion of a meeting to be held in Lausanne (Switzerland) in January 2025,' read a short IOC statement unveiling the candidates. There will be a transition period post-election — not something Bach enjoyed when he succeeded Jacques Rogge in 2013 with the new president and his team assuming control in June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/coe-among-7-candidates-to-succeed-bach-as-ioc-president/7785995.html	2024-09-16T06:40:19-07:00	
Germany expands border controls to curb migrant arrivals	Frankfurt-Oder, Germany — Germany on Monday expanded border controls to the frontiers with all its nine neighbors in hopes of curbing the flow of irregular migrants, a move that has sparked protests from other EU members. Federal police in high-visibility vests braved rains at road and highway crossings for spot checks of passenger cars, buses and other vehicles, asking to see people's identity papers and checking the trunks of some cars. Germany lies at the heart of Europe and of the visa-free Schengen zone, which is designed to allow the free movement of people and goods, long a core idea of the European project. Berlin announced the sweeping measure last week following a string of deadly extremist attacks that have stoked public fears and boosted support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Poland and Austria have been among countries to complain about the move, which is set to last an initial six months. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser said the step aimed to limit irregular migration and 'put a stop to criminals and identify and stop Islamists at an early stage.' The controls slowed traffic, but some people voiced support. Elle Rendigs, 70, who was headed from Germany to the French city of Strasbourg, said she hoped the stepped-up policing would bring 'a bit more security.' Border controls with Poland, the Czech Republic, Austria and Switzerland were already in place before the crackdown was announced. These have now been expanded to Germany's borders with France, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Belgium and Denmark. Faeser said the government hoped to minimize the impact on people living and working in border regions, promising 'coordination with our neighboring countries.' On the Polish border, a small group of protesters stood near the bridge at Frankfurt on the Oder, one waving a placard that called for 'Open worlds, open minds, open borders.' The controls on the way into Frankfurt, on the German side, were 'not good for the city,' local resident Waltraut, 77, told AFP. Germany expanded the border controls after a string of suspected Islamist attacks stirred concerns over immigration. Last month, a man on a knife rampage killed three people and wounded eight more at a festival in the western city of Solingen. The Syrian suspect, who has alleged links to the Islamic State group, had been due to be deported but managed to evade authorities. With national elections looming next year, the attacks put intense political pressure on Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government to toughen its stance on migrants and asylum seekers. As well as increasing the extent of controls at its borders, Germany has presented plans to speed up deportations to European partners. Under EU rules, asylum requests are meant to be handled by the country of arrival. The system has placed a huge strain on countries on the European periphery, where leaders have demanded more burden-sharing. Under the new crackdown, spot controls can be carried out within 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the border, said Daniel Rosin, a spokesman for police in Kehl, across the border from Strasbourg. Police will operate not only along the roads, but on 'trams and cross-border trains' connecting the two countries, Rosin said. Covering hundreds of extra kilometers of borderland will 'definitely not be possible to do without any gaps,' German police union leader Andreas Rosskopf told broadcaster RBB. He said it remained to be seen 'how successful it actually is in curbing migration and people smuggling.' Rene Hemmert, 69, traveling from France to Germany, said the controls remind him 'of when I was younger,' before the Schengen zone was established. 'I think it's a good thing because of all the problems we have, with immigration,' said Hemmert. 'It's the same as in France, they should do the same.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-expands-border-controls-to-curb-migrant-arrivals/7785920.html	2024-09-16T05:44:37-07:00

UK PM Starmer meets Italy's Meloni for illegal immigration talks	Rome — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met his Italian counterpart Giorgia Meloni in Rome on Monday to discuss tackling illegal immigration, a day after another Channel migrant shipwreck claimed eight lives. Starmer, whose center-left Labour Party was elected with a crushing parliamentary majority in July, has vowed to fight illegal immigration, a hot-button topic in British politics for years. 'Here, there's been some quite dramatic reduction [in migrant arrival numbers] so I want to understand how that came about,' Starmer said in Rome ahead of his meeting with Meloni. He was speaking while touring a national immigration coordination centre with Italy's interior minister, Matteo Piantedosi. Starmer was received with a welcome ceremony at 12:00 local time (10:00 GMT) at Rome's Villa Doria Pamphili before his meeting with Meloni. Far-right riots shook cities and towns across England and Northern Ireland shortly after Starmer's election, the U.K.'s worst unrest since 2011, with mosques and migrant accommodation centers often targeted. The perilous cross-Channel journeys migrants attempt from northern France have posed a fiendishly difficult problem to solve for successive British prime ministers Eight migrants died on Sunday after their overcrowded boat capsized in the Channel between France and England, bringing to 46 the number of people who have lost their lives this year trying to reach British shores. Around 800 people crossed the Channel on Saturday, the second-highest figure since the start of the year, according to the U.K. interior ministry. Starmer has rejected the previous Conservative government's plan to expel all undocumented migrants to Rwanda while their asylum claims are examined. Instead, U.K. media say he is interested in the strategy of Meloni, leader of the far-right Brothers of Italy party, whose country is on the front line of illegal migration into the European Union. Italy signed an agreement with Albania in November to open two centers in the Balkan country where undocumented migrants would be housed while their asylum claims are processed. Italy is to fund and manage the centers, which will be capable of accommodating up to 3,000 migrants who have arrived on Italian shores by boat. Migrants with rejected asylum claims would be sent back to their country of origin, whereas those with accepted applications will be granted entry to Italy. That is a key difference from the former U.K. government's Rwanda scheme, whereby migrants sent to the East African nation could never have settled in Britain irrespective of the outcome of their claim. Fewer arriving migrants While touring the migrant coordination center, Starmer said it looked like the lower migrant arrivals to Italy were due to 'work that's been done in some of the countries where people are coming from.' 'I’ve long believed, by the way, that prevention and stopping people travelling in the first place is one of the best ways to deal with this particular issue,' he added. Starmer's trip to Italy has already spurred criticism, even within his own party. Labour MP Kim Johnson told The Guardian newspaper it was 'disturbing that Starmer is seeking to learn lessons from a neo-fascist government, particularly after the anti-refugee riots and far-right racist terrorism that swept Britain this summer.' The newly appointed chief of the U.K.'s new Border Security Command, Martin Hewitt, was accompanying Starmer during his trip, his office said. Besides Albania, Meloni's government has also inked a deal with Tunisia, granting aid in exchange for greater efforts to stop Italy-bound migrants who leave the North African country and cross the Mediterranean. Italy has also renewed a controversial deal with the UN-backed Libyan government in Tripoli, dating from 2017, in which Rome provides training and funding to the Libyan coastguard in order to stem departures of migrants or return to Libya those already at sea. Human rights groups say the policy pushes thousands of migrants back to Libya to face torture and abuse under arbitrary detention. Since the start of the year, migrant arrivals to Italy by sea have dropped markedly, according to the interior ministry. Between January 1 and September 13, 44,675 people arrived in Italy compared to a figure of 125,806 for the same period in 2023. Across all the EU borders, meanwhile, the number of migrants crossing has dropped by 39 percent, according to border agency Frontex. But multiple factors are behind these trends, experts say, with many migrants seeking entry into the EU having changed their route. While the Balkan and Central Mediterranean migration routes saw flows fall significantly this year, by 77 percent and 64 percent respectively, the West African and Eastern land border routes recorded sharp increases, of 123 percent and 193 percent respectively. Crossings are up 13 percent over the Channel this year, Frontex said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-pm-starmer-meets-italy-s-meloni-for-illegal-immigration-talks-/7785869.html	2024-09-16T04:43:44-07:00	
Death toll rises as torrential rain and flooding force evacuations in Central Europe	PRAGUE — The death toll was rising in Central European countries on Sunday after days of heavy rains caused widespread flooding and forced evacuations. Several Central European nations have already been hit by severe flooding, including Austria, the Czech Republic, Poland and Romania. Slovakia and Hungary might come next as a result of a low pressure system from northern Italy dumping record rainfall in the region since Thursday. The floods have claimed six lives in Romania and one each in Austria and Poland. In the Czech Republic, four people who were swept away by waters were missing, police said. It's not over yet Most parts of the Czech Republic have been affected as authorities declared the highest flood warnings at around 100 places across the country. But the situation was worst in two northeastern regions that recorded the biggest rainfall in recent days, including the Jeseniky mountains near the Polish border. In the city of Opava, up to 10,000 people out of a population of around 56,000 have been asked to move to higher ground. Rescuers used boats to transport people to safety in a neighborhood flooded by the raging Opava River. 'There’s no reason to wait,' Mayor Tomáš Navrátil told Czech public radio. He said that the situation was worse than during the last devastating floods in 1997, known as the 'flood of the century.' 'We have to focus on saving lives,' Prime Minister Petr Fiala told Czech public television on Sunday. His government was set to meet Monday to assess the damages. The worst 'is not behind us yet,' the prime minister warned. President Petr Pavel sounded more optimistic, saying 'it's obvious we've learned a lesson from the previous crisis.' At least 4 missing and villages cut off Thousands of others also were evacuated in the towns of Krnov, which was almost completely flooded, and Cesky Tesin. The Oder River that flows to Poland was reaching extreme levels in the city of Ostrava and in Bohumin, prompting evacuations. Ostrava, the regional capital, is the third-largest Czech city. Mayor Jan Dohnal said the city will face major traffic disruptions in the days to come. Almost no trains were operating in the region. Towns and villages in the Jeseniky mountains, including the local center of Jesenik, were inundated and isolated by raging waters that turned roads into rivers. The military sent a helicopter to help with evacuations. Jesenik Mayor Zdenka Blistanova told Czech public television that several houses in her and other nearby towns have been destroyed by the floods. A number of bridges and roads have been badly damaged. About 260,000 households were without power Sunday morning in the entire country, while traffic was halted on many roads, including the major D1 highway. A firefighter dies as Lower Austria declared a disaster zone A firefighter died after 'slipping on stairs' while pumping out a flooded basement in the town of Tulln, the head of the fire department of Lower Austria, Dietmar Fahrafellner, told reporters on Sunday. Authorities declared the entire state of Lower Austria in the northeastern part of the country a disaster zone, while 10,000 relief forces have so far evacuated 1,100 houses there. Emergency personnel have started setting up accommodation for residents who had to flee their homes due to the flooding. The municipality of Lilienfeld with about 25,000 residents is cut off from the outside world. Residents were told to boil tap water as a precaution. In Vienna, the Wien River overflowed its banks, flooding homes and forcing first evacuations of nearby houses. Romania reports 2 more flooding victims Romanian authorities said Sunday that another two people had died in the hard-hit eastern county of Galati after four were reported dead there a day earlier, following unprecedented rain. Dramatic flooding in Poland In Poland, one person was presumed dead in floods in the southwest, Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Sunday. Tusk said the situation was 'dramatic' around the town of Klodzko, with about 25,000 residents, located in a valley in the Sudetes mountains near the border with the Czech Republic. Helicopters were used to pick up people from roofs in a few cases. In Glucholazy, rising waters overflowed a river embankment and flooded streets and houses. Mayor Paweł Szymkowicz said, 'we are drowning,' and appealed to residents to evacuate to high ground. The weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region. Scientists have documented Earth’s hottest summer, breaking a record set just a year ago. A hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-rises-as-torrential-rain-and-flooding-force-evacuations-in-central-europe-/7785841.html	2024-09-16T04:08:01-07:00	
Vietnam puts typhoon losses at $1.6 billion	Hanoi — Typhoon Yagi caused $1.6 billion in economic losses in Vietnam, state media said Monday, as the UN's World Food Program said the deadly floods it triggered in Myanmar were the worst in the country's recent history. Yagi battered Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand with powerful winds and a huge dump of rain more than a week ago, triggering floods and landslides that have killed more than 400 people, according to official figures. It tore across Vietnam's densely populated Red River delta — a vital agricultural region that is also home to major manufacturing hubs — damaging factories and infrastructure, and inundating farmland. The typhoon caused an estimated $1.6 billion in economic losses, state media reported, citing an initial government assessment. The death toll in Vietnam stands at 292, with 38 missing, more than 230,000 homes damaged and 280,000 hectares of crops destroyed, according to authorities. In Myanmar, the ruling junta has reported 113 fatalities and said that more than 320,000 people have been forced from their homes into temporary relief camps. 'Super Typhoon Yagi has affected most of the country and caused the worst floods we have seen in Myanmar's recent history,' Sheela Matthew, WFP's representative in Myanmar, said in a statement, without giving precise details. Exact details of the impact on agriculture were not yet clear, she said. 'But I can say for sure that the impact on food security will be nothing less than devastating,' Matthew said. Severe flooding hit Myanmar in 2011 and 2015, with more than 100 deaths reported on both occasions, while in 2008 Cyclone Nargis left more than 138,000 people dead or missing. The latest crisis has prompted the junta to issue a rare appeal for foreign aid, with neighbor India responding with 10 tons of materials, including dry rations, clothing and medicine. Myanmar's military has blocked or frustrated humanitarian assistance from abroad in the past, including after powerful Cyclone Mocha last year when it suspended travel authorizations for aid groups trying to reach around a million people. Even before the latest floods, people in Myanmar were already grappling with the effects of three years of war between the junta and armed groups opposed to its rule, with millions forced from their homes by the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-puts-typhoon-losses-at-1-6-billion-/7785829.html	2024-09-16T03:50:46-07:00	
Japan celebrates historic Emmys triumph for 'Shogun'	Osaka, Japan — Japan celebrated on Monday the record-breaking Emmy Awards triumph of 'Shogun', although many confessed not having watched the series about the country's warring dynasties in the feudal era. 'Shogun' smashed all-time records at the television awards in Los Angeles on Sunday, taking home an astounding 18 statuettes and becoming the first non-English-language winner of the highly coveted award for best drama series. Lead Hiroyuki Sanada, who played Lord Toranaga, became the first Japanese actor to win an Emmy, while Anna Sawai achieved the same for her performance as Lady Mariko. 'As a Japanese, I'm happy Sanada won,' Kiyoko Kanda, a 70-year-old pensioner, told AFP in Tokyo. 'He worked so hard since he moved to Los Angeles,' she said. 'In 'Last Samurai', Tom Cruise was the lead, but it's exciting Sanada is the main character in 'Shogun',' Kanda added. But she admitted that she only watched the trailer. The series is available only on Disney's streaming platform, which is relatively new in Japan. 'I want to watch it. I'm curious to know how Japan is portrayed,' Kanda said. Otsuka, who declined to give her first name, said she, too, has not watched the show. 'But I saw the news and I'm happy he won.' Sanada, now 63, began his acting career at the age of five in Tokyo and moved to LA after appearing in 'Last Samurai' in 2003. The words 'historic achievements' and 'Hiroyuki Sanada' were trending on X in Japanese, while Sanada's speech at the awards racked up tens of thousands of views. Yusuke Takizawa, 41, also only watched a trailer but he said he was amazed by the quality of the show. 'I was impressed by the high-spirited acting, the attention to detail and the film technology,' Takizawa told AFP outside Osaka Castle, a major historical location for the series. 'I think many young people will want to try their hand in Hollywood after watching Sanada,' he said. Tourists at the castle also welcomed the record Emmy win. 'I think was the best TV show that I've seen this year,' said Zara Ferjani, a visitor from London. 'I thought it was amazing... The direction was beautiful, and I really enjoyed watching something that wasn't in English as well,' the 33-year-old said. She said she had planned to watch 'Shogun' after returning home from Japan. 'But one of my friends strongly advised me to watch it beforehand, just to appreciate the culture more and definitely Osaka Castle more,' she added. - Breaking from cliches - Many in the Japanese film industry were also jubilant. 'He won after many years of trying hard in Hollywood. It's too cool,' wrote Shinichiro Ueda, director of the hit low-budget film 'One Cut of the Dead', on X. Video game creator and movie fan Hideo Kojima, who has described the show as 'Game of Thrones in 17th-century Japan', reposted a news story on the win. The drama, adapted from a popular novel by James Clavell and filmed in Canada, tells the tale of Lord Toranaga, who fights for his life against his enemies alongside Mariko and British sailor John Blackthorne. A previous TV adaptation made in 1980 was centered on Blackthorne's perspective. But the new 'Shogun' breaks away from decades of cliched and often bungled depictions of Japan in Western cinema, with Japanese spoken throughout most of the show. Sanada, who also co-produced the drama, is credited with bringing a new level of cultural and historical authenticity to 'Shogun.' An army of experts, including several wig technicians from Japan, worked behind the scenes to make the series realistic, poring over sets, costumes and the actors' movements.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-celebrates-historic-emmys-triumph-for-shogun-/7785820.html	2024-09-16T03:35:51-07:00	
Over 100 striking Samsung workers detained by Indian police for planning march	CHENNAI, India — Police on Monday detained 104 striking workers protesting low wages at a Samsung Electronics plant in southern India as they were planning a protest march without permission, with the dispute disrupting output at the key factory for the past week. The detention marks an escalation of a strike by workers at a Samsung home appliance plant near Chennai in the state of Tamil Nadu. Workers want higher wages and have stopped work at the plant that contributes roughly a third of Samsung's annual India revenue of $12 billion. The Samsung protests have cast a shadow on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's plan of courting foreign investors to 'Make in India' and his goal of tripling electronics production to $500 billion within six years. Lured by cheap labor, foreign companies are increasingly using India for manufacturing to diversify their supply chain beyond China. On Monday, the workers planned to start a protest march, but were detained as no permission was given since there are schools, colleges and hospitals in that area, said senior police officer of the Kancheepuram district K. Shanmugam. 'It is the main area which would become totally paralyzed and [the protest would] disturb public peace,' he said. 'We have detained them in wedding halls as all of them can't be in stations,' he said. Samsung workers since last week have been protesting at a makeshift tent near the plant, demanding higher wages, recognition for a union backed by influential labor group the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), and better working hours. Samsung is not keen to recognize any union backed by a national labor group such as the CITU, and talks with workers, as well as state government officials, have not yielded resolution. The CITU Tamil Nadu Deputy General Secretary, S. Kannan, condemned the police action, saying 'This is an archaic move by the state government.' Despite Monday's police action, 12 union groups, including one affiliated with the ruling party of Tamil Nadu, said in a public notice dated Sept. 11 that they will stage a protest in support of the striking workers in Chennai on Wednesday, a move that could intensify the tensions between the company and the workers. 'We are going ahead with Wednesday's protest ... no changes to the plan,' said A. Jenitan, a deputy district secretary for the CITU. The protests add to Samsung's challenges in India, a key growth market. The South Korean company is planning job cuts of up to 30% of its overseas staff in some divisions, including in India. And India's antitrust body has found Samsung and other smartphone companies colluded with e-commerce giants to launch devices exclusively, violating competition laws, Reuters has reported. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment on Monday, but on Friday said it has initiated discussions with workers at the Chennai plant 'to resolve all issues at the earliest.' Video footage from Reuters partner ANI showed dozens of Samsung workers wearing the company uniform of blue shirts being transported in a bus to a hall. The Samsung plant employs roughly 1,800 workers and more than 1,000 of them have been on strike. The factory makes appliances such as refrigerators, TVs and washing machines. Another Samsung plant that makes smartphones in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh has had no unrest. The police also detained one of CITU's senior leaders, E. Muthukumar, who was leading the Samsung protests at the factory near Chennai, according to the CITU's Jenitan. Kancheepuram police official Shanmugam said there was no timeline as to how long the workers will be detained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-100-striking-samsung-workers-detained-by-indian-police-for-planning-march-/7785787.html	2024-09-16T03:07:16-07:00	
Australia imposes more sanctions on Iran over human rights concerns	SYDNEY — Australia is imposing more sanctions on Iranian officials on the second anniversary of the jailing and death of Mahsa Jina Amini. The 22-year-old Kurdish-Iranian woman was arrested in September 2022 for 'improperly' wearing her hijab. Australia’s Foreign Affairs Minister Penny Wong said Monday that Australia stood in solidarity 'with Iranian women and girls in their struggle for equality and empowerment.' Wong announced financial sanctions and travel bans on senior security and law enforcement officials who have allegedly been involved in the 'violent repression' of protests in Iran. She said the human rights situation in Iran was 'dire' as female activists continued to be detained and handed death sentences. Wong told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. that abuses by Iranian authorities have continued since the death of Amini two years ago. 'We have sanctioned five Iranian security and law enforcement officials who have been involved in these law enforcement so-called activities, which are ultimately a repression - a violent repression - of the Iranian people,' Wong said. Nikita White a campaigner with Amnesty International Australia, a rights group, told local media Monday that human rights have rapidly deteriorated in Iran. 'The people who are being executed are being executed after facing horrifically unfair trials,' White said. She said torture and and ill-treatment have been reported. Australia has now imposed sanctions on almost 200 individuals and organizations with links to Iran, including those associated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. It was listed by Canada as a terrorist group earlier this year following a similar move by the United States in 2019. In Canberra on Monday, opposition lawmaker and shadow foreign affairs spokesperson Simon Birmingham urged the Australian government to list the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps a terrorist organization. Earlier this month, Iranian foreign minister Abbas Araghchi described sanctions announced by Britain, France and Germany as 'economic terrorism.' Araghchi has rejected U.S. claims that Tehran has sent ballistic missiles to Russia to help in its war with Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-imposes-more-sanctions-on-iran-over-human-rights-concerns/7785771.html	2024-09-16T02:27:13-07:00

Child abuse case puts banned Malaysian sect back in spotlight	Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia — On its website, Global Ikhwan Services and Business Holdings (GISB) describes itself as a Malaysian conglomerate with a vision to implement the Islamic way of life in line with the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad. But the rescue this week of hundreds of children and youths from what Malaysian authorities said was suspected sexual abuse at charity homes allegedly run by GISB has put back in the spotlight the firm's roots in a religious sect outlawed by the government three decades ago. GISB acknowledges links to the religious sect Al-Arqam, which was banned in 1994, and names the sect's late preacher Ashaari Muhammad as its founder, but has largely sought to distance itself from the group's practices and beliefs, which the government views as heretical. GISB has said it did not run the homes and has denied all allegations of abuse. In a video posted on Facebook, however, its chief executive said the firm had broken unspecified laws and that there were 'one or two' cases of sodomy at the youth homes. In 2011, GISB made headlines for its controversial views on sex and marriage, which included encouraging polygamous families and setting up the Obedient Wives' Club, a group that called on wives to submit to their spouses 'like prostitutes.' The police raids on the charity homes in two Malaysian states this week came after several Islamic leaders called on the government to probe GISB's activities. Abu Hafiz Salleh Hudin, a lecturer on Islam at the International Islamic University of Malaysia, said he was aware of reports made to Malaysia's Islamic Development Department (Jakim) about worker exploitation and deviant teachings at GISB as far back as a decade ago. 'They would stress that they were exploited, and they were not being paid for work,' he told Reuters, citing reports made by former GISB members. The former members had also held on to Al-Arqam's teachings and beliefs, Abu Hafiz added. Police say they are investigating other allegations, including money laundering. Authorities say they also plan to scrutinize religious schools run by GISB while Jakim said it would present a report into deviant teachings involving the firm to the cabinet. Police say most of the youths rescued from the homes in two Malaysian states were children of GISB members. Many showed signs of abuse, neglect and emotional trauma, while 13 had been sodomized, officials said on Friday. Residents in Bukit Beruntung, a town in which a police source and locals said authorities had raided several youth homes, expressed shock at the abuse allegations. 'If it's true, then that is really worrying,' said Mohd Khair Syafie, the imam of a surau, or Muslim prayer hall, in the town, some 50 km outside the capital. Ashaari Muhammad founded the Al-Arqam movement in 1968, which was initially focused on discussing religious issues. In the 1980s, the group, which had tens of thousands of followers, was condemned by Malaysia's religious authorities over what they said were deviant teachings by Ashaari, whose followers claimed he had supernatural powers and could defer death. Ashaari, who had five wives and 37 children, spent two years in prison in the 1990s and died in 2010. In 2006, Malaysia's government outlawed Rufaqa Corp, another company founded by Ashaari, which it described as an attempt to revive Al-Arqam. A Rufaqa official at the time denied it had an other agenda than preaching Islam and building its business. In an August interview with business daily The Malaysian Reserve, GISB said the company was rebranded from Rufaqa Corp and reiterated it was a commercial entity compliant with Islam. Munira Mustaffa, executive director of security consultancy Chasseur Group, said GISB's businesses appeared to help it 'hide under the veil of legitimacy.' 'Living in a country where they know they are being watched, GISB have been careful to present themselves as entrepreneurial individuals and legitimate businesspeople,' said Munira. 'But at the same time, they follow the same template as other isolationist communities or cults.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/child-abuse-case-puts-banned-malaysian-sect-back-in-spotlight/7785739.html	2024-09-16T00:51:15-07:00	
First conviction under Hong Kong's security law for wearing 'seditious' T-shirt	HONG KONG — A Hong Kong man on Monday pleaded guilty to sedition for wearing a T-shirt with a protest slogan, becoming the first person convicted under the city's new national security law passed in March. Chu Kai-pong, 27, pleaded guilty to one count of 'doing with a seditious intention an act.' Under the new security law, the maximum sentence for the offense has been expanded from two years to seven years in prison and could even go up to 10 years if 'collusion with foreign forces' was found involved. Chu was arrested on June 12 at a MTR station wearing a T-shirt with the slogan 'Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our times' and a yellow mask printed with 'FDNOL'- the shorthand of another slogan, 'five demands, not one less.' Both slogans were frequently chanted in the huge, sometimes violent, pro-democracy protests in 2019 and June 12 was a key kick-off day of the months-long unrests. Chu told police that he wore the T-shirt to remind people of the protests, the court heard. Chief Magistrate Victor So, handpicked by the city leader John Lee to hear national security cases, adjourned the case to Thursday for sentencing. Hong Kong was returned from Britain to China in 1997 under Beijing's promise of guaranteeing its freedoms, including freedom of speech, would be protected under a 'one country, two systems' formula. Beijing imposed a national security law in 2020 punishing secession, subversion, terrorism or collusion with foreign forces with up to life in prison, after the months-long protests in the financial hub. In March 2024, Hong Kong passed a second new security law, a home-grown ordinance also known as 'Article 23' according to its parent provision in the city's mini constitution, the Basic Law. Critics, including the U.S. government have expressed concerns over the new security law and said the vaguely defined provisions regarding 'sedition' could be used to curb dissent. Hong Kong and Chinese officials have said it was necessary to plug 'loopholes' in the national security regime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/first-conviction-under-hong-kong-s-security-law-for-wearing-seditious-t-shirt/7785735.html	2024-09-16T00:39:30-07:00

Shogun' and 'Hacks' win top series Emmy Awards	LOS ANGELES — 'Hacks' won the comedy series at Sunday's Emmy Awards, topping 'The Bear,' which took home several of the night's honors. 'Shogun' won the best drama series win, collecting a whopping 18 Emmys for its first season, just one of several historic wins. Hiroyuki Sanada won best actor in a drama for 'Shogun' on Sunday night at the Emmy Awards, and Anna Sawai won best actress as they became the first two Japanese actors to win Emmys. Their wins gave the FX series momentum going into one of the night's top awards, where 'Shogun' won best drama series. 'The Bear' came back for seconds in a big way at the ceremony four times including best actor, best supporting actor and best supporting actress in a comedy, while British upstart 'Baby Reindeer' won four of its own, including best limited series. The star of FX's 'The Bear' Jeremy Allen White won best actor in a comedy for the second straight year, and Ebon Moss-Bachrach repeated as best supporting actor. A surprise came when Liza Colón-Zayas won best supporting actor over major competition. 'How could I have thought it would be possible to be in the presence of Meryl Streep and Carol Burnett,' Colón-Zayas said as tears welled in her eyes as she accepted the award on the stage of the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles. She is the first Latina to win in the category. 'To all the Latinas who are looking at me,' she said, 'keep believing and vote.' Netflix's darkly quirky 'Baby Reindeer' won best actor and best writing for the show's creator and star Richard Gadd and best supporting actress for Jessica Gunning, who plays his tormentor. Accepting the best limited series award, Gadd urged the makers of television to take chances. 'The only constant across any success in television is good storytelling,' he said. 'Good storytelling that speaks to our times. So take risks, push boundaries. Explore the uncomfortable. Dare to fail in order to achieve.' 'Baby Reindeer' is based on a one man-stage show in which Gadd describes being sexually abused along with other emotional struggles. Accepting that award, he said, 'no matter how bad it gets, it always gets better.' The Associated Press does not typically name people who say they have been sexually abused unless they come forward publicly as Gadd has. Jodie Foster won her first Emmy to go with her two Oscars when she took best actress in a limited series for 'True Detective: Night Country.' The creator of 'The Bear' was also a repeat winner. Christopher Storer took his second straight Emmy for directing, an award handed out by reunited 'Happy Days' co-stars Ron Howard and Henry Winkler. White said backstage that he was watching in the wings as Colón-Zayas won and 'that was just the greatest.' He also shouted out two acting wins the show had already scored at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmy Awards, when Jamie Lee Curtis won best guest actress in a comedy for playing his mother, and Jon Bernthal won best guest actor for playing his big brother. 'The Bear' won six times including most of the top comedy categories at the strike-delayed Emmys in January. While the third season of FX's 'The Bear' has already dropped, the trio won their second Emmys for its second, in which White's chef Carmen 'Carmy' Berzatto attempts to turn his family's grungy Chicago sandwich shop into an elite restaurant. It could still win more Sunday night including best comedy series. The father-son hosting duo of Eugene and Dan Levy in their monologue at the top of the show mocked the very dramatic 'The Bear' being in the comedy category. 'In honor of 'The Bear' we will be making no jokes,' Eugene Levy said, to laughs. Jean Smart won best actress in a comedy for 'Hacks.' She has won for all three seasons of 'Hacks,' and has six Emmys overall. She beat nominees including Ayo Edebiri, who as co-star of 'The Bear' moved from supporting actress, which she won in January, to lead actress. Coming into the show the big story was 'Shogun,' which had already taken the most Emmys for a show in a single season with 14 at the Creative Arts ceremony. The FX series about lordly politicking in feudal Japan can still win best drama series. If 'Shogun' faces competition for the best drama prize, it could come for the sixth and final season of 'The Crown,' the only show among the nominees that has won before in a category recently dominated by the retired 'Succession.' Elizabeth Debicki took best supporting actress in a drama for playing Princess Diana at the end of her life in the sixth and final season of the show. 'Playing this part, based on this unparalleled, incredible human being, has been my great privilege,' Debicki said. 'It's been a gift.' Billy Crudup won best actor in a drama for 'The Morning Show.' Streep wasn't the only Oscar winner trumped by a little-known name. Robert Downey Jr., the reigning best supporting actor winner for 'Oppenheimer,' was considered the favorite to win best supporting actor in a limited series for 'The Sympathizer,' but that award went to Lamorne Morris for 'Fargo.' 'Robert Downey Jr. I have a poster of you in my house!' Morris said from the stage as he accepted his first Emmy. Several awards were presented by themed teams from TV history, including sitcom dads George Lopez, Damon Wayans and Jesse Tyler Ferguson and TV moms Meredith Baxter, Connie Britton, and Susan Kelechi Watson.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shogun-and-hacks-win-top-series-emmy-awards/7785693.html	2024-09-15T20:31:58-07:00

Shy penguin wins New Zealand's bird election	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — It's noisy, smelly, shy – and New Zealand's bird of the year. The hoiho, or yellow-eyed penguin, won the country's fiercely fought avian election on Monday, offering hope to supporters of the endangered bird that recognition from its victory might prompt a revival of the species. It followed a campaign for the annual Bird of the Year vote that was absent the foreign interference scandals and cheating controversies of past polls. Instead, campaigners in the long-running contest sought votes in the usual ways — launching meme wars, seeking celebrity endorsements and even getting tattoos to prove their loyalty. More than 50,000 people voted in the poll, 300,000 fewer than last year, when British late night host John Oliver drove a humorous campaign for the pūteketeke — a 'deeply weird bird' which eats and vomits its own feathers – securing a landslide win. This year, the number of votes cast represented 10% of the population of New Zealand — a country where nature is never far away and where a love of native birds is instilled in citizens from childhood. 'Birds are our heart and soul,' said Emma Rawson, who campaigned for the fourth-placed ruru, a small brown owl with a melancholic call. New Zealand's only native mammals are bats and marine species, putting the spotlight on its birds, which are beloved — and often rare. This year's victor, the hoiho — its name means 'noise shouter' in the Māori language — is a shy bird thought to be the world's rarest penguin. Only found on New Zealand's South and Chatham islands — and on subantarctic islands south of the country — numbers have dropped perilously by 78% in the past 15 years. 'This spotlight couldn't have come at a better time. This iconic penguin is disappearing from mainland Aotearoa before our eyes,' Nicola Toki, chief executive of Forest & Bird — the organization that runs the poll — said in a press release, using the Māori name for New Zealand. Despite intensive conservation efforts on land, she said, the birds drown in nets and sea and can't find enough food. 'The campaign has raised awareness, but what we really hope is that it brings tangible support,' said Charlie Buchan, campaign manager for the hoiho. But while the bird is struggling, it attracted a star billing in the poll: celebrity endorsements flew in from English zoologist Jane Goodall, host of the Amazing Race Phil Keoghan, and two former New Zealand prime ministers. Aspiring bird campaign managers — this year ranging from power companies to high school students — submit applications to Forest & Bird for the posts. The hoiho bid was run by a collective of wildlife groups, a museum, a brewery and a rugby team in the city of Dunedin, where the bird is found on mainland New Zealand, making it the highest-powered campaign of the 2024 vote. 'I do feel like we were the scrappy underdog,' said Emily Bull, a spokesperson for the runner-up campaign, for the karure — a small, 'goth' black robin only found on New Zealand's Chatham Island. The karure's bid was directed by the students' association at Victoria University of Wellington, prompting fierce skirmish on the college campus when the student magazine staged an opposing campaign for the kororā, or little blue penguin. The rivalry provoked a meme war and students in bird costumes. Several people got tattoos. When the magazine's campaign secured endorsements of the city council and local zoo, Bull despaired for the black robin's bid. But the karure – which has performed a real-life comeback since the 1980s, with conservation efforts increasing the species from five birds to 250 – took second place overall. This weekend as Rawson wrapped up her campaign for the ruru, she too took her efforts directly to the people, courting votes at a local dog park. The veteran campaign manager who has directed the bids for other birds in past years was rewarded by the ruru placing fourth in the poll, her best ever result. 'I have not been in human political campaigning before,' said Rawson, who is drawn to the competition because of the funds and awareness it generates. The campaign struck a more sedate tone this year, she added. 'There's been no international interference, even though that was actually a lot of fun,' she said, referring to Oliver's high-profile campaign. It was not the only controversy the election has seen. While anyone in the world can vote, Forest & Bird now requires electors to verify their ballots after foreign interference plagued the contest before. In 2018, Australian pranksters cast hundreds of fraudulent votes in favor of the shag. The following year, Forest & Bird was forced to clarify that a flurry of votes from Russia appeared to be from legitimate bird-lovers. While campaigns are fiercely competitive, managers described tactics more akin to pro wrestling — in which fights are scripted — than divisive political contests. 'Sometimes people want to make posts that are kind of like beefy with you and they'll always message you and be like, hey, is it okay if I post this?' Bull said. 'There is a really sweet community. It's really wholesome.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/shy-penguin-wins-new-zealand-s-bird-election/7785679.html	2024-09-15T19:38:58-07:00	
Hundreds march in Brazil to support religious freedom	RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil — Practitioners of different religious traditions marched down Rio de Janeiro's iconic Copacabana Beach on Sunday to support religious freedom in Brazil, where cases of intolerance have doubled over the past six years. Hundreds of men, women and children from more than a dozen faiths participated in the event, known as the March for the Defense of Religious Freedom. Many of the participants were practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions that have recently faced attacks from members of Christian groups. Brazil's recently appointed Minister for Human Rights Macaé Evaristo also joined the march, which was held for the 17th consecutive year. 'The great challenge today in our country is to reduce inequality,' Evaristo told the state-run Agencia Brasil news agency. 'So for me it is very important to be present in this march, because the people here are also struggling for many things like decent work and a life free from hunger.' In Rio de Janeiro state, which is home to a quarter of the practitioners of Afro-Brazilian religions, there's been a proliferation of evangelical Christianity, particularly neo-Pentecostal churches founded since 1970 that focus on spreading their faith among non-believers. Experts say that while most neo-Pentecostal proselytizing is peaceful, the spread of the faith has been accompanied by a surge of intolerance for traditional African-influenced religions, ranging from verbal abuse and discrimination to destruction of temples and forced expulsion from neighborhoods. 'Everything that comes from Black people, everything that comes from people of African origin is devalued; if we are not firm in our faith, we will lose strength,' said Vania Vieira, a practitioner of the Afro-Brazilian religion Candomblé. 'This walk is to show that we are standing, that we will survive.' While the Brazilian constitution protects the free exercise of religion, cases of disrespect and attacks, especially against groups of African origin, have become increasingly frequent. Between 2018 and 2023, the Brazilian government's complaint service recorded an increase of 140% in the number of complaints of religious intolerance in the country. In Brazil, those who commit crimes of religious intolerance can face up to five years in prison, as well as a fine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-march-in-brazil-to-support-religious-freedom-/7785675.html	2024-09-15T19:29:39-07:00	
Small town in Kansas finds itself at the center of abortion debate	PITTSBURG, Kan. — The Rev. Anthony Navaratnam stood before his congregation and urged them to pray for the women from surrounding states who will flock to the new abortion clinic in town that opened in August. 'God is giving us an opportunity to be missionaries in Pittsburg, Kansas,' he told those at Flag Church, which hosted a training on how to protest outside of the clinic. The debate over reproductive rights has landed in this college town of 20,000 in the southeast corner of one of the few states left in the region still allowing abortions. It is near Missouri, Oklahoma and Arkansas and not terribly far from Texas. A place this size, especially one in a historically red state, was unlikely to have an abortion clinic before Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022. Since then, Kansas has become one of five states that people are most likely to travel to in order to get an abortion when they're unable to at home, said Caitlin Myers, an economics professor at Middlebury College who researches abortion policies. Abortions spiked in Kansas by 152% after Roe, according to a recent analysis by the Guttmacher Institute, which supports abortion rights. Using Myers' count, six of the clinics in Kansas, Illinois, New Mexico, North Carolina and Virginia that have opened or relocated post-Roe are in communities with fewer than 25,000 people. Two others are in communities of fewer than 50,000. 'Kansas is really the only one in this region that can provide care to many people in these surrounding states,' said Kensey Wright, a member of the board of directors for the Roe Fund in Oklahoma, which supports Kansas abortion clinics through grants. 'Without abortion clinics in that state, we would be without hope,' Wright said. Providing abortions for out-of-state people Housed in a former urology office, Pittsburg's Planned Parenthood clinic sits across the street from a medical clinic run by a Catholic health care system. Behind the clinic are houses. Clinic manager Logan Rink said her mother used to work in this building as a nurse — a connection that's 'small-town stuff.' She loves this town, and said her neighbors agree the clinic is needed. But she was guarded in her optimism, saying ' the reception that we are going to get from the community is going to be favorable in some ways and probably not always.' Experts said smaller-sized clinics can be less overwhelming for women who are coming from rural areas, like those surrounding Pittsburg. But there is no anonymity in these smaller communities, where religious and family ties often run deep. Pittsburg was established in 1876, and settled largely by immigrants from Catholic-leaning countries who came to work at surrounding coal mines. There's a typical main street and a state university with about 7,400 students. 'In a small town, it's not just that you'll know that person. Your family will know them. You will have known them for 40 years,' said Dr. Emily Walters, a supporter of the Pittsburg clinic who works as an anesthesiologist at a hospital in neighboring Missouri. 'Your stories will be intertwined.' She wondered aloud, 'How do I see you at a protest and then see you the next day at the grocery store and still be able to be polite and civil with each other?' Walters also chairs the Crawford County Democratic Party in an area that is increasingly Republican and has no Democratic state legislators — a change from 20 years ago when there were six. The county also has become increasingly religious in the same span; it now has twice as many white evangelical Protestants as the national average, and slightly more Catholics, according to the Public Religion Research Institute. Just five weeks after Roe was overturned in 2022, voters in Kansas had to decide whether to strip the right to an abortion from the state constitution, which could have led to an outright ban. Despite the Republican and religious leanings, 55% of Crawford County voters were part of the 59% of voters statewide who killed the proposal. It's in line with an Associated Press-NORC poll from 2024 that showed 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason. But the rural counties that surrounded Pittsburg chose otherwise at the ballot box. 'I remember people were stealing yard signs, putting up different ones in people's yards,' said Anastin Journot, an 18-year-old from Independence, Kansas, who is majoring in elementary education at Pittsburg State. She said she was alarmed by Roe getting overturned, remembering she thought: 'What if I'm in a situation where I'm needing to get an abortion and it's not an option?' Abortion in Kansas is generally legal up until the 22nd week of pregnancy. The clinic's southern location puts it closer to states that have banned abortions instead of sending people to Kansas' larger cities, where hours have been expanded and appointments are still in short supply. About 60% to 65% of people who call Planned Parenthood clinics in Kansas for an abortion appointment are turned away because there isn't enough capacity, said Emily Wales, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Great Plains. Already, Wales said, the bulk of people seeking abortions in Kansas are from out of state — mostly Texas, which is about five hours south. After that, it's Missouri, a few minutes' drive east and Oklahoma, less than an hour away. She said some come from as far away as Louisiana and even Florida, which now prohibits the procedure after six weeks. Clinics 'strategically placed near (a state's) border can really help ease the congestion,' said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health scientist at the University of California San Francisco who studies abortion. Most of the area that's 100 miles from the new clinic has been designated as medically underserved for primary care by the federal government, and the number of obstetricians and gynecologists for every 100,000 female residents is less than half of the U.S. average. For now, though, the focus at the Pittsburg clinic will be on abortion. Wales said Planned Parenthood wants to slowly add more services over the next two to three months, and one future goal for the clinic is to provide gender-affirming care. Neighboring states have restricted that, too. 'Pittsburg is going to lift up a whole lot of states in the South and help people get care,' Wales said. But those additions, she added, will come after staff gets used to the patients and the presence of protesters and opposition. Protesters are at the ready Donations are up at Vie Medical Clinic, the town's crisis pregnancy center, executive director Megan Newman said. Such centers are typically religiously affiliated and encourage clients to continue their pregnancies. People opposed to the Planned Parenthood clinic also are picking up pamphlets about Vie so they can hand them out to those seeking abortions. 'When we got word that Planned Parenthood was coming, you could just kind of feel that in the town,' Newman said. Jeanne Napier, a 68-year-old who attends a local Baptist church, vowed as she shopped at the local mall that she'll 'be there every day with signs.' Her daughter, Terri Napier, said in a phone interview she believes part of her parents' opposition to the clinic is from watching her struggle about 20 years ago. She was in an abusive relationship with someone who has since died. She got pregnant. The family was fearful of bringing a child into the situation. She had an abortion and spiraled into drug use. 'I was at war with forgiving myself,' said the 43-year-old, who is now clean. Jeanne Napier said she felt like she encouraged the abortion. 'And I hate that,' she said, 'because I wish I could take that sin upon myself, so it's real personal. I had an active play in terminating a life, and we don't have that right.' Brianna Barnes, a 19-year-old journalism major at Pittsburg State who is from Wichita, has protested and prayed outside of a clinic in her hometown. 'If someone made eye contact with us, we just smiled at them, kind of showing that love and care because no one responds well to screaming, yelling, violence no matter what side it's on,' she said just after arriving on campus for the fall semester. Most of the students the AP talked to voiced support for the clinic. Her mother, Crystal Barnes, 42, turned to her daughter: 'You're going to be the odd man out being a Catholic, and conservative, especially with things like abortion. It is so heated.' The Friday before the clinic opened, crews installed a wooden facade outside, the air filled with the smell of fresh-cut lumber. Walters, the local anesthesiologist, had stopped by to check on the progress. Walters' support comes from a personal place. When she was 20 and the same number of weeks pregnant, she went to an emergency room, bleeding. She said she was sent home to miscarry instead of having her labor induced or having a procedure to remove the fetus. That experience — 'horrific, and wouldn't be considered standard of care, in modern practice,' she said — left her with a deep empathy for women in tough positions. Just before the 2022 vote, an ad backed by 400 Kansas doctors who support abortion rights ran in some of the state's largest papers, including The Kansas City Star. Walters' name was listed first. During that time, her home address appeared online, a frightening prospect in a state where abortion provider Dr. George Tiller was shot dead in 2009 at his Wichita church by an anti-abortion extremist. 'It is critical health care for women,' she said. 'It is going to be disruptive to Pittsburg. And that part hurts my heart.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/small-town-in-kansas-finds-itself-at-the-center-of-abortion-debate/7785670.html	2024-09-15T19:16:04-07:00	
Tropical Storm Ileana weakens to a depression	MEXICO CITY — Storm Ileana has weakened to a tropical depression, the National Hurricane Center said Sunday. The tropical storm formed Thursday off Mexico's Pacific coast as it moved ashore, making landfall on the coast of the Mexican state of Sinaloa on Saturday, a day after it pounded the resort-studded Los Cabos. On Sunday, wind speed dropped to 55 kph, NOAA said in an advisory, as Ileana was nearly 45 kilometers southwest of Los Mochis, Mexico, and moving west-northwest at 4 kph. It also forecasts the storm to become a remnant low — a post-tropical cyclone with maximum sustained winds less than 34 knots. On Friday, a warning had been in effect for portions of the Baja California Peninsula, including Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Juan Manuel Arce Ortega, from Los Cabos Civil Protection, said the municipalities of La Paz and Los Cabos had suspended classes in schools because of the storm. Authorities prepared 20 temporary shelters in San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, according to Los Cabos Civil Protection. At the Hacienda Beach Club and Residences in Cabo San Lucas, valet worker Alan Galvan said the rain arrived late Thursday night and has been constant. 'The rain isn't very strong right now, but the waves are choppy,' he said. 'The guests are very calm and already came down for coffee,' Galvan said. 'There's some flights canceled but everything is OK at the moment.' The rain remained consistent through Los Cabos Friday afternoon, with several roads flooded and some resorts stacking up sandbags on their perimeters. Some people were still walking around boat docks with their umbrellas. 'The priority has to be safety, starting with the workers. We always have to check on our colleagues who live in risk areas,' said Lyzzette Liceaga, a tour operator at Los Cabos. Ileana was the only active tropical storm in the National Weather Service's Eastern Pacific basin on Friday. In the Atlantic basin, post-tropical cyclone Francine was bringing heavy rain to parts of the southern United States, and Tropical Storm Gordon formed on Friday in the Atlantic Ocean, with forecasters saying it is expected to remain over open water for several days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-ileana-weakens-to-a-depression/7785661.html	2024-09-15T19:00:18-07:00	
Which candidate is better for tech innovation? Venture capitalists divided on Harris or Trump	LOS ANGELES — Being a venture capitalist carries a lot of prestige in Silicon Valley. Those who choose which startups to fund see themselves as fostering the next big waves of technology. So when some of the industry's biggest names endorsed former President Donald Trump and the onetime venture capitalist he picked for a running mate, JD Vance, people took notice. Then hundreds of other venture capitalists — some high profile, others lesser-known — threw their weight behind Vice President Kamala Harris, drawing battle lines over which presidential candidate will be better for tech innovation and the conditions startups need to thrive. Venture capitalist and Harris backer Stephen DeBerry says some of his best friends support Trump. Though centered in a part of Northern California known for liberal politics, the investors who help finance the tech industry have long been a more politically divided bunch. 'We ski together. Our families are together. We're super tight,' said DeBerry, who runs the Bronze Venture Fund. 'This is not about not being able to talk to each other. I love these guys — they're almost all guys. They're dear friends. We just have a difference of perspective on policy issues.' It remains to be seen if the more than 700 venture capitalists who've voiced support for a movement called 'VCs for Kamala' will match the pledges of Trump's well-heeled supporters such as Elon Musk and Peter Thiel. 'There are a lot of practical reasons for VCs to support Trump,' including policies that could drive corporate profits and stock market values and favor wealthy benefactors, said David Cowan, an investor at Bessemer Venture Partners. But Cowan said he is supporting Harris as a VC with a 'long-term investment horizon' because a 'Trump world reeling from rampant income inequality, raging wars and global warming is not an attractive environment' for funding healthy businesses. Several prominent VCs have voiced their support for Trump on Musk's social platform X. Public records show some of them have donated to a new, pro-Trump super PAC called America PAC, whose donors include powerful tech industry conservatives with ties to SpaceX and Paypal and who run in Musk's social circle. Also driving support is Trump's embrace of cryptocurrency and promise to end an enforcement crackdown on the industry. Although some Biden policies have alienated parts of the investment sector concerned about tax policy, antitrust scrutiny or overregulation, Harris' bid for the presidency has reenergized interest from VCs who until recently sat on the sidelines. 'We buy risk, right? And we're trying to buy the right type of risk,' Leslie Feinzaig, founder of 'VCs for Kamala' said in an interview. 'It's really hard for these companies that are trying to build products and scale to do so in an unpredictable institutional environment.' The schism in tech has left some firms split in their allegiances. Although venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, founders of the firm that is their namesake, endorsed Trump, one of their firm's general partners, John O'Farrell, pledged his support for Harris. O'Farrell declined further comment. Doug Leone, the former managing partner of Sequoia Capital, endorsed Trump in June, expressing concern on X 'about the general direction of our country, the state of our broken immigration system, the ballooning deficit, and the foreign policy missteps, among other issues.' But Leone's longtime business partner at Sequoia, Michael Moritz, wrote in the Financial Times that tech leaders supporting Trump 'are making a big mistake.' Much of the VC discourse about elections is in response to a July podcast and manifesto in which Andreessen and Horowitz backed Trump and outlined their vision of a 'Little Tech Agenda' that they said contrasted with the policies sought by Big Tech. They accused the U.S. government of increasing hostility toward startups and the VCs who fund them, citing Biden's proposed higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations and regulations they said could hobble emerging industries involving blockchain and artificial intelligence. Vance, a U.S. senator from Ohio who spent time in San Francisco working at Thiel's investment firm, voiced a similar perspective about 'little tech' more than a month before he was chosen as Trump's running mate. 'The donors who were really involved in Silicon Valley in a pro-Trump way, they're not big tech, right? They're little tech. They're starting innovative companies. They don't want the government to destroy their ability to innovate,' Vance said in an interview on Fox News in June. Complicating the allegiances is that a tough approach to breaking up the monopoly power of big corporations no longer falls along partisan lines. Vance has spoken favorably of Lina Khan, who Biden picked to lead the Federal Trade Commission and has taken on several tech giants. Meanwhile, some of the most influential VCs backing Harris — such as LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman; and Sun Microsystems co-founder Vinod Khosla, an early investor in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI — have sharply criticized Khan's approach. U.S. Rep. Ro Khanna, a Democrat whose California district encompasses part of Silicon Valley, said Trump supporters are a vocal minority reflecting a 'third or less' of the region's tech community. But while the White House has appealed to tech entrepreneurs with its investments in clean energy, electric vehicles and semiconductors, Khanna said Democrats must do a better job of showing that they understand the appeal of digital assets. Naseem Sayani, a general partner at Emmeline Ventures, said Andreessen and Horowitz's support of Trump became a lightning rod for those in tech who do not back the Republican nominee. Sayani signed onto 'VCs for Kamala,' she said, because she wanted the types of businesses that she helps fund to know that the investor community is not monolithic. 'We're not single-profile founders anymore,' she said. 'There's women, there's people of color, there's all the intersections. How can they feel comfortable building businesses when the environment they're in doesn't actually support their existence in some ways?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/which-candidate-is-better-for-tech-innovation-venture-capitalists-divided-on-harris-or-trump/7785654.html	2024-09-15T18:39:00-07:00	
Trump safe after second assassination attempt, authorities say	washington — For the second time in nine weeks, former President Donald Trump walked away from an assassination attempt – the latest, on Sunday afternoon, at his golf club in West Palm Beach, Florida, authorities said. Officials said Trump was not hurt, and that the shooter was spotted and fired on first by members of Trump’s security detail. Various national media sources, including The Associated Press, The New York Times and Fox News Channel, cited unnamed law enforcement officials who identified the suspect as Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, of Hawaii. Those officials spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss the ongoing investigation. Unlike the previous attempt, this one did not happen on live television, like the dramatic shooting Trump survived on July 13. That attempt wounded Trump in the ear and killed a man attending the rally behind Trump. Days later, Trump accepted the Republican party’s presidential nomination. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, which is leading the case, has described it as 'what appears to be an attempted assassination.' That makes this the agency’s second ongoing investigation into an attempt on Trump’s life. The local sheriff said the suspect fled, leaving behind an 'AK-47-style rifle' with a scope, a GoPro camera and two backpacks. Police later caught him as he sped on the main highway into a neighboring county. 'The Secret Service agent that was on the course did a fantastic job,' said Sheriff Ric Bradshaw of the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, in a briefing held by law enforcement shortly after. 'What they do is they have an agent that jumps one hole ahead of time to where the president was at. And he was able to spot this rifle barrel sticking out of the fence and immediately engage that individual, at which time the individual took off.' In a joint statement sent out to journalists less than an hour after the Trump campaign announced this latest attempt on Trump’s life, President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris said they were being regularly briefed and said they are 'relieved' that he is safe. 'The president and vice president have been briefed about the security incident at the Trump International Golf Course, where former President Trump was golfing,' their statement read. 'They are relieved to know that he is safe. They will be kept regularly updated by their team.' And in evening statement, Biden reiterated his message from the July shooting. 'As I have said many times, there is no place for political violence or for any violence ever in our country, and I have directed my team to continue to ensure that Secret Service has every resource, capability and protective measure necessary to ensure the former President’s continued safety,' he said. And Harris issued a shorter, solo statement on social media, in which she said, 'Violence has no place in America.' Trump has not reacted to this latest turn of events on the social media platform he owns. However, in an email to supporters, Trump said: 'There were gunshots in my vicinity, but before rumors start spiraling out of control, I wanted you to hear this first: I AM SAFE AND WELL!' And so, as dawn rises and questions swirl in America about how this will impact what has already been a tumultuous election season as America hurtles toward November. Trump has not announced any changes to his schedule and is set to speak live on X on Monday night from his Mar-a-Lago resort to launch his sons’ crypto platform. Meanwhile, the leaders of a congressional bipartisan task force investigating the July 13 assassination attempt on Trump said they have requested a briefing by the Secret Service. Some of the material for this story is from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-safe-after-second-assassination-attempt-authorities-say-/7785638.html	2024-09-15T18:02:48-07:00	
Mali, Burkina and Niger to launch new biometric passports	Bamako, Mali — Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger will soon launch new biometric passports, Mali's military leader Colonel Assimi Goita said Sunday, as the junta-led states look to solidify their alliance after splitting from regional bloc ECOWAS. The three Sahel nations, all under military rule following a string of coups since 2020, joined together last September under the Alliance of Sahel States (AES), after severing ties with former colonial ruler France and pivoting toward Russia. They then said in January that they were turning their backs on the Economic Community of West African States — an organization they accused of being manipulated by France. In July, the allies consolidated their ties with the creation of a Confederation of Sahel States which will be chaired by Mali in its first year and groups some 72 million people. 'In the coming days, a new biometric passport of the AES will be put into circulation with the aim of harmonizing travel documents in our common area,' Goita said during a televised address late Sunday. 'We will be working to put in place the infrastructure needed to strengthen the connectivity of our territories through transport, communications networks and information technology,' he said. The announcement came a day before the three states are due to mark the one-year anniversary of the alliance's creation. The neighbors are all battling jihadi violence that erupted in northern Mali in 2012 and spread to Niger and Burkina Faso in 2015. The unrest is estimated to have killed thousands and displaced millions across the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-burkina-and-niger-to-launch-new-biometric-passports/7785514.html	2024-09-15T17:00:09-07:00	
Environmental activist who feared for life killed in Honduras	Tegucigalpa, Honduras — An anti-mining activist was shot and killed in Honduras, President Xiomara Castro said, vowing justice for the latest such murder in one of the world's most dangerous countries for environmentalists. Juan Lopez, 46, was gunned down as he left church Saturday in the northeastern town of Tocoa, his widow Thelma Pena told AFP. Castro condemned the 'vile murder' in a post on the social media platform X, formerly Twitter, late Saturday and said she had ordered an investigation. 'Justice for Juan Lopez,' Castro wrote. Lopez, who belonged to the ruling Libre party, campaigned against open-pit iron ore mining in a forest reserve in the vicinity of Tocoa, where he worked in the town hall. In an interview with AFP in 2021, Lopez discussed the risks that he said environmental activists face in this poor and violent Central American country. 'If you start defending common interests in this country,' he said, 'you clash with major interests.' 'If you leave home, you always have in mind that you do not know what might happen, if you are going to return,' said Lopez. At a recent news conference, the activist called for the resignation of Libre officials caught on video negotiating bribes with drug traffickers in 2013. That video recently ensnared Carlos Zelaya, a brother-in-law of the president. He resigned his seat in congress after admitting he took part in that meeting with drug gangsters. The U.N. country representative of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, Isabel Albaladejo, urged investigators to consider 'possible reprisals' against Lopez for his demand for a local mayor to resign for alleged links to organized crime. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights had ordered protective measures for Lopez due to threats against him and other environmentalists from Tocoa. Fellow rights defender Joaquin Mejia paid tribute to the environmentalist, calling him 'a comrade committed to social change.' Mejia accused authorities of failing to 'fulfill their obligation' to protect Lopez. Honduran Attorney General Johel Zelaya said the 'reprehensible' murder would not go unpunished, and paid tribute to Lopez's activism. 'His life was an example of struggle. He never gave up in his incessant battle, hand-in-hand with the people to preserve natural resources,' Zelaya said on X. The NGO Global Witness says Honduras is one of the world's most dangerous countries for environmental activists. In 2023 it was ranked third in the world for the number of killings of such activists at 18, tied with Mexico. The top two were Colombia and Brazil. The organization said that from 2012 to 2023, 148 environmental campaigners were killed in Honduras. They include Berta Caceres, a high-profile opponent of a controversial hydroelectric dam who was murdered in 2016. A council of Indigenous organizations co-founded by Caceres said that the Honduran state and Castro's government were 'responsible for this new murder by not guaranteeing Juan's life.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/environmental-activist-who-feared-for-life-killed-in-honduras/7785300.html	2024-09-15T16:57:28-07:00

Trump shooting incident, reminder of past assassination attempts against US leaders	Washington — The FBI is investigating what it said was another assassination attempt on Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump. The incident occurred Sunday at the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach in Florida where Trump, the former president, was golfing. Law enforcement officials said Secret Service saw a man with a rifle in the bushes and shot at the suspected assassin. The suspect fled the bushes and was later apprehended on a highway, according to law enforcement. Previous attempt on Trump In July, Trump was shot by a gunman during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania in what the FBI said was an attempted assassination. The former president was wounded in the ear. The Congressional Research Service says direct assaults against presidents, presidents-elect, and candidates have occurred on at least 15 separate occasions, with five resulting in death. Below is a list of other previous attempts on the lives of American leaders, successful or not. Assassinations Four U.S. presidents were assassinated while in office. Abraham Lincoln: Killed in 1865 by John Wilkes Booth at Ford's Theater in Washington. James Garfield: Shot in 1881 in Washington at a train station and died of his wounds two and a half months later. William McKinley: Assassinated in 1901 by an anarchist in Buffalo, New York. John F. Kennedy: Assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald in 1963 in Dallas, Texas, as the president rode in a motorcade. Leaders who survived assassination attempts Four presidents were wounded but survived assassination attempts, while in office or afterward. Donald Trump: Trump had just started a campaign speech in Pennsylvania on July 13 when shots rang out. Trump was shot in the ear. He was rushed by security officials to a black SUV. Ronald Reagan: He was shot in 1981 outside the Hilton Hotel in Washington. Reagan was wounded when one of the bullets ricocheted off a limousine and struck him under the left armpit. Gerald Ford: Survived two attempts on his life in less than three weeks in 1975 without being hurt. Theodore Roosevelt: He was shot in the chest in 1912 while campaigning for election in Milwaukee but insisted on delivering his speech to supporters before being taken to a hospital.

Emmys return with 'Shogun' and 'The Bear' leading the pack	Los Angeles — Hollywood will dole out the annual Emmy Awards, the highest honors in television, Sunday at a red-carpet ceremony where the historical drama 'Shogun' and restaurant tale 'The Bear' are poised to dominate the night. 'Shogun,' a lavish epic about a power struggle in 17th-century Japan, is the front-runner to take the night's top trophy for best drama series, according to awards pundits. Reigning best comedy champion 'The Bear' is expected to claim that prize again. Both shows debuted on the FX cable network and stream on Hulu, setting up a big night for owner Walt Disney and its TV chief Dana Walden. Sunday's ceremony will take place just eight months after the last Emmys, which aired in an unusual January slot because of disruptions caused by Hollywood labor strikes. Back on a September schedule, the show will air live from downtown Los Angeles on Disney's ABC starting at 5 p.m. Pacific time Sunday (12 a.m. GMT on Monday). 'Schitt's Creek' father-son duo Eugene and Dan Levy will host the festivities. Producers have promised cast reunions from shows past, such as 'Happy Days,' and other moments to celebrate the history of television. Olympic gold medalist swimmer Caeleb Dressel and bronze medalist rugby player Ilona Maher also are scheduled to appear. Ahead of the ceremony, 'Shogun' has already set records. It won 14 trophies — the most ever for one season of a drama series — at last weekend's Creative Arts Emmys, where awards were given for guest actors and crafts such as cinematography. The expensive series was no sure thing. It had been in development for years before it came together with elaborate sets, makeup and costumes and storytelling that impressed critics with its attention to detail. 'That's part of the Cinderella story of this series,' said Clayton Davis, awards editor at Hollywood publication Variety. Competitors for best drama include British royal family saga 'The Crown' and spy thriller 'Mr. & Mrs. Smith' from Amazon's Prime Video. 'The Bear' also performed well at the Creative Arts Emmys, earning seven awards. The show is competing with its second season, which featured a widely praised episode about a disastrous family holiday gathering. HBO's 'Hacks,' about a 70-something comedienne and a millennial writer, could play the role of spoiler in the comedy category. Due to the timing of their seasons, the shows have never competed head-to-head at the Emmys. Limited series looks like a lock for 'Baby Reindeer,' awards watchers said. The Netflix series tells the tale of a bartender stalked and harassed by a customer. Scottish comedian and star Richard Gadd has said the Netflix show is based on his real-life story, although a defamation lawsuit argues the stalker's behavior is exaggerated. Rivals for limited series include Netflix's psychological thriller 'Ripley,' FX's 'Fargo' and HBO's 'True Detective: Night Country,' starring lead actress nominee Jodie Foster. Winners are chosen by the nearly 22,000 performers, directors, producers and other members of Hollywood's Television Academy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/emmys-return-with-shogun-and-the-bear-leading-the-pack/7785280.html	2024-09-15T15:53:55-07:00	
Trump Train' convoy surrounded Biden-Harris bus. Was it political violence?	Austin, Texas — A Texas jury will soon decide whether a convoy of supporters of then-President Donald Trump violently intimidated former Democratic lawmaker Wendy Davis and two others on a Biden-Harris campaign bus when a so-called 'Trump Train' boxed them in for more than an hour on a Texas highway days before the 2020 election. The trial, which began on Sept. 9, resumes Monday and is expected to last another week. Attorneys for the plaintiffs argued that six of the Trump Train drivers violated state and federal law. Lawyers for the defendants said they did not conspire against the Democrats on the bus and that their actions are protected speech. Here's what else to know: What happened on Oct. 30, 2020? Dozens of cars and trucks organized by a local Trump Train group swarmed the bus on its way from San Antonio to Austin. It was the last day of early voting in Texas for the 2020 general election, and the bus was scheduled to make a stop in San Marcos for an event at Texas State University. Video recorded by Davis shows pickup trucks with large Trump flags aggressively slowing down and boxing in the bus as it tried to move away from the Trump Train. One defendant hit a campaign volunteer's car while the trucks occupied all lanes of traffic, slowing the bus and everyone around it to a 15-mph crawl. Those on the bus — including Davis, a campaign staffer and the driver — repeatedly called 911 asking for help and a police escort through San Marcos, but when no law enforcement arrived, the campaign canceled the event and pushed forward to Austin. San Marcos settled a separate lawsuit filed by the same three Democrats against the police, agreeing to pay $175,000 and mandate political violence training for law enforcement. Davis testified that she felt she was being 'taken hostage' and has sought treatment for anxiety. In the days leading up to the event, Democrats were also intimidated, harassed and received death threats, the lawsuit said. 'I feel like they were enjoying making us afraid,' Davis testified. 'It's traumatic for all of us to revisit that day.' What's the plaintiffs' argument? In opening statements, an attorney for the plaintiffs said convoy organizers targeted the bus in a calculated attack to intimidate the Democrats in violation of the 'Ku Klux Klan Act,' an 1871 federal law that bans political violence and intimidation. 'We're here because of actions that put people's lives in danger,' said Samuel Hall, an attorney with the law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher. The plaintiffs, he said, were 'literally driven out of town by a swarm of trucks.' The six Trump Train drivers succeeded in making the campaign cancel its remaining events in Texas in a war they believed was 'between good and evil,' Hall said. Two nonprofit advocacy groups, Texas Civil Rights Project and Protect Democracy, also are representing the three plaintiffs. What's the defense's argument? Attorneys for the defendants, who are accused of driving and organizing the convoy, said they did not conspire to swarm the Democrats on the bus, which could have exited the highway at any point. 'This was a political rally. This was not some conspiracy to intimidate people,' said attorney Jason Greaves, who is representing two of the drivers. The defense also argued that their clients' actions were protected speech and that the trial is a concerted effort to 'drain conservatives of their money,' according to Francisco Canseco, a lawyer for three of the defendants. 'It was a rah-rah group that sought to support and advocate for a candidate of their choice in a very loud way,' Canseco said during opening statements. The defense lost a bid last month to have the case ruled in their favor without a trial. The judge wrote that 'assaulting, intimidating, or imminently threatening others with force is not protected expression.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-train-convoy-surrounded-biden-harris-bus-was-it-political-violence/7785268.html	2024-09-15T15:25:36-07:00	
Pakistan braces for deadliest year for journalists, setting grim record	Islamabad — Pakistan has documented the killings of 11 journalists in 2024, reaching a record-breaking annual tally with nearly four months left in the year. The South Asian nation continues to face persistent criticism for an alleged lack of justice or impunity for journalists' murders, making it one of the world’s most dangerous countries for media workers. The latest victim was Nisar Lehri, a 50-year-old Pakistani journalist and secretary of a local press club in violence-hit southwestern Balochistan province. Unknown assailants shot and killed him on September 4 near his home in the town of Mastung for his reporting about criminal elements, according to a complaint filed with the area police. Lehri’s murder followed the death of reporter Muhammad Bachal Ghunio on August 27. He was associated with the local Awaz TV channel and was targeted by gunmen in his native Ghotki district in southeastern Sindh province. Ghunio’s family and police investigators believe he was killed because of his reporting. Police subsequently announced the arrest of a suspect, and the recovery of a weapon allegedly used in the attack. Islamabad-based nonprofit Freedom Network, an advocate for press freedoms, reported that before the two fatalities, nine journalists were killed in Pakistan this year, including a YouTube show host. 'Safety is every journalist’s key concern while reporting, and given the fact that 11 journalists, including a YouTuber, were killed this year so far, it has a chilling effect on independent media,' Iqbal Khattak, the executive director of the nonprofit network, told VOA. Pakistani officials blame growing terrorist activities in the country for the uptick in attacks on journalists. However, critics dispute these claims, noting that many of the journalist fatalities this year occurred in Sindh and the country’s most populous Punjab province, which have been relatively peaceful compared to terrorism-hit Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. While Pakistan’s military and its intelligence agencies are routinely accused of orchestrating violence against journalists critical of their involvement in national politics, influential feudal lords and politicians in Sindh, as well as Punjab, are often blamed for ordering violence against media workers in their native constituencies and escaping accountability. 'The deep-rooted impunity and political instability are driving the current violence. However, the list of press freedom predators is not restricted to the two drivers,' Khattak stated. 'The list is long to name the predators. Terrorism is not excluded,' he added. Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarar told reporters Saturday that the federal government is working closely with authorities in the four provinces to address the challenges facing journalists. 'There are incidents in Sindh, I totally agree. Some people often use political influence to get their way and get out of these cases,' Tarar stated when asked by VOA about his government’s role in addressing the cases of fatal attacks on journalists and providing justice to their families. The minister pledged to coordinate with provincial counterparts to investigate these cases and deter further violence against media workers. 'We need to set an example in one or two cases, so this does not happen again. I think this is a very important issue which needs to be handled,' Tarar said. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), a U.S.-based global media rights group, mourned the deaths of Lehri and Ghunio in a Friday statement. 'Pakistani authorities must immediately bring the perpetrators of the killings … to justice and show urgent political will to end the horrifying cycle of violence against journalists that has continued this year across Pakistan,' said Beh Lih Yi, the CPJ Asia program coordinator. 'The press in Pakistan cannot carry out their journalism unless the government and security agencies put an end to the impunity against journalists in the country,' she stressed. The CPJ statement also noted that dozens of Pakistani journalists have been attacked or forced into hiding this year due to their reporting across the country. Another global media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders (RSF), urged Pakistan's federal and provincial authorities in a recent report to take urgent measures to address the alarming decline in press freedom in the country. 'The many press freedom violations reveal a climate of violence, and a determination to censor that has little in common with the undertakings by the political parties in their elections campaign manifestos and the message of support for journalists by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif,' stated Celia Mercier, the head of RSF’s South Asia desk. 'Pakistan remains one of the world’s most dangerous countries for media personnel, and the level of impunity for the murders of journalists is appalling,' Mercier said in June. Stifling free press Until this month, millions of Pakistanis experienced significant disruptions in accessing major social media platforms nationwide, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, drawing a public outcry. The military-backed Sharif government was blamed for imposing the shutdowns and internet slowdowns to deter dissent or political unrest. Pakistani authorities rejected the allegations and blamed internet disruptions on a faulty submarine internet cable. In an August 28 announcement, the state regulator, the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority, announced that repairs to the faulty cable would likely be completed by early October, but slow internet speeds might persist until then.

Zelenskyy again urges West to allow strikes deep inside Russia	Kyiv, Ukraine — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy once again Sunday urged Western allies to permit Kyiv to strike military targets deep inside Russia, especially air bases, after a deadly attack on Kharkiv. 'Only a systemic solution makes it possible to oppose this terror: the long-range solution to destroy Russian military aviation where it is based,' Zelenskyy said in his daily address. 'We are waiting for appropriate decisions coming primarily from the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy.' Earlier, a guided Russian bomb struck a residential building in Kharkiv, the latest of a series of attacks on the northeastern city, starting a blaze which firefighters extinguished. Rescuers pulled out the dead body of an elderly woman from the rubble, Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram, adding that 42 people were wounded. In his speech, Zelenskyy said Russia had also struck the Sumy and Donetsk regions Sunday with guided bombs. He said the Russian army carried out 'at least 100 such air attacks' daily. It is to prevent these sorts of attacks that Ukraine is asking for permission to strike military targets deep inside Russia from Western allies, who remain hesitant for fear of an escalation. Also Sunday, Russian shelling killed one person in the eastern Ukrainian city of Pokrovsk, local authorities said, as Moscow's troops inched closer to the key logistics hub. More than 20,000 people — almost half of its population — have fled the city since August, while Russian strikes over the past two weeks have cut off water and electricity to many of its remaining residents. 'Around 11 a.m. (0800 GMT), the enemy shelled the western part of the city... Unfortunately, one person died,' Pokrovsk's military administration said on Telegram.

Iran's President to attend BRICS summit in Russia	DUBAI — Iran's President Masoud Pezeshkian will attend the upcoming BRICS summit in Russia, state media cited Tehran's ambassador in Moscow as saying Sunday, amid tensions with the West over military cooperation between the two countries. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Tuesday that Russia had received ballistic missiles from Iran and was likely to use them in Ukraine within weeks. Cooperation between Moscow and Tehran threatened wider European security, he said. The United States, Germany, Britain and France on Tuesday imposed new sanctions on Iran, including measures against its national airline Iran Air. Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said Wednesday that Tehran did not deliver any ballistic missiles to Russia and that sanctions imposed by the U.S. and the three European countries against Iran were not a solution. Iran's ambassador in Russia Kazem Jalali confirmed Sunday that Pezeshkian will attend the summit of the BRICS group of major emerging economies, scheduled to be held in Kazan, Russia from Oct. 22 to 24, according to Iran's state media. Pezeshkian will meet his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin there, Jalali said.

Air Canada, pilots’ union reach tentative agreement to avoid shutdown	OTTAWA, Ontario — Air Canada and the union representing its pilots have come to terms on a labor agreement that is likely to prevent a shutdown of Canada’s largest airline. Talks between the company and the Air Line Pilots Association produced a tentative, four-year collective agreement, the airline announced in a statement early Sunday. The prospective deal recognizes the contributions of the pilots flying for Air Canada and Air Canada Rouge while setting a new framework for company growth. The terms will remain confidential until ratification by union members and approval by the airline’s board of directors over the next month, the airline said. The pilots’ association said its Air Canada Master Executive Council voted to approve the tentative agreement on behalf of more than 5,400 Air Canada pilots. After review and ratification by a majority of members, the deal is expected to generate an additional $1.9 billion for the pilots over the period of the agreement, the union said in a statement. 'While it has been an exceptionally long road to this agreement, the consistent engagement and unified determination of our pilots have been the catalyst for achieving this contract,' Charlene Hudy, the executive council's chair, said in the statement. 'After several consecutive weeks of intense round-the-clock negotiations, progress was made on several key issues including compensation, retirement, and work rules.' Federal Labor Minister Steven MacKinnon confirmed the agreement Sunday and lauded the company and the union. 'Thanks to the hard work of the parties and federal mediators, disruptions have been prevented for Canadians,' MacKinnon said in a statement. 'Negotiated agreements are always the best way forward and yield positive results for companies and workers.' The airline and its pilots have been in contract talks for more than a year. The pilots have sought wages competitive with their U.S. counterparts, but Air Canada continues to post record profits while expecting pilots to accept below-market compensation, the union said. The two sides could have issued a 72-hour notice of a strike or lockout beginning Sunday. The airline said the notice would have triggered its three-day wind down plan and started the clock on a full work stoppage as soon as Sept. 18. Air Canada spokesperson Christophe Hennebelle previously said the airline was committed to negotiations but faced union wage demands that the company could not meet. The airline was not seeking federal intervention, but cautioned the government should be prepared to help avoid major disruptions from the possible shutdown of an airline carrying more than 110,000 passengers daily, Hennebelle said. Business leaders had urged the federal government to intervene in the talks earlier in the week, but MacKinnon said there was no reason the sides should not have been able to reach a collective agreement. In August, the Canadian government asked the country’s industrial relations board to issue a back-to-work order to end a railway shutdown. Leaders of numerous business groups including the Canadian Chamber of Commerce and the Business Council of Canada convened in Ottawa on Thursday to call for action, including binding arbitration, to avoid the widespread economic disruptions of an airline shutdown. NDP Leader Jagmeet Singh said Thursday his party would not support efforts to force pilots back to work. 'If there’s any bills being proposed on back to work legislation, we’re going to oppose that,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/air-canada-pilots-union-reach-tentative-agreement-to-avoid-shutdown-/7785180.html	2024-09-15T11:26:13-07:00

Italian army to guard hospital after attacks on medical staff	Rome — The Italian army will start guarding medical staff at a hospital in the southern Calabria region from Monday, after a string of violent attacks on doctors and nurses by enraged patients and relatives across Italy, according to local media reports. Prefect Paolo Giovanni Grieco has approved a plan to reinforce the surveillance services already operated by soldiers on sensitive targets in the Calabrian town of Vibo Valentia, including the hospital, the reports added. Recent attacks on health workers have been particularly frequent in southern Italy, prompting the doctors’ national guild to ask for the army to be deployed to ensure medical staff’s safety. The turning point was an assault at the Policlinico hospital in the southern city of Foggia in early September. A group of about 50 relatives and friends of a 23-year-old woman — who died during emergency surgery — turned their grief and rage into violence, attacking the hospital staff. Video footage, widely circulated on social media, showed doctors and nurses barricading in a room to escape the attack. Some of them were punched and injured. The director of the hospital threatened to close its emergency room after denouncing three similar attacks in less than a week. With over 16,000 reported cases of physical and verbal assaults in 2023 alone, Italian doctors and nurses have called for drastic measures. 'We have never seen such levels of aggression in the past decade,' said Antonio De Palma, president of the Nursing Up union, stressing the urgent need for action. 'We are now at a point where considering military protection in hospitals is no longer a far-fetched idea. We cannot wait any longer,' he added. The Italian Federation of Medical-Scientific Societies (FISM) has also proposed more severe measures for offenders, such as suspending access to free medical care for three years for anyone who assaults health care workers or damages hospital facilities. Understaffing and long waiting lists are the main reasons behind patients' frustration with health workers. According to Italy’s largest union for doctors (ANAAO), nearly half of emergency medicine positions remained unfilled as of 2022. Doctors lament that Italy’s legislation has kept wages low, leading to overworked and burnout staff at hospitals. These problems have been further aggravated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has pushed many health workers to leave Italy in search of better opportunities abroad. In 2023, Italy was short of about 30,000 doctors, and between 2010 and 2020, the country saw the closure of 111 hospitals and 113 emergency rooms, data from a specialized forum showed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-army-to-guard-hospital-after-attacks-on-medical-staff-/7785175.html	2024-09-15T11:15:26-07:00

Hundreds rally in Paris for Iranian women's rights	Paris — Hundreds of people marched through Paris on Sunday in support of women's rights and the opposition in Iran, two years after the death of Mahsa Amini sparked protests against the country's religious authorities. A 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, Amini died in custody after being arrested for allegedly violating the Islamic Republic's strict dress code for women. The march, organized by around 20 human rights associations, took place as 34 women began a hunger strike in a Tehran prison to mark the two-year anniversary of her death. Chirinne Ardakani, a Franco-Iranian lawyer and member of the 'Iran Justice' collective, said that the 'sacrifices' made by Iranians opposed to the regime were 'not in vain'. 'Everything has changed in Iran,' Ardakani told AFP. 'We've gone from an absolutely patriarchal culture, where there was no question of women being able to reveal themselves in the street, to massive support for these women,' the lawyer and activist added. The march in solidarity with the 'Women, Life, Freedom' movement was attended by Benjamin Briere and Louis Arnaud, two Frenchmen who were arrested and arbitrarily detained in Iran. Iran is accused of arresting Westerners without cause and using them as bargaining chips in state-to-state negotiations, with French diplomats describing these prisoners as 'state hostages'. Briere was eventually released in May 2023, while Arnaud was let go the month after. 'Yes, I was in prison, but it is an immense honor to have been able to live among you, freedom fighters, who shared my suffering,' Arnaud told the crowd, in his first public address since his release. Three other French nationals are still being held in Iran. After Amini died in custody on September 16, 2022, the women-led protests which erupted rattled Iran's leadership that autumn and winter. But the demonstrations were then crushed by the authorities, with rights group Amnesty International saying security forces used assault rifles and shotguns in the crackdown. Human rights groups say at least 551 people were killed. Thousands more were arrested, according to the United Nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-rally-in-paris-for-iranian-women-s-rights-/7785169.html	2024-09-15T10:53:51-07:00

US-China military leaders finish discussions on South China Sea, other issues	BANGKOK — Military leaders from the U.S. and China met in Beijing for routine talks that only resumed in January after being suspended for two years as ties between the two countries soured. The meetings ended Sunday and officials discussed ongoing issues such as Taiwan, the Russia-Ukraine war and clashes in the South China Sea. Michael Chase, deputy assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia led a delegation to engage in the bilateral Defense Policy Coordination Talks, which were last held in January. While the talks weren't expected to resolve long-standing differences in stances over issues ranging from South China Sea claims to Taiwan, the U.S. has continued to push for the discussions to avoid conflict. The meetings were held after Chase attended the Xiangshan forum in Beijing, a defense forum that is China's answer to the Shangri-La Dialogue. Communication between the two militaries broke off in 2021, as U.S.-China tensions ratcheted up over widening differences on issues such as Taiwan's sovereignty, the origin of COVID-19 and economic issues. Beijing has ignored U.S. requests to engage in the past, especially over intercepts between U.S. and Chinese aircraft and ships. While communications resumed after U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping met in San Francisco last November, it is unclear whether the talks could continue as the U.S. is poised for a presidential election. In the bilateral talks, the two sides discussed China's support for Russia during the ongoing Ukraine war, as well as China's actions in the South China Sea, said a U.S. senior defense official briefing reporters on the meetings. On Sunday, the Philippine ship at a disputed shoal, BRP Teresa Magbanua, had left to resupply and provide medical care to its crew members. The defense official said that they were 'watching further developments there very closely.' China's claims over the South China Sea have become increasingly assertive, with increasing clashes with the Philippine coast guard. In August, both sides accused each other over a collision between their ships which left gaping holes in the Philippine ships. The maritime claims have meant clashes at sea, such as at the Sabina Shoal, which both China and the Philippines claim. China had blocked attempts to resupply the BRP Teresa Magbanua, in August, with a force of 40 ships. The Philippines said it would replace the ship immediately, but the departure of the ship raises questions of whether China would seize the shoal. Filipino scientists had previously found submerged piles of crushed corals in its shallows, leading to concern that China may be preparing to build a structure to stake its claim. China confirmed the departure of the ship, which it said, 'infringed on China's territorial sovereignty.' 'During this period, China had taken control measures against the ship in accordance with the law and multiple attempts by the Philippine side to forcibly resupply the ship had failed,' China Coast Guard spokesperson Liu Dejun said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-china-military-leaders-finish-discussions-on-south-china-sea-other-issues-/7785095.html	2024-09-15T09:24:18-07:00	
EU's top diplomat calls Venezuelan government 'dictatorial'	Madrid — The European Union's top diplomat, Josep Borrell, called Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's government 'dictatorial' during an interview broadcast Sunday in Spain, echoing comments made by a Spanish minister that angered Caracas. Venezuela on Thursday recalled its ambassador to Madrid for consultations and summoned Spain's envoy to Caracas for talks after Spanish Defense Minister Margarita Robles referred to Maduro's administration as a 'dictatorship' and saluted 'the Venezuelans who had to leave their country' because of his regime. Asked about the row during an interview with private Spanish television channel Telecinco, Borrell said over 2,000 people had been 'arbitrarily detained' since Venezuela's disputed July 28 presidential election, which the Latin American country's opposition accuses Maduro of stealing. Political parties in Venezuela are 'subjected to a thousand limitations on their activities' and the leader of the opposition, Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, 'has had to flee' to Spain, he added. 'What do you call all this? Of course, this is a dictatorial, authoritarian, dictatorial regime. But just saying so doesn't solve anything. What we need to do is to try to solve it,' said Borrell, a former Spanish foreign minister. 'Sometimes resolving things requires a certain verbal restraint, but let us not fool ourselves about the nature of things. Venezuela has called elections, but it was not a democracy before and it is much less so after.' Maduro, who succeeded iconic left-wing leader Hugo Chavez on his death in 2013, insists he won a third term but failed to release detailed voting tallies to back his claim. The opposition published polling station-level results, which it said showed Gonzalez Urrutia winning by a landslide. Maduro's claim to have won a third term in office sparked mass opposition protests, which claimed at least 27 lives and left 192 people wounded. About 2,400 people, including numerous teens, were arrested in the unrest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eu-s-top-diplomat-calls-venezuelan-government-dictatorial-/7785071.html	2024-09-15T08:47:19-07:00	
More than 40 dead after river boat capsizes in Nigeria	Kano, Nigeria — More than 40 people are presumed to have died after a boat overloaded with passengers sank on a river in northwestern Nigeria, authorities said on Sunday. The vessel was ferrying 53 farmers to their farms across the Gummi River in Zamfara State on Saturday when it capsized, a local official said. 'Only 12 were rescued yesterday shortly after the accident,' said Na'Allah Musa, a political administrator of the flood-hit Gummi district where the accident happened, adding that authorities were searching for the bodies of the rest of the passengers, who are presumed to have died. Musa added that the vessel was 'crammed with passengers far beyond its capacity which caused it to overturn and sink.' In a statement on Sunday, Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu 'expressed the government and the people of Nigeria's commiseration' for the 'twin tragedies' of the farmers' deaths and the nearby floods. In recent days, rising waters in the Gummi area have forced more than 10,000 people to flee, with Tinubu promising support for the victims. Boat accidents are common on Nigeria's poorly regulated waterways, particularly during the rainy season when river and lakes swell. Last month, 30 farmers on their way to their rice fields drowned after their overloaded boat sank in the Dundaye River in neighboring Sokoto State, emergency officials said. Three days earlier, 15 farmers died when their canoe overturned on the Gamoda River in Jigawa State, according to the police.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-40-dead-after-river-boat-capsizes-in-nigeria-/7785053.html	2024-09-15T08:21:50-07:00	
Guinea gives land to victims of forced evictions	Conakry — Guinea has handed over a plot of land to thousands forcibly evicted by previous governments, with some of the victims having waited more than 25 years for compensation. More than 20,000 people were displaced when the government of former president Alpha Conde demolished the Kaporo-Rails, Kipe 2, Dimesse, and Dar Es Salam neighborhoods of the capital Conakry between February and May 2019, according to Human Rights Watch. The government said the land belonged to the state and would be used for official buildings. A previous round of demolitions took place in the same area of Conakry in 1998, under the rule of president Lansana Conte. At a jubilant ceremony on Saturday, the associations representing the victims received the land deeds for a 258-hectare (638-acre) plot in Wonkifong, some 60 kilometers (40 miles) from Conakry, an AFP journalist saw. The land will be managed by the state-owned company SONAPI, which will be responsible for developing the site and rehousing the victims. 'We are taking a concrete step towards healing the wounds of the past for 2,683 households, while laying the foundations for a shared future,' the managing director of SONAPI, Maimouna Laure Mah Barry, said in a statement. The spokesman for the victims, Samba Sow, said the event marked 'the reparation of a 26-year-old injustice for those who were evicted in 1998 and five years for those evicted in 2019.' 'Thousands of homes, schools, markets and places of worship were destroyed in flagrant violation of the laws of our country. The lives of several thousand families have been destroyed,' he added. Sow called on current head of state, junta leader General Mamady Doumbouya, to set up a compensation fund for the victims. The ceremony was attended by General Amara Camara, a junta spokesman, who said the president was 'resolutely committed to drying the tears of all the sons and daughters of this country.' The West African state has been ruled by a military junta led by Doumbouya since a coup in September 2021 toppled civilian president Conde.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guinea-gives-land-to-victims-of-forced-evictions-/7785026.html	2024-09-15T08:05:29-07:00	
US Fed expected to announce its first interest rate cut since 2020	Washington — The Federal Reserve is gearing up to announce its first interest rate cut for more than four years on Wednesday, with policymakers expected to debate how big a move to make less than two months before the U.S. presidential election. Senior officials at the U.S. central bank including Fed chair Jerome Powell have in recent weeks indicated that a rate cut is coming this month, as inflation eases toward the bank's long-term target of two percent, and the labor market continues to cool. The Fed, which has a dual mandate from Congress to act independently to ensure both stable prices and maximum sustainable employment, has repeatedly stressed it will make its decision on rate cuts based solely on the economic data. But a cut on Wednesday could still cause headaches for Powell, as it would land shortly before the election, in which former Republican president Donald Trump is running against the current Democratic vice president, Kamala Harris. 'As much as I think the Fed tries to say that they're not a political animal, we are in a really wild cycle right now,' Alicia Modestino, an associate professor of economics at Northeastern University, told AFP. How big a cut? The debate among policymakers on Tuesday and Wednesday this week will likely center on whether to move by 25 or 50 basis points. However, a rate cut of any size would be the Fed's first since March 2020, when it slashed rates to near-zero in order to support the US economy through the Covid-19 pandemic. The Fed started hiking rates in 2022 in response to a surge in inflation, fueled largely by a post-pandemic supply crunch and the war in Ukraine. It has held its key lending rate at a two-decade high of between 5.25 and 5.50 percent for the past 14 months, waiting for economic conditions to improve. Now, with inflation falling, the labor market cooling, and the US economy still growing, policymakers have decided that conditions are ripe for a cut. Policymakers are left with a choice: making a small 25 basis point cut to ease into things, or a more aggressive cut of 50 basis points, which would be helpful for the labor market but could also risk reigniting inflation. 'I think that in advance of the November meeting, there's not quite enough data to say we're in jeopardy on the employment side,' said Modestino, who was previously a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Analysts see the smaller cut as a safe bet. 'We expect the Fed to cut by 25bp [basis points],' economists at Bank of America wrote in a recent note to clients. 'The Fed likes predictability,' Modestino from Northeastern said. 'It's good for markets, good for consumers, good for workers.' 'So a 25 basis point cut now, followed up by another 25 basis point cut in November after the next round of economic data, offers a somewhat smoother glide path for the economy,' she added. How many cuts? While analysts overwhelmingly expect the Fed to start cutting in September, there is less clarity about what comes next. Economists at some banks, including Goldman Sachs, expect cuts totaling 75 basis points over the last three meetings of the year, while others see more aggressive cuts, like economists at Citi, who have 125 basis points of easing as their base case. 'The continued softening of the labor market is likely to provoke larger-sized cuts if not at this FOMC meeting then in November and December,' the Citi economists wrote in a recent note to clients, referring to the rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC). The Fed will shed some light on the issue on Wednesday, when it publishes the updated economic forecasts of its 19-member FOMC — including their rate cut expectations. In June, FOMC members sharply reduced the number of cuts they had penciled in for this year from a median of three down to just one amid a small uptick in inflation. But as inflation has fallen and the labor market has weakened, expectations of more cuts have grown. Traders also see a greater-than 99 percent chance of at least four more cuts in 2025, which would bring the Fed's key lending rate down to between 3.5 and 3.75 percent — 175 basis points below current levels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-fed-expected-to-announce-its-first-interest-rate-cut-since-2020/7785008.html	2024-09-15T07:31:46-07:00	
Jordan's King Abdullah appoints US-educated technocrat as PM, royal court says	AMMAN — Jordan's King Abdullah has designated key palace aide Jafar Hassan as prime minister after the government resigned on Sunday, the royal court said, days after a parliamentary election in which the Islamist opposition made some gains in the U.S.-allied kingdom. Hassan, now head of King Abdullah's office and a former planning minister, replaces Bisher Khasawneh, a veteran diplomat and former palace adviser who was appointed nearly four years ago, a royal court statement said. Khasawneh will stay on in a caretaker capacity until the formation of a new cabinet, the statement said. Harvard-educated Hassan, a widely respected technocrat, will face the challenges of mitigating the impact of the Gaza war on the kingdom's economy, hard-hit by curbs to investment and a sharp drop in tourism. The outgoing prime minister had sought to drive reforms pushed by King Abdullah to help reverse a decade of sluggish growth, hovering at around 2%, that was worsened by the pandemic and conflict in neighboring Iraq and Syria. The traditional conservative establishment had long been blamed for obstructing a modernization drive advocated by the Western-leaning monarch, fearing liberal reforms would erode their grip on power. Politicians say a key task ahead is accelerating IMF-guided reforms and reining in more than $50 billion in public debt in a country with high unemployment and whose stability is supported by billions of dollars of foreign aid from Western donors. The Muslim Brotherhood opposition and ideological allies of Palestinian militant group Hamas made significant gains in Tuesday's election, boosted by anger over Israel's war in Gaza. The Islamists won 31 seats, the most since parliamentary life was revived in 1989 after decades of martial law, leaving them the largest political grouping in parliament. In a country where anti-Israel sentiment runs high, they have led some of the largest protests in the region in support of Hamas, which their opponents say allowed them to increase their popularity. Although the new composition of the 138-member parliament retains a pro-government majority, the more vocal Islamist-led opposition could challenge IMF-backed free-market reforms and foreign policy, diplomats and officials say. Under Jordan's constitution, most powers still rest with the king, who appoints governments and can dissolve parliament. The assembly can force a cabinet to resign by a vote of no confidence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jordan-s-king-abdullah-appoints-us-educated-technocrat-as-pm-royal-court-says/7784994.html	2024-09-15T07:04:37-07:00	
A high-level US delegation in Dhaka to foster economic growth with interim government	DHAKA, Bangladesh — A high-level U.S. delegation met Sunday with the head of Bangladesh's interim government, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, to affirm 'dedication to fostering inclusive economic growth,' according to the American embassy in Dhaka. Yunus took over after former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled the country last month amid a mass uprising. She was accused of corruption, violation of human rights and excessive use of force against the protesters. During her 15-year rule, Hasina enjoyed close relations with India, China and Russia who have heavily invested in the country's infrastructure development, trade and investment. The U.S. has also become the single largest foreign investor in Bangladesh under Hasina. Yunus on Sunday said he sought U.S. support 'to rebuild the country, carry out vital reforms, and bring back stolen assets,' his press office said in a statement after he met the delegation at the State Guest House Jamuna in Dhaka. He told the U.S. representatives his interim administration has moved fast to 'reset, reform, and restart' the economy, initiate reforms in financial sectors, and fix institutions such as the judiciary and police, the statement said. The U.S. delegation, led by Brent Neiman, assistant secretary for International Finance at the U.S. Department of the Treasury, had representatives from the U.S. Agency for International Development, and Office of the U.S. Trade Representative. Donald Lu, assistant secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs, joined the delegation after visiting India. They met with several officials in Dhaka, including Touhid Hossain, the country's adviser to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The USAID also signed an agreement to provide $202.25 million in aid to Bangladesh. The U.S. embassy on X underscored how American companies are entrenched in the South Asian country. 'With the right economic reforms in place, the American private sector can help unlock Bangladesh's growth potential through trade and investment,' the embassy wrote on its official account. The delegation also met representatives of the American companies under the American Chamber of Commerce in Bangladesh (AmCham) operating in Bangladesh upon arriving Saturday. Concerns over safety and lack of order in Bangladesh were relayed by the companies' agents. AmCham President Syed Ershad Ahmed said at the meeting that while there were improvements after the interim government was installed, 'there are some bottlenecks too.' Profit repatriation amid the ongoing crisis of U.S. dollars and challenges in the supply chain resulting from congestion at ports were among the issues he raised. The meeting came as unrest took hold of the country's major garment industry with workers walking out, leaving factories shuttered, as they demanded better benefits including higher wages. The factory owners, the government and workers' leaders are holding meetings to ease the tension. Bangladesh is one of the most vulnerable countries to climate-induced disasters. The U.S. embassy on its official Facebook page said the United States wanted to help it 'mitigate climate risks.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-high-level-us-delegation-in-dhaka-to-foster-economic-growth-with-interim-government-/7784966.html	2024-09-15T06:23:47-07:00	
87 and hobbled, Pope Francis goes off-script in Asia and reminds world he can still draw a crowd	DILI, East Timor — It was the farthest trip of his pontificate and one of the longest papal trips ever in terms of days on the road and distance traveled. But Pope Francis, age 87, hobbled by bad knees and bent over with sciatica, appeared to be having the time of his life. With half of East Timor's population gathered at a seaside park, Francis couldn't help but oblige them with a final good night and languid loops in his popemobile, long after the sun had set and the field was lit by cellphone screens. It was late, the heat and humidity had turned Tasitolu park into something of a sauna, and most of the journalists had already gone back to their air-conditioned hotel to watch the Mass on TV. But there was Francis, defying the doubters who had questioned if he could, would or should make such an arduous trip to Asia given everything that could go wrong. 'How many children you have!' Francis marveled to the crowd of 600,000, which amounted to the biggest-ever turnout for a papal event as a proportion of the population. 'A people that teaches its children to smile is a people that has a future.' The moment seemed to serve as proof that, despite his age, ailments and seven hours of jet lag, Pope Francis still could pope, still likes to pope and has it in him to pope like he used to at the start of his pontificate. That's never truer than when he's in his element: in the peripheries of the world, among people forgotten by the big powers, where he can go off-script to respond to the spirit of the moment. And it was certainly the case on his 11-day trip through Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, East Timor and Singapore, during which he clocked nearly 33,000 kilometers (20,505 miles) in air travel alone. It was a trip that he had originally planned to make in 2020 but COVID-19 intervened. Four years and a handful of hospitalizations later (for intestinal and pulmonary problems), Francis finally pulled it off. He seemed to relish getting out of the Vatican and away from the weighty grind of the Holy See after being cooped up all year, much of it battling a long bout of bronchitis. Francis does tend to rally during foreign trips, though he usually sticks to a script when he's in the protocol meetings with heads of state, dutifully delivering speeches that were written in advance by Vatican diplomats. But when he's meeting with young people or local priests and nuns, he tends to show his true colors. He'll ditch his prepared remarks and speak off-the-cuff, often engaging in back-and-forth banter with the faithful to make sure his message has stuck. Doing so thrills the crowd, terrorizes his translators and complicates the work of journalists, but you always know Francis is enjoying himself and feels energized when he goes rogue. And he went rogue plenty of times in Asia — and on the in-flight press conference coming back to Rome, during which he urged American Catholics to vote for who they think is the 'lesser evil' for president. Francis started in Indonesia, arguably the most delicate destination on his itinerary given the country is home to the world's largest Muslim population. The Vatican would be loathe to say or do anything that might cause offense. And yet from his very first encounter with President Joko Widodo, Francis appeared in a feisty mood, praising Indonesia's relatively high birthrate while lamenting that in the West, 'some prefer a cat or a little dog.' Francis has frequently made the same demographic quip at home in Italy, which has one of the world's lowest birthrates. But the high-profile trip meant that his trademark sarcasm got amplified. American commentators immediately assumed Francis had entered the 'childless cat ladies' debate roiling U.S. politics, but there was no indication he had JD Vance in mind. Even in the most delicate moment in Jakarta, at Southeast Asia's biggest mosque, Francis threw protocol aside and kissed the hand of the grand imam and brought it to his cheek in gratitude. In Papua New Guinea, Francis was similarly jazzed after pulling off a visit to a remote jungle outpost that had seemed impossible for him to reach: The airport in Vanimo, population 11,000, doesn't have an ambulift wheelchair elevator that Francis now needs to get on and off planes, and bringing one in just for him was out of the question. The stubborn pope, who really, really wanted to go to Vanimo, ended up rolling on and off the back ramp of a C-130 cargo plane that Australia had offered to get him, and the metric ton of medicine and other supplies he brought with him, to the town. Despite the considerable security concerns of entering a region torn by tribal rivalries, Francis seemed to relish the jungle visit, perhaps because he felt so much at home. A dozen Argentine missionary priests and nuns have lived in Vanimo with the local community for years and had invited him to come. They decorated the simple stage in front of the church with a statue of Argentina's beloved Virgin of Lujan, to whom Francis is particularly devoted, and had a gourd of mate, the Argentine tea, waiting for him. In East Timor Francis had to negotiate perhaps the most sensitive issue clouding the visit: the case of Bishop Carlos Ximenes Belo, the revered national hero who won the Nobel Peace Prize for his nonviolent independence campaign. The Vatican revealed in 2022 that it had sanctioned Belo, who now lives in Portugal, for having sexually abused young boys and ordered him to cease contact with East Timor. Francis didn't mention Belo by name and didn't meet with his victims, but he did reaffirm the need to protect children from 'abuse.' There was nary a mention of Belo's name in any official speech during a visit in which East Timor's traumatic history and independence fight were repeatedly evoked. In Singapore, his final stop, Francis once again ditched his remarks when he arrived at the last event, a meeting of Singaporean youth on Friday morning. 'That's the talk I prepared,' he said, pointing to his speech and then proceeding to launch into a spontaneous back-and-forth with the young people about the need to have courage and take risks. 'What's worse: Make a mistake because I take a certain path, or not make a mistake and stay home?' he asked them. He answered his own question, with a response that could explain his own risky decision to embark on the Asia trip in the first place. 'A young person who doesn't take a risk, who is afraid of making a mistake, is an old person,' the 87-year-old pope said. 'I hope all of you go forward,' he said. 'Don't go back. Don't go back. Take risks.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/and-hobbled-pope-francis-goes-off-script-in-asia-and-reminds-world-he-can-still-draw-a-crowd/7784945.html	2024-09-15T05:43:08-07:00

UK foreign minister Lammy plays down Putin threats	London — U.K. Foreign Secretary David Lammy accused Russian President Vladimir Putin of 'bluster' Sunday over his warning that letting Ukraine use long-range weapons to strike inside Russia would put NATO 'at war' with Moscow. Tensions between Russia and the West over the conflict reached dire levels this week as U.S. President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met at the White House to discuss whether to ease rules on Kyiv's use of western-supplied weaponry. 'I think that what Putin's doing is throwing dust up into the air,' Lammy told the BBC. 'There's a lot of bluster. That's his modus operandi. He threatens about tanks, he threatens about missiles, he threatens about nuclear weapons.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has been asking for permission to use British Storm Shadow missiles and U.S.-made ATACMS missiles to hit targets deeper inside Russia for months. Biden and Starmer delayed a decision on the move during their meeting on Friday. It came after Putin warned that green-lighting use of the weapons 'would mean that NATO countries, the U.S., European countries, are at war with Russia.' 'If that's the case, then taking into account the change of nature of the conflict, we will take the appropriate decisions based on the threats that we will face,' he added. The Russian leader has long warned Western countries that they risk provoking a nuclear war over their support for Ukraine. 'We cannot be blown off course by an imperialist fascist, effectively, that wants to move into countries willy nilly,' said Lammy. 'If we let him with Ukraine, believe me, he will not stop there.' Lammy said that talks between Starmer, Biden and Zelensky over the use of the missiles would continue at the United Nations General Assembly gathering in New York later this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-foreign-minister-lammy-plays-down-putin-threats/7784905.html	2024-09-15T03:30:34-07:00	
Floods kill 1 in Poland and rescue worker in Austria as rains batter central Europe	LIPOVA LAZNE, Czech Republic — One person drowned in southwest Poland and thousands were evacuated across the border in the Czech Republic as heavy rains continued to batter central Europe on Sunday, causing flooding in several areas. A firefighter tackling flooding in lower Austria was also killed, Austrian Vice Chancellor Werner Kogler said on Sunday on social platform X as authorities declared the province, which surrounds Vienna, bordering the Czech Republic and Slovakia, a disaster area. Rivers overflowed from Poland to Romania, where four people were found dead on Saturday, after days of torrential rain in a low-pressure system named Boris. Some parts of the Czech Republic and Poland faced the worst flooding in almost three decades. In the Czech Republic, a quarter of a million homes were without power due to high winds and rain. Czech police said they were looking for three people who were in a car that fell into the river Staric near Lipova Lazne, 235 kilometers east of Prague on Saturday. In Poland, one person died in Klodzko county, which Prime Minister Donald Tusk said was the worst-hit area of the country and where 1,600 had been evacuated. 'The situation is very dramatic,' Tusk told reporters on Sunday after a meeting in Klodzko town, which was partly under water as the local river rose to 6.65 meters Sunday morning before receding slightly. That surpassed a record seen in heavy flooding in 1997, which partly damaged the town and claimed 56 lives in Poland. The nearby historic town of Glucholazy ordered evacuations Sunday morning as the local river started to break its banks, while firefighters and soldiers had been fighting since Saturday to protect a bridge in the town. Residents across the Czech border also said the situation was worse than flooding seen before. 'What you see here is worse than in 1997, and I don't know what will happen because my house is under water, and I don't know if I will even return to it,' said Pavel Bily, a resident of Lipova Lazne. The fire service in the region said it had evacuated 1,900 people as of Sunday morning, while many roads were impassable. In the worst-hit areas, more than 10 centimeters of rain fell overnight and around 45 centimeters since Wednesday evening, the Czech weather institute said. More rain is expected Sunday and Monday. In Budapest, officials raised forecasts for the Danube to rise in the second half of this week, to above 8.5 meters, nearing a record 8.91 meters seen in 2013, as rain continued in Hungary, Slovakia and Austria. 'According to forecasts, one of the biggest floods of the past years is approaching Budapest but we are prepared to tackle it,' Budapest's mayor Gergely Karacsony said. In Romania, authorities said the rain was less intense than on Saturday, when flooding killed four and damaged 5,000 homes. Towns and villages in seven counties across eastern Romania were affected, and the country's emergency response unit said it was still searching for two people missing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/floods-kill-1-in-poland-and-rescue-worker-in-austria-as-rains-batter-central-europe/7784895.html	2024-09-15T02:59:17-07:00	
8 migrants die in Channel crossing attempt, French authorities say	Lille, France — Eight migrants died early Sunday when their overcrowded vessel capsized while trying to cross the Channel from France to England, French authorities said, less than two weeks after the deadliest such disaster this year. The French and British governments have sought for years to stop the flow of migrants, who pay smugglers thousands of euros per head for the passage to England from France aboard small boats. A police source told AFP the accident occurred shortly after the boat embarked. Regional prefect Jacques Billant is set to hold a news conference at 10 a.m., his office said. Maritime authorities said Saturday that numerous attempts by migrants to make the perilous crossing in small boats have been attempted in recent days, with 200 people rescued in 24 hours over Friday and Saturday alone. At least 12 migrants, mostly from Eritrea, died off the northern French coast when their boat carrying dozens of people capsized this month. It was the deadliest such disaster this year and brought to 37 the number of migrant deaths in the Channel, up from 12 in 2023. More than 22,000 migrants have arrived in England by crossing the Channel since the beginning of this year, according to British officials. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer and France's President Emmanuel Macron pledged this summer to strengthen 'cooperation' in handling the surge in undocumented migrant numbers. The Channel crossings often prove perilous, and in November 2021, 27 migrants died when their boat capsized in the deadliest single such disaster to date. French authorities seek to stop migrants taking to the water but do not intervene once they are afloat except for rescue purposes, citing safety concerns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrants-die-in-channel-crossing-attempt-french-authorities-say/7784893.html	2024-09-15T02:49:56-07:00	
Shanghai braces for direct hit from Typhoon Bebinca	SHANGHAI/BEIJING — Shanghai halted transportation links, recalled ships and shut tourism spots including Shanghai Disney Resort on Sunday as it braced for Typhoon Bebinca, in what could be the strongest tropical cyclone to hit the Chinese financial hub since 1949. The Category 1 typhoon, packing maximum sustained wind speeds near its center of around 144 kph, was about 500 kilometers southeast of Shanghai as of 1 p.m. It is expected to make landfall along China's eastern coast after midnight on Monday. The strongest storm to make landfall in Shanghai in recent decades was Typhoon Gloria in 1949, which tore through the city with gusts of 144 kph. Shanghai was last threatened by a direct hit in 2022 by the powerful Typhoon Muifa, which instead landed 300 kilometers away in the city of Zhoushan, in Zhejiang province. Shanghai is typically spared the strong typhoons that hit farther south in China, including Yagi, a destructive Category 4 storm that roared past southern Hainan province last week. But Shanghai and neighboring provinces are taking no chances with Category 1 Bebinca. Resorts in Shanghai, including Shanghai Disney Resort, Jinjiang Amusement Park and Shanghai Wild Animal Park, have been temporarily closed while most ferries have been halted to and from Chongming Island - China's third-biggest island known as 'the gateway to the Yangtze River.' More than 600 flights to and from Shanghai were also canceled, according to local media. In Zhejiang, ships have been recalled while several parks in the provincial capital Hangzhou announced closures. Bebinca's arrival will coincide with the Mid-Autumn festival, a nationwide three-day holiday when many Chinese travel or engage in outdoor activities. China's Ministry of Water Resources on Saturday issued a Level-IV emergency response -- the lowest level in China's four-tier emergency response system -- for potential flooding in Shanghai and the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shanghai-braces-for-direct-hit-from-typhoon-bebinca/7784890.html	2024-09-15T02:42:18-07:00	
Tech billionaire returns to Earth after first private spacewalk	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — A billionaire spacewalker returned to Earth with his crew on Sunday, ending a five-day trip that lifted them higher than anyone has traveled since NASA's moonwalkers. SpaceX's capsule splashed down in the Gulf of Mexico near Florida's Dry Tortugas in the predawn darkness, carrying tech entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, two SpaceX engineers and a former Air Force Thunderbird pilot. They pulled off the first private spacewalk while orbiting nearly 740 kilometers above Earth, higher than the International Space Station and Hubble Space Telescope. Their spacecraft hit a peak altitude of 1,408 kilometers following Tuesday's liftoff. Isaacman became only the 264th person to perform a spacewalk since the former Soviet Union scored the first in 1965, and SpaceX's Sarah Gillis the 265th. Until now, all spacewalks were done by professional astronauts. 'We are mission complete,' Isaacman radioed as the capsule bobbed in the water, awaiting the recovery team. Within an hour, all four were out of their spacecraft, pumping their fists with joy as they emerged onto the ship's deck. It was the first time SpaceX aimed for a splashdown near the Dry Tortugas, a cluster of islands 113 kilometers west of Key West. To celebrate the new location, SpaceX employees brought a big, green turtle balloon to Mission Control at company headquarters in Hawthorne, California. The company usually targets closer to the Florida coast, but two weeks of poor weather forecasts prompted SpaceX to look elsewhere. During Thursday's commercial spacewalk, the Dragon capsule's hatch was open barely a half-hour. Isaacman emerged only up to his waist to briefly test SpaceX's brand-new spacesuit followed by Gillis, who was knee-high as she flexed her arms and legs for several minutes. Gillis, a classically trained violinist, also held a performance in orbit earlier in the week. The spacewalk lasted less than two hours, considerably shorter than those at the International Space Station. Most of that time was needed to depressurize the entire capsule and then restore the cabin air. Even SpaceX's Anna Menon and Scott 'Kidd' Poteet, who remained strapped in, wore spacesuits. SpaceX considers the brief exercise a starting point to test spacesuit technology for future, longer missions to Mars. This was Isaacman's second chartered flight with SpaceX, with two more still ahead under his personally financed space exploration program named Polaris after the North Star. He paid an undisclosed sum for his first spaceflight in 2021, taking along contest winners and a pediatric cancer survivor while raising more than $250 million for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. For the just completed so-called Polaris Dawn mission, the founder and CEO of the Shift4 credit card-processing company shared the cost with SpaceX. Isaacman won't divulge how much he spent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tech-billionaire-returns-to-earth-after-first-private-spacewalk-/7784887.html	2024-09-15T02:06:27-07:00	
Missile fired from Yemen lands in open area in Israel, sets off air raid sirens	JERUSALEM — A long-range missile fired from Yemen landed in an open area in central Israel early Sunday, the Israeli military said, in the latest reverberation from the nearly yearlong war in Gaza. The early morning attack triggered air raid sirens, including at Israel's international airport, where Israeli media aired footage of people racing to shelters. There were no reports of casualties or damage, and the airport authority said operations resumed as normal shortly thereafter. A fire could be seen in a rural area of central Israel, and local media showed images of what appeared to be a fragment from a missile or interceptor that landed on an escalator in a train station in the central town of Modiin. The military said the sound of explosions in the area came from interceptors. Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel since the start of the nearly yearlong war between Israel and Palestinian militants in Gaza, but nearly all of them have been intercepted over the Red Sea. There was no immediate claim for Sunday's attack. In July, an Iranian-made drone launched by the Houthis struck Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding 10 others. Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen. The Houthis have also repeatedly attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea, in what the rebels portray as a blockade on Israel in support of the Palestinians. Most of the targeted ships have no connection to Israel. The war in Gaza, which began with Hamas' October 7 attack into southern Israel, has rippled across the region, with Iran and allied militant groups attacking Israeli and U.S. targets and drawing retaliatory strikes from Israel and its Western allies. On several occasions, the strikes and counterstrikes have threatened to trigger a wider conflict. Iran supports militant groups across the region, including Hamas, the Houthis and Lebanon's Hezbollah, its most powerful ally, which has traded fired with Israel on a near-daily basis since the war in Gaza began. Iran and its allies say they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. The military said around 40 projectiles were fired from Lebanon early Sunday, with most intercepted or falling in open areas. The strikes along the Israel-Lebanon border have displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides. Israel has repeatedly threatened to launch a wider military operation against Hezbollah to ensure its citizens can return to their homes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/missile-fired-from-yemen-lands-in-open-area-in-israel-sets-off-air-raid-sirens/7784874.html	2024-09-15T00:26:07-07:00	
Meet straight man protesting Ghana's anti-LGBTQ bill	ACCRA, Ghana — Texas Kadiri Moro stood in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Accra on Thursday, dressed in short pink Speedos and a pink polo shirt. Accompanied by trumpet players, carrying a banner with slogans including 'Why should a society of evildoers judge others?' and 'Justice begins where inequality ends!' he marched across the Ghanaian capital in a one-man protest against a highly controversial bill that targets members of the LGBTQ+ community and their supporters. Moro is an unusual figure amid the LGBTQ+ rights activists in the coastal West African nation. He is heterosexual, married to a woman, and a father of six. He is a teacher. And he is a practicing Muslim. Yet for months he has been conducting solo demonstrations against the bill, which criminalizes members of the LGBTQ+ community, as well as its supporters, including promotion and funding of related activities and public displays of affection. It could send some people to prison for more than a decade. The bill was passed by Ghana's parliament earlier this year but has been challenged in the Supreme Court. It has not yet been signed into law by President Nana Akufo-Addo, who cited ongoing proceedings. But he refused to reject it either. 'There are so many issues about rights' when it comes to the bill, Moro told The Associated Press. 'Homosexuality does not affect anyone,' Moro said. 'We have activities that people are doing in the country that are worse than homosexual activities,' he said, citing adultery as an example. Parliament, he said, should be more concerned with 'other crimes and pollution.' The bill has sparked condemnation from rights groups and some in the international community who have been concerned about similar efforts by other African governments. Sponsors of the bill have said it seeks to protect children and people who are victims of abuse. Man becomes target Gay sex is already illegal in Ghana, carrying a three-year prison sentence, but the new bill could imprison people for more than a decade for activities including public displays of affection and promotion and funding of LGBTQ+ activities. Since he began his protests, Moro has lost his job, not received any assistance from the LGBTQ+ community, and become a target of 'very hostile attacks from the Muslim community,' he said. But he is determined to continue. For him, it is about battling injustice. 'I know I'm doing something that God is asking me to do,' he said. To point out the hypocrisy of the bill, Moro carried a petition to the Parliament asking the government to withdraw foreign missions from countries where homosexuality is legal, if they find it 'filthy,' he said. Bill 'is a wrongdoing' At the entrance to Parliament House, Kate Addo, Parliament's director of communications, received Moro's petition on behalf of the speaker. She said she was pleased with his initiative. 'We live in a democratic country where what people do in their bedrooms is not to be anyone's concern,' Addo said. 'However, we are also regulated by law.' Even though Ghana's president delayed signing the bill into law, activists said that the debate by itself triggered an increase in physical and psychological violence against LGBTQ+ people. Joseph Kobla Wemakor, the executive director of Human Rights Reporters Ghana, said that 'abuse, both psychologically and physically against members of the community has skyrocketed' since the bill was introduced. 'The moment people hear that you are part of this, the LGBTQ+, you are an enemy,' Wekamor said. 'They are looking forward to hurting you, even lynching you, killing you.' They are 'forgetting that we are all humans,' he said. 'It takes one man to change the world,' he said. 'And if he has started something like that, other people will follow, because it (the bill) is a wrongdoing.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---meet-straight-man-protesting-ghana-s-anti-lgbtq-bill-/7784092.html	2024-09-14T23:54:20-07:00	
Bag of Cheetos has huge impact on national park ecosystem	ALBUQUERQUE, New Mexico — A bag of Cheetos gets dropped and left on the floor. Seems inconsequential, right? Hardly. Rangers at Carlsbad Caverns National Park in southern New Mexico describe it as a 'world-changing' event for the tiny microbes and insects that call this specialized subterranean environment home. The bag could have been there a day or two or maybe just hours, but those salty morsels of processed corn made soft by thick humidity triggered the growth of mold on the cavern floor and on nearby cave formations. 'To the ecosystem of the cave it had a huge impact,' the park noted in a social media post, explaining that cave crickets, mites, spiders and flies soon organized to eat and disperse the foreign mess, essentially spreading the contamination. The bright orange bag was spotted off trail by a ranger during one of the regular sweeps that park staff make through the Big Room, the largest single cave chamber by volume in North America, at the end of each day. They are looking for straggling visitors and any litter or other waste that might have been left behind on the paved trail. The Big Room is a popular spot at Carlsbad Caverns. It is a magical expanse filled with towering stalagmites, dainty stalactites and clusters of cave popcorn. Tons of trash From this underground wonderland in New Mexico to lake shores in Nevada, tributaries along the Grand Canyon and lagoons in Florida, park rangers and volunteers collect tons of trash left behind by visitors each year as part of an ongoing battle to keep unique ecosystems from being compromised while still allowing visitors access. According to the National Park Service, more than 300 million people visit the national parks each year, bringing in and generating nearly 70 million tons of trash, most of which ends up where it belongs - in garbage bins and recycling containers. But for the rest of the discarded snack bags and other debris, it often takes work to round up the waste, and organizations like Leave No Trace have been pushing their message at trailheads and online. At Carlsbad Caverns, volunteers comb the caverns collecting lint. One five-day effort netted as much as 50 pounds (22.68 kilograms). Rangers also have sweep packs and spill kits for the more delicate and sometimes nasty work that can include cleaning up human waste along the trail. 'It's such a dark area, sometimes people don't notice that it's there. So they walk through it and it tracks it throughout the entire cave,' said Joseph Ward, a park guide who is working specifically on getting the 'leave no trace' message out to park visitors and classrooms. The rangers' kits can include gloves, trash bags, water, bleach mixtures for decontamination, vacuums and even bamboo toothbrushes and tweezers for those hard-to-reach spots. As for the spilled Cheetos, Ward told The Associated Press that could have been avoided because the park doesn't allow food beyond the confines of the historic underground lunchroom. Cheetos response After the bag was discovered in July, cave specialists at the park settled on the best way to clean it up. Most of the mess was scooped up, and a toothbrush was used to remove rings of mold and fungi that had spread to nearby cave formations. It was a 20-minute job. Some jobs can take hours and involve several park employees, Ward said. Robert Melnick, professor emeritus at the University of Oregon, has been studying the cultural landscape of Carlsbad Caverns, including features like a historic wooden staircase that has become another breeding ground for exotic mold and fungi. He and his team submitted a report to the park in recent days that details those resources and makes recommendations for how the park can manage them in the future. The balancing act for park managers at Carlsbad and elsewhere, Melnick said, is meeting the dual mandate of preserving and protecting landscapes while also making them accessible. 'I don't quite know how you would monitor it except to constantly remind people that the underground, the caves, are a very, very sensitive natural environment,' he said. Pleas to treat the caverns with respect are plastered on signs throughout the park, rangers give orientations to visitors before they go underground, and reminders of the dos and don'ts are printed on the back of each ticket stub. But sometimes there is a disconnect between awareness and personal responsibility, said JD Tanner, director of education and training at Leave No Trace. Personal stake is vital Many people may be aware of the need to 'keep it pristine,' but Tanner said the message doesn't always translate into action or there is a lack of understanding that small actions — even leaving a piece of trash — can have irreversible damage in a fragile ecosystem. 'If someone doesn't feel a personal stake in the preservation of these environments, they may not take the rules seriously,' Tanner said. Diana Northup, a microbiologist who has spent years studying cave environments around the world, once crawled up the main corridor at Carlsbad Caverns to log everything that humans left behind. 'So this is just one thing of very many,' she said of the Cheetos. As many as 2,000 people go through the caverns on any given day during the busy season. With them come hair and skin fragments, and those fragments can have their own microbes on board. 'So it can be really, really bad or it can just be us and all the stuff we're shedding,' Northup said of human contamination within cave environments. 'But here's the other side of the coin: The only way you can protect caves is for people to be able to see them and experience them.' 'The biggest thing,' she said, 'is you have to get people to value and want to preserve the caves and let them know what they can do to have that happen.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bag-of-cheetos-created-huge-impact-on-national-park-ecosystem-/7784063.html	2024-09-14T23:53:46-07:00

Muralists paint over traces of violence in Salvadoran neighborhood	MEJICANOS, El Salvador — From the window of her tin-sided shop outside El Salvador's capital, San Salvador, Esmeralda Quintanilla watches artists get to work in her neighborhood on walls still pockmarked by bullet holes from the country's civil war and gang conflict. Armed with brushes, paint and spray cans, muralists and graffiti artists have already covered the walls of several of the 40 five-story units in a housing complex in the Zacamil neighborhood of the Mejicanos district. 'With the murals, everything looks really nice,' said Quintanilla, a 55-year-old seamstress who has lived in the neighborhood nearly half her life. 'You start to see all this, and it gives the place a different image. I feel really happy, proud.' The dozen murals already completed include a Mesoamerican pyramid, pixelated depictions of the Virgin Mary and works straight out of the artists' imaginations. The initiative in the once-violent neighborhood is led by a Salvadoran foundation that seeks to fill communities with art. Its aim in Zacamil is to create stories-high murals over the next two years on nearly every wall of the complex, which houses around 4,000 residents. Zacamil got a break from decades of violence two years ago when President Nayib Bukele launched a nationwide crackdown on gangs. The state of emergency — which human rights groups have said Bukele must end amid reports of abuses — has put almost 82,000 alleged gang members in prison. Even with the murals improving the neighborhood's appearance, chronic infrastructure issues remain, with garbage piled up in the streets and storm drains clogged. TV antennas, power cables and clothes strewn out windows across clotheslines also dot the neighborhood. Many Zacamil residents fled in 1989 when fighting between the Salvadoran army and the former leftist guerrilla group, Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front, or FMLN, nearly destroyed the Mejicanos district. When they returned, many found homes damaged by two earthquakes in 2001 or invaded by gang members. 'There are always problems, but this is a facelift,' said a 70-year-old resident who declined to give his name. El Salvador's 12-year civil war from late 1979 to January 1992 killed more than 75,000 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/muralists-paint-over-traces-of-violence-in-salvadoran-neighborhood/7783263.html	2024-09-14T23:52:27-07:00	
Traveling 'health train' has become essential source of free care in South Africa	JOHANNESBURG — Thethiwe Mahlangu woke early on a chilly morning and walked through her busy South African township, where minibuses hooted to pick up commuters and smoke from sidewalk breakfast stalls hung in the air. Her eyes had been troubling her. But instead of going to her nearby health clinic, Mahlangu was headed to the train station for an unusual form of care. A passenger train known as Phelophepa — or 'good, clean, health' in the Sesotho language — had been transformed into a mobile health facility. It circulates throughout South Africa for much of the year, providing medical attention to the sick, young and old who often struggle to receive the care they need at crowded local clinics. For the past 30 years — ever since South Africa's break with the former racist system of apartheid — the train has carried doctors, nurses and optometrists on an annual journey that touches even the most rural villages, delivering primary health care to about 375,000 people a year. The free care it delivers is in contrast to South Africa's overstretched public health care system on which about 84% of people rely. Health care reflects the deep inequality of the country at large. Just 16% of South Africans are covered by health insurance plans that are beyond the financial reach of many in a nation with unemployment of over 32%. Earlier this year, the government began to address that gap. President Cyril Ramaphosa in May signed into law the National Health Insurance Act, which aims to provide funding so that millions of South Africans without health insurance can receive care from the better-provisioned private sector. But the law has been divisive. The government has not said how much it will cost and where the money will come from. Economists say the government will have to raise taxes. Critics say the country can't afford it and warn that the system — yet to be implemented — will be open to abuse by corrupt officials and businessmen. They say the government should fix the public health care system instead. For Mahlangu and others who look to the train for a rare source of free treatment, the situation at local health clinics is one of despair. Long lines, shortages of medicines and rude nurses are some of the challenges at the clinics that cater for thousands of patients a day in Tembisa, east of Johannesburg. 'There we are not treated well,' Mahlangu said. 'We are made to sit in the sun for long periods. You can sit there from 7 a.m. until around 4 p.m. when the clinic closes. When you ask, they say we must go ask the president to build us a bigger hospital.' The health train has grown from a single three-carriage operation over the years to two 16-carriage trains. They are run by the Transnet Foundation, a social responsibility arm of Transnet, the state-owned railway company. When the train began in 1994, many Black people in South Africa still lived in rural villages with little access to health facilities. It was a period of change in the country. The train began as an eye clinic, but it soon became clear that needs were greater than that. Now both trains address the booming population of South Africa's capital of Pretoria and nearby Johannesburg, the country's economic hub. One would spend two weeks in Tembisa alone. 'The major metros are really struggling,' said Shemona Kendiah, the train's manager. But the traveling clinic is far from the solution to South Africa's health care problems. Public health expert Alex van den Heever said there have been substantial increases in the health care budget and the public sector employment of nurses and doctors since the country's first democratic government in 1994. The health department's budget in Gauteng province, which includes Pretoria and Johannesburg, has grown from 6 billion rand ($336 million) in 2000 to 65 billion ($3.6 billion) rand now. But van den Heever accused the African National Congress, the ruling party since the end of apartheid, of allowing widespread corruption to undermine the public sector, including the health care system. 'This has led to a rapid deterioration of performance,' he said. For South Africans who have witnessed the decline firsthand, it can be a relief when the health train pulls into town. Mahlangu — with her new pair of glasses — was among hundreds who walked away satisfied with its services and already longing for the train's return next year. Another patient, Jane Mabuza, got a full health checkup along with dental services. She said she hoped the train would reach many other people. 'Here on the train, you never hear that anything has been finished,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/traveling-health-train-has-become-essential-source-of-free-care-in-south-africa/7782629.html	2024-09-14T23:51:51-07:00	
From Chinese to Italians and beyond, maligning a culture via its food is longtime American habit	new york — It's a practice that's about as American as apple pie — accusing immigrant and minority communities of engaging in bizarre or disgusting behaviors when it comes to what and how they eat and drink, a kind of shorthand for saying they don't belong. The latest iteration came at Tuesday's presidential debate, when former President Donald Trump spotlighted a false online tempest around the Haitian immigrant community of Springfield, Ohio. He repeated the groundless claim previously spread by his running mate, JD Vance, that the immigrants were stealing dogs and cats, the precious pets belonging to their American neighbors, and eating them. The furor got enough attention that officials had to step in to refute it, saying there was no credible evidence of any such thing. But while it might be enough to turn your stomach, such food-based accusations are not new. Far from it. Food-related scorn and insults were hurled at immigrant Chinese communities on the West Coast in the late 1800s as they started coming to the United States in larger numbers, and in later decades spread to other Asian and Pacific Islander communities like Thai or Vietnamese. As recently as last year, a Thai restaurant in California was hit with the stereotype, which caused such an outpouring of undeserved vitriol that the owner had to close and move to another location. Behind it is the idea that 'you're engaging in something that is not just a matter of taste, but a violation of what it is to be human,' said Paul Freedman, a professor of history at Yale University. By tarring Chinese immigrants as those who would eat things Americans would refuse to, it made them the 'other.' Food as flashpoint Other communities, while not being accused of eating pets, have been criticized for the perceived strangeness of what they were cooking when they were new arrivals, such as Italians using too much garlic or Indians too much curry powder. Minority groups with a longer presence in the country were and are still not exempt from racist stereotypes — think derogatory references to Mexicans and beans or insulting African Americans with remarks about fried chicken and watermelon. 'There's a slur for almost every ethnicity based on some kind of food that they eat,' said Amy Bentley, professor of nutrition and food studies at New York University. 'And so that's a very good way of disparaging people.' That's because food isn't just sustenance. Embedded in human eating habits are some of the very building blocks of culture — things that make different peoples distinct and can be commandeered as fodder for ethnic hatred or political polemics. 'We need it to survive, but it's also highly ritualized and highly symbolic. So the birthday cake, the anniversary, the things are commemorated and celebrated with food and drink,' Bentley said. 'It's just so highly integrated in all parts of our lives.' And because 'there's specific variations of how humans do those rituals, how they eat, how they have shaped their cuisines, how they eat their food,' she added, 'It can be as a theme of commonality ... or it can be a form of distinct division.' It's not just the what. Insults can come from the how as well — eating with hands or chopsticks instead of forks and knives, for example. It can be seen in class-based bias against poorer people who didn't have the same access to elaborate table settings or couldn't afford to eat the same way the rich did — and used different, perhaps unfamiliar ingredients out of necessity. Such disparagement can extend directly into current events. During the Second Gulf War, for example, Americans angry at France's opposition to the U.S. invasion of Iraq started calling french fries 'freedom fries.' And a much-used insulting term in the United States for Germans during the first two world wars was 'krauts' — a slam on a culture where sauerkraut was a traditional food. 'Just what was wrong with the way urban immigrants ate?' Donna R. Gabaccia wrote in her 1998 book, 'We Are What We Eat: Ethnic Food and the Making of Americans.' In reviewing attitudes of the early 20th century and its demands for '100% Americanism,' she noted that 'sauerkraut became 'victory cabbage'' and one account complained of an Italian family 'still eating spaghetti, not yet assimilated.' More food culture, more fodder Such stereotypes have persisted despite the fact that the American palate has significantly expanded in recent decades, thanks in part to the influx of those immigrant communities, with grocery stores carrying a wealth of ingredients that would baffle previous generations. The rise of restaurant culture has introduced many diners to authentic examples of cuisines they might have needed a passport to access in other eras. After all, Bentley said, 'when immigrants migrate to a different country, they bring their foodways with them and maintain them as they can. ... It's so reminiscent of family, community, home. They're just really material, multisensory manifestations of who we are.' Haitian food is just one example of that. Communities like those found in New York City and south Florida have added to the culinary landscape, using ingredients like goat, plantains and cassava. So when Trump said that immigrants in Springfield — whom he called 'the people that came in' — were eating dogs and cats and 'the pets of the people that live there,' the echoes of his remarks played into not just food but culture itself. And even though the American palate has broadened in recent decades, the persistence of food stereotypes — and outright insults, whether based in fact or completely made up — shows that just because Americans eat more broadly, it doesn't mean that carries over into tolerance or nuance about other groups. 'It's a fallacy to think that,' said Freedman. 'It's like the tourism fallacy that travel makes us more understanding of diversity. The best example right now is Mexican food. Lots and lots of people like Mexican food AND think that immigration needs to be stopped. There's no link between enjoyment of a foreigner's cuisine and that openness.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/from-chinese-to-italians-and-beyond-maligning-a-culture-via-its-foods-is-a-longtime-american-habit-/7782604.html	2024-09-14T23:51:19-07:00	
Historians say increased censorship in China makes research hard	BEIJING — At Beijing's largest antiques market, Panjiayuan, among the Mao statues, posters and second-hand books are prominent signs warning against the sale of publications that might have state secrets or 'reactionary propaganda.' Some of the signs display a hotline number so that citizens can tip off authorities if they witness an illegal sale. China's antique and flea markets were once a gold mine of documents for historians, but now the signs are emblematic of the chill that has descended on their ability to do research in the country. On one hand, Beijing wants to increase academic exchange and President Xi Jinping last November invited 50,000 American students to China over the next five years -- a massive jump from about 800 currently. How much steam that will gather is very much an open question. But scholars of modern Chinese history in particular -- arguably among the people most interested in China - fear that tightened censorship is extinguishing avenues for independent research into the country's past. This is especially so for documents relating to the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution -- the most historically sensitive period for the Chinese Communist Party -- when Mao Zedong declared class war and plunged China into chaos and violence. 'I would say the period of going to flea markets and simply finding treasure troves is pretty much over,' said Daniel Leese, a modern China historian at the University of Freiburg. Trawling for documents 'has basically gone out of favor because it has simply become too complex, difficult and dangerous,' he said, adding that younger foreign scholars are increasingly relying on overseas collections. The Chinese Communist Party has exerted control over all publications including books, the media and the internet since establishing the People's Republic of China (PRC) in 1949, with the degree of censorship fluctuating over time. But censorship has only intensified under President Xi Jinping, who came to power in 2012 and has blamed 'historic nihilism' or versions of history that differ from the official accounts for causing the collapse of the Soviet Union. In recent years, a raft of new national security and anti-espionage legislation has made scholars even more wary of citing unofficial Chinese materials. Some scholars of modern Chinese history who have published studies that either challenged Chinese state narratives or are on sensitive topics say they have been denied visas to China. James Millward, a historian at Georgetown University, said he had been visa-blocked on several occasions after contributing to the 2004 book Xinjiang: China's Muslim Borderland but has since received short-term visas a few times albeit after a lengthy process. The political climate is also shaping how historians choose their research subjects. One historian based in the U.S. said he has chosen to work on non-controversial topics to maintain travel access to China. He declined to be identified due to the sensitivity of the issue. China's education ministry did not respond to a Reuters request for comment. The foreign ministry said it was unaware of relevant circumstances. Documentary discoveries Leese and other foreign historians say they previously found case files of persecuted intellectuals as well as secret Communist Party documents at Chinese flea and antique markets. These were often donated by relatives of deceased officials or painstakingly rescued by booksellers from recycling centers near government offices disbanded during the mass state sector layoffs of the 1990s. But the government has, since 2008, cracked down on flea markets and other sources of used books and documents. Buyers have been arrested, sellers have been fined and used book websites have been cleared of politically sensitive items, according to domestic media reports, collectors and four overseas researchers who spoke with Reuters. In 2019, for example, a Japanese historian was detained for two months on spying charges after buying 1930s books on the Sino-Japanese War from a second-hand bookshop. Two years later, a hobbyist accused of selling illegal publications from Hong Kong and Taiwan publishers on Kongfuzi, China's biggest website for used books, was fined 280,000 yuan ($39,000) for not having a business license, Chinese media reported. And this year, two workers at a recycling center were punished for selling confidential military documents, state media said. Buyers now cultivate personal relationships with merchants who sell through WeChat, said a Beijing-based collector interested in documents from the Cultural Revolution, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Historians also note that access to the vast majority of local government archives has been restricted since 2010 and their digitization has enabled censors to heavily redact them. Foreign-based historians add that their counterparts in mainland China can only preserve materials for posterity in the current political climate. But not all are downbeat. 'Even under Xi, Chinese scholars continue to seek openings and enlarge the understanding and interpretation of PRC history,' said Yi Lu, assistant history professor at Dartmouth College, who has worked extensively with Chinese university collections of 20th-century materials. 'All is not lost.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-wants-academic-exchange-but-historians-say-increased-censorship-makes-research-hard-/7782594.html	2024-09-14T23:50:45-07:00	
US consumer watchdog finds school lunch fees taking toll on parents	new york — Single mother Rebecca Wood, 45, was already dealing with high medical bills in 2020 when she noticed she was being charged a $2.49 'program fee' each time she loaded money onto her daughter's school lunch account. As more schools turn to cashless payment systems, more districts have contracted with processing companies that charge as much as $3.25 or 4% to 5% per transaction, according to a new report from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The report found that though legally schools must offer a fee-free option to pay by cash or check, there's rarely transparency around it. 'It wouldn't have been a big deal if I had hundreds of dollars to dump into her account at the beginning of the year,' Wood said. 'I didn't. I was paying as I went, which meant I was paying a fee every time. The $2.50 transaction fee was the price of a lunch. So I'd pay for six lunches, but only get five.' The U.S. Department of Agriculture, which oversees the federal policy on fee-free school lunch, has mandated that districts inform families of their options since 2017, but even when parents are aware, having to pay by cash or check to avoid fees can be burdensome. 'It's just massively inconvenient,' said Joanna Roa, 43, who works at Clemson University in South Carolina as a library specialist and has two school-aged children. Roa said that when her son was in first grade and she saw the $3.25-per-transaction fee for lunch account transactions, she and her husband decided to send him to school with packed lunches instead. 'A dollar here and there, I expected,' she said. 'But $3.25 per transaction, especially here in rural South Carolina where the cost of living is a lot lower — as are the salaries — is a lot.' Roa said packing lunch for two kids every day, for two working parents, was an increased burden of time and effort. For the past two years, thanks to surplus funds, her school district has been providing free lunches in school, which has changed the equation, but Roa said that could end at any point. In its review of the 300 largest public school districts in the U.S., the CFPB found that 87% of sampled districts contract with payment processors. Within those districts, the companies charge an average of $2.37 or 4.4% of the total transaction, each time money is added to a child's account. For families with lower incomes who can't afford to load large sums in one go, those fees can hit weekly or even more frequently, increasing costs disproportionately. Families that qualify for free or reduced lunch pay as much as 60 cents per dollar in fees when paying for school lunches electronically, according to the report. In Wood's case, she researched the fees and learned about the USDA requirement to offer fee-free payment by cash or by check. When she pointed this out to the superintendent of her daughter's Massachusetts school district, the administrator said the lack of transparency was an oversight. To protest, Wood had planned to pay for her daughter's lunches in coins at the school office, together with other parents. But then the pandemic hit, changing, among other things, school lunch policy. In subsequent years, Wood became part of a campaign that successfully pushed for universal free school lunches in the state, but she continues to protest school processing fees for families. 'Even if lunch itself is free, if you want to buy something a la carte, or an extra lunch, or some other transaction, you still have to pay that fee,' Wood said. 'They take money from people who need it the most.' While payment companies maintain that school districts have the chance to negotiate fees and rates when they form their contracts, the CFPB found that complex company structures 'may insulate companies from competition and make school districts less likely to negotiate.' Just three companies — MySchoolBucks, SchoolCafe, and LINQ Connect — dominate the market, according to the report. Without the ability to choose which company to work with, 'families have fewer ways to avoid harmful practices,' the agency said, 'including those that may violate federal consumer protection law.' The companies named in the report did not respond to requests for comment. I'm a parent facing these fees. What can I do? Know that you always have a right to pay by cash or check, under federal policy. You can also request that your school district negotiate down the fees with their payment processing company, or request that the district cover the fees directly, which can give them leverage in negotiating a contract. If your school is located in a low-income area, you may also check whether your district qualifies for the Community Eligibility Provision, which would allow the school to provide free breakfast and lunch to all enrolled students. More information on the CEP is available at the U.S. Department of Agriculture's website.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-consumer-watchdog-finds-school-lunch-fees-taking-a-toll-on-parents-/7781142.html	2024-09-14T23:49:59-07:00	
Robot begins removing Fukushima nuclear plant’s melted fuel	tokyo — A long robot entered a damaged reactor at Japan's Fukushima nuclear power plant on Tuesday, beginning a two-week, high-stakes mission to retrieve for the first time a tiny amount of melted fuel debris from the bottom. The robot's trip into the Unit 2 reactor is a crucial initial step for what comes next — a daunting, decades-long process to decommission the plant and deal with large amounts of highly radioactive melted fuel inside three reactors that were damaged by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Specialists hope the robot will help them learn more about the status of the cores and the fuel debris. Here is an explanation of how the robot works, its mission, significance and what lies ahead as the most challenging phase of the reactor cleanup begins. What is the fuel debris? Nuclear fuel in the reactor cores melted after the magnitude 9.0 earthquake and tsunami in March 2011 caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear plant's cooling systems to fail. The melted fuel dripped down from the cores and mixed with internal reactor materials such as zirconium, stainless steel, electrical cables, broken grates and concrete around the supporting structure and at the bottom of the primary containment vessels. The reactor meltdowns caused the highly radioactive, lava-like material to spatter in all directions, greatly complicating the cleanup. The condition of the debris also differs in each reactor. Tokyo Electric Power Company Holdings, or TEPCO, which manages the plant, says an estimated 880 tons of molten fuel debris remains in the three reactors, but some experts say the amount could be larger. What is the robot's mission? Workers will use five 1.5-meter-long pipes connected in sequence to maneuver the robot through an entry point in the Unit 2 reactor's primary containment vessel. The robot itself can extend about 6 meters inside the vessel. Once inside, it will be maneuvered remotely by operators at another building at the plant because of the fatally high radiation emitted by the melted debris. The front of the robot, equipped with tongs, a light and a camera, will be lowered by a cable to a mound of melted fuel debris. It will then snip off and collect a bit of the debris — less than 3 grams). The small amount is meant to minimize radiation dangers. The robot will then back out to the place it entered the reactor, a roundtrip journey that will take about two weeks. The mission takes that long because the robot must make extremely precise maneuvers to avoid hitting obstacles or getting stuck in passageways. That has happened to earlier robots. TEPCO is also limiting daily operations to two hours to minimize the radiation risk for workers in the reactor building. Eight six-member teams will take turns, with each group allowed to stay maximum of about 15 minutes. What do officials hope to learn? Sampling the melted fuel debris is 'an important first step,' said Lake Barrett, who led the cleanup after the 1979 disaster at the U.S. Three Mile Island nuclear plant for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and is now a paid adviser for TEPCO's Fukushima decommissioning. While the melted fuel debris has been kept cool and has stabilized, the aging of the reactors poses potential safety risks, and the melted fuel needs to be removed and relocated to a safer place for long-term storage as soon as possible, experts say. An understanding of the melted fuel debris is essential to determine how best to remove it, store it and dispose of it, according to the Japan Atomic Energy Agency. Experts expect the sample will also provide more clues about how exactly the meltdown 13 years ago played out, some of which is still a mystery. The melted fuel sample will be kept in secure canisters and sent to multiple laboratories for more detailed analysis. If the radiation level exceeds a set limit, the robot will take the sample back into the reactor. 'It's the start of a process. It's a long, long road ahead,' Barrett said in an online interview. 'The goal is to remove the highly radioactive material, put it into engineered canisters ... and put those in storage.' For this mission, the robot's small tong can only reach the upper surface of the debris. The pace of the work is expected to pick up in the future as more experience is gained and robots with additional capabilities are developed. What's next? TEPCO will have to 'probe down into the debris pile, which is over a meter thick, so you have to go down and see what's inside,' Barrett said, noting that at Three Mile Island, the debris on the surface was very different from the material deeper inside. He said multiple samples from different locations must be collected and analyzed to better understand the melted debris and develop necessary equipment, such as stronger robots for future larger-scale removal. Compared to collecting a tiny sample for analysis, it will be a more difficult challenge to develop and operate robots that can cut larger chunks of melted debris into pieces and put that material into canisters for safe storage. There are also two other damaged reactors, Unit 1 and Unit 3, which are in worse condition and will take even longer to deal with. TEPCO plans to deploy a set of small drones in Unit 1 for a probe later this year and is developing even smaller 'micro' drones for Unit 3, which is filled with a larger amount of water. Separately, hundreds of spent fuel rods remain in unenclosed cooling pools on the top floor of both Unit 1 and 2. This is a potential safety risk if there's another major quake. Removal of spent fuel rods has been completed at Unit 3. When will the decommissioning be finished? Removal of the melted fuel was initially planned to start in late 2021 but has been delayed by technical issues, underscoring the difficulty of the process. The government says decommissioning is expected to take 30-40 years, while some experts say it could take as long as 100 years. Others are pushing for an entombment of the plant, as at Chernobyl after its 1986 explosion, to reduce radiation levels and risks for plant workers. That won't work at the seaside Fukushima plant, Barrett says. 'You're in a high seismic area, you're in a high-water area, and there are a lot of unknowns in those (reactor) buildings,' he said. 'I don't think you can just entomb it and wait.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/robot-begins-removing-fukushima-nuclear-plant-s-melted-fuel/7781166.html	2024-09-14T23:49:27-07:00	
Brazilian dog plays footvolley by passing, driving ball with his snout	rio de janeiro — Rio de Janeiro's main beaches bustle with commotion on sunny weekends. But activity ground to a near standstill on one stretch of sand. People held up their phones to record athletic feats they'd never before witnessed, or even imagined. The game? Footvolley, a combination of soccer and beach volleyball. The athlete? A 3-year-old border collie named Floki. Floki sparks wonder among bystanders because he hangs tough in a game that even humans struggle to get a handle on. Footvolley rules are essentially the same as beach volleyball, but with a slightly lower net and, like soccer, players are forbidden from using hands and arms. Floki springs up from the sand to drive the ball with his snout. He has become something of an internet sensation in Brazil, with hundreds of thousands of followers on Instagram and TikTok. Floki's owner, Gustavo Rodrigues, is a footvolley coach, but swears he didn't plan this. He had wanted an American Bully, a decidedly less sprightly breed. Floki came into Rodrigues' life instead and quickly revealed his potential when, at just 2 months old, he started jumping after birthday balloons. Rodrigues started Floki out on what's called 'altinha,' where a group standing in a circle juggles a soccer ball for as long as possible. In 2023, Floki made his debut in the much more complex, competitive game of footvolley — a hobby enjoyed by some Brazilian soccer stars after they retire, including World Cup winners Ronaldinho and Romario. Footvolley players need poise, agility, coordination, timing, finesse. Covering one side of the court between just two people means quick sprints back and forth on soft sand under the baking sun. It's no mean feat, but Floki was a natural. A star was born. 'He does things that even some professionals don't — like positioning on the court,' said Rodrigues, 26. 'Sometimes the ball goes from one side (of the court) to the other, and he doesn't keep his back turned to it. He turns toward the ball to always hit it straight on.' It's clear this high-energy pup lives for this game. Even resting under the shade of the beach's caipirinha bar, he was laser-focused on the action of the adjacent court's match. When playing, he barks at Rodrigues to pass him the ball and seems to at least understand the basic rules. At times, rather than passing back to Rodrigues for the third and final touch their opponents expect, he sneaks the ball over the net himself to score a point. Then he jumps into Rodrigues' arms to celebrate. One of the awestruck onlookers Sunday was Luiza Chioli, who had traveled to Rio from Sao Paulo. She already knew the famous Floki from TikTok, but hadn't expected front-row seats to watch him while sipping her gin and tonic. 'Seeing social media, we had thought it was just cuts, that they used the best takes,' said Chioli, 21. 'But we saw he played, performed the whole time, did really well. It's really cool.' As Floki's follower count has grown, partnerships and endorsement deals have come rolling in. Rodrigues and Floki live in the inland capital Brasilia, but often travel to Rio — footvolley's mecca — and other Brazilian states to show off his skills, do marketing appearances and create monetized social media content. Floki's Sunday began with almost an hour playing beside former footvolley champion Natalia Guitler, who's been called Queen of the Beach. Between attempts to film her doing a trick pass to him, he scampered for drinks of water or to dip in the ocean. By the end, both she and Floki were scrambling for shade. 'We're dead,' she said as she collapsed onto the sand next to a panting Floki. Someone passed her a phone to check out the best clips for her Instagram, where she has almost 3 million followers. 'Me and my bestie @dog_altinha playing footvolley,' she wrote in a later post showing their long rally, and which included her bicycle kicking the ball over the net. After a rest and another footvolley session, Floki headed to a more remote beach to do a marketing shoot for Farm, a fashion designer that's become the paragon of Rio's breezy tropical style, both in Brazil and abroad. Then Floki was on Instagram hyping a brand of dog popsicles, gnawing a banana-flavored one himself, and giving an altinha demonstration to mall shoppers. His evening stroll along Copacabana's beachside promenade showed him straining against his leash, still evidently bursting with his boundless energy. With their weekend marketing blitz in Rio over, Rodrigues and Floki would head back to Brasilia, where their influencer hustle takes a back seat to the hustle of playing competitive matches. They win about one in every three, Rodrigues said, and their opponents are always desperate to avoid being beaten by a dog. 'It generates talk, and people make fun,' said Rodrigues. 'No one likes to lose a point to him, so people play their hearts out against us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazilian-dog-plays-footvolley-by-passing-driving-ball-with-his-mouth/7781119.html	2024-09-14T23:48:51-07:00	
Nightlife now rules in Iraq's former IS bastion	Mosul, Iraq — If they had tried to do this a few years ago, the group of Iraqi women enjoying a night out in Mosul would probably have risked severe punishment. The northern city was under the harsh rule of the Islamic State group until the jihadists were ousted from their last major Iraqi bastion in 2017. Seven years later, Mosul's streets truly come alive at nightfall, and residents are rediscovering the art of having a good time. Amira Taha and her friends have come to a restaurant with their children, to enjoy food and live music -- complete with crooners -- on a night out that would have been unthinkable under IS rule. 'There has been enormous change in Mosul,' Taha tells AFP. 'We now have freedom and nights out like this have become common' because of 'the very stable security situation.' The city has new restaurants to go to, pleasure cruises on the river Tigris, and amusement parks that draw families keen to take advantage of the newfound stability. Dressed in an electric blue suit, the 35-year-old mother says 'people wanted to open up [to the world] and enjoy themselves.' Reign of terror On the stage, three Iraqi singers in suits and slicked-back hair take it in turns to entertain the diners with Iraqi and Arab pop songs. The orchestra includes an electric organist, a violinist, and a musician playing the darbouka, a goblet-shaped drum. When the jihadists took Mosul in 2014 they imposed a reign of sheer terror. Music was banned, as were cigarettes. Churches and museums were ransacked and IS staged public stonings and beheaded perceived wrongdoers. Even after Mosul was retaken in 2017 in a destructive and lengthy fight by Iraqi and international coalition forces, it took several years for its citizens to emerge from years of trauma. Entire neighborhoods were devastated, and reconstruction became a lengthy process. Mines had to be cleared before homes, infrastructure and roads could be rebuilt to allow hundreds of thousands of people to return to what is now a metropolis of 1.5 million people. In the past, Taha says, 'people would go home, shut their doors and then go to bed' because of fears over security. But now, all around her on the restaurant's lawns, families are seated at most of the tables. Sometimes the men and women puff on water pipes as their children clap and dance. Overlooking the restaurant is a brand-new bridge spanning the Tigris, a proud symbol of a Mosul being reborn. Taking a gamble Other cities in Iraq are in a similar situation, enjoying a return to normality after decades marked by war, sectarian violence, kidnappings, political conflict and jihadist extremism. Ahmed -- who goes by only his first name -- opened a restaurant called 'Chef Ahmed the Swede' in June, after spending 'half of my life' in Sweden and taking a gamble. Now he serves between 300 and 400 diners every day, Ahmed tells AFP. 'I'd always dreamt of coming back and starting my own business,' says the proprietor, who is in his 40s. 'People want to go out, they want to see something different,' he says. At Ahmed's, diners can choose from dishes inspired by Scandinavian and European cuisines, alongside old favorites such as pastas, pizzas and grilled meats. Khalil Ibrahim runs an amusement park on the banks of the river. 'The city has seen radical changes over the past few years,' he says. 'We've gone from destruction to reconstruction.' Friday is the first day of the weekend, and the evening is pierced by the happy shrieks and laughter of children in dodgem cars, the Ferris wheel and other attractions. 'People used to go home early,' Ibrahim tells AFP. 'But now they're still arriving even at midnight.' 'We can breathe' His park opened in 2011, but it was 'completely destroyed' in the war. 'We started again from scratch' with the help of private funding, he says. As Mosul was still emerging from its jihadist nightmare, another tragedy befell the city. In 2019 around 100 people, mostly women and children, died when a ferry taking families across the river to a leisure park capsized. But today, pleasure boats ply the Tigris by night, their passengers admiring the riverbank lights of the restaurants and their reflection in the dark waters. In small cafes, clients play dominoes or cards as they have a smoke. 'We're comfortable here. We can breathe. We have the river, and that's enough for us,' says day laborer Jamal Abdel Sattar. 'Some shops stay open until 3 in the morning, and some never close,' he adds. 'When people got their first taste of security, they began to go out again.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nightlife-now-rules-in-iraq-s-former-is-bastion/7784854.html	2024-09-14T22:33:35-07:00	
Storm, flooding death toll in Myanmar jumps to 74	Yangon, Myanmar — The death toll in Myanmar in the wake of Typhoon Yagi has jumped to 74, state media reported on Sunday, a day after its junta made a rare request for foreign aid. Floods and landslides have killed almost 350 people in Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand in the wake of Typhoon Yagi, which hit the region last weekend, according to official figures. In Myanmar, the floods 'resulted in 74 deaths and 89 people missing' as of Friday evening, the Global New Light of Myanmar said. Search and rescue operations were ongoing, it said, adding that the floods had destroyed more than 65,000 houses and five dams, heaping further misery on the country where war has raged since the military's 2021 coup. The junta's previous death toll was 33, with more than 235,000 people displaced, according to figures released Friday. Swathes of farmland have been inundated in central regions, including around the sprawling, low-lying capital Naypyidaw. There have been reports of landslides in hilly areas but with roads and bridges damaged and phone and internet lines down, compiling information has been difficult. The Sittaung and Bago rivers, which flow through central and southern Myanmar, were both still above dangerous levels Sunday, state media said, although water levels were expected to fall in the coming days. Authorities in Myanmar had opened 82 'relief camps' to house displaced people, according to state media. Thailand's weather office warned Sunday of further heavy rain in provinces along the Mekong river. Request for aid The floods have heaped more misery on Myanmar, where more than 2.7 million people have already displaced by conflict. Myanmar's junta chief made a rare request for foreign aid to deal with the floods, state media reported Saturday. The military has previously blocked or frustrated humanitarian assistance from abroad. Last year it suspended travel authorizations for aid groups trying to reach around a million victims of powerful Cyclone Mocha that hit the west of the country. On Saturday the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs (UNOCHA) in Myanmar and the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) told AFP they could not currently comment on the junta's request. Heavy monsoon rains lash Southeast Asia every year, but human-made climate change is causing more intense weather patterns that can make destructive floods more likely. Climate change is causing typhoons to form closer to the coast, intensify faster and stay longer over land, according to a study published in July.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-flooding-death-toll-in-myanmar-jumps-to-74/7784852.html	2024-09-14T22:02:56-07:00	
Italian prosecutors seek 6-year sentence for Salvini in migration case	rome — Italian prosecutors requested on Saturday a six-year prison sentence for Matteo Salvini, Italy's far-right deputy prime minister, for allegedly blocking migrants from disembarking at one of the country's ports in 2019. Salvini, a partner in Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's coalition, is on trial for alleged deprivation of liberty and abuse of office for keeping 147 migrants at sea for weeks on a ship run by the Open Arms charity. 'The prosecution has asked for former interior minister Salvini to be sentenced to six years,' Open Arms' lawyer Arturo Salerni told AFP, as the 'long and difficult trial' nears an end. A verdict in the trial, which began in October 2021, could come next month, he said. Salvini would be free to appeal any decision. Salvini was not present, but wrote on Facebook: 'Six years in prison for having blocked arrivals and defended Italy and Italians? Madness. Defending Italy is not a crime.' Meloni also criticized the prosecutors. 'It is incredible that a minister of the Italian Republic risks 6 years in prison for doing his job defending the nation's borders, as required by the mandate received from its citizens,' the prime minister wrote on X. In summing up, prosecutor Geri Ferrara told the Palermo court in Sicily that there was 'one key principle that is not debatable.' 'Between human rights and the protection of state sovereignty, it is human rights that must prevail in our fortunately democratic system,' he said. The ship was stuck at sea for nearly three weeks before the migrants were allowed to disembark on the island of Lampedusa following a court order. Members of Open Arms have testified that the migrants' physical and mental well-being reached a crisis point as sanitary conditions onboard became dire, including a scabies outbreak. Salvini, head of the anti-immigration League party and interior minister at the time, testified in January that he had understood that 'the situation was not at risk' onboard the ship. 'The POS (safe port) should have been provided immediately and without delay,' prosecutor Marzia Sabella said Saturday, according to Italian media reports. 'Refusing to do so was breaking the rules, not being in line with a government plan,' and Salvini's 'choices' had given rise to 'chaos,' she said. A populist known for an 'Italians first' policy, Salvini has repeatedly used attacks against illegal immigration to boost his political capital. In 2019, serving under prime minister Giuseppe Conte, he implemented a 'closed ports' policy under which Italy refused entry to charity ships that rescue migrants stranded while crossing the Mediterranean. He cast it as a tough measure against traffickers who operate boats between North Africa and Italy and Malta, the deadliest migrant crossing in the world. French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, also known for her anti-immigrant politics, offered Salvini a message of support on Saturday night, alleging he was the target of 'judicial harassment aimed at silencing him.' Salvini thanked her and promised not to 'give in.' Much of the trial has been focused on determining whether the decision-making and responsibility in the case lay with the Conte government or Salvini alone. Salvini has previously faced a similar trial, accused of refusing to allow 116 migrants to disembark from an Italian coast guard boat in July 2019. But it was thrown out by a court in Catania in 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-prosecutors-seek-6-year-sentence-for-salvini-in-migration-case/7784843.html	2024-09-14T20:19:51-07:00	
WHO flags limited mpox testing in epicenter DRC	Geneva, Switzerland — Limited capacity is keeping mpox testing coverage low in the DR Congo — the epicenter of the international emergency — the World Health Organization said Saturday in its latest situation report. 'Testing coverage in the Democratic Republic of the Congo remains low, due to limited testing capacity,' the United Nations health agency said in its update. It said the mpox case fatality ratio in the DRC in 2024 was 0.5% among confirmed cases — or 25 deaths from 5,160 cases — and 3.3% among suspected cases, both tested and untested — or 717 deaths among 21,835 cases. 'Due to limited access to laboratory testing in remote areas, only about 40% of all suspected cases have been tested in 2024 (up from 9% in 2023), and among these, around 55% tested positive,' the WHO said. It said the three countries reporting the most suspected cases in the year up to September 8 were the DRC, followed by Burundi (1,489 suspected cases, no deaths), and Nigeria (935 suspected cases, no deaths). There are two clades of mpox, each with a and b subclades. The WHO said the clades and their subclades were circulating in different geographic areas and were affecting different populations — and therefore needed 'tailored and locally adapted outbreak responses.' The WHO declared an international emergency over mpox on August 14, concerned by the surge in cases of the new Clade 1b strain in the DRC that spread to nearby countries. In the DRC, Clade 1b has been detected chiefly in the eastern South Kivu and North Kivu provinces, with additional cases in the Kinshasa capital province. Current sequencing capacity in the DRC 'is limited, and clade distribution might be broader than what is currently known' the WHO said. Clade 1b has also been detected in the DRC's eastern neighbors Burundi, Rwanda and Uganda, plus Kenya. Additionally, a single case has been detected in Sweden and another in Thailand. Looking at global vaccine availability, the WHO said more than 3.6 million doses had been pledged for the global response, including more than 620,000 doses of the MVA-BN vaccine by European countries, the United States and manufacturer Bavarian Nordic. Meanwhile Japan has pledged 3 million doses of the LC16 vaccine. To date, 265,000 MVA-BN doses have been delivered to Kinshasa, while 10,000 have gone to Nigeria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-flags-limited-mpox-testing-in-epicenter-drc-/7784829.html	2024-09-14T18:39:24-07:00	
Tunisia’s presidential campaign season begins a day after protests	TUNIS, Tunisia — The official start of the presidential campaign season in Tunisia began on Saturday, a day after Tunisians took their anger to the streets of the capital to decry what protesters say is the deteriorating state of the country. In what appeared to be the largest protest since authorities began a monthslong wave of arrests earlier this year, hundreds of Tunisians marched peacefully on Friday and called for an end to what they called a police state. 'We're here to say no and show that we don't all agree with what's really happening in the country,' Khaled Ben Abdeslam, a father and urban development consultant, told The Associated Press. In 2011, longtime Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali was toppled by nationwide protests that unleashed revolt across the Arab world. More than a decade later, Ben Abdelslam said he was worried about the growing number of political figures who've been thrown in jail under President Kais Saied and said he wants to ensure Tunisia 'turns the page' for the good of his kids. 'Nobody dares to say or do anything anymore today,' he said as protesters neared Tunisia's powerful Interior Ministry. He and other demonstrators slammed both Tunisia's economic and political woes, carrying signs that grouped together the growing costs of staple items and growing concerns about civil liberties. 'Where is sugar? Where is oil? Where is freedom? Where is democracy?' signs read. Some carried posters telling the government that 'human rights are not optional' while others revived the popular slogans that mobilized Tunisia's masses against Ben Ali. This time though, they directed scorn toward Saied. The protests capped off a week in which the North African country's largest opposition party, Ennahda, said its senior members had been arrested en masse, at a scale not previously seen. The arrests come as Saied prepares to campaign for reelection on October 6, when he will ask voters to grant him a second term. When first elected in 2019, Saied used anti-corruption promises to win over people disillusioned with the political controversies that plagued Tunisia's young democracy in the years that followed the Arab Spring. Since taking office, the 66-year-old former law professor has gone to lengths to consolidate his own power, freezing the country's parliament and rewriting the constitution. Throughout his tenure, authorities have arrested journalists, activists, civil society figures and political opponents across the ideological spectrum. And though he promised to chart a new course for the country, its unemployment rate has steadily increased to one of the region's highest at 16%, with young Tunisians hit particularly hard. The economy continues to face significant challenges, yet Saied has managed to energize supporters with populist rhetoric, often accusing migrants from sub-Saharan Africa of violence and crime and aiming at changing the country's demography. In the months leading up to his reelection bid, the political crackdown has expanded. His opponents have been arrested, placed under gag order or faced criminal investigations that observers have called politically motivated. Figures who said they planned to challenge him have been sentenced for breaking campaign finance laws. Others have been ruled ineligible to challenge him by Tunisia's election authority. Even those whom the authority approved have later faced arrest. Ayachi Zammel, a businessman planning to challenge Saied, was promptly arrested after being announced as one of the two candidates approved to appear on the ballot alongside Saied. His attorney, Abdessattar Messaoudi, told The Associated Press that she feared a court may bar him from politics for life as it had done to other Saied challengers. The Tunisian Network for the Defense of Rights and Freedoms — a newly formed coalition of civil society groups and political parties — organized Friday's protest to draw attention to what it called a surge of authoritarianism. Outrage swelled among many members of the network after the country's election authority — made up of Saied appointees — dismissed a court ruling ordering it to reinstate three challengers to Saied. The authority has defied judges who have ruled in favor of candidates who have appealed its decisions and pledged not to allow Mondher Zenaidi, Abdellatif El Mekki and Imed Daimi to appear on the ballot alongside Saied next month. Hajer Mohamed, a 33-year-old law firm assistant said that she and her friends are terrified about the direction Tunisia is heading in ways they couldn't have imagined when people rejoiced the freedoms won 13 years ago. 'We never thought that after the 2011 revolution we'd live to see the country's suffocating situation,' she said. 'Even under former dictator Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, the situation wasn't as scandalous as it is today.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tunisia-s-presidential-campaign-season-begins-a-day-after-protests/7784831.html	2024-09-14T18:35:28-07:00	
Shame must change sides' — France's rape plaintiff becomes feminist icon	Marseille, France — Walking into court each day with her head held high, the ex-wife of a Frenchman on trial for orchestrating multiple rapes of her in her own bed for almost a decade has become a feminist icon. With her now trademark auburn bob and dark glasses, 71-year-old Gisele Pelicot has become a figurehead in the battle against the use of drugs to commit sexual abuse. Her life was shattered in 2020 when she discovered that her partner of five decades had for years been secretly administering her large doses of tranquilizers to rape her and invite dozens of strangers to join him. But she has decided not to hide and demanded the trial of Dominique Pelicot, 71, and 50 co-defendants since September 2 be open to the public because, as she has said through one of her lawyers, it should be up to her alleged abusers — not her — to be ashamed. 'It's a way of saying ... shame must change sides,' her attorney Stephane Babonneau said as the trial opened. Since then, feminist activists have held up her stylized portrait by Belgian artist Aline Dessine, with the words 'Shame is changing sides,' to show support at protests. The artist with 2.5 million followers on TikTok has given up all rights to the image. Thousands protest Thousands protested in cities across France on Saturday in support of Gisele Pelicot and demanding an end to rape. 'Gisele for all, all for Gisele,' read one hand-drawn poster at a gathering in the southern city of Marseille. A day earlier, outside the courthouse in the southern town of Avignon, protester Nadege Peneau said she was full of admiration for the trial's main plaintiff. 'What she's doing is very brave,' she said. 'She's speaking up for so many children and women, and even men' who have been abused. Gisele Pelicot in August obtained a divorce from her husband, who has confessed to the abuse after meticulously documenting it with photos and videos. She has moved away from the southern town of Mazan where, in her own words, for years he treated her like 'a piece of meat' or a 'rag doll.' She now uses her maiden name, but during the trial has asked the media to use her former name as a married woman. Her lawyer Antoine Camus said she had transformed from a devoted wife and retiree, who loved walks and choir singing, into a woman ready for a battle. 'I will have to fight till the end,' she told the press on September 5, in her only public statement outside court in the first days of the four-month trial. 'Obviously it's not an easy exercise and I can feel attempts to trap me with certain questions,' she added calmly. Learning truth behind memory lapses She met Dominique Pelicot, her future husband and rapist, in 1971. She had dreamed of becoming a hairdresser but instead studied to be a typist. After a few years temping, she joined France's national electricity company EDF, ending her career in a logistics service for its nuclear power plants. At home, she looked after her three children and later seven grandchildren. Only when the police caught her husband filming up women's skirts in a supermarket in 2020 did she find out the true reason behind her troubling memory lapses. Camus, her lawyer, said his client 'never wanted to be a role model.' 'She just wants all this not to be in vain,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/shame-must-change-sides-france-s-rape-plaintiff-becomes-feminist-icon-/7784817.html	2024-09-14T17:54:22-07:00	
Boeing strike could last ‘a while’; workers confident of higher wages, union says	SEATTLE — A strike at Boeing 'could go on for a while' as workers are confident they can get bigger wage increases and an improved pension, union leader Jon Holden said in an interview with National Public Radio on Saturday. More than 30,000 members of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM), who produce Boeing's top-selling 737 MAX and other jets in the Seattle and Portland, began a strike Friday after overwhelmingly voting down a new contract. Boeing and union negotiators are to return to the bargaining table next week, in talks overseen by U.S. federal mediators, after more than 94% of workers voted to reject an initial contract offer that Holden had endorsed. Holden said the priorities for his members were a bigger wage increase and the restoration of a defined-benefit pension scheme that the union lost during a previous round of negotiations with Boeing a decade ago. 'We have the most leverage and the most power at the most opportune time that we've ever had in our history, and our members are expecting us to use it,' Holden told NPR. 'I know that our members are confident. They're standing shoulder to shoulder and they're ready. So it (the strike) could go on for a while,' he said. The initial deal included a 25% pay raise spread over four years and a commitment by Boeing to build its next commercial jet in the Seattle region, if the plane program is launched within the four-year period of the contract. Union members, venting frustration at years of stagnant wages and rising living costs, said removal of a performance bonus in the Boeing offer would erode half of the headline salary increase. Boeing's stock fell 3.7% on Friday. It has tumbled almost 40% so far this year, slashing the company's market value by roughly $58 billion. A long strike could further damage Boeing's finances, already groaning because of $60 billion in debt. A lengthy pause on plane production would also weigh on airlines that fly Boeing jets and suppliers that manufacture parts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/boeing-strike-could-last-a-while-workers-confident-of-higher-wages-union-says/7784821.html	2024-09-14T17:54:17-07:00	
NATO’s Bauer, others support Ukraine using long-range weapons against Russia	PRAGUE — The head of NATO's military committee said Saturday that Ukraine has the solid legal and military right to strike deep inside Russia to gain combat advantage — reflecting the beliefs of several U.S. allies — even as the Biden administration balks at allowing Kyiv to do so using American-made weapons. 'Every nation that is attacked has the right to defend itself. And that right doesn't stop at the border of your own nation,' said Admiral Rob Bauer, speaking at the close of the committee's annual meeting, also attended by U.S. Gen. CQ Brown, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Bauer, of Netherlands, also added that nations have the sovereign right to put limits on the weapons they send to Ukraine. But, standing next to him at a news briefing, Lt. General Karel Řehka, chief of the General Staff of the Czech Armed Forces, made it clear his nation places no such weapons restrictions on Kyiv. 'We believe that the Ukrainians should decide themselves how to use it,' Řehka said. Their comments came as U.S. President Joe Biden is weighing whether to allow Ukraine to use American-provided long-range weapons to hit deep into Russia. And they hint at the divisions over the issue. Biden met with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday, after this week's visit to Kyiv by their top diplomats, who came under fresh pressure to loosen weapons restrictions. U.S. officials familiar with discussions said they believed Starmer was seeking Biden's approval to allow Ukraine to use British Storm Shadow missiles for expanded strikes in Russia. Biden's approval may be needed because Storm Shadow components are made in the U.S. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to share the status of private conversations, said they believed Biden would be amenable, but there has been no decision announced yet. On Thursday Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that allowing long-range strikes 'would mean that NATO countries, the United States and European countries, are at war with Russia.' His remarks were in line with the narrative the Kremlin has promoted since early in the war, accusing NATO countries of de-facto participation in the conflict and threatening a response. Providing additional support and training for Ukraine was a key topic at the NATO chiefs' meeting, but it wasn't clear Saturday if the debate over the U.S. restrictions was discussed. Many of the European nations have been vigorously supportive of Ukraine in part because they worry about being the next victim of an empowered Russia. At the opening of the meeting, Czech Republic President Petr Pavel broadly urged the military chiefs gathered in the room to be 'bold and open in articulating your assessments and recommendations. The rounder and the softer they are, the less they will be understood by the political level.' The allies, he said, must 'take the right steps and the right decisions to protect our countries and our way of life.' The military leaders routinely develop plans and recommendations that are then sent to the civilian NATO defense secretaries for discussion and then on to the nations' leaders in the alliance. The U.S. allows Ukraine to use American-provided weapons in cross-border strikes to counter attacks by Russian forces. But it doesn't allow Kyiv to fire long-range missiles, such as the ATACMS, deep into Russia. The U.S. has argued that Ukraine has drones that can strike far and should use ATACMS judiciously because they only have a limited number. Ukraine has increased its pleas with Washington to lift the restrictions, particularly as winter looms and Kyiv worries about Russian gains during the colder months. 'You want to weaken the enemy that attacks you in order to not only fight the arrows that come your way, but also attack the archer that is, as we see, very often operating from Russia proper into Ukraine,' said Bauer. 'So militarily, there's a good reason to do that, to weaken the enemy, to weaken its logistic lines, fuel, ammunition that comes to the front. That is what you want to stop, if at all possible.' Brown, for his part, told reporters traveling with him to the meeting that the U.S. policy on long-range weapons remains in place. But, he added, 'by the same token, what we want to do is — regardless of that policy — we want to continue to make Ukraine successful with the capabilities that have been provided' by the U.S. and other nations in the coalition, as well as the weapons Kyiv has been able to build itself. 'They've proven themselves fairly effective in building out uncrewed aerial vehicles, in building out drones,' Brown told reporters traveling with him to meetings in Europe. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has made similar points, arguing that one weapons system won't determine success in the war. 'There are a number of things that go into the overall equation as to whether or not you know you want to provide one capability or another,' Austin said Friday. 'There is no silver bullet when it comes to things like this.' He also noted that Ukraine has already been able to strike inside Russia with its own internally produced systems, including drones.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-s-bauer-others-support-ukraine-using-long-range-weapons-against-russia/7784820.html	2024-09-14T17:42:06-07:00	
China's economy softens in August as Beijing grapples with lagging demand	BEIJING — China's economy softened in August, extending a slowdown in industrial activity and real estate prices as Beijing faces pressure to ramp up spending to stimulate demand. Data published by the National Bureau of Statistics Saturday showed weakening activity across industrial production, retail sales and real estate this month compared to July. 'We should be aware that the adverse impacts arising from the changes in the external environment are increasing,' said Liu Aihua, the bureau's chief economist in a news conference. Liu said that demand remained insufficient at home, and the sustained economic recovery still confronts multiple difficulties and challenges. China has been grappling with a lagging economy post-COVID, with weak consumer demand, persistent deflationary pressures and a contraction in factory activity. Chinese leaders have ramped up investment in manufacturing to rev up an economy that stalled during the pandemic and is still growing slower than hoped. Beijing also has to deal with increasing pressure to implement large-scale stimulus measures to boost economic growth. While industrial production rose by 4.5% in August compared to a year ago, it declined from July's 5.1% growth, according to the bureau's data released. Retail sales grew 2.1% from the same time last year, slower than the 2.7% increase last month. Fixed asset investment rose by 3.4% from January to August, down from 3.6% in the first seven months. Meanwhile, investment in real estate declined by 10.2% from January to August, compared to last year. The figures released Saturday come after trade data for August saw imports grow just 0.5% compared to a year ago. The consumer price index rose 0.6% in August, missing forecasts according to data released Monday. Officials attributed the higher CPI to an increase in food prices due to bad weather. But the core CPI, which excludes food and energy prices, rose by just 0.3% in August, the slowest in over three years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-economy-softens-in-august-as-beijing-grapples-with-lagging-demand/7784816.html	2024-09-14T17:12:33-07:00

Nigerian army rescues 13 hostages from extremist group	ABUJA, Nigeria — Nigerian troops have rescued 13 hostages who were kidnapped by an extremist group in the northwestern state of Kaduna, the country's army said on Saturday. The army said in a statement that 'the troops successfully overwhelmed the terrorists, forcing them to abandon their captives.' Several kidnappers were killed, and others were captured, the military added. It didn't specify which armed group the kidnappers belonged to. The rescued hostages were taken to a military facility for a medical assessment before being reunited with their families. Weapons, ammunition, solar panels and cash were also discovered during the rescue operation. Kidnappings have become common in parts of northern Nigeria, where dozens of armed groups take advantage of a limited security presence to carry out attacks in villages and along major roads. Most victims are released only after the payment of ransoms that sometimes run into the thousands of dollars. At least 1,400 students have been taken from Nigerian schools since the 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram militants in the village of Chibok in Borno state shocked the world. Boko Haram, Nigeria's homegrown jihadi rebels, launched its insurgency in 2009 to establish Islamic Shariah law in the country. At least 35,000 people have been killed and 2.1 million people displaced due to the extremist violence, according to United Nations agencies in Nigeria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-army-rescues-13-hostages-from-extremist-group-/7784577.html	2024-09-14T16:41:52-07:00

Ukraine: N. Korea's military aid to Russia presents battlefield problem	kyiv, ukraine — Ukraine's spy chief said Saturday that Russia's increased production of guided bombs as well as artillery ammunition deliveries from North Korea present major problems for Ukrainian forces on the battlefield. The head of Ukraine's military intelligence agency GUR, Kyrylo Budanov, said North Korean military aid to Russia presented the biggest concern compared to support provided by Moscow's other allies. 'They supply huge amounts of artillery ammunition, which is critical for Russia,' he said, pointing to the ramp up in the battlefield hostilities following such deliveries. Ukraine and the United States, among other countries and independent analysts, say North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is helping Russia in the war against Ukraine by supplying missiles and ammunition in return for economic and other military assistance from Moscow. Russia's boost in the production of guided bombs also presented a 'huge problem for the front line,' Budanov said at the Yalta European Strategy conference organized by the Victor Pinchuk Foundation in Kyiv. Ukraine's forces are stretched thin more than 30 months into the full-scale invasion, working to stave off Russian advance toward key towns in the country's east. Ukrainian forces have also made an incursion into the western Russian region of Kursk. A ramp up in the production of the Iskander-type missiles has resulted in Russia's 'massive use' of weapons to attack Ukraine, Budanov said. This year's strikes on Ukraine's critical infrastructure have caused significant damage to the country's power grid, leading to power cuts. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has renewed pleas for air defense support from Ukraine's allies. Budanov said Russian internal planning showed that Moscow will face a recruitment crunch in the middle of next year. 'During this period (summer 2025) they will face a dilemma: either to declare mobilization or to somehow reduce the intensity of hostilities, which may ultimately be critical for them,' Budanov said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-n-korean-military-aid-to-russia-present-major-battlefield-problem-/7784566.html	2024-09-14T16:10:17-07:00	
Biden to use rest of term putting Ukraine in 'best position,' says adviser	Kyiv, Ukraine — U.S. President Joe Biden will use the remaining four months of his term 'to put Ukraine in the best possible position to prevail,' a senior adviser said Saturday. Speaking remotely to a forum in Kyiv, Ukraine, Jake Sullivan, the U.S. national security adviser, also said Biden will meet Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in late September at the U.N. General Assembly in New York to discuss aid to Ukraine. 'President Zelenskyy has said that ultimately this war has to end through negotiations, and we need them to be strong in those negotiations,' Sullivan said, adding Ukraine would decide when to enter talks with Russia. Biden will be replaced next January either by Vice President Kamala Harris, who has indicated she will continue his policies of backing Ukraine, or by former President Donald Trump, who would not say at a debate earlier this week whether he wanted Kyiv to win the war. The announcement of the upcoming Biden-Zelenskyy meeting came after Moscow and Kyiv earlier Saturday swapped 103 prisoners of war each in a UAE-brokered deal, and as Russian forces continue to gain ground in their grinding offensive in east Ukraine. Sullivan, in his comments by video link to the forum in Kyiv, said 'difficult and complicated' logistics — rather than unwillingness — was delaying aid to Ukraine. 'It's not a matter of political will,' Sullivan said. 'But given what Ukraine is up against, we've got to do more, and we've got to do better.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-use-rest-of-term-putting-ukraine-in-best-position-says-adviser-/7784556.html	2024-09-14T15:16:35-07:00	
American, 2 Spaniards suspected of link to plan to destabilize Venezuela	Caracas, Venezuela — An American citizen and two Spaniards have been detained in Venezuela on suspicion of links to an alleged plan to destabilize the country, Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said Saturday, adding that hundreds of weapons were seized. The two Spanish nationals were recently detained in Puerto Ayacucho, Cabello told a press conference, adding that an American was also in custody on suspicion of planning to 'generate violence' and 'destabilize' Venezuela. He added that around 400 rifles originating in the United States had also been seized. The arrests come amid heightened tensions between Venezuela and both the U.S. and Spain over the disputed Venezuelan presidential election, which the country's opposition accuses incumbent strongman Nicolas Maduro of stealing. Earlier this week Caracas recalled its ambassador to Madrid for consultations and summoned Spain's envoy to Venezuela for talks after a Spanish minister accused Maduro of running a 'dictatorship.' Venezuela was also angered by the decision of Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez to meet with Venezuelan opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, who went into exile in Spain after being threatened with arrest by Maduro's regime. Caracas also has been engaged in a war of words with the United States, which recognized Gonzalez Urrutia as the winner of the July 28 poll. Maduro insists he won a third term but has failed to release detailed voting tallies to back his claim. Washington on Thursday announced new sanctions against 16 Venezuelan officials, including some from the electoral authority, for impeding 'a transparent electoral process' and not publishing accurate results. Venezuela denounced the measures as a 'crime of aggression' and Maduro decorated four military officers among those targeted by the sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7784547.html	2024-09-14T14:40:16-07:00	
Fuel truck explodes in Haiti, killing at least 16, seriously wounding 40	PORT-AU-PRINCE, haiti — A fuel truck exploded on a road in Haiti's southern peninsula Saturday, killing at least 16 people and leaving 40 survivors with serious burns, officials said. Haiti Prime Minister Garry Conille said emergency teams were working to 'save the lives of the seriously injured' after the incident, which occurred in the morning near the coastal city of Miragoane in the department of Nippes. 'The government stands in solidarity with all the victims and their families,' Conille said in a social media post. Authorities in Nippes said 16 bodies were completely charred and unrecognizable. A witness to the incident said the truck's gas tank had been punctured by another vehicle, and people rushed to the site to collect fuel. 'There were a lot of people. Those who were close to the truck got pulverized,' said the man, who did not give his name, in a video interview with local outlet Echo Haiti Media. When asked how many people might have been killed in the blast, he said it was difficult to say. 'You can't know, because there were a lot of people, bystanders and those collecting oil. There were a lot of people,' he said. Fuel deliveries to the Miragoane area have slowed in recent weeks as trucks were transported via ferry to avoid gang-controlled highways surrounding the capital of Port-au-Prince. The spread of gangs in the capital and surrounding areas has fueled a humanitarian crisis with mass displacements, sexual violence, child recruitment and widespread hunger. A state of emergency is now in place nationwide. Haiti's civil protection agency reported the identities of a 31-year-old man and two 23-year-old men who suffered burns over 89% of their bodies, and were being treated in a hospital in Les Cayes, in southern Haiti. Two of them sustained second-degree burns, the agency said. A similar incident in 2021 in the city of Cap-Haitien killed at least 60 people, after people were also thought to have been attempting to take fuel from a tanker truck.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fuel-truck-explodes-in-haiti-killing-at-least-16-seriously-wounding-40-/7784544.html	2024-09-14T13:59:34-07:00

Japan, US face ‘shared challenge’ from China steel, PM hopeful says	TOKYO — Japan and the United States should avoid confrontation about the steel industry and work together amid competition from China, the world's top steelmaker, leading prime ministerial candidate Shinjiro Koizumi said Saturday. Sources told Reuters Friday that a powerful U.S. national security panel reviewing Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel faces a September 23 deadline to recommend whether the White House should block the deal. Koizumi, Japan's former environment minister, said at a debate Saturday that Japan and the U.S. should not confront each other when it comes to the steel industry but to face together the 'shared challenge' coming from China's steel industry. 'If China, producing cheap steel without renewable or clean energy, floods the global market, it will most adversely affect us, the democratic countries playing by fair market rules,' Koizumi said. Nippon Steel's key negotiator on the deal, Vice Chairman Takahiro Mori, said last month that his company and other Japanese steelmakers were urging Tokyo to consider curbing cheap steel imports coming from China to protect the local market. On Sunday, Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel sent a letter to U.S. President Joe Biden about their deal, as Biden, Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump have all opposed the merger. 'We are also in the midst of elections, just like the U.S., and during elections, various ideas may arise. Overreacting to each of these would, in my view, call into question diplomatic judgment,' Koizumi said when asked about the deal. Sanae Takaichi, Japan's minister in charge of economic security and another prime ministerial candidate, also defended the deal during the same debate attended by eight other Liberal Democratic Party's, or LDP, leadership contenders Saturday. 'It appears they are using CFIUS to frame this as an economic security issue,' she said, referring to the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. 'However, Japan and the U.S. are allies, and the steel industry is about strengthening our combined resilience.' The 43-year-old son of former Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi, the junior Koizumi, is seen as a leading contender in the September 27 race to pick the LDP's new leader, who will become the next prime minister due to the party's control of parliament. Koizumi said Saturday that he would seek a dialog with the North Korean leadership to resolve the issue over the abduction of Japanese citizens kidnapped by North Korean agents in the 1970s and 1980s. The purported primary goal was to train North Korean agents to impersonate Japanese people. 'We want to explore new opportunities for dialog between people of the same generation, without being bound by conventional approaches, and without preconditions,' Koizumi said. After admitting in 2002 that it had abducted 13 Japanese, North Korea apologized and allowed five to return home. It said eight others had died and denied that an additional four entered its territory. It promised to reinvestigate but has never announced the results. Japan says North Korea has refused to send the others home because of concern that they might reveal inconvenient information about the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-us-face-shared-challenge-from-china-steel-pm-hopeful-says/7784444.html	2024-09-14T10:53:01-07:00	
Thousands attend rally organized by Poland's nationalist opposition party	WARSAW, Poland — Thousands of people attended an antigovernment rally organized by Poland's nationalist conservative opposition party to boost support before next year's presidential election. Law and Justice leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski called on supporters to be active at social and political levels and to back the party’s candidate in next year’s presidential election. He hasn't yet named the candidate. Kaczynski also accused the pro-European Union government of acting against the nation’s interests and violating its laws and cited recently opened investigations into allegations of mismanagement and corruption of the Law and Justice government. Up to 4,000 people with national white-and-red flags gathered for the rally held in windy weather outside the Justice Ministry in Warsaw, which has become a symbol of years of deep rifts between the backers of Kaczynski and Donald Tusk, now the prime minister and leader of the center-right Civic Platform party. Law and Justice, which governed Poland for from 2015 until 2023, drew criticism from Brussels and Tusk alike for making changes to Poland’s judicial system that were deemed undemocratic. Many in the nation of 38 million people were also tired of the aggressive and divisive language that Kaczynski, who dictated the government's policies from the sidelines, used to energize support. The party lost power in the 2023 election, but is still exerting control through President Andrzej Duda, who is allied with Law and Justice. Duda, whose second and last term runs out in August, has been blocking many of the government's draft laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-attend-rally-organized-by-poland-s-nationalist-opposition-party/7784439.html	2024-09-14T10:38:42-07:00	
Sudanese city pounded as analysts report 'unprecedented' combat	Port Sudan, Sudan — Heavy fighting on Saturday shook a Sudanese city besieged by paramilitaries, witnesses told AFP, as U.S. researchers reported unprecedented and escalating combat in the North Darfur state capital. El-Fasher is one of five state capitals in Sudan's western Darfur region and the only one not in the hands of the Rapid Support Forces, or RSF, who have been battling the regular army since April 2023. The United Nations says the war across much of Sudan has created the world's largest displacement crisis, with millions uprooted, and has led to famine at a displacement camp near El-Fasher. Darfur has seen some of the war's worst atrocities, and the RSF has besieged El-Fasher since May. 'Neighborhoods are completely deserted and all you can hear are explosions and missiles,' Ibrahim Ishaq, 52, told AFP. 'The central market area has become unlivable because of the intensity of the explosions,' said Ishaq, who fled westward from the city on Friday. Witnesses reported army bombardment south and east of the city on Saturday and said they heard air-defense batteries firing. The Yale School of Public Health's Humanitarian Research Lab said in a report Friday that its analysis confirmed 'unprecedented large-scale combat operations' in El-Fasher within the previous 10 days, 'with significant escalation in the past 36 hours' involving the army and the paramilitaries. It cited reports that describe 'a major multidirectional RSF attack from the northern, eastern, and southern directions' on Thursday. Reduced to rubble Darfur Governor Mini Minawi had on Thursday said on social media platform X that the army had repelled 'a large attack' by the RSF. The paramilitaries, however, said they seized military sites in El-Fasher. Using satellite imagery and other data, the Yale researchers said they found munition impacts 'likely related to high-tempo aerial bombardment' from the regular army, but they said other structural damage resulted from 'RSF bombardment' and combat activity by both sides. Whatever the battle's ultimate outcome, current levels of fighting 'are likely to effectively reduce what is left of El-Fasher to rubble,' the Yale study said. The United States special envoy for Sudan, Tom Perriello, on Saturday said on social media platform X: 'We are extremely concerned about the RSF's renewed attacks.' He urged the RSF 'to stop its assault.' It was not immediately possible to determine the number of victims. Sudan's war has already killed tens of thousands of people, with some estimates as high as 150,000, according to Perriello. Strikes near Khartoum In the capital, Khartoum, on Saturday, about 800 kilometers from El-Fasher, witnesses reported heavy explosions and strikes to the city's south. Independent United Nations experts earlier this month appealed for deployment of an 'impartial force' to be urgently deployed in Sudan for civilian protection. Sudan's foreign ministry, loyal to the army, rejected the idea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudanese-city-pounded-as-analysts-report-unprecedented-combat/7784432.html	2024-09-14T10:27:31-07:00	
Ballerina DePrince, whose career inspired many after she was born into war, dies at 29	FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida — Ballet dancer Michaela Mabinty DePrince, who came to the United States from an orphanage in war-ravaged Sierra Leone and performed on some of the world's biggest stages, has died, her family said in a statement. She was 29. 'Michaela touched so many lives across the world, including ours. She was an unforgettable inspiration to everyone who knew her or heard her story,' her family said in a statement posted Friday on DePrince's social media accounts. 'From her early life in war-torn Africa, to stages and screens across the world, she achieved her dreams and so much more.' A cause of death was not provided. DePrince was adopted by an American couple and by age 17 she had been featured in a documentary film and had performed on the TV show 'Dancing with the Stars.' After graduating from high school and the American Ballet Theatre’s Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis School, she became a principal dancer with the Dance Theatre of Harlem. She then went to the Netherlands, where she danced with the Dutch National Ballet. She later returned to the U.S. and joined the Boston Ballet in 2021. 'We’re sending our love and support to the family of Michaela Mabinty DePrince at this time of loss,' the Boston Ballet said in a statement to The Associated Press on Saturday. 'We were so fortunate to know her; she was a beautiful person, a wonderful dancer, and she will be greatly missed by us all.' In her memoir, Taking Flight: From War Orphan to Star Ballerina, she shared her journey from the orphanage to the stage. She also wrote a children's book, Ballerina Dreams. DePrince suffered from a skin pigmentation disorder that had her labeled 'the devil’s child' at the orphanage. 'I lost both my parents, so I was there [the orphanage] for about a year, and I wasn’t treated very well because I had vitiligo,' DePrince told the AP in a 2012 interview. 'We were ranked as numbers, and number 27 was the least favorite and that was my number, so I got the least amount of food, the least amount of clothes and whatnot.' She added that she remembered seeing a photo of an American ballet dancer on a magazine page that had blown against the gate of the orphanage during Sierra Leone's civil war. 'All I remember is she looked really, really happy,' DePrince told the AP, adding that she wished 'to become this exact person.' She said she saw hope in that photo, 'and I ripped the page out and I stuck it in my underwear because I didn’t have any place to put it,' she said. Her passion helped inspire young Black dancers to pursue their dreams, her family said. 'We will miss her and her gorgeous smile forever and we know you will, too,' their statement said. Her sister, Mia Mabinty DePrince, recalled in the statement that they slept on a shared mat in the orphanage and used to make up their own musical theater plays and ballets. 'When we got adopted, our parents quickly poured into our dreams and arose the beautiful, gracefully strong ballerina that so many of you knew her as today. She was an inspiration,' Mia DePrince wrote. 'Whether she was leaping across the stage or getting on a plane and flying to third-world countries to provide orphans and children with dance classes, she was determined to conquer all her dreams in the arts and dance.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ballerina-deprince-whose-career-inspired-many-after-she-was-born-into-war-dies-at-29/7784422.html	2024-09-14T10:15:48-07:00	
Syria's president asks former minister to form new government	BEIRUT — Syrian President Bashar Assad issued a decree Saturday in which he named former Communications Minister Mohammed Ghazi Jalali as the head of the new government following July’s parliamentary election, state media reported. Jalali, 55, has been under European Union sanctions since October 2014 over the government crackdown during Syria’s conflict that has left nearly half a million people dead since 2011. As a government minister, he was 'collectively responsible for the regime’s violent repression against the civilian population,' the EU said at the time of announcing the sanctions. Jalali was communications minister for nearly two years starting in August 2014, according to the state news agency SANA. Syria’s outgoing government has been in a caretaker capacity since the mid-July parliamentary election. It's not clear how long it will take Jalali to form a new Cabinet. The EU first started imposing sanctions on Syria in 2011. The measures also include a ban on oil imports, investment restrictions, a freeze on central bank assets held in the EU, and export limits on equipment and technology that could be used to crack down on civilians or to monitor their phones and internet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-president-asks-former-minister-to-form-new-government/7784416.html	2024-09-14T10:04:24-07:00	
Iran says it is open to talks but rejects pressure from US, EU	DUBAI — Iran's foreign minister said that Tehran was open to diplomacy to solve disputes but not 'threats and pressure,' state media reported on Saturday, after the U.S. and three European powers imposed sanctions against the country's aviation sector. Abbas Araqchi's comments come a day after the European Union's chief diplomat said the bloc is considering new sanctions targeting Iran's aviation sector, in reaction to reports Tehran supplied Russia with ballistic missiles in its war against Ukraine. 'Iran continues on its own path with strength, although we have always been open to talks to resolve disputes ... but dialogue should be based on mutual respect, not on threats and pressure,' Araqchi said, according to the official news agency IRNA. Araqchi said on Wednesday that Tehran had not delivered any ballistic missiles to Russia and that sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and three European powers would not solve any problems between them. The United States, Germany, Britain and France on Tuesday imposed new sanctions on Iran, including measures against its national airline, Iran Air.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-it-is-open-to-talks-but-rejects-pressure-from-us-eu/7784405.html	2024-09-14T09:56:36-07:00	
Algerian court certifies Tebboune's landslide reelection win	ALGIERS, Algeria — Algeria's constitutional court on Saturday certified the landslide victory of President Abdelmadjid Tebboune in last weekend's election after retabulating vote counts that he and his two opponents had called into question. The court said that it had reviewed local voting data to settle questions about irregularities that Tebboune’s opponents had alleged in two appeals Monday. 'After verification of the minutes of the regions and correction of the errors noted in the counting of the votes,' it had lowered Tebboune's vote share and determined that his two opponents had won hundreds of thousands more votes than previously reported, said Omar Belhadj, the constitutional court's president. The court's decision makes Tebboune the official winner of the September 7 election. His government will next decide when to inaugurate him for a second term. The court's retabulated figures showed Tebboune leading Islamist challenger Abdellali Hassan Cherif by around 75 percentage points. With 7.7 million votes, the first-term president won 84.3% of the vote, surpassing the 2019 win by millions of votes and a double-digit margin. Cherif, running with the Movement of Society for Peace, won nearly 950,000 votes, or roughly 9.6%. The Socialist Forces Front's Youcef Aouchiche won more than 580,000 votes, or roughly 6.1%. Notably, both challengers surpassed the threshold required to receive reimbursement for campaign expenses. Under its election laws, Algeria pays for political campaigns that receive more than a 5% vote share. The results announced by the election authority last week showed Cherif and Aouchiche with 3.2% and 2.2% of the vote, respectively. Both were criticized for participating in an election that government critics denounced as a way for Algeria's political elite to make a show of democracy amid broader political repression. Throughout the campaign, each of the three campaigns emphasized participation, calling on voters and youth to participate and defy calls to boycott the ballot. The court announced nationwide turnout was 46.1%, surpassing the 2019 presidential election, when 39.9% of the electorate participated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/algerian-court-certifies-tebboune-s-landslide-reelection-win/7784401.html	2024-09-14T09:47:50-07:00	
US historian leads Kyiv charity run highlighting plight of Ukrainian POWs	KYIV, Ukraine — U.S. historian and author Timothy Snyder led a charity run in Kyiv Saturday to raise awareness of the conditions under which Ukrainian prisoners of war are held in Russia as the conflict approaches a third winter. The race came following a recent escalation in Russian missile and drone attacks, largely aimed at Ukraine's electricity infrastructure. People clapped and cheered after Snyder, a 55-year-old Yale University professor who has written extensively on eastern Europe and the global resurgence of authoritarian regimes and is much admired in Ukraine, addressed the nearly thousand runners. He then joined a workout and participated in the run. 'Thousands of Ukrainian civilians and soldiers are illegally held in captivity during an illegal war,' Snyder told The Associated Press just ahead of the run. 'This race is about reminding everyone of that and expressing solidarity with Ukrainians and giving Ukrainians a chance to do something together.' The 5K and 10-kilometer runs took place around a sprawling park in the Ukrainian capital created out of a renovated Soviet-era exhibition center. The runners included members of the public, service people and veterans, as well as wives of the POWs. Among them was 27-year-old Anastasia Ofyl, whose husband Oleksandr was captured by the Russians. 'We have to fight for him,' she said. 'That’s why I’m running.' Ukrainian soldiers often give harrowing accounts of their conditions in Russian captivity when they return home as part of regular prisoner exchanges. In a report issued in July, a United Nations human rights agency said it 'continued to document the widespread use of torture and ill-treatment, including sexual violence, against civilians and Ukrainian prisoners of war held by the Russian Federation.' Snyder, who has organized fundraisers as part of the country’s war-relief effort, enjoys near-celebrity status in Ukraine. On Tuesday, he visited President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who thanked him for his charity work. The Ukrainian head of state also received former U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and the American actor Michael Douglas this week. After Saturday’s race, Snyder was surrounded by admirers, many of whom waited in line for autographs and selfies. Some asked the historian to sign translated copies of his widely read books on Ukraine, 'Bloodlands: Europe between Hitler and Stalin' and 'The Road to Unfreedom: Russia, Europe, America.' Saturday’s race was organized by the Kyiv School of Economics’ charity foundation which, according to its website, has been raising funds for charitable assistance for Ukrainians since the start of the Russian invasion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-historian-leads-kyiv-charity-run-highlighting-plight-of-ukrainian-pows-/7784364.html	2024-09-14T09:06:58-07:00	
Salvagers again attempt to tow tanker damaged by Houthi rebels	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — A new attempt has begun to try to salvage an oil tanker burning in the Red Sea after attacks by Yemen’s Houthi rebels, a European Union naval mission said Saturday. The EU’s Operation Aspides published images dated Saturday of its vessels escorting three ships heading to the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion. The mission has 'been actively involved in this complex endeavor, by creating a secure environment, which is necessary for the tugboats to conduct the towing operation,' the EU said. A phone number for the mission rang unanswered Saturday. However, satellite images taken Saturday morning by Planet Labs PBC and later analyzed by The Associated Press showed what appeared to be the three salvage vessels close to the Sounion. A warship could be seen nearby. The Sounion came under attack from the Houthis beginning Aug. 21. The vessel had been staffed by a crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, who were taken by a French destroyer to nearby Djibouti. The Houthis later planted explosives aboard the ship and detonated them. That’s led to fears the ship’s 1 million barrels of crude oil could spill into the Red Sea. The Houthis have targeted more than 80 vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that also killed four sailors. One of the sunken vessels, the Tutor, went down after the Houthis planted explosives aboard it and after its crew abandoned it due to an earlier attack, the rebel group later acknowledged. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/salvagers-again-attempt-to-tow-tanker-damaged-by-houthi-rebels/7784361.html	2024-09-14T08:56:40-07:00

5 dead in Romania as central Europe braces for severe flooding	BUCHAREST, Romania — Five people in eastern Romania were found dead after torrential rainstorms dumped unprecedented rain, leaving hundreds stranded in flooded areas, emergency authorities said Saturday. Rescue services scrambled to save people in the hard-hit eastern counties of Galati and Vaslui. The bodies of three elderly women and two men were found in the localities of Pechea, Draguseni, Costache Negri and Corod, the Department for Emergency Situations said. Authorities later added that one of the victims had been dead for two days and 'did not die due to the effects of the weather' but from other causes. Emergency authorities released video footage showing teams of rescuers evacuating people using small lifeboats through muddy waters and carrying some elderly people to safety. Some of the most significant flood damage was concentrated in Galati, where 5,000 households were affected. A Black Hawk helicopter was also deployed there to help with the search and rescue. The storms battered 19 localities in eight counties in Romania, with strong winds downing dozens of trees that damaged cars and blocked roads and traffic. Authorities sent text message alerts to residents to warn them of adverse weather as emergency services rushed to remove floodwaters from homes. By 1 p.m. Saturday, more than 250 people had been evacuated with the help of 700 Interior Ministry personnel deployed to affected communities, authorities said. Romania’s environment minister, Mircea Fechet, told The Associated Press that in some of the badly flooded areas, more than 160 liters of rain fell per one square meter, which he said is a rare occurrence. 'What we are trying to do right now is save as many lives as possible,' said the minister, who was on his way to Galati to assess the situation. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis offered his condolences to the victims' families, writing on Facebook: 'We must continue to strengthen our capacity to anticipate extreme weather phenomena. 'Severe floods that have affected a large part of the country have led to loss of lives and significant damage,' Iohannis said. 'We are again dealing with the effects of climate change, which are increasingly present throughout the European continent, with dramatic consequences on people.' Central Europe braces for intense flooding The stormy weather comes as several central European nations anticipate severe flooding to hit the Czech Republic, Poland, Austria, Germany, Slovakia and Hungary over the weekend. In the Czech Republic, river waters reached dangerous levels in dozens of areas across the country Saturday morning, flooding houses and roads in several towns and villages. Heavy rain and high winds left more than 63,000 households without power, the Czech power company CEZ said. A hospital in the country's second-largest city of Brno was forced to evacuate as dozens of citizens moved to safer grounds. Fallen trees and floodwaters caused a dozen railways across the country to also shutter. In neighboring Austria, authorities declared 24 villages in the northeast Lower Austria province disaster zones Saturday afternoon and began evacuating residents from those areas. 'The coming hours will be the hours of truth for flood protection, for our emergency forces and numerous compatriots,' State Governor Johanna Mikl-Leitner said, adding that in one area, 'we expect challenges of historical dimensions.' The torrential downpours have also caused a sharp rise in water levels on the Danube River in Austria's capital, Vienna, where special flood relief channels were built in the 1970s and ’80s and are likely to be tested over the weekend. The River Kamp, a tributary of the Danube, is also swelling due to the unprecedented weather. Heavy rain also hit Moldova on Saturday, where emergency workers pumped floodwater from dozens of peoples’ homes in several localities, authorities said. Meteorologists say a low-pressure system from northern Italy was predicted to dump much rain in most parts of the Czech Republic, including the capital and border regions with Austria and Germany in the south, and Poland in the north. 'We have to be ready for worst-case scenarios,' Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala said after the government’s central crisis committee met. 'A tough weekend is ahead of us.' In Poland, dozens of people were evacuated as a precautionary measure Saturday from two villages near the town of Nysa, in the Nysa River basin, after meteorologists warned of unprecedented rainfall, and water levels on some rivers in the area sharply rose, according to Interior Minister Tomasz Siemoniak. 'The worst is yet to come,' he warned. Polish authorities appealed to residents Friday to stock up on food and to prepare for power outages by charging power banks. The weather change arrived following a hot start to September in the region. Scientists have documented Earth’s hottest summer, breaking a record set just one year ago. A hotter atmosphere, driven by human-caused climate change, can lead to more intense rainfall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-romania-as-central-europe-braces-for-severe-flooding/7784322.html	2024-09-14T08:03:31-07:00	
Immigration takes center stage in debate, but no major proposals from candidates	When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump faced each other on the debate stage less than two months before Election Day, the two candidates were at odds on issues ranging from the economy to tariffs and Ukraine. But on immigration, their positions were especially different.

Prince Harry turns 40 as the royal scamp moves to middle age	LONDON — Prince Harry was always something different. From the moment he first appeared in public, snuggled in Princess Diana’s arms outside the London hospital where he was born in 1984, Harry was the ginger-haired scamp who stuck his tongue out at photographers. He grew to be a boisterous adolescent who was roundly criticized for wearing a Nazi uniform to a costume party, and then a young man who gave up the trappings of royal life and moved to Southern California with his American wife. Through it all, there was a sense that Harry was rebelling against an accident of birth that made him, in the harsh calculus of the House of Windsor, just 'the spare.' As the second son of the man who is now King Charles III, he was raised as a prince but wouldn’t inherit the throne unless brother William came to harm. Now the angry young man is turning 40, the halfway point in many lives, providing a chance to either dwell on the past or look forward to what might still be achieved. For the past four years, Harry has focused mainly on the past, making millions of dollars by airing his grievances in a wildly successful memoir and a Netflix docu-series. But he faces the likelihood that the royal aura so critical to his image may be fading, said Sally Bedell Smith, author of 'Charles: The Passions and Paradoxes of an Improbable Life.' 'He is at a sort of crossroads,’’ Smith told The Associated Press. 'And he appears to be struggling with how he wants to proceed.’’ How did we get here? It wasn’t always this way. Six years ago, Harry and his wife were among the most popular royals, a glamorous young couple who reflected the multicultural face of modern Britain and were expected to help revitalize the monarchy. Their wedding on May 19, 2018, united a grandson of Queen Elizabeth II with the former Meghan Markle, a biracial American actress who had starred for seven years in the U.S. television drama 'Suits.' George Clooney, Serena Williams and Elton John attended their wedding at Windsor Castle, after which the couple were formally known as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. But the optimism quickly faded amid allegations that Britain’s tabloid media and even members of the royal household treated Meghan unfairly because of racism. By January 2020, the pressures of life in the gilded cage had become too much, and the couple announced they were giving up royal duties and moving to America, where they hoped to become 'financially independent.' They signed lucrative deals with Netflix and Spotify as they settled into the wealthy enclave of Montecito, near Santa Barbara, California. Since then, Harry has missed few opportunities to bare his soul, most famously in his memoir, aptly titled 'Spare.' In the ghostwritten book, Harry recounted his grief at the death of Princess Diana, a fight with Prince William and his unease with life in the royal shadow of his elder brother. From accounts of cocaine use and losing his virginity to raw family rifts, the book was rife with damning allegations about the royal family. Among the most toxic was Harry’s description of how some family members leaked unflattering information about other royals in exchange for positive coverage of themselves. The prince singled out his father’s second wife, Queen Camilla, accusing her of feeding private conversations to the media as she sought to rehabilitate an image tarnished by her role in the breakup of Charles’ marriage to Diana. The allegations were so venomous that there is little chance of a return to public duty, Smith said. 'He criticized the royal family in such a powerful and damaging way. You can’t un-say those things,' she said. 'And you can’t unsee things like Meghan in that Netflix series doing a mock curtsey. It’s such a demeaning gesture to the queen.’’ Harry, who agreed not to use the honorific HRH, or 'his royal highness,' after he stepped away from front-line royal duties, is now fifth in line to the British throne, behind his brother and William’s three children. While he grew up in a palace and is said to be in line to inherit millions of dollars on his 40th birthday from a trust set up by his great-grandmother, applied developmental psychologist Deborah Heiser thinks that, in many ways, Harry is just like the rest of us. Like anyone turning 40, he is likely to have learned a few lessons and has a good idea of who his real friends are, and that will help him chart the next phase of his life, said Heiser, who writes a blog called 'The Right Side of 40' for Psychology Today. 'He has had a very public display of what a lot of people have gone through,' Heiser said. 'I mean, most people are not princes, but … they have all kinds of issues within their families. He’s not alone. That’s why he’s so relatable.’’ Harry's next chapter Of course, Harry’s story isn’t just about the drama within the House of Windsor. If he wants to write a new chapter, Harry can build on his 10 years of service in the British Army. Before retiring as a captain in 2015, the prince earned his wings as a helicopter pilot, served two tours in Afghanistan and shed the hard-partying reputation of his youth. Harry also won accolades for establishing the Invictus Games in 2014, a Paralympic-style competition to inspire and aid in the rehabilitation of sick and wounded servicemembers and veterans. Harry and Meghan made headlines this year with their two international trips to promote mental health and internet safety. While some in British media criticized them for accepting royal treatment in Nigeria and Colombia, the couple said they visited at the invitation of local officials. Will Charles see the grandkids? The prospects of reconciliation are unclear, although Harry did race home to see his father after Charles' cancer diagnosis. And in what may be seen as a tentative olive branch, the paperback edition of 'Spare' slated for October has no additions — so nothing new to stir the pot. But plainly at this point, Harry is thinking about his family in California. He told the BBC about the importance of his two young children, Archie and Lilibet. 'Being a dad is one of life’s greatest joys and has only made me more driven and more committed to making this world a better place,' the prince said in a statement released by his spokesperson.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prince-harry-turns-40-as-the-royal-scamp-moves-to-middle-age/7784290.html	2024-09-14T07:31:55-07:00	
Russia, Ukraine exchange 206 prisoners in second swap in two days	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russia and Ukraine conducted a major exchange of prisoners Saturday, 206 in all, in their second such swap in two days, following negotiations mediated by the United Arab Emirates, officials said. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that all 103 Ukrainians returned were from the military — 82 soldiers and privates and 21 officers. The Russian Defense Ministry said that the 103 Russian soldiers exchanged had been taken prisoner in the Kursk border region where Ukrainian forces launched a surprise incursion in August. 'Our people are home,' Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging app. 'We have successfully brought back another 103 warriors from Russian captivity to Ukraine.' Zelenskyy posted pictures of servicemen wrapped in the national blue and yellow flag, hugging each other, talking on mobile phones and posing for group photographs at an undisclosed location. The exchange was mediated by the UAE, Emirati state news agency WAM said. It was the country's eighth such mediation since the start of 2024, it said. Kyiv and Moscow have frequently exchanged prisoners since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, and Saturday's swap was the third since Ukraine began its incursion into the Kursk region. Ukrainian officials have previously said its troops had captured at least 600 Russian soldiers during the incursion, and that this would help it secure the return of captured Ukrainians. Dmytro Lubinets, Ukraine's ombudsman, said most of the freed Ukrainians had been in Russian captivity since the early days of the invasion. He posted a short video on the Telegram messaging app showing the servicemen standing in front of a bus and shouting 'Glory to Ukraine.' Lubinets said that Kyiv had so far secured the return of 3,672 Ukrainians in 57 exchanges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-exchange-206-prisoners-in-second-swap-in-two-days/7784271.html	2024-09-14T07:04:43-07:00	
Israel strikes Gaza as American activist killed by Israeli fire is buried	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Israeli airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza overnight into Saturday, killing at least 14 people as friends and family members of a Turkish-American activist killed by an Israeli soldier honored her in a funeral. The airstrikes in Gaza City hit one home housing 11 people, including three women and four children, and another strike hit a tent in Khan Younis with Palestinians displaced by the Israel-Hamas war, Gaza's Civil Defense said Saturday. They followed airstrikes earlier this week that hit a tent camp on Tuesday and a United Nations school sheltering displaced people on Wednesday. Polio vaccination campaign A campaign to inoculate children in Gaza against polio drew down, and the World Health Organization said about 559,000 people under the age of 10 — seven out of every eight children the campaign aimed to vaccinate — have recovered from their first dose. The second doses are expected to begin later this month as part of an effort in which the WHO said parties had already agreed to. 'As we prepare for the next round in four weeks, we’re hopeful these pauses will hold, because this campaign has clearly shown the world what’s possible when peace is given a chance,' Richard Peeperkorn, WHO’s representative in Gaza and the West Bank, said in a statement on Saturday. Turkish-American activist buried In Turkey, activist Aysenur Ezgi Eygi, the 26-year-old from Seattle who held U.S. and Turkish citizenships, was laid to rest in her hometown of Didim on the Aegean Sea. The Israeli military has said that Eygi was likely shot 'indirectly and unintentionally' by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank on September 6. Turkey announced it will conduct its own investigation into her death. An Israeli protester who witnessed the shooting said she was killed after a demonstration against Israeli settlements. 'We are not going to leave our daughter’s blood on the ground, and we demand responsibility and accountability for this murder,' Numan Kurtulus, the speaker of Turkey's parliament, told mourners. Eygi's body had been earlier brought from a hospital to her family home and Didim's Central Mosque. Thousands of people bid her farewell in the town's streets, which were lined with Turkish flags. Her death was condemned by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as the United States, Egypt and Qatar push for a cease-fire and the release of the remaining hostages held by Hamas. Talks have repeatedly bogged down as Israel and Hamas accuse each other of making new and unacceptable demands. The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an October 7 terror attack on southern Israel. They abducted 250 people and are still holding about 100 hostages after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire in November. About a third of the remaining hostages are believed to be dead. The United States, the U.K. and other Western countries designate Hamas as a terror group. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced roughly 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, often multiple times, and plunged the territory into a severe humanitarian crisis. Gaza’s Health Ministry says upwards of 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since the war began. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and militants in its count, but says women and children make up just over half of the dead. Israel says it has killed more than 17,000 militants in the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-strikes-gaza-as-american-activist-killed-by-israeli-fire-is-buried/7784260.html	2024-09-14T06:44:29-07:00	
Comoros president 'out of danger' after knife attack, minister says	MORONI, COMOROS — Comoros President Azali Assoumani is 'out of danger' after he was injured on Friday in a knife attack by a 24-year-old police officer who was found dead in his cell a day later, officials said Saturday. The attack occurred around 2 p.m. Friday in Salimani Itsandra, a town just north of the capital, Moroni. 'The president is doing well. He has no health problems; he is out of danger. A few stitches were given,' Energy Minister Aboubacar Said Anli said at a press conference in Moroni on Saturday. Azali was attacked as he attended a funeral, according to the presidency. The motive for the attack has not yet been determined. The attacker, Ahmed Abdou, went on leave Wednesday before orchestrating the attack on Friday. Abdou was placed in a cell after he was taken into custody. However, 'this Saturday morning, when investigators went to see him, they found him lying on the ground, his body was lifeless,' Ali Mohamed Djounaid, Comoros' public prosecutor, said at a separate press conference. He added that an investigation was being conducted to determine the motive of the attack and the cause of his death. In May, Assoumani was sworn in for a fourth term in office following a tense January election, which his opponents claim was tainted by voter fraud. Officials deny the allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/comoros-president-out-of-danger-after-knife-attack-minister-says/7784241.html	2024-09-14T06:19:34-07:00	
Tropical storm brings heavy rains over southern Gulf of California	MEXICO CITY — Mexico issued a tropical storm warning Saturday along the coast, from Altata to Huatabampito, and has discontinued all watches and warnings for Baja California Sur after rain from Storm Ileana pounded the resort-studded Los Cabos a day before. Ileana moved northward over the southern Gulf of California at 11 kph, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center. The storm was about 110 kilometers east of La Paz, Mexico, with maximum sustained winds of 65 kph, the center said. Tropical storm warnings have been issued for the coasts of northern Sinaloa and extreme southern Sonola. On Friday, a warning was in effect for portions of the Baja California Peninsula, including Cabo San Lucas and San Jose del Cabo. Juan Manuel Arce Ortega of Los Cabos Civil Protection said the municipalities of La Paz and Los Cabos were on red alert at the time and urged residents to avoid crossing rivers, streams and low areas where they can be swept away by water. All schools in Los Cabos were suspended Friday due to the storm. Oscar Cruces Rodriguez of Mexico’s federal Civil Protection said in a statement that residents should avoid leaving their homes until the storm passes and if residents are in an area at risk of flooding, to find temporary shelters. Authorities prepared 20 temporary shelters in San Jose del Cabo and Cabo San Lucas, according to Los Cabos Civil Protection. At the Hacienda Beach Club and Residences in Cabo San Lucas, valet worker Alan Galvan said the rain arrived late Thursday and has been constant. 'The rain isn’t very strong right now, but the waves are choppy,' he said. 'The guests are very calm and already came down for coffee,' Galvan said. 'There’s some flights canceled, but everything is OK at the moment.' Galvan said they are awaiting further advisories from authorities. The rain remained consistent through Los Cabos Friday afternoon, with several roads flooded and some resorts stacking up sandbags on their perimeters. Some people were still walking around boat docks with their umbrellas. 'The priority has to be safety, starting with the workers. We always have to check on our colleagues who live in risk areas,' said Lyzzette Liceaga, a tour operator at Los Cabos. 'We give them the information shared by the authorities — firefighters in risk areas — so that they can go to the shelters, if necessary.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tropical-storm-brings-heavy-rains-over-southern-gulf-of-california/7784228.html	2024-09-14T06:00:51-07:00	
Mourners pay respects to Ugandan athlete who died after partner set her on fire	BUKWO, Uganda — Dozens of mourners in Uganda paid respects to Rebecca Cheptegei, the Olympic athlete who died last week in Kenya after her partner set her on fire. Local leaders and others gathered at the local administration hall Saturday as they awaited her burial at her ancestral home in a village near the Kenya border. Cheptegei died after her body suffered 80% burns in the attack by Dickson Ndiema, who doused her in gasoline at her home in western Kenya’s Trans-Nzoia County on September 3. Ndiema sustained 30% burns on his body and later died. According to a report filed by the local chief, they quarreled over a piece of land the athlete bought in Kenya. The horrific gasoline attack shocked many and strengthened calls for the protection of female runners facing exploitation and abuse in the East African country. Cheptegei’s body was returned to Uganda Friday in a somber procession following a street march by dozens of activists in the western Kenyan town of Eldoret who demanded an end to physical violence against female athletes. Cheptegei, who was 33, is the fourth female athlete to have been killed by her partner in Kenya in a pattern of gender-based violence in recent years. Kenya’s high rate of violence against women has prompted several marches this year. Ugandan officials have condemned the attack, demanding justice for Cheptegei. Janet Museveni, who serves as Uganda’s education and sports minister, described the attack as 'deeply disturbing.' Don Rukare, chair of the National Council of Sports of Uganda, said in a statement on X that the attack was 'a cowardly and senseless act that has led to the loss of a great athlete.' Four in 10 dating or married Kenyan women have experienced physical or sexual violence perpetrated by their current or most recent partner, according to the 2022 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey. Many Ugandan athletes train across the border in Kenya, an athletics powerhouse with better facilities. Some of the region’s best runners train together at a high-altitude center in Kenya’s west. Cheptegei competed in the women’s marathon at the Paris Olympics, finishing in 44th place, less than a month before the attack. She had represented Uganda at other competitions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mourners-pay-respects-to-ugandan-athlete-who-died-after-partner-set-her-on-fire/7784220.html	2024-09-14T05:48:10-07:00	
Bomb blast in southwest Pakistan kills two police officers	ISLAMABAD — A bomb explosion in Pakistan’s violence-hit southwestern Baluchistan province ripped through a police vehicle Saturday, killing at least two officers and wounding as many others. Abdul Hameed, an area police officer, told VOA by phone that the attack occurred on a main highway passing through Kuchlak near the provincial capital of Quetta. He said that a homemade bomb targeted a police mobile unit and that an investigation into the incident was underway. There were no immediate claims of responsibility for the deadly bombing in the natural resources-rich Pakistani province, where separatist ethnic Baluch groups routinely target security forces. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned Saturday’s attack on the police as a terrorist act, his office said in a statement in Islamabad. A daylong series of insurgent attacks rattled Baluchistan last month, killing more than 50 civilians and security personnel. The outlawed Baluch Liberation Army, the largest of all the separatist groups active in the province, claimed responsibility for orchestrating the violence, which targeted security installations and passenger vehicles. The BLA, designated as a global terrorist group by the United States, has lately intensified its attacks in Baluchistan. The province shares Pakistan’s border with Afghanistan and Iran and hosts major China-funded infrastructure projects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bomb-blast-in-southwest-pakistan-kills-two-police-officers/7784207.html	2024-09-14T05:02:21-07:00	
Iran says it successfully launched a satellite	TEHRAN, Iran — Iran launched a satellite into space Saturday with a rocket built by the country's paramilitary Revolutionary Guard, state-run media reported, the latest for a program the West fears helps Tehran advance its ballistic missile program. Iran described the launch as a success, which would be the second such launch to put a satellite into orbit with the rocket. There was no immediate independent confirmation of the launch's success, nor did Iranian authorities immediately provide footage or other details. The launch comes amid heightened tensions gripping the wider Middle East over the ongoing Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip, during which Tehran launched an unprecedented direct missile-and-drone attack on Israel. Meanwhile, Iran continues to enrich uranium to nearly weapons-grade levels, raising concerns among nonproliferation experts about Tehran's program. Iran identified the satellite-carrying rocket as the Qaem-100, which the Guard used in January for another successful launch. Qaem means 'upright' in Iran's Farsi language. The solid-fuel rocket put the Chamran-1 satellite, weighing 60 kilograms, into a 550-kilometer orbit, state media reported. The U.S. State Department and the American military did not immediately respond to requests for comment over the Iranian launch. The United States had previously said Iran's satellite launches defy a U.N. Security Council resolution and called on Tehran to undertake no activity involving ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. U.N. sanctions related to Iran's ballistic missile program expired last October. Under Iran's relatively moderate former President Hassan Rouhani, the Islamic Republic slowed its space program for fear of raising tensions with the West. Hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi, a protege of Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei who came to power in 2021, has pushed the program forward. Raisi died in a helicopter crash in May. It's unclear what Iran's new president, the reformist Masoud Pezeshkian, wants for the program as he was silent on the issue while campaigning. The U.S. intelligence community's worldwide threat assessment this year said Iran's development of satellite launch vehicles 'would shorten the timeline' for Iran to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile because it uses similar technology. Intercontinental ballistic missiles can be used to deliver nuclear weapons. Iran is now producing uranium close to weapons-grade levels after the collapse of its nuclear deal with world powers. Tehran has enough enriched uranium for 'several' nuclear weapons, if it chooses to produce them, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency repeatedly has warned. Iran has always denied seeking nuclear weapons and says its space program, like its nuclear activities, is for purely civilian purposes. However, U.S. intelligence agencies and the IAEA say Iran had an organized military nuclear program up until 2003. The launch also came ahead of the second anniversary of the death of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini, which sparked nationwide protests against Iran's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law and the country's Shiite theocracy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-it-successfully-launched-a-satellite-/7784161.html	2024-09-14T02:04:03-07:00	
Women in Iran are going without hijabs as the 2nd anniversary of Amini's death nears	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — On the streets of Iranian cities, it's becoming more common to see a woman passing by without a mandatory headscarf, or hijab, as the second anniversary of the death of Mahsa Amini and the mass protests it sparked approaches. There's no government official or study acknowledging the phenomenon, which began as Iran entered its hot summer months and power cuts in its overburdened electrical system became common. But across social media, videos of people filming neighborhood streets or just talking about a normal day in their life, women and girls can be seen walking past with their long hair out over their shoulders, particularly after sunset. This defiance comes despite what United Nations investigators describe as 'expanded repressive measures and policies' by Iran's theocracy to punish them — though there's been no recent catalyzing event like Amini's death to galvanize demonstrators. The country's new reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian campaigned on a promise to halt the harassment of women by morality police. But the country's ultimate authority remains the 85-year-old Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who in the past said 'unveiling is both religiously forbidden and politically forbidden.' For some observant Muslim women, the head covering is a sign of piety before God and modesty in front of men outside their families. In Iran, the hijab — and the all-encompassing black chador worn by some — has long been a political symbol as well. 'Meaningful institutional changes and accountability for gross human rights violations and crimes under international law, and crimes against humanity, remains elusive for victims and survivors, especially for women and children,' warned a U.N. fact-finding mission on Iran on Friday. Amini, 22, died on September 16, 2022, in a hospital after her arrest by the country's morality police over not wearing her hijab to the liking of the authorities. The protests that followed Amini's death started first with the chant 'Women, Life, Freedom.' However, the protesters' cries soon grew into open calls of revolt against Khamenei. A monthslong security crackdown that followed killed more than 500 people and saw over 22,000 detained. Today, passersby on the streets of Tehran, whether its tony northern suburbs for the wealthy or the working-class neighborhoods of the capital's southern reaches, now routinely see women without the hijab. It particularly starts at dusk, though even during the daylight on weekends women can be seen with their hair uncovered at major parks. Online videos — specifically a sub-genre showing walking tours of city streets for those in rural areas or abroad who want to see life in the bustling neighborhoods of Tehran — include women without the hijab. Something that would have stopped a person in their tracks in the decades following the 1979 Islamic Revolution now goes unacknowledged. 'My quasi-courage for not wearing scarves is a legacy of Mahsa Amini and we have to protect this as an achievement,' said a 25-year-old student at Tehran Sharif University, who gave only her first name Azadeh out of fear of reprisal. 'She could be at my current age if she did not pass away.' The disobedience still comes with risk. Months after the protests halted, Iranian morality police returned to the streets. There have been scattered videos of women and young girls being roughed up by officers in the time since. In 2023, a teenage Iranian girl was injured in a mysterious incident on Tehran's Metro while not wearing a headscarf and later died in hospital. In July, activists say police opened fire on a woman fleeing a checkpoint in an attempt to avoid her car being impounded for her not wearing the hijab. Meanwhile, the government has targeted private businesses where women are seen without their headscarves. Surveillance cameras search for women uncovered in vehicles to fine and impound their cars. The government has gone as far as use aerial drones to monitor the 2024 Tehran International Book Fair and Kish Island for uncovered women, the U.N. said. Yet some feel the election of Pezeshkian in July, after a helicopter crash killed Iranian hard-line President Ebrahim Raisi in May, is helping ease tensions over the hijab. 'I think the current peaceful environment is part of the status after Pezeshkian took office,' said Hamid Zarrinjouei, a 38-year-old bookseller. 'In some way, Pezeshkian could convince powerful people that more restrictions do not necessarily make women more faithful to the hijab.' On Wednesday, Iran's Prosecutor General Mohammad Movahedi Azad warned security forces about starting physical altercations over the hijab. 'We prosecuted violators, and we will,' Movahedi Azad said, according to Iranian media. 'Nobody has right to have improper attitude even though an individual commits an offense.' While the government isn't directly addressing the increase in women not wearing hijabs, there are other signs of a recognition the political landscape has shifted. In August, authorities dismissed a university teacher a day after he appeared on state television and dismissively referred to Amini as having 'croaked.' Meanwhile, the pre-reform newspaper Ham Mihan reported in August on an unpublished survey conducted under the supervision of Iran's Ministry of Culture and Islamic Guidance that found the hijab had become one of the most important issues in the country — something it hadn't seen previously. 'This issue has been on people's minds more than ever before,' sociologist Simin Kazemi told the newspaper.	https://www.voanews.com/a/women-in-iran-are-going-without-hijabs-as-the-2nd-anniversary-of-amini-s-death-nears/7784156.html	2024-09-14T00:56:38-07:00	
On the streets of a Colorado city, pregnant migrants struggle to survive	AURORA, Colorado — She was eight months pregnant when she was forced to leave her Denver homeless shelter. It was November. Ivanni Herrera took her 4-year-old son, Dylan, by the hand and led him into the chilly night, dragging a suitcase containing donated clothes and blankets away from the Microtel Inn & Suites. It was one of 10 hotels where Denver has housed more than 30,000 migrants, many of them Venezuelan, over the last two years. First, they walked to Walmart. There, with money she and her husband earned begging on the street, they bought a tent. They chose for their new home a grassy median along a busy thoroughfare in Aurora, the next town over, a suburb known for its immigrant population. 'We wanted to go somewhere where there were people,' Herrera, 28, said in Spanish. 'It feels safer.' That night, temperatures dipped to 32 degrees. And as she wrapped her body around her son's, Ivanni Herrera cried. Over the past two years, a record number of Venezuelans have come to the United States seeking a better life. Instead, they’ve found themselves in communities roiling over how much to help the newcomers — or whether to help at all. Unable to legally work without filing expensive and complicated paperwork, some have found themselves sleeping on the streets — even those who are pregnant. Herrera had found inspiration for her journey to the U.S. on social media. On Facebook and TikTok, young, smiling Venezuelan migrants in nice clothes stood in front of new cars. Some 320,000 Venezuelans have tried to cross the U.S. border since October 2022, according to U.S. Border Patrol reports — more than in the previous nine years combined. Just weeks after arriving in Denver, Herrera began to wonder if the success she had seen was real. She was seeing doctors and social workers at a Denver hospital where she planned to give birth because they served everyone, even those without insurance. They were alarmed their pregnant patient was now sleeping outside in the cold. In Colorado's third-largest city, Aurora, officials have turned down requests to help migrants. In February, the City Council passed a resolution telling other cities and nonprofits not to bring migrants into the community because it 'does not currently have the financial capacity to fund new services.' Yet still they come, because of its lower cost of living and Spanish-speaking community. Former President Donald Trump last week called attention to the city, suggesting a Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment complex. Authorities say that hasn’t happened. The doctors urged Herrera to sleep at the hospital. It wouldn’t cost anything, they assured her, just as her birth would be covered by emergency Medicaid. Herrera refused. 'How,' she asked, 'could I sleep in a warm place when my son is cold on the street?' Denver struggled to keep up with the rush of migrants, many arriving on buses chartered by Texas to draw attention to the impact of immigration. All told, Denver officials say they have helped some 42,700 migrants since last year, either by giving them shelter or a bus fare to another city. Initially, the city offered migrants with families six weeks in a hotel. But any migrants arriving since May have received only three days in a hotel. After that, some have found transportation to other cities, scrounged for a place to sleep or wandered into nearby towns like Aurora. Today, fewer migrants are coming to the Denver area. But Candice Marley, founder of a nonprofit called All Souls, still receives dozens of outreaches per week from social service agencies looking to help homeless migrants. All Souls had run encampments for migrants, but Denver shut them down because they lacked a permit. 'It’s so frustrating that we can’t help them,' Marley said. 'That leaves families camping on their own, unsupported, living in their cars. Kids can’t get into school. There’s no stability.' When Herrera started feeling labor pains in early December, she waited until she couldn’t bear the pain anymore and could feel the baby getting close. She called an ambulance. The paramedics didn’t speak Spanish but called an interpreter. They told Herrera they had to take her to the closest hospital, instead of the one in Denver, since her contractions were so close together. Her son was born healthy at 7 pounds, 8 ounces. She took him to the tent the next day. A few days later the whole family, including the baby, had contracted chicken pox. 'The baby was in a bad state,' said Emily Rodriguez, a close friend living with her family in a tent next to Herrera’s. Herrera took him to the hospital, then returned to the tent before being offered a way out. An Aurora woman originally from Mexico invited the family to live with her — at first, for free. After a couple weeks, the family moved to a small room in the garage for $800 a month. To earn rent and pay expenses, Herrera and Rodriguez have cleaned homes, painted houses and shoveled snow while their children waited in a car by themselves. Finding regular work and actually getting paid for it has been difficult. While their husbands can get semi-regular work in construction, the women’s most consistent income comes from standing outside with their children and begging. On a good day, each earns about $50. Herrera and her husband recently became eligible to apply for work permits and legal residency for Venezuelans who arrived in the United States last year. But it will cost $800 each for a lawyer to file the paperwork, along with hundreds of dollars in government fees. They don't have the money. What's worse, they're deeply in debt. Despite what the hospital had said when she was pregnant, Herrera was never signed up for emergency Medicaid. She says she owes $18,000 for the ambulance ride and delivery of her baby. Now, she avoids going to the doctor or taking her children because she’s afraid her large debt will jeopardize her chances of staying in the U.S. 'I’m afraid they’re going to deport me,' she says. Herrera and Rodriguez now hold cardboard signs along a busy street in Denver and then knock on the doors of private homes, never returning to the same address. They type up their request for clothes, food or money on their phones and translate it to English using Google. They hand their phones to whoever answers the door. Herrera recently sent $500 to her sister to make the monthslong trip from Venezuela to Aurora with Herrera’s 8-year-old daughter. 'I’ll have my family back together,' she says. And she believes her sister will be able to watch her kids so Herrera can look for work. The problem is, Herrera hasn’t told her family back in Venezuela how she spends her time. 'They think I’m fixing up homes and selling chocolate and flowers,' she says. 'I’m living a lie.' Finally, her sister and daughter are waiting across the border in Mexico. When we come to America, her sister asks, could we fly to Denver? The tickets are $600. Herrera has to come clean. Life is far more difficult than she has let on. She texts back: No.	https://www.voanews.com/a/on-the-streets-of-a-colorado-city-pregnant-migrants-struggle-to-survive/7780514.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Ohio city reshaped by Haitian immigrants lands in unwelcome spotlight	SPRINGFIELD, Ohio — Many cities have been reshaped by immigrants in the last few years without attracting much notice. Not Springfield, Ohio. Its story of economic renewal and related growing pains has been thrust into the national conversation in a presidential election year — and maliciously distorted by false rumors that Haitian immigrants are eating their neighbors' pets. Donald Trump amplified those lies during Tuesday's nationally televised debate, exacerbating some residents' fears about growing divisiveness in the predominantly white, blue-collar city of about 60,000. At the city's Haitian Community Help and Support Center on Wednesday, Rose-Thamar Joseph said many of the roughly 15,000 immigrants who arrived in the past few years were drawn by good jobs and the city's relative affordability. But a rising sense of unease has crept in as longtime residents increasingly bristle at newcomers taking jobs at factories, driving up housing costs, worsening traffic and straining city services. 'Some of them are talking about living in fear. Some of them are scared for their life,' Joseph said. A 'Welcome To Our City' sign hangs from a parking garage downtown, where a coffee shop, bakery and boutique line Springfield's main drag, North Fountain Street. A flag advertising 'CultureFest,' the city's annual celebration of unity through diversity, waves from a pole nearby. Melanie Flax Wilt, a Republican commissioner in the county where Springfield is located, said she has been pushing for community and political leaders to 'stop feeding the fear.' 'After the election and everybody's done using Springfield, Ohio, as a talking point for immigration reform, we are going to be the ones here still living through the challenges and coming up with the solutions,' she said. Ariel Dominique, executive director of the Haitian American Foundation for Democracy, said she laughed at first at the absurdity of the false claims. But seeing the comments repeated on national television by the former president was painful. 'It is so unfair and unjust and completely contrary to what we have contributed to the world, what we have contributed to this nation for so long,' Dominique said. The falsehoods about Springfield's Haitian immigrants were spread online by Trump's running mate, JD Vance, on the eve of Tuesday's debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris. It's part of a timeworn American political tradition of casting immigrants as outsiders. 'This is what's happening in our country. And it's a shame,' Trump said at the debate after repeating the falsehoods. When challenged by ABC News moderator David Muir over the false claims, Trump held firm, saying 'people on television' said their dogs were eaten, but he offered no evidence. Officials in Springfield have tried to tamp down the misinformation by saying there have been no credible or detailed reports of any pets being abducted or eaten. State leaders are trying to help address some of the real challenges facing the city. Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine, a Republican, said Tuesday he would add more law enforcement and health care resources to an aid package the state has already provided to Springfield. Many Haitians have come to the U.S. to flee poverty and violence. They have embraced President Joe Biden's new and expanded legal pathways to enter, and have shunned illegal crossings, accounting for only 92 border arrests out of more than 56,000 in July, the latest data available. The Biden administration recently announced an estimated 300,000 Haitians in the U.S. could remain in the country at least through February 2026, with eligibility for work authorization, under a law called Temporary Protected Status. The goal is to spare people from being deported to countries in turmoil. Springfield, about 72 kilometers from the state capital of Columbus, suffered a steep decline in its manufacturing sector toward the end of the last century, and its population shrank as a result. But its downtown has been revitalized in recent years as more Haitians arrived and helped meet the rising demand for labor as the economy emerged from the pandemic. Officials say Haitians now account for about 15% of the population. The city was shaken last year when a minivan slammed into a school bus, killing an 11-year-old boy. The driver was a Haitian man who recently settled in the area and was driving without a valid license. During a city commission meeting on Tuesday, the boy's parents condemned politicians' use of their son's death to stoke hatred. Last week, a post on the social media platform X shared what looked like a screengrab of a social media post apparently out of Springfield. The post claimed without evidence that the person's 'neighbor's daughter's friend' saw a cat hanging from a tree to be butchered and eaten, outside a house where it claimed Haitians lived. It was accompanied by a photo of a Black man carrying what appeared to be a goose by its feet. On Monday, Vance posted on X: 'Reports now show that people have had their pets abducted and eaten by people who shouldn't be in this country.' The next day, he posted again, saying his office had received inquiries from Springfield residents who said 'their neighbors' pets or local wildlife were abducted by Haitian migrants.' Longtime Springfield resident Chris Hazel, who knows the park and neighborhood where the pet and goose abductions were purported to have happened, called the claims 'preposterous.' 'It reminds me of when people used to accuse others and outsiders as cannibals. It's dehumanizing a community,' he said of the accusations against the city's Haitian residents. Sophia Pierrilus, the daughter of a former Haitian diplomat who moved to the Ohio capital of Columbus 15 years ago and is now an immigrant advocate, agreed, calling it all political. 'My view is that's their way to use Haitians as a scapegoat to bring some kind of chaos in America,' she said. With its rising population of immigrants, Springfield is hardly an outlier. So far this decade, immigration has accounted for almost three-quarters of U.S. population growth, with 2.5 million immigrants arriving in the United States between 2020 and 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Population growth is an important driver of economic growth. 'The Haitian immigrants who started moving to Springfield the last few years are the reason why the economy and the labor force has been revitalized there,' said Guerline Jozef, executive director of the Haitian Bridge Alliance, which provides legal and social services to immigrants across the U.S. Now, she said, Haitians in Springfield have told her that, out of fear, they are considering leaving the city.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ohio-city-reshaped-by-haitian-immigrants-lands-in-unwelcome-spotlight/7781154.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00

Share of foreign-born people in US is at highest rate in over a century, survey says	miami — The percentage of U.S. residents who were foreign-born last year grew to its highest level in more than a century, according to figures released Thursday from the most comprehensive survey of American life. The share of people born outside the United States increased in 2023 to 14.3% from 13.9% in 2022, according to estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau's annual American Community Survey, which tracks commuting times, internet access, family life, income, education levels, disabilities, military service and employment, among other topics. International migrants have become a primary driver of population growth this decade, increasing their share of the overall population as fewer children are being born in the U.S. compared with numbers from years past. The rate of the foreign-born population in the United States hasn't been this high since 1910, when it was 14.7%, driven by waves of people emigrating in search of a better life. 'We knew that here you can have savings, live well. Here you can have normal services such as water and electricity,' said Luciana Bracho, who moved legally to Miami from Venezuela as part of a humanitarian parole program with her boyfriend, parents and brother in April 2023. 'I like Miami and the opportunities that I have had.' In 2023, international migrants accounted for more than two-thirds of the population growth in the United States, and so far this decade they have made up almost three-quarters of U.S. growth. The growth appears to have been driven by people coming from Latin America, whose share of the foreign-born population increased year-over-year to 51.2% from 50.3%, according to the estimates. Latin America was the only world region of origin to experience an increase among those U.S. residents born in another country, as the share of foreign-born residents from Europe and Asia dropped slightly. Nicole Díaz, a Venezuelan opposition activist, left after receiving threats to her life and lived in Peru and Ecuador before moving to the Miami area legally in February 2023 with her husband and 9-year-old daughter. Díaz described herself as '100% happy' living in South Florida, where they pay $2,300 a month for a two-bedroom apartment. 'After being in different countries, working here is relaxed, despite the language,' Díaz said. 'But housing is very expensive, and we have been evaluating moving to another state because here all the salary goes for the rent.' Among the states with the largest year-over-year bumps in the foreign-born population was Delaware, going to 11.2% from 9.9%; Georgia, to 11.6% from 10.7%; and New Mexico, to 10.2% from 9.3% The share of the foreign-born population dropped slightly in Washington, D.C., Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Minnesota, Montana, North Dakota and Oregon. The Census Bureau figures don't distinguish whether people are in the United States legally or illegally. Illegal immigration has become a top issue in the 2024 presidential race, even as illegal border crossings from Mexico plunged this summer after reaching a record last December. The share of U.S. residents who identify as Hispanic, no matter what race, rose last year to 19.4% from 19.1% in the previous year, according to the survey. At the same time, those who identify as non-Hispanic white alone dropped from 57.7% to 57.1%. The share of U.S. residents who identify as Black alone dropped slightly, from 12.2% to 12.1%, and it increased slightly for those who identify as Asian alone from 5.9% to 6%. Residents in the United States continued to get older, with the median age increasing from 39 in 2022 to 39.2 in 2023. The nation's aging is taking place as a majority of baby boomers have become senior citizens and millennials are entering middle age. While the share of children under age 18 remained steady at 21.7% year-over-year, the share of senior citizens age 65 and over increased to 17.7% from 17.3%. Meanwhile, a post-pandemic bump in working from home continued its slide back to pre-COVID-19 times, as the share of employees working from home dropped last year to 13.8% from 15.2% in the previous year. In 2021, the first full year after the pandemic's start, almost 18% of employees were working from home, up from 5.7% in 2019. But return-to-office mandates in the past two years have reversed that trend and caused commute times to bump up slightly last year, growing on average to 26.8 minutes from 26.4 minutes. The survey also showed that the median cost of renting, plus utilities and related expenses, grew faster than median home values in 2023 for the first time in a decade. The 3.8% jump in rental costs was the largest annual increase since at least 2011. Despite the spike in rental costs, the share of renter income spent on rent and utilities remained unchanged at 31% in 2023, suggesting that incomes kept pace with rent hikes, the Census Bureau said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/share-of-foreign-born-people-in-us-is-at-highest-rate-in-over-a-century-survey-says-/7782615.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
New York City lawmakers approve bill to study slavery and reparations	NEW YORK — New York City lawmakers approved legislation Thursday to study the city's significant role in slavery and consider reparations to descendants of enslaved people. If signed into law, the package of bills passed by the City Council would follow in the footsteps of several other municipalities across the U.S. that have sought ways to address the country's dark history, as well as a separate New York state commission that began working this year. New York fully abolished slavery in 1827. But businesses, including the predecessors of some modern banks, continued to benefit financially from the slave trade — likely up until 1866. The lawmakers behind the proposals noted that the harms caused by the institution are still felt by Black Americans today. 'The reparations movement is often misunderstood as merely a call for compensation,' Council Member Farah Louis, a Democrat who sponsored one of the bills, told the City Council on Thursday. She explained that systemic forms of oppression are still impacting people through redlining, environmental racism and services in predominantly Black neighborhoods that are underfunded. The bills still need to be signed by Democratic Mayor Eric Adams. City Hall signaled his support in a statement calling the legislation 'another crucial step towards addressing systemic inequities, fostering reconciliation, and creating a more just and equitable future for all New Yorkers.' The bills would direct the city's Commission on Racial Equity to suggest remedies to the legacy of slavery, including reparations. It would also create a truth and reconciliation process to establish historical facts about slavery in the state. One of the proposals would also require that the city install an informational sign on Wall Street in Manhattan to mark the site of New York's first slave market, which operated between 1711 and 1762. A sign was placed nearby in 2015, but Public Advocate Jumaane D. Williams, a Democrat who sponsored the legislation, said its location is inaccurate. The commission would work with the existing state commission, which is also considering the possibility of reparations. A report from the state panel, which held its first public meeting in late July, is expected in early 2025. The city effort wouldn't need to produce recommendations until 2027. The city's commission was created out of a 2021 racial justice initiative during then-Mayor Bill de Blasio's administration, which also recommended the city track data on the cost of living and add a commitment to remedy 'past and continuing harms' to the city charter's preamble. 'Your call and your ancestors' call for reparations had not gone unheard,' Linda Tigani, executive director of the racial equity commission, said at a news conference ahead of the council vote. A financial impact analysis of the bills estimated that the studies would cost $2.5 million. New York is the latest city to study reparations. Tulsa, Oklahoma, where a notorious massacre of Black residents took place in 1921, announced a similar commission last month. Evanston, Illinois, became the first city to offer reparations to Black residents and their descendants in 2021, including distributing some payments of $25,000 in 2023, according to PBS. The eligibility was based on harm suffered as a result of the city's discriminatory housing policies or practices. San Francisco approved reparations in February, but the mayor later cut the funds, saying that reparations should instead be carried out by the federal government. California budgeted $12 million for a reparations program that included helping Black residents research their ancestry, but it was defeated in the state's Legislature this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-city-lawmakers-approve-bill-to-study-slavery-and-reparations/7784062.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Animal rights groups object to Buckingham Palace guards' bearskin caps	london — An animal rights group trying to get real fur out of the bearskin caps worn by King's Guards at Buckingham Palace took aim Thursday at the cost of the ceremonial garb. The price of the caps soared 30% in a year to more than 2,000 pounds ($2,600) apiece for the hats made of black bear fur, the Ministry of Defense said in response to a freedom of information request by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. 'Stop wasting taxpayer pounds on caps made from slaughtered wildlife and switch to faux fur today,' the group said in a statement. A luxury fake fur maker has offered to supply the army with free faux bear fur for 10 years, PETA said. Military willing to consider alternatives The military said it was open to exploring alternatives if they pass muster in durability, water protection and appearance. But 'no alternative has met all those criteria to date,' a ministry spokesperson said in a statement. The distinctive tall black hats, worn by guards in bright scarlet tunics, are seen by millions who watch the regular changing of the guard ceremony at the palace. They also appear at other royal events including the annual Trooping the Color ceremony honoring the monarch's birthday in June. The cost of the caps rose from 1,560 pounds ($2,035) each in 2022 to 2,040 pounds ($2,660) in 2023, the ministry said. More than 1 million pounds ($1.3 million) was spent on them in the past decade. The price went up because of a contract change for fur that comes from bears killed in licensed hunts in Canada, the military said. PETA, which has been pushing for more than two decades to scrap the fur hats, said each cap requires one bear pelt. The group claimed that the defense department is propping up the 'cruel' Canadian bear-hunting industry. The ministry denied that charge and said if it stopped buying the pelts, it would not reduce the numbers of bears being killed. Petition calls for fake fur Parliament debated the issue in July 2022 after an online petition with more than 100,000 signatures called for using fake fur in the caps. 'This hunting involves the violent killing of bears, with many bears being shot several times,' Martyn Day, then a Scottish National Party member of Parliament, said at the time. 'It seems undeniable, therefore, that by continuing to purchase hats made from the fur of black bears the MOD is funding the suffering of bears in Canada by making the baiting and killing of those animals and the sale of their pelts a profitable pursuit for the hunters.' Day said a poll at the time found 75% of the U.K. population found real bearskins were a bad use of taxpayer money and supported replacing the hats. He noted that the late Queen Elizabeth II had ceased buying fur for her wardrobe. Earlier this year, Queen Camilla, wife of King Charles III, pledged to buy no more fur products.	https://www.voanews.com/a/animal-rights-groups-object-to-buckingham-palace-guard-s-distinctive-bearskin-caps-/7784068.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Limited role for US Navy SEAL Team in defense of Taiwan	Washington — The United States Navy's elite SEAL Team Six would likely have a limited role in defending Taiwan should China invade the self-governing and democratic island, say analysts responding to a Financial Times report that the unit has been training for it for more than one year. Lyle J. Morris, senior fellow for foreign policy and national security at the Asia Society Policy Institute’s Center for China Analysis, tells VOA Mandarin if the unit is indeed preparing for an attack by Beijing, it may indicate that the U.S. is more deeply involved in defending Taiwan than previously thought. However, he stressed that the secret and precise combat characteristics of SEAL Team Six mean its role in resisting China's invasion of Taiwan would be very limited, and the focus would be on carrying out special tasks. 'As far as their sheer capability to repel an invasion. I think that's more limited,' he says. 'I think it's in a very discreet, narrow way of coming in for a specific task that Taiwan might need, whether it's helping to protect, let's say, an airfield in Taiwan or protect a communication asset in Taiwan, in Taipei, they could come in and out very discreetly and very lethally to protect that asset.' SEAL Team Six specializes in performing sensitive, highly difficult missions. In 2009, the unit rescued Richard Phillips, captain of the MV Maersk Alabama, who was taken hostage by Somali pirates. The elite unit gained an international reputation after the successful raid on al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden’s compound in Pakistan in 2011. It is one of the most highly regarded U.S. military units, along with the United States Army's Delta Force, the 75th Ranger Regiment's Regimental Reconnaissance Company, the Intelligence Support Activity, and the Air Force's 24th Special Tactics Squadron, and part of the Joint Special Operations Command. 'Navy SEALs usually deployed from submarines or, most likely, small ships. And are useful for targeting vulnerabilities in enemies’ presentation,' Richard D. Fisher Jr., senior fellow with the International Assessment and Strategy Center, tells VOA. Analysts say the U.S. military likely revealed the SEAL Team Six training program to the Financial Times to send a warning to Beijing amid China’s increasingly assertive moves in the region. 'This is one way the U.S. is bolstering deterrence towards China, towards preventing a Chinese invasion of Taiwan,' says Morris. 'So, I think this is just an added factor getting China to second guess or to reconsider what it will face if it were to invade Taiwan.' Dennis Wilder, a senior fellow for the Initiative for U.S.-China Dialogue on Global Issues at Georgetown University and a former Central Intelligence Agency military analyst, posted on social media platform X, 'It is sure to get under Beijing's skin.' In a written response to VOA Mandarin, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson of the Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C., said, 'The Taiwan question is the very core of China’s core interests and the first red line that must not be crossed in the China-U.S. relationship.' He urged 'the U.S. to earnestly abide by the one-China principle and the three China-U.S. joint communiqués, stop enhancing military contact with the Taiwan region or arming it by any means or under whatever pretext, stop creating factors that could heighten tensions in the Taiwan Strait, and stop conniving at and supporting the separatists’ attempt to seek ‘Taiwan independence’ by force.' Taiwan split from China during the civil war that saw the Communist Party seize power in Beijing in 1949 and the Nationalist Party flee to the island, which developed into a flourishing democracy. But China’s one-party, authoritarian state never gave up its claim to Taiwan and considers it a renegade province that must one day reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. Admiral Philips Davidson, former commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, warned in 2021 that China could attack Taiwan within six years. President Joe Biden has repeatedly stressed that if China invades Taiwan, the U.S. will intervene militarily to defend it. The U.S. Department of Defense declined to confirm or deny the Financial Times report. Pentagon spokesperson John Supple said in an email to VOA, 'The DoD and our service members prepare and train for a wide range of contingencies. We will not comment on specifics, but will restate that we are committed to our longstanding one China policy, guided by the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques, and the Six Assurances. As we have said before, conflict is neither imminent nor inevitable.' America’s one-China policy is a strategically ambiguous agreement it made in 1972 to establish relations with China that recognizes Beijing as the only government of China and acknowledges, but does not endorse, Beijing’s claim that Taiwan is part of China. Washington has unofficial relations with Taiwan defined through the Taiwan Relations Act, the Three Joint Communiques with Beijing, and the Six Assurances with Taipei, which underscore U.S. opposition to attempts to unilaterally alter the status quo and determination to help Taiwan defend itself through weapons sales. There has been previous U.S. military training for Taiwan’s defense, both on the island and in the United States. Reuters reported last year the U.S. was set to expand the number of troops helping train Taiwanese forces on the island and Taiwanese officials confirmed more of their troops would be training in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/limited-role-for-us-navy-seal-team-in-defense-of-taiwan/7784108.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
US-Russia battle for influence in Africa plays out in Central African Republic	BANGUI, Central African Republic — Hours after Russian mercenary leader Yevgeny Prigozhin rebelled against his country's top military leaders, his private army's biggest client in Africa panicked, turning for help to his foe in the West. Officials from Central African Republic, where some 1,500 of Prigozhin's Wagner Group mercenaries were stationed, wrote a letter that day, requesting to 'rapidly' arrange a meeting with a private U.S. security firm to discuss collaboration. Dated June 23, 2023, the day Prigozhin launched the armed rebellion, the letter sparked a series of meetings, culminating in a deal with the central African nation and Bancroft Global Development. That sparked backlash from Russian mercenaries, according to a dozen diplomats, locals, and analysts. The tensions in Central African Republic are a window into a larger battle playing out across the continent as Moscow and Washington vie for influence. The Russian mercenaries — using success in staving off rebels in this impoverished nation as a model for expansion — have long been accused by locals and rights groups of stripping natural resources such as minerals and timber and are linked to the torture and death of civilians. In the wake of Prigozhin's rebellion and suspicious death in a plane crash, the Russians are recalibrating their Africa operations. The United States, which has been largely disengaged from the region for years, is attempting to maintain a presence and stymie Russian gains as it pushes African countries to distance themselves from the mercenaries. U.S. officials blame Russia for anti-American sentiment in the region and say they're trying to shift the narrative. 'If the U.S. can't regain a foothold, it could give Russia greater economic and political leverage,' said Samuel Ramani of the Royal United Services Institute, a defense and security think tank. 'If Russia loses Central African Republic, its flagship model on the continent, there could be a domino effect in other countries.' Russia's influence In recent years, Russia has emerged as the security partner of choice for a growing number of governments in the region, displacing traditional allies such as France and the U.S. Moscow expanded its military cooperation by using mercenaries like Wagner, which since around 2017 has operated in at least half a dozen countries by protecting African leaders and in some cases helping fight rebels and extremists. They're also plagued by their human rights record. Two years ago in Mali, Wagner and the army were accused of executing about 300 men — some suspected of being Islamist extremists, but most civilians — in what Human Rights Watch called the worst single atrocity reported in the country's decade-long armed conflict. And in Central African Republic, mercenaries train the army on torture tactics, including how to tburn people alive, according to watchdog The Sentry. Central African Republic Central African Republic was one of the first places the mercenaries entered. The country has been in conflict since 2013, when predominantly Muslim rebels seized power and forced the president from office. Six of the 14 armed groups that signed a 2019 peace deal later left the agreement. Locals and the government credited Wagner with fighting back rebels who tried to overtake Bangui, the capital, in 2021. The Russians soon expanded to Burkina Faso and Niger, and have ambitions for further growth. Russia is refurbishing a military base some 80 kilometers from Bangui. Alexander Bikantov, Russia's ambassador to Central African Republic, said the base will improve the country's security. Fidele Gouandjika, adviser to President Faustin-Archange Touadera, said the base aims to have 10,000 fighters by 2030 to engage with more African nations. Touadera's office didn't reply to written requests for comment for this story. His adviser to the country's spy agency declined to be interviewed. Pressure from United States The U.S. had been pushing Central African Republic to find an alternative to Wagner for years. A more assertive U.S. approach came as it faced new setbacks and tried to rework agreements in the region. Its troops left Chad and Niger, where they were no longer welcome. Still, the State Department said in a statement this year that it wasn't involved in the decision to establish Bancroft Global Development's presence in Central African Republic. But Washington could deny such contracts if it wanted, said Sean McFate, a former contractor in Africa and author of 'The New Rules of War.' The U.S. has used private military companies to reduce American 'boots on the ground' in Africa, McFate said, and companies like Bancroft have to play by Washington's rules if they want future government work. In response to AP questions, the U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity said it uses private contractors in Africa to help countries operate more effectively, with U.S. government oversight to ensure accountability. The official said the State Department has overseen Bancroft's work in Somalia but not Central African Republic or elsewhere. Bancroft's background Washington-based Bancroft is a nonprofit working in nine countries — five in Africa. Its involvement in Central African Republic has been shrouded in secrecy since signs emerged of its presence last fall. During an AP visit months later, rumors swirled about Bancroft's activities, fueling speculation the U.S was bringing its own Wagner to oust Russia. But according to Bancroft founder Michael Stock, the group entered at Bangui's behest. Stock received the letter from the presidency within a day of Prigozhin's mutiny, and the two signed a deal in September, he said. Fewer than 30 Bancroft personnel work there, Stock said, helping Central African Republic with intelligence systems, interagency cooperation and law enforcement. Bancroft has invested some $1.4 million there, Stock said. Much of Bancroft's funding has come from U.S. and United Nations grants. From 2018 to 2020, it received more than $43 million from the U.S., according to audits required as part of tax forms. Amal Ali, a former U.S. intelligence analyst, is among critics who say that despite its yearslong presence in Somalia, Bancroft hasn't contributed to any eradication of terrorism. Stock dismissed such comments as uninformed and said the Somali and U.S. governments 'agree Bancroft has done a great deal to damaging illegal armed groups and developing the capacity of the government to perform its national defense functions professionally.' Backlash on the ground Rights groups say a lack of transparency about Bancroft's operations has fostered an atmosphere of distrust in a country already rampant with armed actors. Wagner, a U.N. peacekeeping mission and Rwandan troops are all on the ground to try to quell violence. 'Operating in a vague and nontransparent way in the Central African Republic only leads to suspicion,' said Lewis Mudge, of Human Rights Watch. Stock defended Bancroft's work and policies. 'It is perfectly normal for a government not to publicize how it is defending the people and the state,' he told AP. Unclear future As the U.S. and Russia jockey for power, African governments say they want to make their own choices. Central African Republic officials approached Bancroft, which shows that these governments haven't become Russian puppets, said Jack Margolin, an expert on private military companies. But, he added, Russia's reaction to Bancroft could hurt Moscow's standing with other nations. After Prigozhin's death, Russia moved quickly to take control of Wagner's assets, and the defense ministry told countries where Wagner operated that it would take over. The country and its military intelligence arm have taken a more direct role in Africa operations, deploying more official detachments from its army. In Central African Republic, it's unclear how much sway the Russian state has with the mercenaries, who are beloved by many. For most people here, there's little interest in squabbles among foreign nations. 'There are problems between the Americans and Russians, but that doesn't matter to us,' said Jean Louis Yet, who works at Bangui's market. 'We are here working, trying our best to make a living. All we want is security.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-us-russia-battle-for-influence-in-africa-plays-out-in-central-african-republic-/7782634.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
As warming threatens polar bear tourism, a Canadian town adapts and thrives	CHURCHILL, Manitoba — Change has broken, remade and continues to reshape this remote town where tundra meets forest on the shore of Hudson Bay. The economic base collapsed when the military left town. Rail service and cargo ships — the lifeblood of supplies for a town not connected to the rest of the world by roads — blinked out. The weather is warming, signature animals are dwindling and even the ground is shifting. Through it all, Churchill has adapted. The town turned to tourism, luring people eager to see its plentiful polar bears. Leaders figured out ways to revitalize its port and railway. As climate change has edged into the picture, they've begun designing more flexible buildings and seeking to entice more varied visitors if, as scientists fear, shrinking sea ice crashes the bear population. Residents, government officials and experts say the town is a model for coping with dramatic shifts and attribute it to the rural mindset that focuses on fixing, not whining. Churchill sits about 1,700 kilometers north of Winnipeg. The town had thousands of people before the military base and a rocket research launch site shut down decades ago. Those sites fell into decay, and what had been a bustling port closed. Train service stopped for more than a year as weather shattered poorly maintained tracks. As the town dwindled, bears began coming to town more often, no longer frightened away by noise from the base and rocket launches and made desperate as climate change shrank the Hudson Bay ice they depend on as a base for hunting. A local mechanic built a fat-tired, souped-up recreational vehicle to see bears safely. Photos and documentaries attracted tourists, who spend $5,000 a visit on average and millions of dollars overall. Churchill now bills itself as the polar bear capital of the world, and though it has no stoplights, it features upscale restaurants and plenty of mom-and-pop hotels. If that comes to an end, Churchill hopes to be ready. The town is promoting tourism for beluga whales, although those too may be harmed as the entire Hudson Bay ecosystem, including the food the belugas eat, shifts to one usually seen further south. It's also highlighting visitors' prospects for seeing the northern lights, spotting birds they can't see at home, and even trying dogsledding. 'In time you're going to lose bear season. And we know that. Anyway, it's just a matter of we're going to have to adapt to that change,' said Mike Spence, mayor since 1995. 'You can't stew over it. That's not going to get you any points.' Spence grew up with the military installation 'and all of a sudden it closes and then all of a sudden you get the tourists, the abundance of wildlife and the aurora. That's where you take advantage of it. You sort of tweak things and you improve life.' The shuttered port and the damaged train tracks? The town took them over and got both running again. Ground sinking because the weather is getting rainier and permafrost is thawing? New buildings like the ones at Polar Bears International, a nonprofit conservation organization with headquarters in the city, have metal jacks that can be adjusted when a corner sinks nearly half a foot in five years. Lauren Sorkin, executive director of the Resilient Cities Network, said every city should have a plan to adapt to climate change's effect on economy and tourism. 'Churchill is a standout example of a city that is planning ahead to protect communities and preserve our natural environment and its biodiversity,' she said. Spence, who is Cree, grew up with no electricity or running water in 'the flats' on the outskirts of town, which was run by a white minority. Churchill is about two-thirds Indigenous with Cree, Metis, Inuit and Dene. Spence recalls his father saying that if only he spoke better English he could tell officials how to fix the town. 'I think I'm doing that for him,' Spence said. 'You don't just say 'I got a problem.' You go there with the fix.' You can't drive to Churchill. Food, people, cargo, everything gets there by rail, boats or plane. Rail is the cheapest, and most residents travel by taking the overnight train to Thompson, then driving south from there. Until a few years ago the train tracks, which had been leased to a private company, were not being maintained properly and the wet, stormy spring of 2017 created 22 washouts of the line between Churchill and points south, Spence said. The company couldn't afford to fix them. Big storms in Churchill are as much as 30% rainier than 80 years ago because of human-caused climate change, said Cornell University climate scientist Angie Pendergrass. 'Service stopped dead' for 18 months, Spence said. 'It was just devastating.' Meanwhile, there weren't enough goods coming into the aging port. Spence said that shipping hub and rail lines needed to operate as an integrated system, and not be run by an absentee U.S. owner, so the town negotiated with the federal and provincial governments for local control and federal financial help. In 2018, Arctic Gateway Group, a partnership of 41 First Nations and northern communities, took ownership of the port and rail line. Rail service returned on Halloween that year. Manitoba officials said that in the last two years 610 kilometers of track have been upgraded and 10 bridges repaired. Shipping in the port has more than tripled since 2021, including the return of its first cruise ship in decade, they said. Earlier this year, officials announced another $60 million in port and rail funding. Local ownership is key in Churchill, said former Chamber of Commerce president Dave Daley, who left town in the 1980s but returned after five years because he and his wife missed it. Big hotel chains poked around once and said they could fix up the town's infrastructure and build something big. 'We all stood and said 'no',' Daley said. 'We're a tight-knit group. We have our different opinions and everything else but we know how we want Churchill to be.' As Churchill evolves, its forgotten past has surfaced at times as tourists ask about residents and their history, said longtime resident Georgina Berg, who like Spence lived on the flats as a child. That past includes 'not-so-happy stories' about forced relocation, missing women, poverty, subsistence hunting, being ignored, deaths and abuse, said Berg, who is Cree. Daley, a dogsled racer and president of Indigenous Tourism Manitoba, tells of how the Metis people were especially ignored, abused and punished, yet he ends the history lesson with an abrupt shift. 'We can't change five minutes ago, but we can change five minutes from now,' Daley said. 'So that's what I teach my kids. You know it's nice to know the history and all the atrocities and everything that happened, but if we're going to get better from that we have to look forward and look five minutes from now and what we can do to change that.' Meanwhile, Daley and Spence notice the changes in the weather — not only warmer, but they're getting thunder here, something once unimaginable. The Arctic is warming four times faster than the rest of the world. While Churchill isn't quite as bad off because it's south of the Arctic Circle, 'it's something we take seriously,' Spence said. 'It's a matter of finding the right blend in how you adapt to climate change,' Spence said. 'And work with it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-warming-threatens-polar-bear-tourism-a-canadian-town-adapts-and-thrives/7781156.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Brazil officially welcomes return of sacred Indigenous cloak from Denmark	RIO DE JANEIRO — Brazil formally received on Thursday the return from Denmark of an Indigenous cloak made with 4,000 red feathers of the scarlet ibis bird, a sacred mantle that was taken by Europeans during the 17th century colonial era. President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva attended the ceremony outside Brazil's National Museum in Rio de Janeiro, marking the importance that Brazil gives to the item's repatriation. The cloak, a feathered ceremonial cape used in religious rituals of the Tupinamba people of Bahia in northeastern Brazil, was removed during the Dutch occupation of the area. Its first mention comes in a Danish inventory in 1689, although it is thought to have been taken from Brazil some 50 years before. By the 21st century it was held in the ethnographic collection of Denmark's National Museum, the Nationalmuseet. In 2000, the museum lent the cloak out for an exhibition in Sao Paulo. A Tupinamba leader saw it there and demanded its return. Last year, after lengthy diplomatic negotiations, the Danish museum announced it would donate the cloak to Brazil's National Museum, and it was repatriated in July. Some 170 Tupinamba traveled from southern Bahia to Rio to celebrate its return. 'It is crucial they return what isn't theirs and rightfully belongs to us. Our heritage strengthens our identity,' said cacique, or chief, Jamopoty Tupinamba to Agencia Brasil on Wednesday. From the first Portuguese voyages to Brazil in the early 16th century, Indigenous cultural items were taken to Europe as evidence of the 'discovery' of new territories and then entered museums or private collections. A fresco painted in 1674 on the ceiling of the Apollo Salon at the Palace of Versailles, the king's throne room, depicts newly found America as a woman wearing a Tupinamba cloak as if it were a headdress. According to cultural heritage activist Gliceria Tupinamba, there are another 10 such cloaks in Europe, held in museums and libraries in Italy, France, Belgium, Switzerland and Denmark, where the National Museum still has one large and three partial ones. 'It took more than 20 years to get the cloak back. Its return is a symbol of the protection of our cultural and land rights that are under threat today in Brazil,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-officially-welcomes-return-of-sacred-indigenous-cloak-from-denmark/7782592.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
Brazil's Lula pledges to finish paving road experts say could worsen Amazon deforestation	brasilia — In a visit to see the damage caused by drought and fire in the Amazon, President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pledged to pave a road that environmentalists and some in his own government say threatens to vastly increase destruction of the world's largest tropical forest — and contribute to climate change. The BR-319 roadway is a mostly dirt road through the rainforest that connects the states of Amazonas and Roraima to the rest of the country. It ends in Manaus, the Amazon's largest city with over 2 million people, and runs parallel to the Madeira River, a major tributary of the Amazon River. The Madeira is at its lowest recorded level, disrupting cargo navigation, with most of its riverbed now endless sand dunes under a sky thick with smoke. 'We are aware that, while the river was navigable and full, the highway didn't have the importance it has now, while the Madeira River was alive. We can't leave two capitals isolated. But we will do it with the utmost responsibility,' Lula said Tuesday during a visit to an Indigenous community in Manaquiri, in Amazonas state. He didn't specify what steps the government would take to try to prevent deforestation from increasing after paving. Hours later, he oversaw the signing of a contract to pave 52 kilometers (32 miles) of the road, and promised to begin work before his term ends in 2026 on the most controversial section of the road — a 400-kilometer (249-mile) stretch through old-growth forest. A permit for the longer stretch was issued under Lula's far-right predecessor, Jair Bolsonaro, who favored development in the Amazon and weakened environmental protections. In July, a federal court suspended the permit in a lawsuit brought by the Climate Observatory, a network of 119 environmental, civil society and academic groups. Lula's government had appealed the suspension, but it wasn't until his visit on Tuesday that Lula made clear his plan to move ahead with paving. The Climate Observatory lamented the move. 'Without the forest, there is no water, it's interconnected,' said Suely Araujo, a public policy coordinator with the group. 'The paving of the middle section of BR-319, without ensuring environmental governance and the presence of the government in the region, will lead to historic deforestation, as pointed out by many specialists and by Brazil's federal environmental agency in the licensing process.' Lula has sought to portray himself as an environmental protector, and deforestation has slowed significantly since he took over for Bolsonaro. But he has also struck out at times against pressure from richer nations on preserving the Amazon, an invaluable resource for the planet in storing the carbon driving atmospheric warming, and did so again on Tuesday. 'The world that buys our food is demanding that we preserve the Amazon,' he said. 'And why? Because they want us to take care of the air they breathe. They didn't preserve their own lands in the last century during the Industrial Revolution.' Brazil is enduring its worst drought ever recorded, with 59% of the country under stress — an area about half the size of the U.S. In the Amazon, rivers' low levels have stranded hundreds of riverine communities, with shortage of potable water and food. Lula announced a wide distribution of water filters and other measures during his visit to the region. Meanwhile, most of Brazil has been under a thick layer of smoke from wildfires in the Amazon, affecting millions of people in faraway cities such as Sao Paulo, Brasilia and Curitiba and reaching as far south as Argentina and Paraguay. At Lula's event, Environment Minister Marina Silva blamed the extreme drought brought by climate change for the widespread fires in a rainforest usually resistant to fire, calling it 'a phenomenon we don't even know how to handle.' Silva has been more cautious than Lula about paving the roadway. At a congressional hearing earlier, she called the Bolsonaro era's permit a 'sham' and praised the judicial ruling that suspended it. Brazil is the world's fifth-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, contributing nearly 3% of global emissions, according to Climate Watch, an online platform managed by the World Resources Institute. Almost half these emissions stem from destruction of trees in the Amazon rainforest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-s-lula-pledges-to-finish-paving-road-that-experts-say-could-worsen-amazon-deforestation-/7782627.html	2024-09-14T00:00:00-07:00	
China condemns German navy's transit of Taiwan Strait	BEIJING — China's military on Saturday condemned the transit of two German navy ships through the Taiwan Strait, saying it increased security risks and sent the 'wrong' signal, adding that Chinese forces monitored and warned the vessels. China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own, says it alone exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction over the strait. Both the United States and Taiwan say the strait -- a major trade route through which about half of global container ships pass -- is an international waterway. The People's Liberation Army's Eastern Theater Command said the passage of the two ships -- a frigate and a supply vessel -- was 'public hyping,' and that its navy and air forces monitored and warned them throughout. 'The German side's behavior increases security risks and sends the wrong signal. Troops in the theater are on high alert at all times and will resolutely counter all threats and provocations,' it said in a statement. China's embassy in Germany said in a separate statement it had lodged 'representations' with Berlin, saying Taiwan belonged to China, a position the democratically elected government in Taipei strongly rejects. 'The question of Taiwan is not a matter of 'freedom of navigation,' but of China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,' it said. The Taiwan Strait is Chinese waters 'and there are no so-called 'international waters' at all,' the embassy added. China urges Germany to avoid any 'interference' that would jeopardize the healthy and stable development of bilateral relations, it added. Taiwan's government says only the island's people can decide their future. U.S. warships sail through the strait around once every two months, drawing the ire of Beijing, and some U.S. allies like Canada and Britain have also made occasional transits.

In Belarus, the native language is vanishing as Russian takes prominence	TALLINN, Estonia — When school started this year for Mikalay in Belarus, the 15-year-old discovered that his teachers and administrators no longer called him by that name. Instead, they referred to him as Nikolai, its Russian equivalent. What's more, classes at his school — one of the country's best — are now taught in Russian, not Belarusian, which he has spoken for most of his life. Belarusians like Mikalay are experiencing a new wave of Russification as Moscow expands its economic, political and cultural dominance to overtake the identity of its neighbor. It's not the first time. Russia under the czars and in the era of the Soviet Union imposed its language, symbols and cultural institutions on Belarus. But with the demise of the USSR in 1991, the country began to assert its identity, and Belarusian briefly became the official language, with the white-red-white national flag replacing a version of the red hammer and sickle. But all that changed in 1994, after Alexander Lukashenko, a former Soviet collective farm official, came to power. The authoritarian leader made Russian an official language, alongside Belarusian, and did away with the nationalist symbols. Now, with Lukashenko in control of the country for over three decades, he has allowed Russia to dominate all aspects of life in Belarus, a country of 9.5 million people. Belarusian, which like Russian uses the Cyrillic alphabet, is hardly heard on the streets of Minsk and other large cities anymore. Official business is conducted in Russian, which dominates the majority of the media. Lukashenko speaks only Russian, and government officials often don't use their native tongue. The country depends on Russian loans and cheap energy and has created a political and military alliance with Moscow, allowing President Vladimir Putin to deploy troops and missiles on its soil, which was used as a staging area for the war in Ukraine. 'I understand that our Belarus is occupied. … And who is the president there? Not Lukashenko. The president is Putin,' said Svetlana Alexievich, who won the 2015 Nobel Prize for literature and lives in Germany in effective exile. 'The nation has been humiliated and it will be very difficult for Belarusians to recover from this.' Belarusian cultural figures have been persecuted and hundreds of its nationalist organizations have been closed. Experts say Moscow is seeking to implement in Belarus what the Kremlin intended to do in neighboring Ukraine when the war there began in 2022. 'It is obvious that our children are being deliberately deprived of their native language, history and Belarusian identity, but parents have been strongly advised not to ask questions about Russification,' said Mikalay's father, Anatoly, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition his last name not be used, for fear of retribution. 'We were informed about the synchronization of the curriculum with Russia this year and were shown a propaganda film about how the Ukrainian special services are allegedly recruiting our teenagers and forcing them to commit sabotage in Belarus,' he said. Mikalay's school was one of the few where paperwork and some courses were conducted in Belarusian. In recent years, however, dozens of teachers were fired and the Belarusian-language section of its website vanished. Human rights advocate Ales Bialiatski, convicted in 2023 on charges stemming from his Nobel Peace Prize-winning work, demanded his trial be conducted in Belarusian. The court rejected it and sentenced him to 10 years. Lukashenko derides his native language, saying 'nothing great can be expressed in Belarusian. … There are only two great languages in the world: Russian and English.' Speaking to Russian state media, Lukashenko recounted how Putin once thanked him for making Russian the dominant language in Belarus. 'I said, 'Wait, what are you thanking me for? ... The Russian language is my language, we were part of one empire, and we're taking part in [helping] that language develop,'' Lukashenko said. Belarus was part of the Russian empire for centuries and became one of 15 Soviet republics after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution. Daily use of the Belarusian language decreased and continued only in the country's west and north and in rural areas. In 1994, about 40% of students were taught in Belarusian; it's now down to under 9%. Although Belarusian, like Russian, is an eastern Slavic language, its vocabulary is considerably different. In 1517, Belarusian publisher Francysk Skaryna was one of the first in Eastern Europe to translate the Bible into his native language. Even speaking Belarusian is seen as a show of opposition to Lukashenko and a declaration of national identity. That played a key role in the mass protests after the disputed 2020 election gave the authoritarian leader a sixth term. In the harsh crackdown that followed, a half-million people fled the country. 'The Belarusian language is increasingly perceived as a sign of political disloyalty and is being abandoned in favor of Russian in the public administration, education, culture and the mass media, upon orders from the hierarchy or out of fear of discrimination,' said Anaïs Marin, the United Nations special rapporteur for human rights in Belarus. At the same time, 'more people want to speak Belarusian, which has become one of the symbols of freedom, but they're afraid to do it in public,' said Alina Nahornaja, author of Language 404, a book about Belarusians who experienced discrimination for speaking their native language. Like Ukraine, Belarusians had a desire for rapprochement with Europe that accompanied their nationalist sentiment, said Belarusian analyst Valery Karbalevich. 'But the Kremlin quickly realized the danger and began the process of creeping Russification in Belarus,' he added. That prompted pro-Russian organizations, joint educational programs and cultural projects to spring up 'like mushrooms after the rain — against the backdrop of harsh repressions against everything Belarusian,' Karbalevich said. Censorship and bans affect not only contemporary Belarusian literature but also its classics. In 2023, the prosecutor's office declared as extremist the 19th-century poems of Vincent Dunin-Martsinkyevich, who opposed the Russian Empire. When the Kremlin began supporting Lukashenko against the anti-government protests in 2020, it ensured his loyalty and received carte blanche in Belarus. 'Today, Lukashenko is paying Putin with our sovereignty,' said exiled opposition leader Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya. 'Belarusian national identity, cultures and language are our strongest weapons against the Russian world and Russification.' Four cities in Belarus now host a 'Russia House' to promote its culture and influence, offering seminars, film clubs, exhibitions and competitions. 'The goal is to plant Russian narratives so that as many Belarusians as possible view Russian as their own,' said analyst Alexander Friedman. 'The Kremlin spares no expense and acts on a grand scale, which could be especially effective and dangerous in a situation where Belarus has found itself in information isolation, and there is almost no one left inside the country to resist the Russian world.' Almost the entire troupe of the Yanka Kupala Theater, the country's oldest, fled Belarus amid the political crackdown. Its former director, Pavel Latushka, now an opposition figure abroad, said the new management couldn't recruit enough new actors, and had to invite Russians, 'but it turned out that no one knew the Belarusian language.' 'Putin published an article denying the existence of an independent Ukraine back in 2021, and even then we understood perfectly well that he was pursuing similar goals in Belarus,' Latushka said. 'The main course was supposed to be Ukraine,' he added, with a Russified Belarus 'as a dessert.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-belarus-the-native-language-is-vanishing-as-russian-takes-prominence/7784130.html	2024-09-13T22:52:01-07:00

Slave to fear': Ghosts of the gulag haunt modern Russia	Moscow — When Russians started being arrested for opposing the Ukraine offensive, Maria felt the same kind of fear she guessed her ancestors, victims of repression under Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, must have lived through. Now 2½ years into its military offensive, Russia has imprisoned hundreds for protesting or speaking out against the campaign -- even in private -- in a crackdown that has paralyzed the Kremlin's domestic critics. 'It's not normal when you start behaving like your ancestors did. Twitching every time the phone rings ... thinking all the time about who you are talking with and what you are talking about,' Maria, a 47-year-old from Moscow, told AFP. 'My fear is growing.' Leafing through a book with photos of victims of Stalin's purges, Maria pointed to her great-grandfather. Of Polish origin, he was declared an 'enemy of the people' and executed in 1938 for 'spying.' He was posthumously rehabilitated after Stalin's death in 1953. His wife was also targeted, spending four years in the gulag, the Soviet network of harsh prison labor camps. Maria's grandmother, who had to live with the stigma of her parents being dubbed 'enemies of the people,' constantly worried she too would be arrested. Maria now feels a similar fear, concerned she could be labelled a 'foreign agent' -- a modern-day label with Stalin-era connotations that is used to marginalize critics of President Vladimir Putin's regime. Self-censorship Putin's Russia also has harsher legal tools at its disposal to target its opponents. Under military censorship laws, people can be convicted for up to 15 years for spreading 'false information' about the military campaign in Ukraine. In such a climate, Maria, an English professor at a university, is cautious about how she behaves and what she says in public. Outside her circle of close friends, she hides her pacifist convictions and her fondness for Ukrainian culture. She doesn't discuss politics with her colleagues, and lives in fear that somebody could denounce her for reading Western news or social media sites blocked in Russia that she accesses through a VPN. English itself is now considered an 'enemy language' that raises suspicions, said Maria, who asked for her surname to be withheld. When she is reading news articles on her phone on public transport, she said she 'immediately closes' the page and starts playing a game 'if I realize there is a person next to me not reading anything but just looking around.' Fearing her phone will be searched at passport control, she cleanses it before traveling of any chats where the fighting in Ukraine might have been mentioned. She is also afraid to wear her vyshyvanka, a traditional stitched Ukrainian shirt, in public, and shuns combining yellow and blue clothes -- the colors of the Ukrainian flag. 'Do not dare' After a brief eruption of anticonflict rallies in February 2022, the Kremlin has since stymied almost all shows of public opposition. 'People do not dare to protest, do not dare to speak out,' said Svetlana Gannushkina, a prominent Russian rights activist who has been labelled a 'foreign agent.' Heavy sentences for regime critics along with harsh treatment of prisoners has scared many into silence, she said. Gannushkina pointed to what she called a 'historical, maybe even genetic, fear' in a country that has seen multiple bouts of political repression -- from serfdom in the Russian Empire, the Bolsheviks' 'Red Terror' after the 1917 Revolution and the 1930s purges under Stalin. Her Memorial group worked to preserve the memory of victims of Communist repression and campaigned against modern rights violations until Russian authorities shut it down in 2021. Through history, repression has repeatedly 'divided society into those who were ready to submit and those who did not want to, understood that resistance leads to nothing, and left,' Gannushkina told AFP. 'History has made a kind of natural selection. ... And now we've got a whole generation of people who are not ready to resist.' 'Slave to fear' For Soviet dissident Alexander Podrabinek, 71, fear 'is not an ethnic, national or genetic peculiarity' specific to Russia. 'I have visited several totalitarian countries besides the Soviet Union and the situation is basically the same everywhere,' he told AFP. 'Fear is the main obstacle to a normal life in our country. ... Fear demoralizes people, deprives them of their freedom.' 'Someone who is afraid is no longer free. They become a slave to their fear, living without being able to realize their potential,' he added. Podrabinek was exiled to Russia's Siberia in 1978 and then imprisoned in 1981 after writing a book on punitive psychiatry in the USSR. Despite pressure from the KGB security services, he refused to leave the country. 'The only thing that can overcome fear,' he said, 'is the conviction that you are right.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/slave-to-fear-ghosts-of-the-gulag-haunt-modern-russia/7784121.html	2024-09-13T21:29:03-07:00	
Myanmar junta makes rare request for foreign aid to cope with deadly floods	Yangon, Myanmar — Myanmar's junta chief made a rare request Saturday for foreign aid to cope with deadly floods that have displaced hundreds of thousands of people who have endured three years of war. Floods and landslides have killed almost 300 people in Myanmar, Vietnam, Laos and Thailand in the wake of Typhoon Yagi, which dumped a colossal deluge of rain when it hit the region last weekend. In Myanmar more than 235,000 people have been forced from their homes by floods, the junta said Friday, piling further misery on the country where war has raged since the military seized power in 2021. 'Officials from the government need to contact foreign countries to receive rescue and relief aid to be provided to the victims,' Min Aung Hlaing said on Friday, according to the Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper. 'It is necessary to manage rescue, relief and rehabilitation measures as quickly as possible,' he was quoted as saying. The junta gave a death toll on Friday of 33, while earlier in the day the country's fire department said rescuers had recovered 36 bodies. A military spokesman said it had lost contact with some areas of the country and was investigating reports that dozens had been buried in landslides in a gold-mining area in the central Mandalay region. Aid restrictions Myanmar's military has previously blocked or frustrated humanitarian assistance from abroad. Last year it suspended travel authorizations for aid groups trying to reach around a million victims of powerful Cyclone Mocha that hit the west of the country. At the time the United Nations slammed that decision as 'unfathomable.' AFP has contacted a spokesperson for the U.N. in Myanmar for comment. After cyclone Nargis killed at least 138,000 people in Myanmar in 2008, the then-junta was accused of blocking emergency aid and initially refusing to grant access to humanitarian workers and supplies. Military trucks carried small rescue boats to flood-hit areas around the military-built capital Naypyidaw on Saturday, AFP reporters said. On Friday hundreds of villagers waded or swam through chin-high waters to safety following floods around the capital. Some told AFP they had sheltered in trees overnight to escape the raging flood waters below. State media said flooding in the area around the capital had caused landslides and destroyed electricity towers, buildings, roads, bridges and houses. More than 2.7 million people were already displaced in Myanmar by conflict triggered by the junta's 2021 coup.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-junta-makes-rare-request-for-foreign-aid-to-cope-with-deadly-floods/7784118.html	2024-09-13T20:48:15-07:00	
South Sudan postpones elections by 2 years, citing incomplete preparations	JUBA, South Sudan — The government in South Sudan has postponed elections scheduled for December for two years citing the need to complete processes such as a census, the drafting of a permanent constitution and the registration of political parties. The Presidential Adviser on National Security Tut Gatluak on Friday said the extension would provide an opportunity to complete critical processes before the new election date of December 22, 2026. This is the second time the country, which gained independence in 2011, is postponing elections and extending a transitional period that started in February 2020. President Salva Kiir and his former rival turned deputy, Riek Machar, signed a peace agreement in 2018 that ended a five-year civil war in which more than 400,000 people died. Cabinet Affairs Minister Martin Elia Lomuro said the extension followed recommendations from both electoral institutions and the security sector. Last month, the chairperson of National Election Commission, Professor Abednego Akok, told The Associated Press the country was behind the electoral calendar, which required voter registration to have started in June but was still pending due to a shortage of funds. The country is going through an economic crisis that has seen civil servants go unpaid for almost one year, after it's oil exports were affected by a damaged pipeline in war-torn neighboring Sudan through which it exports. The Tumaini initiative peace talks that have been going on in neighboring Kenya, believed to provide a foundation for the inclusion of non-signatory groups to sustain peace, have also stalled. A new security act that allows for warrantless detentions became law in August despite concerns from human rights groups that it would create fear in the runup to the elections. Andrea Mach Mabior, an independent political analyst, warned that any sham elections may result in a waste of resources and chaos. 'Going for elections that do not meet international standards will be a waste of money,' Mabior told the AP. But others like Edmund Yakani, executive director of the Community Empowerment Progress Organization, said delays to the elections or any extension of the transitional period would create a possibility of violence erupting across the fragile country. 'If we fail to conduct the elections in December 2024 the chance of the country turning into violence is higher than if we go for the elections,' Yakani told the AP in August. The country, which has gone through the shocks of civil war and climate change is in need of humanitarian aid with an estimated 9 million people — 73% of the country's population — projected to be in need of humanitarian assistance during 2024, according to the 2024 UN Humanitarian Needs Overview for South Sudan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-postpones-elections-by-2-years-citing-incomplete-preparations-/7784116.html	2024-09-13T20:39:58-07:00	
Dozens of Hong Kong journalists threatened in harassment campaign, says HKJA	BANGKOK — Dozens of Hong Kong journalists and their families have been harassed and intimidated in the past three months, according to the chair of a local press club. The Hong Kong Journalists Association or HKJA said Friday it had tracked 'systematic' and 'organized' attacks on journalists from June to August this year. At least 15 journalists and their family members, employers and neighbors were harassed both online and offline, the press club said. Selina Cheng, the chair of the HKJA, said in a press conference Friday that it is the biggest case of intimidation that the association has ever seen. 'I don’t believe this is right, and that’s why we are making a loud call today to say we do not accept such behavior,' she said. 'This type of intimidation and harassment, which includes sharing false and defamatory content and death threats, damages press freedom,' she added. Journalists from multiple Hong Kong media outlets have been affected, with anonymous threats and harassment made via social media email or in the mail, the HKJA said in a statement. Some of those targeted received threats to their personal safety and were warned to give up their employment or position within associations, the HKJA added. 'HKJA has gathered detailed information on a number of affected journalists and organisations,' the statement read. Those affected include two journalism education institutions and 13 media outlets, including the executive committee of the HKJA, Hong Kong Free Press, InMediaHK, and HK Feature. Many of the letters and emails warned that association with the named organizations or people could be a violation of Hong Kong’s national security laws. The emails and letters were sent anonymously, with emails sent from Microsoft Outlook accounts. On social media, posts showed photos of journalists and members of the HKJA executive committee pictured alongside images of knives, blood, shooting targets and 'memorial' signs. The Hong Kong Free Press condemned the attacks. In a statement shared on social media, it said that the landlord of the news website’s director, Tom Grundy, had received threatening letters, saying 'unimaginable consequences' would occur unless Grundy was evicted from his property. Grundy reported the threats to police, the news website said. Media watchdog Reporters Without Borders or RSF called on the international community to take action. 'We strongly condemn this harassment campaign led against the independent media outlets that managed to survive the previous waves of government repression,' said Cedric Alviani, RSF’s Asia-Pacific bureau director. 'We urge the international community to intensify its pressure on the Chinese regime so press freedom is fully restored in the territory.' VOA requested comment late Friday from the Hong Kong Police Force but did not immediately receive a response. Hong Kong’s undersecretary for security, Michael Cheuk, told media 'no one should be intimidated, insulted, or so-called harassed.' Cheuk urged anyone who felt under pressure to report it to law agencies, Reuters reported. The HKJA said that it has contacted Meta, which owns Facebook, and Wikimedia Foundation, the two main platforms used in the harassment campaign. Cheng told VOA she believes a person or group of people are responsible. 'Bots means they are machine-controlled. I don’t think that’s the case,' she added. Details of the intimidation campaign come as critics warn that press freedom is being eroded in Hong Kong. Since Beijing imposed a national security law on Hong Kong in 2020 — which carries life imprisonment for those found guilty of what are deemed as sedition, subversion, foreign interference or terrorism — news outlets have shuttered and there is greater self-censorship on sensitive issues, say media experts. Activists, political figures, lawmakers and reporters are cautious about speaking on the record to the media, with most declining to be interviewed for fear of reprisal. Media unions like the Hong Kong Journalist Association have also come under pressure, after being criticized by authorities and Chinese state media for alleged links to activist organizations. The governments of Hong Kong and China have said that the security law has brought stability back to the former British colony. But since 2020, dozens of people have been arrested under the legislation. At least 28 of those arrested were journalists or press freedom defenders. In August, two journalists from the now-defunct Stand News website were found guilty of sedition in a landmark case. And the pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai is in prison and on trial under the national security law for charges he denies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dozens-of-hong-kong-journalists-threatened-in-harassment-campaign-says-hkja/7784104.html	2024-09-13T19:19:17-07:00

Iraqi, US forces kill top IS commander, other militants in joint operation	baghdad — Iraqi forces and American troops have killed a senior commander with the Islamic State group who was wanted by the United States, as well as several other prominent militants, Iraq's military said Friday. The operation in Iraq's western Anbar province began in late August, the Iraqi military said, and involved members of the Iraqi National Intelligence Service and Iraq's air force. Among the dead was an IS commander from Tunisia, known as Abu Ali Al-Tunisi; the U.S. Treasury Department had offered $5 million for information about him. Also killed was Ahmad Hamed Zwein, the IS deputy commander in Iraq. Despite their defeat, attacks by IS sleeper cells in Iraq and Syria have been on the rise over the past years, with scores of people killed or wounded. Friday's announcement was not the first news of the operation. Two weeks ago, officials said that the U.S. military and Iraq launched a joint raid targeting suspected IS militants in the country's western desert that killed at least 15 people and left seven American troops hurt. Five of the American troops were wounded in the raid itself, while two others suffered injuries from falls during the operation. One who suffered a fall was transported out of the region, while one of the wounded was evacuated for further treatment, a U.S. defense official said at the time, speaking on condition of anonymity. In Friday's announcement, the Iraqi military said the operation also confiscated weapons and computers, smartphones and 10 explosives belts. It added that 14 IS commanders were identified after DNA tests were conducted. It made no mention of the 15th person killed and whether that person had also been identified. The U.S. military has not commented on the August raid. The Islamic State group seized territory at the height of its power and declared a caliphate in large parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014 but was defeated in Iraq in 2017. In March 2019, the extremists lost the last sliver of land they once controlled in eastern Syria. At its peak, the group ruled an area half the size of the United Kingdom where it enforced its extreme interpretation of Islam, which included attacks on religious minority groups and harsh punishment of Muslims deemed to be apostates. Earlier Friday, the U.S. Central Command said its forces killed an IS attack cell member in a strike in eastern Syria. It added that the individual was planting an improvised explosive device for a planned attack against anti-IS coalition forces and their partners, an apparent reference to Syria's Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. In August last year, the U.S. had agreed to enter into talks to transition U.S. and anti-IS coalition forces from their long-standing role in assisting Iraq in combating IS. There are approximately 2,500 U.S. troops in the country, and their departure will take into account the security situation on the ground, and the capabilities of the Iraqi armed forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iraqi-us-forces-kill-top-is-commander-other-militants-in-joint-operation/7784098.html	2024-09-13T18:47:00-07:00	
China’s retirement age, among youngest in world, set to rise	BEIJING — Starting next year, China will raise its retirement age for workers, which is now among the youngest in the world's major economies, in an effort to address its shrinking population and aging work force. The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's legislature, passed the new policy Friday after a sudden announcement earlier in the week that it was reviewing the measure, state broadcaster CCTV announced. The policy change will be carried out over 15 years, with the retirement age for men raised to 63 years, and for women to 55 or 58 years depending on their jobs. The current retirement age is 60 for men and 50 for women in blue-collar jobs and 55 for women doing white-collar work. 'We have more people coming into the retirement age, and so the pension fund is (facing) high pressure. That's why I think it's now time to act seriously,' said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Australia who studies China's population and its ties to the economy. The previous retirement ages were set in the 1950's, when life expectancy was only around 40 years, Peng said. The policy will be implemented starting in January, according to the announcement from China's legislature. The change will take effect progressively based on people's birthdates. For example, a man born in January 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 7 months in August 2032, according to a chart released along with the policy. A man born in May 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 8 months in January 2033. Demographic pressures made the move long overdue, experts say. By the end of 2023, China counted nearly 300 million people over the age of 60. By 2035, that figure is projected to be 400 million, larger than the population of the U.S. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences had previously projected that the public pension fund will run out of money by that year. Pressure on social benefits such as pensions and social security is hardly a China-specific problem. The U.S. also faces the issue as analysis shows that currently, the Social Security fund won't be able to pay out full benefits to people by 2033. 'This is happening everywhere,' said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. 'But in China with its large elderly population, the challenge is much larger.' That is on top of fewer births, as younger people opt out of having children, citing high costs. In 2022, China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that for the first time the country had 850,000 fewer people at the end of the year than the previous year, a turning point from population growth to decline. In 2023, the population shrank further, by 2 million people. What that means is that the burden of funding elderly people's pensions will be divided among a smaller group of younger workers, as pension payments are largely funded by deductions from people who are currently working. Researchers measure that pressure by looking at a number called the dependency ratio, which counts the number of people over the age of 65 compared to the number of workers under 65. That number was 21.8% in 2022, according to government statistics, meaning that roughly five workers would support one retiree. The percentage is expected to rise, meaning fewer workers will be shouldering the burden of one retiree.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-retirement-age-among-youngest-in-world-set-to-rise-/7784095.html	2024-09-13T18:41:22-07:00	
US drone was struck, recovered in Middle East, defense official says	pentagon — A U.S. MQ-9 drone was struck but safely recovered while operating in the Middle East this week, a U.S. defense official told VOA on Friday. 'We can confirm that a U.S. Air Force MQ-9 drone was struck but then landed safely and was recovered by U.S. partner forces on September 9. An investigation into the incident is underway. There were no reported injuries,' the defense official, who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss national security sensitivities, said in a statement. The news came days after Yemen's Iranian-backed Houthi militants claimed they shot down an MQ-9 drone flying over that country. Houthi spokesperson Brigadier General Yahya Saree said in a prerecorded video message Sunday that the drone had been shot down over Yemen's Marib province, home to key oil and gas fields. The province has been held by allies of a Saudi-led coalition that has been at war with the Houthis for years. It was unclear from the U.S. statement where in the Middle East the drone was struck or who struck it. It was also unclear if the drone was struck and recovered on the same day — Monday — or struck before the Monday recovery. When VOA asked for clarification, it was told there were 'no additional details to share at this time.' The Houthis have downed U.S. drones several times since 2014, when the Iranian-backed group seized Yemen's capital. The attacks on U.S. drones, along with attacks on commercial and military vessels transiting the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, have drastically increased since the start of the Israel-Hamas war. The Houthis' continuous assault campaign has disrupted commercial shipping in the important corridor, prompting many shipping companies to reroute ships. The militants have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October, seizing one, sinking two and killing at least four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets. The Houthi militant campaign began after Israel launched a retaliatory attack against Hamas in Gaza following Hamas' October 7 terror attack, and the Houthis claim they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians during the war. MQ-9 drones, also known as Reapers, cost around $30 million each, can fly up to 24 hours before landing, and can reach altitudes of about 15,000 meters. The aircraft have been flown by both the U.S. military and the CIA over Yemen for years. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-drone-was-struck-recovered-in-middle-east-defense-official-says-/7784085.html	2024-09-13T18:21:01-07:00	
Mounting North Korean threats await next US president	washington — Recent moves by Pyongyang have focused attention on what will be one of the first major foreign policy challenges facing the next U.S. president: how to deal with North Korea’s rapidly developing nuclear threat. In a set of rapid-fire developments on Friday: — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un called for an 'exponential increase' in the size of his nation’s nuclear arsenal, according to the state-run news agency KCNA. He made the same call in speeches on Tuesday and on the last day of 2022. — State media released photos for the first time of the Nuclear Weapons Institute where North Korea processes uranium for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. The photos, which showed a sophisticated array of centrifuges, were made public as Kim toured the facility. — North Korea announced that it had tested a new type of 600 mm multiple rocket launcher the previous day. South Korea said on Thursday that North Korea test-fired several short-range ballistic missiles into the waters off the eastern coast. The developments came in the context of enhanced military cooperation between North Korea and Russia, which is believed to be helping Pyongyang to develop its weapons capabilities in exchange for munitions used in Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine. 'The threat from North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs has been growing steadily and virtually unchecked over the course of several U.S. administrations,' said Evans Revere, a former State Department official with extensive experience negotiating with North Korea. 'Whoever the next U.S. president is, she or he will face a more sophisticated and dangerous North Korean threat.' Revere said in an interview that the winner of the U.S. election would have to find ways to weaken the link between Moscow and Pyongyang 'and demonstrate to Beijing that its ‘partnership without limits’ with Russia is a dangerous and ill-advised path that will yield no benefits' for China. Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping declared in May a 'new era' in opposition to the U.S. and reaffirmed the 'no limits' partnership that was first announced just days before Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. While China has held back on providing Russia with arms for its war effort, the United States has accused it of delivering electronic components and other dual-use items that are keeping Moscow’s arms industry afloat. Pyongyang, for its part, denies participating in any arms transfers to Russia, an act that would violate United Nations sanctions. But a report this week by Conflict Armament Research, a U.K.-based group that tracks weapons in armed conflicts, said parts from four North Korean missiles have been found in Ukraine. The missiles, examined by Kyiv, are either KN-23 or KN-24, known as Hwasong-11 short-range missile series, and thought to have been used in attacks in July and August, the report said. Pyongyang-Moscow military ties have also been expanded to include tourism, trade, and economic and technical cooperation. This makes the use of sanctions less effective as a policy tool to counter North Korea’s nuclear buildup, according to Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration. 'That’s not as much leverage now as it was before because of the Russian-North Korean relationship,' said Samore. 'The U.S. doesn’t have very strong economic leverage that it can use with North Korea.' With few obvious policy options available, the two presidential candidates – former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris – have largely confined themselves to criticizing each other’s approach without laying out any specific plans to roll back the North Korean threat. At Tuesday night’s televised debate, Harris criticized Trump for exchanging 'love letters with Kim Jong Un' during his presidency while Trump disapproved of the current administration’s handling of the issue, saying, 'Look at what’s going on in North Korea.' During his presidency, Trump held three summits with Kim but the diplomatic effort ultimately failed when Trump refused Kim’s demand for sanctions relief in exchange for a partial rollback of his nuclear program. There have been no formal talks between the two countries since, although the Biden administration insists it is open to negotiations without preconditions, a policy that Harris could be expected to continue if elected. The Biden administration also maintains that its goal remains the complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, even as many experts suggest it is time to acknowledge that Pyongyang will not give up its weapons and say the international community should focus on containment. Samore predicted that a Harris administration would continue to say that 'as an ultimate objective ... the U.S. seeks denuclearization in the long term.' A second Trump administration, he theorized, may say 'denuclearization is no longer possible' and 'accept North Korea as a nuclear power.' Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said much would depend on how the winner of the election decides to work with regional allies South Korea and Japan. 'In the likely absence of any grand outreach towards Pyongyang, Harris will have to carefully manage the relationship with ally Seoul, with a focus for the foreseeable future on maintaining peace and stability on the peninsula,' he said. He added that it was 'uncertain at this moment' whether Trump would feel compelled to reach out to Kim and whether he would diminish the value of the alliances with South Korea and Japan.

Pentagon: $5.9B in Ukraine aid is left to be spent before October 1	pentagon — The Pentagon says it has nearly $6 billion in funding for Ukraine left that could expire at the end of this month unless Congress or the State Department acts to extend the military's authority to draw weapons from its stockpiles to send to Kyiv. 'We have $5.9 billion left in Ukraine Presidential Drawdown Authority, all but $100 million of which will expire at the end of the fiscal year,' Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Friday. 'The department will continue to provide drawdown packages in the near future and is working with Congress to seek an extension of PDA [presidential drawdown] authorities beyond the end of the fiscal year.' A defense official, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity, said Congress' monthslong deadlock in passing the supplemental funding bill for Ukraine was a 'contributing factor' as to why billions of dollars for weapons remained unspent. The money was expected to be allocated for Ukraine last year, but the U.S. House was unable to pass the $95 billion foreign aid package for Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan until late April of this year. Of that, about $61 billion was earmarked for Ukraine. The official said the delay left the Pentagon with less time to identify and send military aid to Kyiv from its stockpiles. The nearly $6 billion left in funding amounts to less than 10% of the aid allocated in April to address the conflict in Ukraine. Speaking in response to a VOA question earlier this month, deputy Pentagon press secretary Sabrina Singh said the Pentagon would 'use everything we can that's available to us to make sure that we are continuing to provide Ukraine what it needs, both in the short term and the long term.' 'We're in this fight with Ukraine for the long haul,' she said. Two ways to ensure access There are two ways to make sure that access to the remaining funds will not expire at the beginning of October, Mykola Murskyj, director of advocacy for the NGO Razom for Ukraine, told VOA. The first is that Congress has to approve it again. This requires lawmakers to pass a provision that would extend the authority to use the remaining amount in the next budget year. House members from both sides of the aisle have expressed support for extending the authorities so that all the allocated funding for Kyiv can be used. 'If we need to extend it, we'll extend it,' Representative Adam Smith, the ranking Democrat on the House Armed Services Committee, told VOA. Representative Mike Lawler, a Republican on the House Committee on Foreign Affairs, added that he would 'push to get it done' if the funding was not all spent by the deadline. The second way to ensure the military can access the remaining funds is for the State Department to notify Congress of its intent to use the funds, according to Murskyj. In this case, lawmakers will not need to vote on the extension, but formal notification must be issued by the secretary of state, as has been done in the past. A State Department spokesperson would not comment on whether it would issue the extension, saying it would not discuss communications with lawmakers and their staffs, but would continue 'to coordinate closely with Congress concerning the steadfast support that the United States, our allies and our partners worldwide are providing to help Ukraine defend itself against Russia's premeditated, unprovoked and unjustified war.' Murskyj told VOA his advocacy group was working with members of Congress to extend the funds. 'However, I am not going to put all of my eggs in that basket,' he said, because 'it is very difficult to predict what Congress will do, and there's always the potential for some kind of last-minute derailment.' In a letter to the administration, members of pro-Ukrainian nongovernmental organizations said extending these funds 'would send a powerful message to Ukraine, Russia and American voters that the administration wants Ukraine to win.' Kateryna Lisunova of VOA's Ukrainian Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-5-9b-in-ukraine-aid-is-left-to-be-spent-before-october-1-/7783763.html	2024-09-13T16:56:03-07:00

US slams RT as 'de facto' arm of Russian intelligence	washington — The United States and some of its allies have launched a global campaign to undercut efforts by RT and other Russian state-backed media outlets, accusing them of operating on behalf of the Kremlin’s intelligence agencies. The State Department on Friday announced sanctions against two people and three entities, including RT’s Moscow-based parent company, saying new intelligence leaves no doubt that they are no longer engaged in providing anything that resembles news and information. RT’s parent company and its subsidiaries 'are no longer merely fire hoses of Russian government propaganda and disinformation,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters at the State Department. 'They are engaged in covert influence activities aimed at undermining American elections and democracy, functioning like a de facto arm of Russia's intelligence apparatus,' he said, adding the Russian operations also seek to 'meddle in the sovereign affairs of countries around the world.' Blinken and other U.S. officials declined to share details about the new intelligence, saying only that some of it comes from RT employees, and that it shows how the Russian-controlled television network is playing a key role in running cyber operations and even acquiring lethal weapons for Russian troops fighting in Ukraine. RT quickly ridiculed the U.S. accusations both on social media and in a response to VOA. 'RT: *Lives rent free in the State Department head*,' the outlet posted on X. 'We’re running out of popcorn, but we’ll be here live, laughing hard...' In response to a query from VOA, RT pointed to comments by editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan on her Telegram channel. 'American intelligence services have uncovered that we are helping the front lines,' Simonyan wrote, according to a translation from Russian. 'We’ve been doing this openly, you idiots. Should I send you a list of what we've bought and sent? We regularly publish this, just so you know.' The Russian Embassy in Washington has not yet responded to a request from VOA for comment. U.S. officials, though, said comments like the ones from RT’s Simonyan only give more weight to the allegations. 'They've admitted it,' said James Rubin, the special envoy for the State Department's Global Engagement Center. 'They have said they're operating under direct instruction of [Russian President] Vladimir Putin. That's what they say they're doing.' And the U.S. says the intelligence shows those Kremlin-assigned responsibilities go far beyond what could be considered normal broadcast operations, including oversight of a crowdsourcing campaign to provide Russian troops in Ukraine with sniper rifles, body armor, drones, night vision equipment and other weaponry. 'That's not what a TV station normally does. That's what ... that's what a military entity does,' Rubin said. RT is 'a fully fledged member of the intelligence apparatus and operation of the Russian government on the war in Ukraine.' The U.S. intelligence also points to Kremlin-directed RT operations in Argentina, Germany and the South Caucasus – some linked to a Russian military intelligence cyber team that has been embedded within the company. U.S. officials also said evidence shows RT is 'almost certainly' coordinating with traditional Russian intelligence services to meddle in next month’s presidential elections in Moldova. 'RT is going to be used to try to manipulate an election and, if they don't win the election, manipulate a crowd to try to generate violence for the possibility of overthrowing [the government],' Rubin said. U.S. officials also called out RT for covert influence operations in Latin America and Africa that have had serious consequences. 'One of the reasons why so much of the world has not been as fully supportive of Ukraine as you would think they would be — given that Russia has invaded Ukraine and violated rule number one of the international system — is because of the broad scope and reach of RT,' Rubin said. The State Department said Friday that it had instructed its diplomats to share evidence about RT’s efforts with countries around the world. 'We urge every ally, every partner, to start by treating RT’s activities as they do other intelligence activities by Russia within their borders,' Blinken said. Friday’s sanctions came a little more than a week after the U.S. took action against what it described as two Russian plots, one of them involving RT, aimed at undermining the U.S. presidential elections in November. The U.S. Department of Justice announced the takedown of 32 fake websites designed by Russia to mimic legitimate news sites, to bombard U.S. voters with propaganda aimed at building support for Russia in its war against Ukraine and bolstering support for Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump. The U.S. also unsealed indictments against two RT employees, accusing them of funneling nearly $10 million to a U.S. company in Tennessee to promote and distribute English-language material favorable to the Russian government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-slams-rt-as-de-facto-arm-of-russian-intelligence-/7783709.html	2024-09-13T14:55:08-07:00

Critics denounce $1.3B in US military aid to Egypt despite alleged rights abuses	washington — The Biden administration’s approval this week of a $1.3 billion military aid package for Egypt despite its failure to hit human rights benchmarks has been criticized by rights experts. The bill’s approval Wednesday overrode human rights benchmarks required to release a certain portion of the aid. A group of senators had earlier urged the administration in a letter to withhold the aid, citing the Egyptian government’s 'targeting of political opponents and journalists.' Egypt, a longtime ally of the U.S., was far from reaching those benchmarks, Yeganeh Rezaian of the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, told VOA. 'No one can say Egypt is making human rights progress,' Rezaian said. The senators’ letter cited Egypt’s failure to investigate 'allegations of human rights abuses,' including enforced disappearances and torture in prison, especially for journalists and political dissidents. This was the first time during Biden’s presidency that Egypt received the full amount of U.S. foreign military financing allocated to Cairo. In previous years, a portion of aid had been withheld because of human rights concerns, according to CPJ. This year, the human rights requirements were waived in the interest of advancing cease-fire negotiations in Gaza, territory that borders Egypt, a spokesperson for Secretary of State Antony Blinken told Reuters. 'Egypt plays an important role in accessing Gaza for peace talks in Israel,' Rezaian told VOA. 'But that’s why the security of journalists and freedom of information in the country is very important for everyone, inside and outside.' CPJ researchers believe the world’s increased focus on the Israel-Hamas war has drawn attention away from other allegations of human rights violations in the same region. In Egypt, CPJ has documented the arrests of four journalists who were subjected to enforced disappearances since March. Their cases highlight the 'shameful record' of media persecution in Egypt, according to a joint statement published Monday by the CPJ and 34 other international rights groups. The statement called for the release of Ashraf Omar, Khaled Mamdouh, Ramadan Gouida and Yasser Abu Al-Ela. Authorities took all four journalists to undisclosed locations before their appearances in Egypt’s court. At least two have been subjected to physical torture during their imprisonment, according to CPJ. 'By releasing these folks, the government can show they believe in press freedom and democracy,' Rezaian told VOA. Among those detained is Omar, a cartoonist for independent news website Al-Manassa. Omar was subjected to electric shocks and other forms of physical torture, his wife told an Egyptian news website. Omar had published multiple 'critical cartoons' about the policies of his government, Sophie Brondel of Cartooning for Peace told VOA. She added that authorities have questioned him about his cartoons during detainment. Cartooning for Peace was one of the 34 co-signers of CPJ’s statement. 'We can see in many authoritarian regimes that cartoonists are often among the first targets,' Brondel told VOA. 'With their drawings, they have the capacity to also reach out to a broader public.' Freemuse, another artistic freedom organization that signed the document, has been monitoring Egypt’s media landscape for years. The organization noted an increase in how the government has 'hammered down on freedom of expression,' Sverre Pedersen, Freemuse’s executive director, told VOA. 'Without free expression and free art, it’s not possible to have democracy,' Pedersen said. Egypt has consistently been a top-10 jailer of journalists worldwide, according to CPJ data. The watchdog contends that torture and enforced disappearance of media workers are common practices under President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi. In the decade since el-Sissi came to power, media repression in Egypt has intensified. The country has become 'one of the world’s most oppressive countries towards journalists,' with dozens of arrests and the blocking of over 500 news websites, according to Reporters Without Borders. The Egyptian Embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA's email requesting comment. 'Our statement is the first step in terms of raising awareness,' said Rezaian of CPJ. 'We want the statement to be amplified as much as possible and are hoping to move towards international pressure.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/critics-denounce-1-3b-in-us-military-aid-to-egypt-despite-alleged-rights-abuses/7783692.html	2024-09-13T14:28:19-07:00	
Malawi battles fresh cholera outbreak	Blantyre, Malawi — Malawi is recording new cases of cholera two months after it declared the end of the country's worst cholera outbreak, which began in March 2022 and killed nearly 2,000 people. New cases have been reported in Chitipa district in northern Malawi and Machinga district in the south. Records from Chitipa District Health Office, released Friday, show the district has recorded 22 cases of cholera, with one death, since the onset of the new outbreak last week. That includes nine new cases registered Friday, with eight people hospitalized. Cholera is an acute diarrheal disease that can kill within hours if left untreated. Machinga district hospital in southern Malawi registered its first cholera case in the new outbreak this week. 'It has been three days now since we registered that case,' said Wongani Nyirenda, the hospital’s spokesperson. 'However, we are doing everything to make sure that people are using safe water. We have given them some chlorine and a water guard to treat their water.' He said health surveillance assistants are also on the ground educating people about good hygiene practices. The resurgence of cholera cases comes two months after Malawi declared the end of the country's worst cholera outbreak, which began in March 2022 and killed nearly 2,000 people. Government authorities told VOA in July that they had stopped the outbreak by increasing access to safe water and administering an oral cholera vaccination campaign that began in December 2022. George Jobe, executive director of the Malawi Health Equity Network, is concerned about the resurgence. 'It is worrisome,' he said. 'Our hope and expectation was that we would have a breather. A longer breather, especially considering that in 2022 we had a big suffering from cholera which took us over a year. So, we wouldn’t want to go back to such a bad experience.' Jobe believes the resurgence means Malawi is still struggling to address the challenges of making safe water available. He said water contaminated by sewage is the main cause of cholera. 'We have issues to do with behavioral change where hygiene issues should be borne in mind, like washing hands with soap, having pit latrines and good waste management,' he said. The co-chairperson for the presidential task force on COVID-19 and cholera in Malawi, Dr. Wilfred Chalamira Nkhoma, did not respond to calls and texts from VOA seeking comment on the new outbreak. However, Ministry of Health officials told local media this week that Malawians should not panic, saying the government is putting measures in place to control the spread of the disease.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-battles-fresh-cholera-outbreak/7783671.html	2024-09-13T13:58:54-07:00

Report details how China retaliates against people for engaging with UN	washington — China is among the foreign governments that retaliate against people for engaging with the United Nations, according to a report released this week by the U.N. Secretary-General. The report highlights how hard Beijing tries to silence its critics, according to Sophie Richardson, an expert on human rights in China. 'These [U.N.] mechanisms are some of the only ones available to people inside China, at least on paper, to provide any modicum of redress or justice for the human rights abuses either they’ve endured or the communities they work with have endured,' Richardson told VOA. 'That’s why you see the Chinese government go to extraordinary lengths to silence people who are simply trying to take reports to some of these human rights experts or bodies,' Richardson said. A former China director at Human Rights Watch, Richardson is currently a visiting scholar at Stanford University. The annual report chronicles government retaliation against people for engaging with the U.N. In addition to China, other countries named in the report include Colombia, India, Nicaragua, the Philippines and Russia. 'In my perfect world, governments that get referenced in these reprisals reports shouldn’t be members of the Human Rights Council,' said Richardson, who is based in Washington. China is a current member of the council in Geneva. China’s Washington embassy, as well as its U.N. offices in New York and Geneva, did not reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment for this story. One of the incidents included in the report’s China section is harassment against two members of the international legal team supporting Jimmy Lai, a pro-democracy publisher. Lai is on trial in Hong Kong on national security charges that are widely viewed as politically motivated. The 76-year-old is in prison following convictions in other cases that supporters also view as sham cases. Members of Lai’s legal team have faced death and rape threats, as well as attempts by unknown sources to hack their email and bank accounts, according to the report. Sebastien Lai thanked the U.N. for shedding light on his father’s case. 'These intimidation tactics will not succeed. I will not rest until my father is freed,' he said in a statement. Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, a barrister leading Jimmy’s international legal team, also condemned the attacks. The reprisals 'are personally unpleasant and distressing,' Gallagher said in a statement. 'But they are also an attack on the legal profession and on the international human rights system.' The reprisals make it harder for Jimmy Lai to use U.N. mechanisms to achieve justice in his case, Gallagher said. Hong Kong’s government has tried to argue that the legal team interfered in Hong Kong’s judicial process by bringing his case to U.N. human rights mechanisms, according to the report. 'It’s just so nakedly in tension with its obligations under international law,' Richardson said. On Thursday, Lai’s international legal team submitted an urgent appeal to the U.N. special rapporteur on torture. The appeal raised several concerns, including that the elderly publisher has been in solitary confinement since late 2020 and that the British national has been denied access to independent medical care, according to a statement from his legal team. Lai’s trial began in December 2023. It was initially expected to last around 80 days but is now expected to resume in November. Press freedom groups have called the trial a sham, and the U.S. and British governments have called for his immediate release. Hong Kong officials, however, have said he will receive a fair trial. Other incidents cited in the U.N. report include the case of Cao Shunli, a Beijing-based human rights defender who was arrested following an attempt to engage in a universal periodic review of China’s human rights record at the Human Rights Council. Cao died in custody in 2014. Another case is that of the Beijing-based activists Li Wenzu and Wang Quanzhang, who are married. The couple have faced significant retaliation, including police surveillance and evictions, and their son is unable to enroll in school due to pressure from state authorities, the report said. 'If one reads these cases, you get a sense of what risks — what unbelievable risks — people are taking to do this kind of work,' Richardson said. The report doesn’t mention specific incidents involving Uyghurs or Tibetans, but Richardson says their absence underscores how difficult it is for some groups to access U.N. mechanisms in the first place, as well as how some people may be too scared to report such incidents to the U.N. The Chinese government has engaged in severe human rights abuses against both ethnic groups, according to myriad reports. Multiple governments and international human rights organizations have accused Beijing of committing genocide and crimes against humanity against the Uyghurs, which the Chinese government rejects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-details-how-china-retaliates-against-people-for-engaging-with-un/7783526.html	2024-09-13T12:35:16-07:00	
China, US resume top-level military communication amid ongoing tension	Taipei, Taiwan — The United States and China are taking steps to resume top-level military-to-military communication, which analysts say is aimed at avoiding miscommunication and preventing tensions in the Indo-Pacific region from spiraling out of control. The head of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, Admiral Sam Paparo, and the head of the People's Liberation Army (PLA) Southern Theater Command, General Wu Yanan, held a video call Tuesday. The Chinese defense ministry said the two commanders had an 'in-depth exchange of views on issues of common concern' while Paparo urged the Chinese military 'to reconsider its use of dangerous, coercive and potentially escalatory tactics in the South China Sea and beyond.' On Thursday, the Financial Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that Wu is expected to attend a defense conference held by the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command in Hawaii next week, citing anonymous U.S. defense officials. Meanwhile, Michael Chase, the U.S. assistant secretary of defense for China, Taiwan and Mongolia, is holding defense policy coordination talks with Chinese defense officials while attending the annual Xiangshan Security Dialogue held in Beijing. The U.S. delegation led by Chase will 'engage with regional allies and partners on the sidelines of the Xiangshan Forum to underscore the United States' shared vision for the region ‘underpinned by a set of enduring beliefs,’' said the U.S. Department of Defense in a readout released Thursday. The Biden administration has been working to restore communication between Chinese and American militaries since the U.S. president’s meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the APEC Summit in California last November. It also follows the first meeting between U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan and China’s vice chairman of the Central Military Commission, Zhang Youxia, last month. During that meeting, Zhang said maintaining military security is 'in line with the common interests of both sides' and Sullivan highlighted the two nations’ shared responsibility to 'prevent competition from veering into conflict or confrontation.' Some analysts see a potential for further communication and engagement between the two militaries. 'I won’t rule out the possibilities that Beijing and Washington may look to establish a hotline between the two militaries, and whether that mechanism could be extended to the theater command level remains to be seen,' Lin Ying-Yu, a military expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. While the resumption of top-level communication allows Beijing and Washington to avoid miscalculations, other experts say it is unclear whether China and the U.S. can establish a more sustainable mechanism to cope with potential crises. 'While having contact and knowing your interlocutors are positive things during non-crisis times, the real test is whether these contacts can hold back any unintended escalation when incidents happen,' said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. Chong said since theater commanders from the U.S. and China oversee implementing rather than formulating policies, it is unclear whether the latest development can become established protocols. 'If there’s a persistence of [maintaining military-to-military communication], then it would suggest that it has become a policy,' he told VOA by phone. Tensions remain high over contentious issues Tensions remain high between China and the U.S. over a range of issues, including the repeated collision between Chinese and Philippine vessels near disputed reefs in the South China Sea and Beijing’s increased maneuvers in waters and airspace near Taiwan and Japan. During the Xiangshan Forum, Lieutenant General He Lei, the former vice president of the PLA Academy of Military Sciences, characterized the Philippines’ attempt to safeguard its territorial claims in the South China Sea as 'a unilateral change of the status quo' while accusing the U.S. of undermining security across the Taiwan Strait by selling weapons to Taiwan. 'The Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army will never allow any external forces to interfere in China's internal affairs or invade China's territory,' he told Chinese state broadcaster CGTN in an interview. Some analysts say there are limits to what military-to-military communications can do to ease tensions over what are essentially political disagreements. 'The military tension is only a manifestation of their political differences over Taiwan and the South China Sea, so if their disagreements are not resolved, the military tension is very unlikely to see a permanent resolution,' Yun Sun, China program director at the Stimson Center in Washington, told VOA by phone. With less than two months until the U.S. presidential election, Chong in Singapore said Beijing and Washington’s recent efforts may be an attempt to lay the foundation for bilateral military-to-military communication to be continued after the November election. 'On the Democrat side, if some of the current team stays [after November], perhaps we would see this momentum continue,' he told VOA. 'On the Republican side, things are a bit messier, because you have those who prefer the isolationist approach, those who advocate a containment approach in Asia, and people who talk about competing against China to win,' Chong added. Sun said if Donald Trump wins the election in November, Beijing will expect instability in bilateral relations and be prepared for the military relationship to be affected.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-us-resume-top-level-military-communication-amid-ongoing-tension/7783487.html	2024-09-13T11:53:08-07:00	
Mexican cartel leader 'El Mayo' Zambada pleads not guilty to US charges	new york — Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada, a powerful leader of Mexico’s Sinaloa cartel, pleaded not guilty Friday to U.S. narcotics trafficking charges in a case accusing him of engaging in murder plots, ordering torture and channeling tons of drugs into the United States. Participating in a court hearing through a Spanish-language interpreter, Zambada gave yes-or-no answers to a magistrate’s standard questions about whether he understood various documents and procedures. Asked how he was feeling, he said, 'Fine, fine.' His lawyers entered the not guilty plea on his behalf. Outside court, Zambada attorney Frank Perez said his client wasn't contemplating making a deal with the government, and the attorney expects the case to go to trial. 'It's a complex case,' he said. Sought by American law enforcement for more than two decades, Zambada has been in U.S. custody since July 25, when he landed in a private plane at an airport outside El Paso, Texas, in the company of another fugitive cartel leader, Joaquin Guzman Lopez, according to federal authorities. Zambada later said in a letter that he was kidnapped in Mexico and brought to the U.S. by Guzman Lopez, a son of imprisoned Sinaloa co-founder Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman. Zambada's lawyer did not elaborate on those claims Friday. U.S. Magistrate Judge James Cho ordered Zambada detained until trial. His lawyers did not ask for bail, and U.S. prosecutors in Brooklyn asked the judge to detain him. 'He was one of the most, if not the most, powerful narcotics kingpins in the world,' Assistant U.S. Attorney Francisco Navarro said. 'He co-founded the Sinaloa cartel and sat atop the narcotics trafficking world for decades.' Zambada sat quietly as he listened to the interpreter. Leaving court after the brief hearing, he appeared to accept some help getting out of a chair, then walked out slowly but unaided. The 76-year-old had used a wheelchair at a court appearance in Texas last month. But Perez said after court Friday that Zambada was healthy and 'in good spirits.' Sketch artists were in the small courtroom, but other journalists could observe only through closed-circuit video because of a shortage of seats. In court and in a letter earlier to the judge, prosecutors said Zambada presided over a vast and violent operation, with an arsenal of military-grade weapons, a private security force that was almost like an army, and a corps of 'sicarios,' or hitmen, who carried out assassinations, kidnappings and torture. His bloody tenure included ordering the murder, just months ago, of his own nephew, the prosecutors said. 'A United States jail cell is the only thing that will prevent the defendant from committing further crimes,' Navarro said. Zambada also pleaded not guilty to the charges at an earlier court appearance in Texas. His next court appearance is scheduled for October 31. According to authorities, Zambada and 'El Chapo' Guzman built the Sinaloa cartel from a regional syndicate into a huge manufacturer and smuggler of cocaine, heroin and other illicit drugs to the U.S. Zambada has been seen as the group's strategist and dealmaker and a less flamboyant figure than Guzman. Zambada had never been behind bars until his U.S. arrest in July. His apprehension has touched off fighting in Mexico between rival factions in the Sinaloa cartel. Gunfights have killed several people. Schools and businesses in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa, have closed amid the fighting. The battles are believed to be between factions loyal to Zambada and those led by other sons of 'El Chapo' Guzman, who was convicted of drug and conspiracy charges and sentenced to life in prison in the U.S. in 2019. It remains unclear why Guzman Lopez surrendered to U.S. authorities and brought Zambada with him. Guzman Lopez is awaiting trial on a separate drug trafficking indictment in Chicago, where he has pleaded not guilty.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-cartel-leader-el-mayo-zambada-pleads-not-guilty-to-us-charges-/7783468.html	2024-09-13T11:41:56-07:00

How propaganda outlets cover — or ignore — aspects of US election	Washington — When Kamala Harris and Donald Trump met in a presidential debate on Tuesday, they spoke about a range of foreign policy issues, including China and Russia’s war in Ukraine. But while the debate attracted large audiences and coverage in the United States and Europe, Beijing and Moscow’s state-run media were relatively quiet on the event. The minimal coverage is a contrast to the presidential debate between Joe Biden and Trump in June. Chinese media After that debate, Beijing-run outlets — like media around the world — were flooded with coverage of Biden’s poor performance. But Harris-Trump coverage was noticeably slimmer in state-run outlets such as Xinhua, the Global Times and the People’s Daily newspaper, China media analysts say. The shift is a subtle but significant distinction, according to China media analysts, that reflects how the Chinese Communist Party, or CCP, employs its propaganda apparatus. The relative lack of coverage wasn’t all that surprising to Kenton Thibaut, a senior resident China fellow at the Atlantic Council’s Digital Forensic Research Lab in Washington. The Chinese government is probably still figuring out how to move forward following Biden’s abrupt withdrawal, said Thibaut. She believes that’s a primary reason for the reduced coverage of this week’s debate. 'This is really reflective of how China handles changes in foreign policy issues,' Thibaut said. 'They just stick to very fact-based coverage, basically restating what the candidate said, until they — the propaganda department and such — can figure out basically how to cover it globally and domestically.' Another reason for the reduced coverage may have to do with democracy itself, according to China experts. 'The presidential debate is important for U.S. democracy, and democracy is always a sensitive topic for the CCP,' Anne-Marie Brady, a professor and specialist in Chinese politics at the University of Canterbury in New Zealand, told VOA in an email. Jonathan Hassid, an Iowa State University professor who specializes in Chinese media, agreed. 'Chinese media does not like covering democratic successes,' Hassid told VOA. 'Democratic failures are highlighted, but the successes are not.' That helps explain the difference between the coverage of the two debates. During the first debate, which by many accounts was a fiasco, Biden sounded hoarse and frail, and his repeated fumbles highlighted concerns over the 81-year-old’s capacity to serve another four-year term as president. In coverage of that debate, Chinese state media relied on narratives about how democracy doesn’t work well, Hassid said. For instance, Hu Xijin, a Chinese media commentator and former state media editor, wrote, 'Objectively speaking, the low-quality performance of these two old men was a negative advertisement for Western democracy.' By contrast, Hassid said, this week’s debate may have been perceived as a better display of democracy. Still, China also didn’t even feature that largely in the latest debate. While Harris didn’t go into much detail, she said that 'a policy about China should be in making sure the United States of America wins the competition for the 21st century.' Trump, meanwhile, has previously proposed tariffs up to 100% on Chinese products. When asked about Harris and Trump’s views about tariffs on imports from China, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning on Wednesday said she had no comment. 'The presidential elections are the United States’ own affairs,' she said. 'That said, we are opposed to making China an issue in U.S. elections.' A spokesperson for China’s embassy replied to VOA’s request for comment with a similar statement: 'On the issue of the U.S. election, China’s position is consistent and clear. China has no intention and will not interfere in it. At the same time, we hope that the U.S. side will not make accusations against China in the election.' Russian media Russia — another propaganda powerhouse — also didn’t offer much coverage of the debate. 'But that doesn’t mean that they don’t drop in plenty of spin,' according to Darren Linvill, co-director of Clemson University’s Media Forensics Hub. Based on his analysis of Russian state media coverage of the debate, Linvill said outlets such as RT and Sputnik were focused on downplaying Harris and playing up Trump. There were some outliers, such as a Sputnik article in which a psychiatrist claimed Harris was trying to 'hide her imposter syndrome' during the debate. But most of the coverage was subtler, Linvill said. Articles tended to be anodyne and not necessarily critical of either side, Linvill said, but they still reveal Moscow’s well-documented preference for Trump. U.S. officials are again warning about Russian efforts to influence this year’s election. Last week, the Justice Department accused two Russians who work at the Kremlin-backed RT of money laundering by funneling nearly $10 million to a conservative Tennessee-based media outlet that is a leading platform for pro-Trump voices. While it’s important to monitor disinformation in the lead-up to and during an election, according to Thibaut, the period immediately after is perhaps even more important, especially if the election is close. 'This is a prime time for threat actors to take advantage of information, the polarizing narratives, the charged-up atmosphere to really sow social division,' Thibaut said. 'We have to really remain vigilant after the election as well.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-propaganda-outlets-cover-or-ignore-aspects-of-us-election/7783317.html	2024-09-13T10:12:54-07:00
