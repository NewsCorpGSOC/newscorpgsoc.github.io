Italy resumes migrant transfers to processing centers in Albania	Rome — Italy said Sunday it was transferring 49 migrants picked up in the Mediterranean to new processing centers in Albania, in the third such attempt facing hurdles by courts. The navy vessel Cassiopea with the migrants on board was expected to reach the Albanian port of Shengjin on Tuesday morning, port officials said. The Interior Ministry said Sunday that 53 other migrants 'spontaneously presented their passports' after they were told that it would avoid their transfer to Albania. Where the nationality is confirmed, processing generally takes less time as people who are determined by Italy to be ineligible to apply for asylum in the European Union are repatriated via a fast-track procedure. Italian judges refused to validate the detention of the first two small groups in the Albanian centers, built under a contentious agreement between Rome and Tirana. Their cases have been referred to the European Court of Justice, which had earlier established that asylum applicants could not undergo a fast-track procedure that could lead to repatriation if their country of provenance was not deemed completely safe. The European court hearing on the case is scheduled for Feb. 25. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni’s government had vowed to reactivate the two centers in Albania that have remained dormant following the Italian courts’ decisions. The premier’s position was partially backed by a ruling in late December by Italy’s highest court, which said Italian judges could not substitute for government policy in deciding which countries are safe for repatriation of migrants whose asylum requests are rejected. The decision does allow lower courts to make such determinations on a case-by-case basis, short of setting overall policy. Italy has earmarked $675 million (650 million euros) to run the centers over five years. They opened in October ready to accept up to 3,000 male migrants a month picked up by the Italian coast guard in international waters. Human rights groups and nongovernmental organizations active in the Mediterranean have slammed the agreement as a dangerous precedent that conflicts with international laws. Meloni has repeatedly stressed that plans to process migrants outside EU borders in Albania had received strong backing from other European leaders.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-resumes-migrant-transfers-to-processing-centers-in-albania/7951226.html	2025-01-26T16:00:22-08:00	
Germany holds commemoration for 2 people killed in knife attack	Berlin — Government officials and residents attended a solemn Mass Sunday to honor a child and a man killed in a knife attack in Germany, an assault that amplified the debate about migration ahead of the Feb. 23 general election. The ecumenical religious service at the Catholic Basilica of St. Peter and Alexander in Aschaffenburg, Bavaria, was briefly suspended for the tolling of the city’s bells at the exact time that the attack took place Wednesday, 11:45 a.m. Bavaria Governor Markus Soder, Aschaffenburg Mayor Jurgen Herzing and Muslim imam Zischan Mehmood addressed the congregation that included rescuers, to express grief and disbelief at the loss of lives. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser was also present. 'Compassion, solidarity and cohesion are more important than ever, because there are many dividers and agitators around us,' Mehmood told the people gathered in and outside the church. 'We must never allow grief and pain to tear us apart.' Soder said the attack was a 'senseless, brutal and disturbing crime.' 'Good and evil are not a question of origin, nationality, ethnicity or faith,' Soder said, and stressed that the killings should not lead to divisions because 'incitement is the wrong answer.' Before attending the service, Faeser and Soder laid wreaths at the site of the attack. The attack is politically sensitive a month before Germany’s national election as migration policy is among the top campaign issues. A 2-year-old boy of Moroccan origin, who was part of a group of kindergarten children, was killed, along with a 41-year-old German man who apparently intervened to protect the children in a city park. The arrested suspect is a 28-year-old former asylum-seeker from Afghanistan who had been told to leave Germany. Officials said he had received psychiatric treatment and there was no immediate indication that he was motivated by extremism. He is being held in a psychiatric hospital, according to the German news agency, dpa. Bavarian officials said two adults and a 2-year-old Syrian girl were also wounded in the attack and hospitalized but there was no danger to their lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-holds-commemoration-for-2-people-killed-in-knife-attack/7950989.html	2025-01-26T15:25:10-08:00	
Lebanon, Gaza ceasefires with Israel teeter on shaky ground	Israeli ceasefires with Hezbollah militants in southern Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza appeared to be on fragile ground Sunday as Israeli forces opened fire on Palestinians in both regions, killing at least 23 people and injuring dozens. In Lebanon, the Health Ministry said at least 22 were killed and 124 others injured as Israel confirmed it would not meet the 60-day deadline to withdraw its troops as part of the ceasefire it reached with Hezbollah in November. On Sunday, the White House released a statement that the arrangement between Lebanon and Israel, monitored by the United States, would continue to be in effect until February 18. 'The Government of Lebanon, the Government of Israel, and the Government of the United States will also begin negotiations for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after Oct. 7, 2023,' the statement said. Israel blamed the militants and the Lebanese army for failing to meet their own commitments under the truce. The Israeli military said that it fired 'warning shots' toward 'suspects' and that it had detained an unspecified number of people. Under terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah was required to retreat to the north away from the Israeli border and Israel was to pull out of Lebanon. In a statement, the United Nations peacekeeping forces in Lebanon, known as UNIFIL, warned that it was 'imperative to avoid further deterioration of the situation.' It urged the Israeli military to avoid firing at civilians, and for Lebanese people to adhere to the directives of the Lebanese military. 'Further violence risks undermining the fragile security situation,' the statement said. In Gaza, the long-awaited return of Palestinians from the central and southern regions of the territory to the northern sector was delayed in a dispute over the release of a female hostage held by Hamas. Israel said it would not retreat from the heavily fortified Netzarim Corridor, which divides the enclave, until another female hostage, Arbel Yehoud, an Israeli civilian, is freed. She was supposed to have been released Saturday. Israeli forces fired at Palestinians along a coastal road near the checkpoint, killing at least one person and injuring 18 others, according to a spokesperson for al-Awda Hospital in Nuseirat in central Gaza. The Israeli military said in a statement that it 'identified several gatherings of dozens of suspects that posed a threat.' The violence exhibited the tenuous nature of the two ceasefires, both of which were brokered in part by the United States in contentious negotiations during the final months of the administration of President Joe Biden. Steve Witkoff, U.S. President Donald Trump’s Mideast envoy, participated in the talks to reach the Gaza ceasefire. Trump on Saturday called on Egypt and Jordan to take in more Palestinians from Gaza to 'clean out' the enclave after much of it has been leveled by 15 months of Israeli-Hamas fighting. The war in Gaza started with the shock Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed nearly 47,000 people, most of them women and children, according to health officials, although the Israeli military says the death toll includes 17,000 militants. Hamas is believed to be holding about 100 hostages, with the ceasefire requiring them to release 33 during a six-week truce in exchange for hundreds of Palestinians jailed by Israel. Seven Israeli hostages and nearly 300 Palestinian prisoners have been freed thus far.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-gaza-ceasefires-with-israel-teeter-on-shaky-ground/7950986.html	2025-01-26T15:07:18-08:00	
Border czar: Trump administration prioritizes undocumented migrants seen as security threats	President Donald Trump’s border czar said Sunday that the administration’s current priority is to deport undocumented immigrants who are deemed to pose security threats to the U.S. But he stressed that illegal immigration in general won’t be tolerated.

UN chief calls for Rwandan forces to leave DR Congo	United Nations, United States — U.N. chief Antonio Guterres called Sunday on Rwandan forces to withdraw from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and halt support for fighters advancing on the key Congolese city of Goma. M23 fighters backed by several thousand Rwandan troops have been quickly advancing toward the city, which lies along DRC's eastern border and is home to more than a million people. Several foreign peacekeepers have been killed in the mounting violence around Goma. 'The Secretary-General is deeply concerned by the escalating violence' and 'calls on the Rwanda Defense Forces to cease support to the M23 and withdraw from DRC territory,' said a statement from his spokesperson Stephane Dujarric. Guterres had previously referred to a U.N. experts' report citing Kigali's backing of the M23 but had not explicitly called on Rwanda to withdraw from DRC territory. In his statement Sunday, made after three U.N. peacekeepers in eastern DRC had been killed within 48 hours, Guterres emphasized that 'attacks against United Nations personnel may constitute a war crime.' The U.N. in the meantime has begun to evacuate 'non-essential' staff from the major city of Goma in eastern DRC, a United Nations source told AFP. During an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council session Sunday, permanent member states France, Britain and the United States called on Rwanda to pull its forces back. But others, including China and the African nations holding rotating council seats, did not specifically name Kigali. The Security Council as a whole has yet to accuse Rwanda of taking part directly in the conflict, simply underlining the importance of the DRC's territorial integrity. But the French ambassador to the U.N., Nicolas de Riviere, indicated Sunday he was working on a Security Council statement that would 'call a cat a cat,' a phrase essentially meaning to state directly what something is without sugarcoating it. He urged the Council to condemn what he said was a grave threat to regional peace and security. Congolese foreign minister Therese Kayikwamba Wagner went further, urging the Council to impose sweeping economic and political sanctions on Kigali. She accused Rwanda of having sent new troops into eastern DRC on Sunday, actions which she said amounted to a 'declaration of war.' But Rwanda's ambassador to the U.N., Ernest Rwamucyo, rejected the accusations, accusing Kinshasa of being responsible for the deteriorating situation and failing to make a 'genuine commitment to peace.' He suggested that the U.N. peacekeepers in the DRC had joined a 'coalition' seeking regime change in Rwanda. The fighting in the region has forced some 230,000 to flee their homes. Eastern DRC has vast mining resources and is a complex landscape of rival armed militias which has seen violence ebb and flow since the 1990s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-calls-for-rwandan-forces-to-leave-dr-congo/7950969.html	2025-01-26T14:01:15-08:00	
Islamist militants kill at least 20 Nigerian troops, security sources say	MAIDUGURI, Nigeria — Suspected Islamist fighters killed at least 20 Nigerian soldiers, including a commanding officer, after attacking an army base in a remote town in northeastern Borno state, security sources and residents said Sunday. Boko Haram and Islamic State West Africa Province (ISWAP) fighters have mainly operated in Borno, targeting security forces and civilians, in the process killing and displacing tens of thousands of people. The latest assault happened Friday, when ISWAP members arrived on gun trucks and attacked the army's 149 Battalion in Malam-Fatori town, gateway to the border with Niger, two soldiers and residents said. One of the soldiers who survived the attack told Reuters by phone that troops were taken by surprise as the militants 'rained bullets everywhere.' 'We tried so much to repel the attacks and after more than three hours of gun duel, they overpowered us, killing our commanding officer, a lieutenant colonel,' the soldier said, declining to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. He said 20 soldiers died while several were injured. A Nigerian army spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Residents who left the town said some of the militants were seen in Malam-Fatori as late as Saturday night. Malakaka Bukar, a member of the local militia recruited to help the army, said the militants also burned buildings, forcing some residents to flee the town. 'They preached to some of the residents,' said Bukar. Although weakened by military assaults and internal fighting over the years, Boko Haram and ISWAP have stepped up attacks in Borno since the turn of the year, killing dozens of farmers and fishermen in series of raids.	https://www.voanews.com/a/islamist-militants-kill-at-least-20-nigerian-troops-security-sources-say/7950960.html	2025-01-26T13:48:19-08:00

Trump orders tariffs, visa restrictions on Colombia over rejection of deportation flights	Bogota, Colombia — U.S. President Donald Trump said Sunday that he was ordering tariffs, visa restrictions and other retaliatory measures to be taken against Colombia after its government rejected two flights carrying migrants. Trump said the measures were necessary, because the decision of Colombian President Gustavo Petro 'jeopardized' national security in the United States. 'These measures are just the beginning,' Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social. 'We will not allow the Colombian Government to violate its legal obligations with regard to the acceptance and return of the Criminals they forced into the United States.' Earlier Sunday, Petro said that his government won't accept flights carrying migrants deported from the U.S. until the Trump administration creates a protocol that treats them with 'dignity.' Petro made the announcement in two X posts, one of which included a news video of migrants reportedly deported to Brazil walking on a tarmac with restraints on their hands and feet. 'A migrant is not a criminal and must be treated with the dignity that a human being deserves,' Petro said. 'That is why I returned the U.S. military planes that were carrying Colombian migrants.' Colombia accepted 475 deportation flights from the United States from 2020 to 2024, fifth behind Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico and El Salvador, according to Witness at the Border, an advocacy group that tracks flight data. It accepted 124 deportation flights in 2024. Last year, Colombia and other countries began accepting U.S.-funded deportation flights from Panama. The U.S. government didn't immediately respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press regarding aircraft and protocols used in deportations to Colombia. Petro, a former leftist guerrilla, added that his country would receive Colombians in 'civilian airplanes' and 'without treatment like criminals.' As part of a flurry of actions to make good on U.S. President Donald Trump's campaign promises to crack down on illegal immigration, his government is using active-duty military to help secure the border and carry out deportations. Two Air Force C-17 cargo planes carrying migrants removed from the U.S. touched down early Friday in Guatemala. That same day, Honduras received two deportation flights carrying a total of 193 people. In announcing what he called 'urgent and decisive retaliatory measures,' Trump explained that he ordered '25% tariffs on all goods coming into the United States,' which would be raised to 50% in one week. He said he also ordered 'A Travel Ban and immediate Visa Revocations' on Colombian government officials, allies and supporters. 'All Party Members, Family Members, and Supporters of the Colombian Government,' Trump wrote will be subject to 'Visa Sanctions.' He didn't say to which party he was referring to or provide any additional details on the visa and travel restrictions. Trump added that all Colombians will face enhanced customs inspections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-tariffs-visa-restrictions-on-colombia-over-rejection-of-deportation-flights/7950941.html	2025-01-26T13:01:22-08:00

India celebrates Republic Day with Indonesian president observing	New Delhi — India celebrated its 76th Republic Day on Sunday with a colorful parade displaying its military might and cultural diversity on a boulevard in the heart of country’s capital. Indonesian president was the guest of honor. Tens of thousands of people lined the road on a cold Sunday morning to watch the long parade to mark the anniversary of the official adoption of India’s Constitution on Jan. 26, 1950, nearly three years after independence from British colonial rule. Soldiers from India’s military and paramilitary, along with their bands, marched as the country’s leaders and other guests watched. Various floats displayed India’s cultural diversity with one showcasing the Maha Kumbh festival, the ongoing massive Hindu festival touted as the world’s largest religious gathering. The parade took place on Rajpath Avenue, built by India’s former British rulers and lined by huge lawns, canals and rows of trees. The avenue was redeveloped as part of the celebrations of the 75th anniversary of Indian independence and renamed Kartavayapath, or the Boulevard of Duty, in 2022. Visiting Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto attended the event as the chief guest and was flanked by India’s president and prime minister. A 342-member band and marching contingent from the Indonesian National Armed Forces joined the parade, the first time the ASEAN country's troops have joined any foreign parade. India traditionally invites foreign leaders to witness the spectacle. French President Emmanuel Macron was the guest of honor last year and former U.S. President Barack Obama in 2015. Ten Southeast Asian leaders watched the parade in 2018. Sukarno, Indonesia’s first president and the leader of the country’s independence struggle, was the chief guest at India’s first Republic Day celebration in 1950. Thousands of men and women in colorful costumes played marches, performed traditional dances and pulled motorbike stunts during the 90-minute parade. It also showcased India’s domestically built defense equipment and military systems, including tanks, infantry combat vehicles, radar systems and missile systems. Some 5,000 artists, carrying traditional props like spears, swords and drums, performed over 40 dance forms from different parts of India in a cultural performance that lasted about 10 minutes. The parade ended with a fly-past by air force fighters, including Rafale jets, transport planes and helicopters. The parade was broadcast live by television networks. Republic Day parades also took place in state capitals and other cities across India amid massive security arrangements. In Srinagar, the main city of disputed Kashmir, armed police and soldiers patrolled as regional officials celebrated Republic Day. Hundreds of people braved winter chills to witness the parade amid additional security, with police and soldiers checking vehicles and frisking pedestrians. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi’s rule since 1989.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-celebrates-republic-day-with-indonesian-president-observing/7950904.html	2025-01-26T11:36:18-08:00	
Mel Gibson’s ‘Flight Risk’ is No. 1 at box office, ‘The Brutalist’ expands	New York — Critics lambasted it and audiences didn’t grade it much better. But despite the turbulence, Mel Gibson’s 'Flight Risk' managed to open No. 1 at the box office with a modest $12 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a quiet weekend, even for the typically frigid movie-going month of January, the top spot went to the Lionsgate thriller starring Mark Wahlberg as a pilot flying an Air Marshal (Michelle Dockery) and fugitive (Topher Grace) across Alaska. But it wasn’t a particularly triumphant result for Gibson’s directorial follow-up to 2016’s 'Hacksaw Ridge.' Reviews (21% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and audience scores (a 'C' CinemaScore) were terrible. President Donald Trump recently named Gibson a 'special ambassador' to Hollywood, along with Jon Voight and Sylvester Stallone. Going into the weekend, Hollywood’s attention was more focused on the Sundance Film Festival and on Thursday’s Oscar nominations, which were twice postponed by the wildfires in the Los Angeles region. The weekend was also a small test as to whether the once more common Oscar 'bump' that can sometimes follow nominations still exists. Most contenders have by now completed the bulk of their theatrical runs and are more likely to see an uptick on VOD or streaming. But the weekend’s most daring gambit was A24 pushing Brady Corbet’s 'The Brutalist' a three–and-a-half-hour epic nominated for 10 Academy Awards, into wide release. Though some executives initially greeted 'The Brutalist,' which is running with an intermission, as 'un-distributable,' Corbet has said, A24 acquired the film out of the Venice Film Festival and it’s managed solid business, collecting $6 million in limited release. In wide release, it earned $2.9 million — a far from blockbuster sum but the best weekend yet for 'The Brutalist.' The audience was downright miniscule for another best-picture nominee: RaMell Ross’ 'Nickel Boys.' Innovatively shot almost entirely in first-person POV, the Amazon MGM Studios release gathered just $340,171 in 540 locations after expanding by 300 theaters. Coming off one of the lowest Martin Luther King Jr. weekends in years, no new releases made a major impact. Steven Soderbergh’s 'Presence,' a well-reviewed horror film shot from the perspective of a ghost inside a suburban home, debuted with $3.4 million in 1,750 locations. The film, released by Neon and acquired out of last year’s Sundance, was made for just $2 million. The top spots otherwise went to holdovers. The Walt Disney Co.’s 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' in its sixth weekend of release, scored $8.7 million to hold second place. After starting slowly, the Barry Jenkins-directed film has amassed $626.7 million globally. 'One of Them Days,' the Keke Palmer and SZA-led comedy from Sony Pictures, held well in its second weekend, dropping just 32% with $8 million in ticket sales. In recent years, few comedies have found success on the big screen, but 'One of Them Days' has proven an exception. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. 'Flight Risk,' $12 million. 2. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $8.7 million. 3. 'One of Them Days,' $8 million. 4. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $5.5 million. 5. 'Moana 2,' $4.3 million. 6. 'Presence,' $3.4 million. 7. 'Wolf Man,' $3.4 million. 8. 'A Complete Unknown,' $3.1 million. 9. 'Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,' $3 million. 10. 'The Brutalist,' $2.9 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mel-gibson-s-flight-risk-is-no-1-at-box-office-the-brutalist-expands-/7950872.html	2025-01-26T10:54:08-08:00	
With Trump in power, US quickly deporting undocumented migrants	U.S. authorities are now arresting hundreds of undocumented migrants per day and sending them back to their home countries, carrying out President Donald Trump’s 2024 campaign pledge to deport masses of migrants who have illegally entered the United States. 'We’re going to enforce immigration laws,' Vice President JD Vance told CBS News’ 'Face the Nation' on Sunday. More than 1,000 migrants were arrested with hundreds repatriated to other countries, including Guatemala last week, during the first days of the new Trump administration, according to figures compiled by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency and the White House. 'It’s going very well. We’re getting the bad, hard criminals out,' Trump told reporters Friday during a trip to North Carolina to view the flood recovery efforts from Hurricane Helene. Without evidence, he said, 'These are murderers. These are people that have been as bad as you get. As bad as anybody you’ve seen. We’re taking them out first.' The White House released photos of shackled migrants boarding a C-17 military transport aircraft for flights out of the United States. Trump’s 'border czar,' Tom Homan, told ABC’s 'This Week' show Sunday, 'There will be more arrests nationwide.' Trump authorized sending 1,500 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, and Homan said, 'You’ll see the numbers increase. They’re down there to create a secure border.' He said the U.S. is deporting 'as many as we can' arrest, with the focus first on those convicted of U.S. crimes and then moving on to detain and deport those whose asylum requests have been rejected by U.S. officials. 'We’re in the beginning stages,' Homan said. 'It’s not OK to violate the laws of this country,' Homan said. He urged undocumented migrants, even those who have not been ordered out of the U.S., to return to their home countries voluntarily. About 11 million undocumented migrants are believed to be living in the U.S., a staggering number that most officials believe will be impossible to deport. 'We’re going to do what we can with the money we have,' Homan said. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, a staunch Trump ally, urged his Republican colleagues in Congress to authorize more spending for the deportation effort. 'We haven't given the Trump team the resources,' Graham said on NBC’s 'Meet the Press' show. He said Homan 'needs to substantially hire more [immigration] agents. He needs to finish the [border] wall [with Mexico] and technology. He needs to go from 41,000 detention beds to 150,000 detention beds to make this work.' 'So, to my Republican colleagues, particularly in the House [of Representatives], as we fiddle, our immigration plans are hitting walls. We're not building walls, we're hitting walls. We need to give Tom Homan the money now to execute the plan that he's come up with. And without congressional funding this is going to hit a wall,' Graham declared. The Trump administration has stopped taking appointments for migrants waiting in Mexico to request asylum through a mobile app, but Trump’s anti-immigration edicts are facing legal challenges. One judge has already temporarily blocked Trump from declaring that he no longer recognizes constitutionally guaranteed citizenship for children of undocumented migrants born in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-trump-in-power-us-quickly-deporting-undocumented-migrants-/7950864.html	2025-01-26T10:34:50-08:00	
Iran's foreign minister meets Taliban in 1st visit to Kabul in 8 years	Top Taliban officials met Iran’s foreign minister Sunday to discuss tensions along their shared border, the treatment of Afghan refugees in Iran and water rights. It was the first visit by an Iranian foreign minister to the Afghan capital since 2017. Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said Iran was committed to the return of some 3.5 million Afghan refugees and had no intention of interfering in its neighbor’s domestic politics, according to a statement from the Afghan government’s deputy spokesperson Hamdullah Fitrat. He also called for the full implementation of the Helmand River water treaty, which envisions shared water resources, the statement said. Acting Prime Minister Hassan Akhund asked Iran to treat Afghan refugees with respect and said it was not feasible to manage a large-scale repatriation within a short period. He also said incidents such as the execution of Afghans in Iran provoked public sentiment. Araghchi also met Afghanistan's foreign minister, Amir Khan Muttaqi, and Defense Minister Mohammad Yaqoob. Earlier Sunday, Iran’s official IRNA news agency quoted Araghchi as saying he hoped for more economic ties and improved relations with Afghanistan, citing some 'ups and downs.' Iran doesn’t formally recognize the Taliban government in Afghanistan, which seized power in 2021 as U.S. and NATO forces withdrew from the country following two decades of war. But Tehran maintains political and economic ties with Kabul and has allowed the Taliban to manage Afghanistan’s Embassy in Iran's capital.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-foreign-minister-meets-taliban-in-1st-visit-to-kabul-in-8-years-/7950827.html	2025-01-26T09:47:03-08:00	
As Hegseth takes charge at Pentagon, here are what changes could be in store	Washington — When Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth starts his first official day on Monday morning, he will face a daunting array of issues to tackle — from global conflicts and border security to administrative tasks. At the top of his list is addressing President Donald Trump's priority to strengthen the U.S. military presence along the southern border and reviewing whether active-duty forces should be used for law enforcement — something done rarely. Dozens of other issues will compete for his attention, including developing the Pentagon's massive budget, decisions about aid to Ukraine, support for the ceasefire in Gaza, troop deployments in the Middle East. Not to mention Trump directives to rid the federal government of diversity programs and personnel as well as moves to cut waste and remove any lingering Biden administration backers. In a message to the force shortly after he was sworn in Saturday, Hegseth cited the challenges he sees ahead. Some are ones his predecessors also faced, such as reorienting the military from decades of a Middle East focus and better deterring China. Continued conflict in the region, including the October 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas, has made that shift impossible to execute. Hegseth also told service members about other priorities, including strengthening the defense industrial base and getting the Pentagon to pass an audit, while ensuring that the United States remains 'the strongest and most lethal force in the world.' He made an unannounced stop to the Pentagon on Saturday after the swearing-in ceremony at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building. There was no media coverage of his arrival. The Pentagon later released an official photo saying Hegseth was 'ready to get to work on behalf of America’s warriors.' Already, support staff have been meeting with military leaders, including Gen. CQ Brown Jr., chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. But Hegseth will get to experience what many describe as 'drinking from a firehose' as he works to quickly get up to speed on what his 2.1 million service members and 780,000 civilians in the department are doing. Among them are tens of thousands serving overseas, including in combat zones. Then there are the cultural issues that Hegseth railed on as a media personality that did not make it into Hegseth’s message to the military. Many expect they will surface in the coming days. Here are some key issues that Hegseth, who was confirmed in a tiebreaking vote Friday by Vice President JD Vance, will face right away: Border deployments In trying to meet Trump's demand of securing the border, Hegseth will face a barrage of information about what troops are available, what assistance the Border Patrol needs and where, as well as how to house, feed and transport the troops and border personnel and how to ensure none of this affects other national security requirements. One of his first big decisions is whether he will recommend that active-duty troops deployed to the border become involved in law enforcement, a move that military leaders in recent years have pushed to avoid. Active-duty forces are prohibited from doing law enforcement duties on U.S. soil under the Posse Comitatus Act. Trump has signed an executive order directing that his defense and homeland security secretaries report back within 90 days on whether they think he should invoke the 1807 law called the Insurrection Act, which allows troops to be used for civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil during emergencies. During previous deployments, troops have been used for transportation, intelligence, logistics, wall-building and other support tasks, freeing up the Border Patrol to interact with migrants and conduct the law enforcement duties. Transgender troops In his first executive order, Trump again stripped protections for transgender troops that Democratic President Joe Biden had restored after Trump banned those members from serving during his first term in office. The ban previously faced legal challenges, and lawyers who represented transgender forces last time are readying to take it up in the courts again. While Trump has not announced a ban, his decision to revoke protections is seen as a first step toward that. It is unclear how many troops would be affected. The Defense Department has no exact figure on the number of transgender troops serving because not every transgender person is in the same state of medical transition and not every transgender person identifies as such in military paperwork. The department has referred queries on how many transgender troops there are to the services; the services have said they have no way to track. The budget and Ukraine Hegseth will have to become familiar with the complicated construction of the Pentagon budget, which right now is about $850 billion. Trump ran on a vow to make the U.S. military more lethal — something Hegseth has echoed. But they also have spoken extensively about cutting waste. So Hegseth's imprint on the budget will be studied to determine how that's being done. Woven into those discussions will be security assistance to Ukraine. The State Department has ordered a freeze on new funding for almost all U.S. foreign aid, and there was no indication of a waiver for military assistance for Ukraine like there was for Israel and Egypt. The Biden administration provided Kyiv with more than $66 billion in military aid and weapons during the war with Russia. It had left unspent about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding to send more weapons to Ukraine from existing U.S. stockpiles — a sum that is not affected by the foreign aid freeze. But it is now up to Hegseth and Trump to decide whether or not to spend it, and Trump hasn’t said what he will do on Ukraine aid. Diversity, equity and inclusion rollbacks Hegseth will take over the Pentagon's push to implement Trump's executive order to get rid of DEI programs, coming as military officers fret over whether they will be fired for being 'woke,' as Hegseth has pledged to do. During his Senate hearing, Hegseth affirmed his commitment to focus on lethality and to eliminate wokeness, arguing that DEI policies 'divide' troops and do not prioritize 'meritocracy.' Officials said the Defense Department doesn’t have any full-time workers assigned to DEI so they don’t expect to have to fire people, as other federal agencies have. But senior leaders have been poring over their websites to delete pages that mention diversity. Lacking clear guidance, staffers were pulling websites down in often inconsistent ways. The Army, for example, temporarily removed its sexual assault guidelines before they later came back online. Hegseth also has railed against women in combat in his books and on podcasts and said standards were lowered for them, which is not true. He has since toned down his criticism after substantial pushback from lawmakers. He most recently told senators that he's not aware that Trump wants to roll back the decision to allow women to serve in all combat jobs. Instead, he has talked about doing a review of standards. Reproductive care After the Supreme Court in 2022 ended constitutional protections for abortion that were set out in Roe v. Wade, then-Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin came out with a policy that would allow service members to take leave and be reimbursed for travel expenses to obtain reproductive care — including abortions and in-vitro fertilization — if the military base they were assigned to was in a state that had banned that care. It’s not clear whether Hegseth will seek to further revise that policy to remove the reimbursement provisions. It has been only scarcely used, and the department does not break down what the travel was for due to medical privacy laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-hegseth-takes-charge-at-pentagon-here-are-what-changes-could-be-in-store/7950776.html	2025-01-26T08:06:33-08:00	
Thousands in Ireland still without power as officials say Storm Eowyn cleanup will take time	London — Ireland called in help from England and France on Sunday as repair crews worked to restore power to hundreds of thousands of people after the most disruptive storm for years. More than 1 million people in Ireland, Northern Ireland and Scotland were left without electricity after Storm Eowyn roared through on Friday. In Ireland, which suffered the heaviest damage, the wind snapped telephone poles, ripped apart a Dublin ice rink and even toppled a giant wind turbine. A wind gust of 183 kph was recorded on the west coast, breaking a record set in 1945. The state electricity company, ESB Networks, said that more than 300,000 properties in Ireland still had no power on Sunday, down from 768,000 on Friday. The Irish military was also helping out, but the company said that it could be two more weeks before electricity is restored to everyone. Irish Minister for Social Protection Dara Calleary said authorities were 'throwing everything at it.' 'We’re bringing additional people from England today and we’re looking for people from France, additional technicians,' he told broadcaster RTE. 'What we’re focused on is getting our infrastructure back up, getting our power back up, getting our water and connectivity back up as soon as is possible.' Another 75,000 people were still without power on Sunday in Northern Ireland, which is part of the United Kingdom and neighbors the Republic of Ireland. At least two people died during the storm. Kacper Dudek, 20, was killed when a tree fell on his car in County Donegal in northwest Ireland, local police said. Police in Scotland said that a 19-year-old man, who hasn't been named, died in a hospital on Saturday after a tree fell on his car in the southwestern town of Mauchline on Friday. More rainy and windy weather battered Britain and Ireland on Sunday, with a gust of 132 kph recorded at Predannack in southwest England.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-in-ireland-still-without-power-as-officials-say-storm-%c3%a9owyn-cleanup-will-take-time-/7950764.html	2025-01-26T07:58:19-08:00	
Jannik Sinner beats Alexander Zverev for 2nd Australian Open title	MELBOURNE, Australia — There's all sorts of ways beyond merely the score to measure just how dominant Jannik Sinner was while outplaying and frustrating Alexander Zverev during the 6-3, 7-6 (4), 6-3 victory Sunday that earned the 23-year-old Italian a second consecutive Australian Open championship. The zero break points Sinner faced. Or the 10 he accumulated. The 27-13 advantage in points that lasted at least nine strokes. Or the way Sinner accumulated more winners, 32 to 25, and fewer unforced errors, 27 to 45. The way Sinner won 10 of the 13 points that ended with him at the net. Or the way he only let Zverev go 14 of 27 in that category, frequently zipping passing shots out of reach. Well, here's is one more bit of evidence: what Zverev said about Sinner. 'I’m serving better than him, but that’s it. He does everything else better than me. He moves better than me. He hits his forehand better than me. He hits his backhand better than me. He returns better than me. He volleys better than me,' Zverev said. 'At the end of the day, tennis has five or six massive shots — like, massive factors — and he does four or five of them better than me. That’s the reason why he won.' High praise from a guy who is, after all, ranked No. 2. Sinner has held the No. 1 spot since last June and is not showing any signs of relinquishing it. This was the first Australian Open final between the men at No. 1 and No. 2 since 2019, when No. 1 Novak Djokovic defeated No. 2 Rafael Nadal — also in straight sets. 'It's amazing,' Sinner said, 'to achieve these things.' The 'things' include being the youngest man to leave Melbourne Park with the trophy two years in a row since Jim Courier in 1992-93, and the first man since Nadal at the French Open in 2005 and 2006 to follow up his first Grand Slam title by repeating as the champion at the same tournament a year later. Sinner was asked later whether he felt more relief or excitement when he raised his arms after the last point was his. 'This one was joy. We managed to do something incredible this time, because the situation I was in was completely different from a year ago here,' he said. 'I had more pressure.' Probably true, but it's hard to tell. Go to the start of 2024 and take stock. In that span, Sinner has won three of the five major tournaments, including the U.S. Open in September, meaning he now has claimed three straight hard-court Slams. His record is 80-6 with nine titles. His current unbeaten run covers 21 matches. 'There's always something that can get better,' said one of his two coaches, Simone Vagnozzi. 'He is playing really well right now and everything comes easily. But there will be tough moments ahead.' The only thing that’s clouded the past 12 months for Sinner, it seems, is the doping case in which his exoneration was appealed by the World Anti-Doping Agency. He tested positive for a trace amount of an anabolic steroid twice last March but blamed it on an accidental exposure involving two members of his team who have since been fired. Sinner initially was cleared in August; a hearing in the WADA appeal is scheduled for April. 'I keep playing like this because I have a clear mind on what happened,' Sinner said Sunday. 'I know if I would be guilty, I would not play like this.' While he became the eighth man in the Open era (which began in 1968) to start his career 3-0 in Grand Slam finals, Zverev is the seventh to be 0-3, adding this loss to those at the 2020 U.S. Open and last year's French Open. Those earlier setbacks both came in five sets. This contest was not that close. Not at all. 'I’ll keep doing everything I can,' Zverev said, 'to lift one of those trophies.' Just before Zverev began speaking into a microphone during the trophy ceremony, a voice cried out from the stands, making reference to two of the player’s ex-girlfriends who accused him of physical abuse. During the match, there truly was only one moment that contained a hint of tension. It came when Zverev was two points from owning the second set at 5-4, love-30. But a break point — and a set point — never arrived. A year ago, Sinner went through a lot more trouble to earn his first major, needing to get past Novak Djokovic — who quit one set into his semifinal against Zverev on Friday because of a torn hamstring — before erasing a two-set deficit in the final against 2021 U.S. Open champion Daniil Medvedev. This time, Sinner applied pressure with an all-around style that does not really appear to have holes. 'The facts speak for themselves,' Zverev said. 'He’s in a different universe right now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jannik-sinner-beats-alexander-zverev-for-2nd-australian-open-title/7950756.html	2025-01-26T07:49:44-08:00	
Pope Francis warns of 'scourge of antisemitism' ahead of Holocaust Remembrance Day	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis warned of the 'scourge of antisemitism' in his Angelus prayer on Sunday, the eve of the International Holocaust Remembrance Day, noting it marks 80 years since the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp. 'The horror of the extermination of millions of Jewish people and others of different faiths during those years must never be forgotten or denied,' Francis said, citing the example of Hungarian-born poet Edith Bruck, who lives in Rome. He noted that many Christians were also killed in Nazi concentration camps, 'among whom there were numerous martyrs.' 'I renew my appeal for everyone to work together to eradicate the scourge of antisemitism, along with every form of discrimination and religious persecution,' Francis said. 'Together, let us build a more fraternal, just world, educating young people to have hearts open to all, in the spirit of fraternity, forgiveness, and peace,' he added. The pontiff also launched an appeal for an end to the civil war in Sudan, which began in April 2023, saying it is causing 'the most severe humanitarian crisis in the world, with dramatic consequences even in South Sudan.' The pope also expressed concern for the situation in Colombia’s Catatumbo region, where many civilians have been killed by clashes between armed groups, which have forced over 30,000 people to leave their homes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-warns-of-scourge-of-antisemitism-ahead-of-holocaust-remembrance-day-/7950693.html	2025-01-26T06:16:32-08:00	
Congo severs ties with Rwanda as rebels close in on Goma, displacing thousands	GOMA, DRC — Congo severed diplomatic ties with Rwanda as fighting between Rwanda-backed rebels and government forces raged around the key eastern city of Goma, leaving at least 13 peacekeepers and foreign soldiers dead and displacing thousands of civilians. The M23 rebel group has made significant territorial gains along the border with Rwanda in recent weeks, closing in on Goma, the provincial capital of around 2 million people and a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts. Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing M23, which is mainly made up of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army more than a decade ago. It's one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in the mineral-rich region, where a long-running conflict has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. Rwanda's government denies backing the rebels, but last year acknowledged that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. The Congolese foreign ministry said late Saturday it was severing diplomatic ties with Rwanda and pulling out all diplomatic staff from the country 'with immediate effect.' Rwanda did not comment immediately. The U.N. Security Council moved up an emergency meeting on the escalating violence in eastern Congo to Sunday. Congo requested the meeting, which had originally been scheduled for Monday. On Sunday morning, heavy gunfire resonated across Goma, just a few kilometers from the front line, while scores of displaced children and adults fled the Kanyaruchinya camp, one of the largest in eastern Congo, right near the Rwandan border, and headed south to Goma. 'We are fleeing because we saw soldiers on the border with Rwanda throwing bombs and shooting,' said Safi Shangwe, who was heading to Goma. 'We are tired and we are afraid, our children are at risk of starving,' she added. Some of the displaced worried they will not be safe in Goma either. 'We are going to Goma, but I heard that there are bombs in Goma, too, so now we don't know where to go,' said Adèle Shimiye. Hundreds of people attempted to flee to Rwanda through the border crossings east of Goma on Sunday while migration officers carefully checked travel documents. 'I am crossing to the other side to see if we will have a place of refuge because for the moment, security in the city is not guaranteed,' Muahadi Amani, a resident of Goma, told The Associated Press. Earlier in the week, the rebels seized Sake, 27 kilometers from Goma, as concerns mounted that the city could soon fall. Congo's army said Saturday it fended off an M23 offensive with the help of allied forces, including U.N. troops and soldiers from the Southern African Development Community Mission, also known as SAMIDRC. Two South African peacekeepers were killed Friday, while a Uruguayan soldier was killed Saturday, a U.N. official told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on the matter publicly. Additionally, three Malawian peacekeepers were killed in eastern Congo, the United Nations in Malawi said Saturday. Seven South African soldiers from the SAMIDRC were also killed during clashes with M23 over the last two days, South Africa's Defense Department said. Since 2021, Congo's government and allied forces, including SAMIDRC and U.N. troops, have been keeping M23 away from Goma. The U.N peacekeeping force, also known as MONUSCO, entered Congo more than two decades ago and has around 14,000 peacekeepers on the ground.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-severs-ties-with-rwanda-as-rebels-close-in-on-goma-displacing-thousands-/7950644.html	2025-01-26T04:45:16-08:00	
South Korean president indicted as 'ringleader of an insurrection'	Seoul — South Korean prosecutors indicted impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol Sunday for being the 'ringleader of an insurrection' after his abortive declaration of martial law, ordering the suspended leader to remain in detention. Yoon plunged the country into political chaos with his December 3 bid to suspend civilian rule, a move which lasted just six hours before lawmakers defied armed soldiers in parliament to vote it down. He was impeached soon after, and earlier this month became the first sitting South Korean head of state to be arrested. That came after a weekslong holdout at his residence, where his elite personal security detail resisted attempts to detain him. In a statement, prosecutors said they had 'indicted Yoon Suk Yeol with detention today on charges of being the ringleader of an insurrection.' He has been held at the Seoul Detention Center since his arrest, and the formal indictment with detention means he will now be kept behind bars until his trial, which must happen within six months. The indictment was widely expected after a court twice rejected requests by prosecutors to extend his arrest warrant while their investigation proceeded. 'After a comprehensive review of evidence obtained during investigations [prosecutors] concluded that it was only appropriate to indict the defendant,' they said in a statement. The need to keep Yoon behind bars was justified by a 'continued risk of evidence destruction,' they said. The specific charge — being the ringleader of an insurrection — is not covered by presidential immunity, they added. 'Process of accountability' The opposition hailed the indictment. 'We need to hold not only those who schemed to carry out an illegal insurrection, but also those who instigated it by spreading misinformation,' said lawmaker Han Min-soo. Without providing evidence, Yoon and his legal team have pointed to purported election fraud and legislative gridlock at the opposition-controlled parliament as justification for his declaration of martial law. Yoon has vowed to 'fight to the end', earning the support of supporters who have adopted the 'stop the steal' rhetoric associated with U.S. President Donald Trump. 'This indictment will provide a sense of relief, reaffirming that the constitutional order is functioning as it should,' said Bae Kang-hoon, co-founder of political think tank Valid. Yoon also faces a series of Constitutional Court hearings, to decide whether to uphold his impeachment and strip him formally of the presidency. If the court rules against Yoon, he will lose the presidency and an election will be called within 60 days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-president-indicted-as-ringleader-of-an-insurrection-/7950623.html	2025-01-26T03:26:48-08:00	
3 killed in Lebanon amid protests as Israeli forces remain	MAYS AL-JABAL, LEBANON — At least three people were killed and more than 40 others injured in southern Lebanon Sunday when Israeli forces opened fire on protesters who had breached roadblocks the Israeli army set up a day before, Lebanon's health ministry reported. Demonstrators, some of them carrying Hezbollah flags, attempted to enter several villages in the border area to protest Israel's failure to withdraw its troops from southern Lebanon by the 60-day deadline stipulated in a ceasefire agreement that halted the Israel-Hezbollah war in late November. Israel has said that it needs to stay longer because the Lebanese army has not deployed to all areas of southern Lebanon to ensure that Hezbollah does not reestablish a military presence in the area. The Lebanese army has said it cannot deploy until Israeli forces withdraw. Lebanese President Joseph Aoun, said in a statement addressing the people of southern Lebanon on Sunday that 'Lebanon's sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable, and I am following up on this issue at the highest levels to ensure your rights and dignity.' He urged them to 'exercise self-restraint and trust in the Lebanese Armed Forces.' The Lebanese army, in a separate statement, said it was escorting civilians into some towns in the border area and called on residents to follow military instructions to ensure their safety. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, whose Amal Movement party is allied with Hezbollah and who served as an interlocutor between the militant group and the U.S. during ceasefire negotiations, said in a statement that Sunday's bloodshed 'is a clear and urgent call for the international community to act immediately and compel Israel to withdraw from occupied Lebanese territories.' Lebanon's Health Ministry said in a statement that one protester was killed and 10 others injured in the border village of Houla. Another protester was killed in the village of Aitaroun and 11 injured. A third protester was killed in the village of Blida and one person injured. The health ministry also reported injuries in the areas of Mays al-Jabal, Markaba, Bani Hayyan, Odaisseh, Rab Thalatin and Kfar Kila. There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military on the protests. The Israeli army's Arabic language spokesperson called Sunday morning in a post on X for residents of the border area not to attempt to return to their villages. An AP team was stranded overnight at a base of the U.N. peacekeeping force known as UNIFIL near Mays al-Jabal after the Israeli army erected roadblocks Saturday while they were joining a patrol by peacekeepers. The journalists reported hearing gunshots and booming sounds Sunday morning from the base, and peacekeepers said that dozens of protesters had gathered nearby. In the village of Aita al Shaab, families wandered over flattened concrete structures looking for remnants of the homes they left behind. No Israeli forces were present. 'These are our houses,' said Hussein Bajouk, one of the returning residents. 'However much they destroy, we will rebuild.' Bajouk added that he is convinced that former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli strike in Beirut's southern suburbs in September, is really still alive. 'I don't know how much we're going to wait, another month or two months... but the Sayyed will come out and speak,' he said using an honorific for Nasrallah. Some 112,000 Lebanese remain displaced, out of over 1 million displaced during the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-in-lebanon-amid-protests-as-israeli-forces-remain/7950610.html	2025-01-26T02:36:54-08:00	
Facebook scammers use fake VOA article to push Russian cryptocurrency scheme	When American conservative commentator Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian IT entrepreneur Pavel Durov in April, he had an additional unexpected audience: scammers. After the video was published, a phony Russian-language transcript of the interview tried to attract 'investors' to a cryptocurrency scheme that promised monthly earnings of $13,000. That scheme came to VOA’s attention because its creators used a copy of a VOA Russian article page in their attempts to defraud internet users. It is one of many examples of legitimate media outlets being exploited for fraudulent purposes. These schemes buy advertising using Facebook accounts — often hacked without the user’s knowledge — spanning countries like the Philippines, Mexico and Afghanistan. The strategy and rhetoric follow a pattern, according to Jordan Liles, at American fact-checking site Snopes.com. 'There are so many scams online that pose as legitimate publishers,' he told VOA. 'Name any publisher – they’ve probably been used in scams to try to fool people who don’t look at their web address bar.' There is no indication that Durov or Carlson is involved in the scheme. VOA reached out to them for comment but received no response. In a statement, Facebook parent company Meta told VOA it takes scams seriously. 'Fraud is a problem that’s always persisted with new technology,' the company wrote. 'But that’s exactly why Meta always has — and always will — take a hard line against scams, fraud and abuse in all of its forms to help keep it off of our platforms.' Scammers have previously posed as Voice of America, using deepfakes in two separate cases that targeted VOA Russian journalists. Those cases relied on artificial intelligence. In contrast, the Durov scam takes a distinctly low-tech approach: It uses a Q&A-style text transcript in Russian that falsely claims to be a 'continuation' of Carlson’s interview. The founder of Russian social media site VKontakte and messenger app Telegram, Durov is a well-known tech entrepreneur. That makes him harder to impersonate. According to an April 2024 report by the Microsoft Threat Analysis Center, while deepfakes of public figures 'are relatively routine,' they also tend not to be believable. Layers of lies At the center of the cryptocurrency scam impersonating VOA is an intriguing promise and a trail of stolen accounts spanning the globe. The fake story claims that Durov told Carlson about his latest creation: ProTON-Invest, an open program that will allow even the least financially literate person to earn large sums of money with minimal effort. VOA attempted to trace the origins of the ProTON-Invest scheme and its promotional content, but the fraudsters had done a good job covering their tracks. When VOA approached the owners of the Facebook accounts that bought advertising for the scheme, those who responded said they had lost access to their pages. One of the accounts, called 'Simply News' in Russian, had previously been the page of a business in Calumpit, a provincial city in the Philippines, that sold house plants and baked goods during the coronavirus pandemic. The business’s co-owner, Dannie Roxas, told VOA that the page had been hacked. 'We do not have any access to it and we cannot take it back anymore,' she said in a Telegram message. 'We already have reported it.' Another Facebook page promoting the scam (but without the fake VOA story) was 'Golden News.' It formerly belonged to a travel agency in Kabul, Afghanistan. VOA wrote to the agency over WhatsApp. A man who did not identify himself said the most recent posts were not from the company and they had likely been hacked. When VOA inquired further, he declined to provide more information. VOA also identified several more accounts sharing the fake transcript or pushing the fraud scheme. Two appeared to belong to a graphic designer in the Punjab region of Pakistan. He did not respond to a request for comment. Another belonged to a Mexican rapper. The man behind that page did not respond to a request for comment but had previously written from his personal Facebook page that his music account was hacked. According to Facebook’s Page Transparency data, the stolen accounts often had managers supposedly located in multiple countries, including Vietnam, Bangladesh, Ukraine, China and the U.S. But it’s unclear how Facebook determines where the managers are located. Meta did not respond to a question from VOA about that. If the determination is based on an IP address, that can easily be spoofed using a virtual private network (VPN), a basic tool for maintaining privacy online. Trouble fighting back At its core, the ProTON-Invest scam appears to benefit from the current online environment. When hackers take over an account, they often change the password, recovery email and phone number. That makes it extremely difficult to retake the account. After cryptocurrency scammers took over his Facebook account in early 2024, it took journalist Yuri – who asked to be identified only by his first name to discuss the hack without his employer’s permission – nearly six months to regain control. Ultimately, he had to hire a lawyer to engage with Facebook parent company Meta. 'If the lawyer hadn’t helped me, I would have spent a long time writing to Meta,' Yuri said. The scams are also relatively inexpensive to create. Facebook advertising costs very little, according to Snopes’ Liles. Meanwhile, people who fall victim to the scams give them hundreds or even thousands of dollars. 'If [the scammer] spent only $100, their scam has, unfortunately, been successful,' Liles told VOA. So, how can internet users distinguish a scam from real VOA? Besides looking for an accurate VOA URL in the web address of any supposed VOA page, users should also look for specific signs that VOA social media pages are legitimate. 'In our branding, VOA uses specific colors, and the social media accounts’ names are the same across platforms. On Facebook, Instagram and YouTube, look for the verification check mark, and follow links to other social media platforms from our website or official social media accounts,' a representative of VOA Public Relations said. 'On X, not all of our accounts are verified because they require a paid subscription, so always crosscheck the link on the website or official social media accounts.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/facebook-scammers-use-fake-voa-article-to-push-russian-cryptocurrency-scheme/7949807.html	2025-01-25T23:29:14-08:00	
Taipei pet shop strives to break down anti-snake prejudice	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As the Year of the Snake approaches, a pet store in Taipei is offering adventurous customers an opportunity to enjoy the company of snakes while sipping coffee, hoping to break down some of the prejudice against the animal. Taiwan has been plastered with images of the reptile ahead of the start of the Lunar New Year, which starts on Wednesday and whose zodiac animal this year is the snake. The snake has a mixed reputation in traditional Taiwanese and Chinese culture as a symbol of either good or bad. Some of Taiwan's Indigenous peoples venerate snakes as guardian spirits, and while the island is home to species potentially deadly to humans, including vipers and cobras, deaths are rare given the wide availability of anti-venom. Luo Chih-yu, 42, the owner of the Taipei pet shop Pythonism which opened in 2017, is offering potential snake owners the chance to interact with snakes over a cup of coffee. 'I provide a space for people to try and experience, finding out whether they like them without any prejudice,' he said. Liu Ting-chih took his daughter to the shop, who looked curiously at the animals in their cages. 'Through this activity she can learn how to take care of small animals and cherish them,' Liu said. Sub-tropical and mountainous Taiwan is home to some 60 native snake species.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taipei-pet-shop-strives-to-break-down-anti-snake-prejudice-/7949837.html	2025-01-25T23:28:31-08:00	
Indonesia showcases returned artifacts it had sought for decades from Netherlands	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Centuries-old stone Buddha statues and precious jewelry repatriated by the Dutch government to its former colony are on display at Indonesia's National Museum, providing a glimpse into the country's rich heritage that the government had struggled to retrieve. The collection is part of more than 800 artifacts that were returned under a Repatriation Agreement signed in 2022 between Indonesia and the Netherlands, said Gunawan, the museum's head of cultural heritage. The objects are not just those looted in conflict but also those seized by scientists and missionaries or smuggled by mercenaries during the four centuries of colonial rule. 'I was so amazed that we have all of these artifacts,' said Shaloom Azura, a visitor to the museum in Jakarta. She hoped other historical objects can be repatriated too, 'so we don't have to go to the Netherlands just to see our own cultural heritage.' The agreement to return cultural objects was inspired by the new era of global restitution and repatriation efforts. In 2021, France said it was returning statues, royal thrones and sacred altars taken from the West African nation of Benin. Belgium returned a gold-capped tooth belonging to the slain Congolese independence hero Patrice Lumumba. Cambodia in 2023 welcomed the return of priceless stolen artifacts that had been seized during periods of war and instability. Many of the items returned so far have come from the United States. And the Berlin museum authority said it would return hundreds of human skulls from the former German colony of East Africa. The Dutch government announced the same year the return of the Indonesian treasures and looted artifacts from Sri Lanka. Few objects made it back before deal was struck The repatriation 'is not something out of the blue' but followed a lengthy process, said I Gusti Agung Wesaka Puja, former Indonesian ambassador to the Netherlands who also headed the government's team tasked to recover the objects. He said negotiations with the Dutch government have been ongoing since Indonesia's independence in August 1945, but it was only in July 2022 that Indonesia formally requested the return of its cultural objects with a list of specific items. 'This repatriation is important for us to reconstruct history that may be lost or obscured or manipulated,' Puja said. 'And we can fill the gap of the historical vacuum that has existed so far.' The Dutch government in 1978 returned the famous 13th-century statue of Princess Pradnya Paramita from the Javanese Singhasari Kingdom. During the same visit to Indonesia, then-Queen Juliana also returned a saddle and spear seized from Prince Diponegoro, a Javanese nobleman considered a national hero for his struggle against colonial rule in the 19th century. The prince's scepter was returned in 2015. In 2020, Dutch King Willem-Alexander handed over Diponegoro's gold-plated kris dagger in his first state visit to Indonesia. Also pending is the return of the 'Java Man' — the first known example of homo erectus that was collected by Dutch paleoanthropologist Eugene Dubois in the 19th century. 'The importance of the most recent repatriation is knowledge creation, that will give society a more complete knowledge of our past history,' said Puja. He said the recent repatriation efforts seem to also be motivated by practical considerations, such as when the Delf city administration sent back 1,500 objects in 2019. They were part of the bankrupted Nusantara Museum collection. Focus on protection of repatriated artifacts However, Marc Gerritsen, the Dutch ambassador to Indonesia, said the repatriation would only focus on cultural objects that are requested, rather than emptying out European museums. 'There is a huge interest from the Dutch public in Indonesian history and Indonesian culture, so we do know that if Dutch museums put these objects on display, there will be an interest,' Gerritsen said, 'But again, the heart of the matter is that the colonial collections artifacts that were stolen during the colonial period are returned on the basis of this process that was established.' He said the Netherlands, the largest investor from the European Union in Indonesia, has a unique relationship with Southeast Asia's biggest economy. 'Of course, we have elements of which we are not proud, but we are really grateful for the fact that Indonesia is so much attached to preserving that history,' Gerritsen said. To support its former colony in safeguarding its repatriated cultural heritage, the Dutch government has offered to assist in improving museum storage conditions and staff expertise. Some researchers have criticized Indonesia, the world's largest archipelago nation of 17,000 islands, for a lack of legal framework to protect its rich cultural heritage and natural conservation. At least 11 cases of museum theft were reported between 2010 and 2020, according to a 2023 report by Rucitarahma Ristiawan, a lecturer of cultural science at Gajah Mada University, and two other researchers. In 2023, dozens of ships dredged the bottom of the Batanghari River in Jambi province, and the crews looted archaeological objects including porcelain, coins, metal and gold artifacts, which are believed to have been sold abroad, the report said. 'I think there is a lot to be reviewed from our historical works that are still kept in other countries,' said Frengky Simanjuntak, who marveled at the Repatriation Exhibition at the National Museum, on display since October. 'So it's not just about bringing them back home, but how to protect them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-showcases-returned-artifacts-it-had-sought-for-decades-from-netherlands-/7949888.html	2025-01-25T23:27:56-08:00	
Polls open in Belarus with Lukashenko set to extend 30-year rule	MINSK, BELARUS — Belarusians began voting Sunday, with President Alexander Lukashenko expected to cruise to victory unchallenged for a seventh term, prolonging his three-decade authoritarian rule. Lukashenko, a 70-year-old former collective farm boss, has been in power in reclusive, Moscow-allied Belarus since 1994. Polls opened at 8 a.m. (0500 GMT) in Minsk's first presidential vote since Lukashenko suppressed mass protests against his rule in 2020. He has since allowed Moscow to use Belarusian territory to invade Ukraine in 2022. The opposition and the West said Lukashenko rigged the last vote and the authorities cracked down on demonstrations, with more than a thousand people still jailed. All of Lukashenko's political opponents are either in prison -- some held incommunicado -- or in exile along with tens of thousands of Belarusians who have fled since 2020. 'All our opponents and enemies should understand: do not hope, we will never repeat what we had in 2020,' Lukashenko told a stadium in Minsk during a carefully choreographed ceremony Friday. Belarusians hope for 'no war' Most people in Belarus have only distant memories of life in the landlocked country before Lukashenko, who was 39 when he won the first national election in Belarus since it gained independence from the Soviet Union. Criticism of the strongman is banned in Belarus. Most people AFP spoke to in Minsk and other towns voiced support for him but were still fearful of giving their surnames. The other candidates running against Lukashenko have been picked to give the election an air of democracy and few know who they are. 'I will vote for Lukashenko because things have improved since he became president [in 1994],' said 42-year-old farmer Alexei in the tiny village of Gubichi in southeastern Belarus. He earns around 300 euros a month selling milk. But, like many in Belarus, he is worried about the war in neighboring Ukraine. In 2022, Russian troops entered Ukraine from several directions, including from Belarus. The following year, Russia sent tactical nuclear weapons to the country, which borders NATO countries. Alexei said he wished 'for there not to be a war.' The government's narrative has been to say that Lukashenko guaranteed peace and order in Belarus, accusing 2020 street protest leaders of sowing chaos. 'Farce' The United Nations estimates that some 300,000 Belarusians have left the country since 2020 -- mostly to Poland and Lithuania -- out of a population of 9 million. They will not be able to cast ballots, with Belarus having scrapped voting abroad. Exiled opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya denounced the vote as a 'farce' in a January interview with AFP. Her husband, Sergei Tikhanovsky, has been held incommunicado for almost a year. She urged dissidents to prepare for an opportunity to change their country but conceded 'it was not the moment.' In the run-up to the election, the Lukashenko administration pardoned around 200 political prisoners. But former prisoners AFP spoke to say those released are under the close watch of security services and are unable to lead a normal life. Nobel Prize winner Ales Bialiatski is among those in prison in Belarus. Reliant on Russia While Lukashenko once carefully balanced his relations between the European Union and Moscow, since 2020 he has become politically and economically reliant on Russia. Kaja Kallas, the EU's top diplomat, called the election a 'sham' in a posting on X Saturday and said, 'Lukashenko doesn't have any legitimacy.' Known as 'Europe's last dictator' -- a nickname he embraces -- Lukashenko's Belarus has retained much of the Soviet Union's traditions and infrastructure. Unlike in Russia, the KGB security agency has kept its haunting name and Belarus still applies the death penalty. The country's economy is largely state-planned and Lukashenko scrapped Belarus's white-red-white flag in the 1990s -- which has since become the symbol of the opposition. Lukashenko prides himself for having kept the country's Soviet-era industries and agriculture enterprises in state hands. In his speech on Friday, he spoke about the 'pyatiletka' (Five Year Plan) -- an economic term used in the Soviet Union.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polls-open-in-belarus-with-lukashenko-set-to-extend-30-year-rule/7950578.html	2025-01-25T23:05:19-08:00	
WHO chief urges end to attacks on Sudan health care after 70 drone strike kills 70	The head of the World Health Organization called on Saturday for an end to attacks on health care workers and facilities in Sudan after a drone attack on a hospital in Sudan's North Darfur region killed more than 70 people and wounded dozens. 'As the only functional hospital in El Fasher, the Saudi Teaching Maternal Hospital provides services which include gyn-obstetrics, internal medicine, surgery and pediatrics, along with a nutrition stabilization center,' WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus posted on X after the Friday strike. 'We continue to call for a cessation of all attacks on health care in Sudan, and to allow full access for the swift restoration of the facilities that have been damaged,' Tedros said. The war between Sudan's army and the Rapid Support Forces, which broke out in April 2023 due to disputes over the integration of the two forces, has killed tens of thousands, driven millions from their homes and plunged half of the population into hunger. The conflict has produced waves of ethnically driven violence blamed largely on the RSF, creating a humanitarian crisis. Darfur Governor Mini Minnawi said on X that an RSF drone had struck the emergency department of the hospital in the capital of North Darfur, killing patients, including women and children. Fierce clashes have erupted in El Fasher between the RSF and the Sudanese joint forces, including the army, armed resistance groups, police, and local defense units.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-chief-urges-end-to-attacks-on-sudan-health-care-after-70-drone-strike-kills-70/7950576.html	2025-01-25T22:25:24-08:00	
Trump discussing TikTok purchase with multiple people; decision in 30 days	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday he was in talks with multiple people over buying TikTok and would likely have a decision on the popular app's future in the next 30 days. 'I have spoken to many people about TikTok and there is great interest in TikTok,' Trump told reporters on Air Force One during a flight to Florida. Earlier in the day, Reuters reported two people with knowledge of the discussions said Trump's administration is working on a plan to save TikTok that involves tapping software company Oracle and a group of outside investors to effectively take control of the app's operations. Under the deal being negotiated by the White House, TikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, would retain a stake in the company, but data collection and software updates would be overseen by Oracle, which already provides the foundation of TikTok's Web infrastructure, one of the sources told Reuters. However, in his comments to reporters on the flight, Trump said he had not spoken to Oracle's Larry Ellison about buying the app. Asked if he was putting together a deal with Oracle and other investors to save TikTok, Trump said: 'No, not with Oracle. Numerous people are talking to me, very substantial people, about buying it and I will make that decision probably over the next 30 days. Congress has given 90 days. If we can save TikTok, I think it would be a good thing.' The sources did say the terms of any potential deal with Oracle were fluid and likely to change. One source said the full scope of the discussions was not yet set and could include the U.S. operations as well as other regions. National Public Radio on Saturday reported the deal talks for TikTok's global operations, citing two people with knowledge of the negotiations. Oracle had no immediate comment. The deal being negotiated anticipates participation from ByteDance's current U.S. investors, according to the sources. Jeff Yass's Susquehanna International Group, General Atlantic, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Sequoia Capital are among ByteDance's U.S. backers. Representatives for TikTok, ByteDance investors General Atlantic, KKR, Sequoia and Susquehanna could not immediately be reached for comment. Others vying to acquire TikTok, including the investor group led by billionaire Frank McCourt and another involving Jimmy Donaldson, better known as the YouTube star Mr. Beast, are not part of the Oracle negotiation, one of the sources said. Oracle responsible Under the terms of the deal, Oracle would be responsible for addressing national security issues. TikTok initially struck a deal with Oracle in 2022 to store U.S. users' information to alleviate Washington's worries about Chinese government interference. TikTok's management would remain in place, to operate the short video app, according to one of the sources. The app, which is used by 170 million Americans, was taken offline temporarily for users shortly before a law that said it must be sold by ByteDance on national security grounds, or be banned, took effect on Jan. 19. Trump, after taking office a day later, signed an executive order seeking to delay by 75 days the enforcement of the law that was put in place after U.S. officials warned that under ByteDance, there was a risk of Americans' data being misused. Officials from Oracle and the White House held a meeting on Friday about a potential deal, and another meeting has been scheduled for next week, NPR reported. Oracle was interested in a TikTok stake 'in the tens of billions,' but the rest of the deal is in flux, the NPR report cited the source as saying. Trump has said he 'would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture' in TikTok. NPR cited another source as saying that appeasing Congress is seen as a key hurdle by the White House. Free speech advocates have opposed TikTok's ban under a law passed by the U.S. Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden. The company has said U.S. officials have misstated its ties to China, arguing its content recommendation engine and user data are stored in the United States on cloud servers operated by Oracle while content moderation decisions that affect American users are also made in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-discussing-tiktok-purchase-with-multiple-people-decision-in-30-days/7950571.html	2025-01-25T21:00:57-08:00	
Rubio threatens bounties on Taliban leaders over detained Americans	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Saturday threatened bounties on the heads of Afghanistan's Taliban leaders, sharply escalating the tone as he said more Americans may be detained in the country than previously thought. The threat comes days after the Afghan Taliban government and the United States swapped prisoners in one of the final acts of former U.S. President Joe Biden. The new top U.S. diplomat issued the harsh warning via social media, in a rhetorical style strikingly similar to his boss, President Donald Trump. 'Just hearing the Taliban is holding more American hostages than has been reported,' Rubio wrote on X. 'If this is true, we will have to immediately place a VERY BIG bounty on their top leaders, maybe even bigger than the one we had on bin Laden,' he said, referring to the al-Qaida leader killed by U.S. forces in 2011. Rubio did not describe who the other Americans may be, but there have long been accounts of missing Americans whose cases were not formally taken up by the U.S. government as wrongful detentions. In the deal with the Biden administration, the Taliban freed the best-known American detained in Afghanistan, Ryan Corbett, who had been living with his family in the country and was seized in August 2022. Also freed was William McKenty, an American about whom little information has been released. The United States in turn freed Khan Mohammed, who was serving a life sentence in a California prison. Mohammed was convicted of trafficking heroin and opium into the United States and was accused of seeking rockets to kill U.S. troops in Afghanistan. The United States offered a bounty of $25 million for information leading to the capture or killing of Osama bin Laden shortly after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks, with Congress later authorizing the secretary of state to offer up to $50 million. No one is believed to have collected the bounty for bin Laden, who was killed in a U.S. raid in Pakistan. Harder line on Taliban? Trump is known for brandishing threats in his speeches and on social media. But he is also a critic of U.S. military interventions overseas and in his second inaugural address Monday said he aspired to be a 'peacemaker.' In his first term, the Trump administration broke a then-taboo and negotiated directly with the Taliban -- with Trump even proposing a summit with the then-insurgents at the Camp David presidential retreat -- as he brokered a deal to pull U.S. troops and end America's longest war. Biden carried out the agreement, with the Western-backed government swiftly collapsing and the Taliban retaking power in August 2021 just after U.S. troops left. The scenes of chaos in Kabul brought strong criticism of Biden, especially when 13 American troops and scores of Afghans died in a suicide bombing at the city's airport. The Biden administration had low-level contacts with Taliban government representatives but made little headway. Some members of Trump's Republican Party criticized even the limited U.S. engagements with the Taliban government and especially the humanitarian assistance authorized by the Biden administration, which insisted the money was for urgent needs in the impoverished country and never routed through the Taliban. Rubio on Friday froze nearly all U.S. aid around the world. No country has officially recognized the Taliban government, which has imposed severe restrictions on women and girls under its ultra-conservative interpretation of Islam. The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor on Thursday said he was seeking arrest warrants for senior Taliban leaders over the persecution of women.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-threatens-bounties-on-taliban-leaders-over-detained-americans/7950570.html	2025-01-25T20:41:40-08:00	
Trump wants Jordan and Egypt to accept more refugees	ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE — President Donald Trump said Saturday he'd like to see Jordan, Egypt and other Arab nations increase the number of Palestinian refugees they are accepting from the Gaza Strip — potentially moving out enough of the population to 'just clean out' the war-torn area to create a virtual clean slate. During a 20-minute question-and-answer session with reporters aboard Air Force One on Saturday, Trump also said he's ended his predecessor's hold on sending 907-kilogram bombs to Israel. That lifts a pressure point that had been meant to reduce civilian casualties during Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza that is now halted by a tenuous ceasefire. 'We released them today,' Trump said of the bombs. 'They've been waiting for them for a long time.' Asked why he lifted the ban on those bombs, Trump responded, 'Because they bought them.' Trump has built his political career around being unapologetically pro-Israel. On his larger vision for Gaza, Trump said he had call earlier in the day with King Abdullah II of Jordan and would speak Sunday with President Abdel Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt. 'I'd like Egypt to take people,' Trump said. 'You're talking about probably a million and a half people, and we just clean out that whole thing and say, 'You know, it's over.'' Trump said he complimented Jordan for having successfully accepted Palestinian refugees and that he told the king, 'I'd love for you to take on more, ‘cause I'm looking at the whole Gaza Strip right now, and it's a mess. It's a real mess.' He said of such a mass movement of Palestinians, 'it could be temporary or long term,' adding that the area of the world that encompasses Gaza, has 'had many, many conflicts' over centuries. 'Something has to happen,' Trump said. 'But it's literally a demolition site right now. Almost everything's demolished, and people are dying there.' He added: 'So, I'd rather get involved with some of the Arab nations, and build housing in a different location, where they can maybe live in peace for a change.' There was no immediate comment from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office. Trump has offered nontraditional views on the future of Gaza in the past. He suggested after he was inaugurated on Monday that Gaza has 'really got to be rebuilt in a different way.' The new president added then, 'Gaza is interesting. It's a phenomenal location, on the sea. The best weather, you know, everything is good. It's like, some beautiful things could be done with it, but it's very interesting.' His resuming delivery of large bombs, meanwhile, is a break with then-President Joe Biden, who halted their delivery in May as part of an effort to keep Israel from launching an all-out assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. A month later, Israel did take control of the city, but after the vast majority of the 1 million civilians that had been living or sheltering in Rafah had fled. 'Civilians have been killed in Gaza as a consequence of those bombs and other ways in which they go after population centers,' Biden told CNN in May when he held up the weapons. 'I made it clear that if they go into Rafah ... I'm not supplying the weapons that have been used historically to deal with Rafah, to deal with the cities, that deal with that problem.' The Biden pause had also held up 1,700 227-kilogram bombs that had been packaged in the same shipment to Israel, but weeks later those bombs were delivered. Trump's action comes as he has celebrated the first phase of a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel that has paused the fighting and seen the release of some hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in return for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Negotiations have yet to begin in earnest on the more difficult second phase of the deal that would eventually see the release of all hostages held by Hamas and an enduring halt to the fighting. The Israeli government has threatened to resume its war against Hamas — which launched a massive assault against Israel on Oct. 7, 2023 — if the remaining hostages are not released.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-wants-jordan-and-egypt-to-accept-more-refugees/7950563.html	2025-01-25T20:20:08-08:00	
Rain in California will aid firefighters, create risk of toxic runoff	LOS ANGELES — Rain began falling in parched Southern California on Saturday in a boon for firefighters who were mopping up multiple wildfires. But heavy downpours on charred hillsides could bring the threat of new troubles like toxic ash runoff. Los Angeles County crews spent much of the week removing vegetation, shoring up slopes and reinforcing roads in devastated areas of the Palisades and Eaton fires. The two fires reduced entire neighborhoods to rubble and ash after breaking out during powerful winds on January 7. Most of the region was expected to get about 2.5 centimeters of precipitation over several days, but 'the threat is high enough to prepare for the worst-case scenario' of localized cloudbursts causing mud and debris to flow down hills, the National Weather Service said on social media. 'So the problem would be if one of those showers happens to park itself over a burn area,' weather service meteorologist Carol Smith said. 'That could be enough to create debris flows.' The rain started along the Central Coast before moving into Ventura and LA counties in the evening. It was forecast to increase throughout the weekend and possibly last into early Tuesday, Smith said. Flood watches were issued for some burn areas, and snow was likely in the mountains. Leaders take steps to speed cleanup Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass issued an executive order this week to expedite cleanup efforts and mitigate the environmental impacts of fire-related pollutants. Los Angeles County supervisors also approved an emergency motion to install flood-control infrastructure and expedite and remove sediment in fire-impacted areas. Fire crews filled sandbags for communities while county workers installed barriers and cleared drainage pipes and basins. Officials cautioned that ash in recent burn zones was a toxic mix of incinerated cars, electronics, batteries, building materials, paints, furniture and other household items. It contains pesticides, asbestos, plastics and lead. Residents were urged to wear protective gear while cleaning up. Concerns about post-fire debris flows have been especially high since 2018, when the town of Montecito up the coast from LA was ravaged by mudslides after a downpour hit mountain slopes burned bare by a huge blaze. Twenty-three people died, and hundreds of homes were damaged. Several fires continue burning While the impending wet weather ended weeks of dangerous gusts and dry conditions, several wildfires were still burning across Southern California. Those included the Palisades and Eaton fires, which killed at least 28 people and destroyed more than 14,000 structures. Containment of the Palisades Fire reached 81%, and the Eaton Fire was at 95% containment. In northern Los Angeles County, firefighters made significant progress against the Hughes Fire, which prompted evacuations for tens of thousands of people when it erupted Wednesday in mountains near Lake Castaic. And in San Diego County, there was still little containment of the Border 2 Fire churning through a remote area of the Otay Mountain Wilderness near the U.S.-Mexico border. The rain was expected to snap a near-record streak of dry weather for Southern California. Much of the region has received less than 5% of the average rainfall for this point in the water year, which began October 1, the Los Angeles Times reported. Most of Southern California is now either in 'extreme drought' or 'severe drought,' according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rain-expected-in-california-will-aid-firefighting-but-could-lead-to-toxic-runoff-/7950548.html	2025-01-25T18:24:56-08:00	
CIA: COVID likely originated in a lab, but agency has ‘low confidence’ in report	WASHINGTON — The CIA now believes the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic most likely originated from a laboratory, according to an assessment released Saturday that points the finger at China even while acknowledging that the spy agency has 'low confidence' in its own conclusion. The finding is not the result of any new intelligence, and the report was completed at the behest of the Biden administration and former CIA Director William Burns. It was declassified and released Saturday on the orders of President Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency, John Ratcliffe, who was sworn in Thursday as director. The nuanced finding suggests the agency believes the totality of evidence makes a lab origin more likely than a natural origin. But the agency's assessment assigns a low degree of confidence to this conclusion, suggesting the evidence is deficient, inconclusive or contradictory. Earlier reports on the origins of COVID-19 have split over whether the coronavirus emerged from a Chinese lab, potentially by mistake, or whether it arose naturally. The new assessment is not likely to settle the debate. In fact, intelligence officials say it may never be resolved, due to a lack of cooperation from Chinese authorities. The CIA 'continues to assess that both research-related and natural origin scenarios of the COVID-19 pandemic remain plausible,' the agency wrote in a statement about its new assessment. Instead of new evidence, the conclusion was based on fresh analyses of intelligence about the spread of the virus, its scientific properties and the work and conditions of China's virology labs. Lawmakers have pressured America's spy agencies for more information about the origins of the virus, which led to lockdowns, economic upheaval and millions of deaths. It's a question with significant domestic and geopolitical implications as the world continues to grapple with the pandemic's legacy. Republican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas, chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said Saturday he was 'pleased the CIA concluded in the final days of the Biden administration that the lab-leak theory is the most plausible explanation,' and he commended Ratcliffe for declassifying the assessment. 'Now, the most important thing is to make China pay for unleashing a plague on the world,' Cotton said in a statement. China's embassy in Washington did not immediately return messages seeking comment. Chinese authorities have in the past dismissed speculation about COVID's origins as unhelpful and motivated by politics. While the origin of the virus remains unknown, scientists think the most likely hypothesis is that it circulated in bats, like many coronaviruses, before infecting another species, probably racoon dogs, civet cats or bamboo rats. In turn, the infection spread to humans handling or butchering those animals at a market in Wuhan, where the first human cases appeared in late November 2019. Some official investigations, however, have raised the question of whether the virus escaped from a lab in Wuhan. Two years ago, a report by the Energy Department concluded a lab leak was the most likely origin, though that report also expressed low confidence in the finding. The same year then-FBI Director Christopher Wray said his agency believed the virus 'most likely' spread after escaping from a lab. Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump's first term, has said he favors the lab leak scenario, too. 'The lab leak is the only theory supported by science, intelligence, and common sense,' Ratcliffe said in 2023. The CIA said it will continue to evaluate any new information that could change its assessment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cia-covid-likely-originated-in-a-lab-but-agency-has-low-confidence-in-report-/7950532.html	2025-01-25T17:28:11-08:00	
North Korea tests sea-to-surface cruise missiles, state media says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea has test-fired sea-to-surface strategic guided cruise missiles, state news agency KCNA reported Sunday, adding that the weapons 'precisely' hit their targets. 'The war deterrence means of the armed forces of the DPRK are being perfected more thoroughly,' North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said as he oversaw Saturday's test, the agency reported. The missiles hit their marks after travelling along the 1,500-kilometer (930-mile) elliptical and figure-eight orbits, the report said, adding that there was 'no negative impact on the security of neighboring countries.' KCNA did not say where the test took place. The weapons test by Pyongyang was the first since U.S. President Donald Trump returned to the White House on Monday. Shortly before his inauguration, North Korea fired several short-range ballistic missiles into the sea. Trump, who had a rare series of meetings with Kim during his first term in office, said in an interview aired Thursday that he would reach out to Kim again, calling the North Korean leader a 'smart guy.' The two Koreas remain technically at war since the 1950 to 1953 conflict ended in an armistice, not a peace treaty. Relations between Pyongyang and Seoul have been at one of their lowest points in years, with the North launching a flurry of ballistic missiles last year in violation of United Nations sanctions. On Sunday, KCNA carried a statement from North Korea's foreign ministry criticizing Washington and Seoul, South Korea, for carrying out joint military drills in recent days. 'The reality stresses that the DPRK should counter the U.S. with the toughest counteraction from A to Z as long as it refuses the sovereignty and security interests of the DPRK,' the statement said, referring to North Korea by its official acronym. 'This is the best option for dealing with the U.S.' Such joint military exercises regularly infuriate the nuclear-armed North, which decries them as rehearsals for invasion. In late October, North Korea test-fired what it said was its most advanced and powerful solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). It then fired a salvo of short-range ballistic missiles days later. U.S. and South Korean intelligence also believe that North Korea started in October to send thousands of troops to fight against Ukraine and has since suffered hundreds of casualties. Neither North Korea nor Russia has officially confirmed that Pyongyang's forces are fighting for Moscow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nkorea-test-fires-sea-to-surface-strategic-cruise-missile-state-media-says-/7950531.html	2025-01-25T17:17:09-08:00	
Haitian leader: Trump administration's deportation plans will be 'catastrophic'	ROME — The president of Haiti's transitional presidential council said the Trump administration's decisions to freeze aid programs, deport migrants and block refugees will be 'catastrophic' for Haiti. Leslie Voltaire made the comment in an interview with The Associated Press in Rome on Saturday following a meeting with Pope Francis at the Vatican. He visited the pope to ask for help for Haiti. 'I'm knocking on the doors of people who love Haiti. The pope loves Haiti, and he is eager to help,' Haiti's interim president said. The pontiff and Voltaire discussed the dire situation in Haiti where gangs have killed civilians and operate across the Caribbean nation with impunity. Half of Haiti's 11.4 million people are already hungry, according to Voltaire, and losing humanitarian assistance will make the situation dramatically worse. 'Trump said that Haiti is a 'shithole,' so I don't think he will care about Haiti,' Voltaire said, noting that thousands of people are already being repatriated from the Dominican Republic every week and gangs are terrorizing the populace. With the new U.S. policies, 'the situation will be catastrophic.' During his first administration, President Donald Trump used blunt language to question why the U.S. would accept immigrants from Haiti and other countries in Africa. At the time, the White House did not deny his remark but issued a statement saying Trump supports immigration policies that welcome 'those who can contribute to our society.' Voltaire said there are roughly 1.5 million Haitians in the United States and roughly 150,000 who were accepted under a program called the 'Temporary Protection System.' 'Trump says that he will expel all of them,' Voltaire said, adding that Haiti, which is already struggling with hunger and internally displaced people, cannot handle the influx. In a report released this month, the U.N. migration agency said internal displacement within Haiti has tripled over the last year and now surpasses 1 million people. The situation has been largely caused by gang violence in the Caribbean country. The new figure provided by the International Organization for Migration represents a record for Haiti. IOM said that 'relentless gang violence' in Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince has fueled a near-doubling of displacement in the city and a collapse of health care and other services and worsening food insecurity. About 200,000 people have been forcibly returned to Haiti over the last year mostly from the Dominican Republic. Voltaire and his transitional government have been tasked with leading the country to general elections, an elusive goal but he is convinced they can make it happen by next November despite powerful gangs that rule 85% of the capital and are gaining ground in surrounding areas. Nevertheless, Voltaire is positive that — if Haiti's multinational police force is boosted with several thousand additional officers — they can go ahead with elections this year. Kenya is leading the multinational police force with a total deployment of more than 600, below the 1,000 officers the country's president pledged. An additional 150 Guatemalans and an advance team of eight Salvadorean troops have also arrived, but the force remains far below its anticipated strength of 2,500 officers. Voltaire said Benin has pledged an additional 2,000 soldiers. 'We have to do a referendum on a new constitution and also the election at the end of November. I say that we can do the elections because we have like eight departments, like 80% of the country. We can do the election.' The power of gangs in Haiti has grown since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moïse. Some gangs have even indicated they want to be part of the political process. Voltaire excluded that possibility, 'I don't think they should be around the table.' More than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti last year, according to the United Nations. The number of killings increased by more than 20% compared with all of 2023, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haitian-leader-trump-administration-s-deportation-plans-will-be-catastrophic-/7950530.html	2025-01-25T17:12:36-08:00	
US migrant deportation flights arrive in Latin America	GUATEMALA CITY, GUATEMALA — U.S. military planes carrying dozens of expelled migrants arrived in Guatemala, authorities said Friday, as President Donald Trump moved to crack down on illegal immigration. A total of 265 Guatemalans arrived on three flights — two operated by the military, and one a charter, the Central American country's migration institute said, updating earlier figures. Washington also sent four deportation flights to Mexico on Thursday, the White House press secretary said on X, despite multiple U.S. media reports that authorities there had turned at least one plane back. The Mexican government has not confirmed either the arrival of flights or any agreement to receive a specific number of planes with deportees. But Mexico's foreign ministry said Friday it was ready to work with Washington over the deportation of its citizens, saying the country would 'always accept the arrival of Mexicans to our territory with open arms.' The flights came as the White House said it had arrested more than 1,000 people in two days with hundreds deported by military aircraft, saying that 'the largest massive deportation operation in history is well underway.' Some 538 illegal immigrant 'criminals' were arrested Thursday, it said, followed by another 593 on Friday. By comparison, under Trump's predecessor Joe Biden deportation flights were carried out regularly, with a total of 270,000 deportations in 2024 — a 10-year record — and 113,400 arrests, making an average of 310 per day. 'Bad, hard criminals' The Guatemalan government did not confirm whether any of the migrants arrested this week were among the deportees that arrived Friday. 'These are flights that took place after Trump took office,' an official in the Guatemalan vice president's office told AFP. A Pentagon source told AFP that 'overnight, two DOD (Department of Defense) aircraft conducted repatriation flights from the U.S. to Guatemala.' Early Friday the White House posted an image on X of men in shackles being marched into a military aircraft, with the caption: 'Deportation flights have begun.' Trump told reporters that the flights were to get 'the bad, hard criminals out.' 'Murderers, people that have been as bad as you get. As bad as anybody you've seen,' he said. Friday's deportees were taken to a reception center at an air force base in Guatemala's capital, away from the media. Crackdown a campaign promise Trump promised a crackdown on illegal immigration during the election campaign and began his second term with a flurry of executive actions aimed at overhauling entry to the United States. On his first day in office, he signed orders declaring a 'national emergency' at the southern border and announced the deployment of more troops to the area while vowing to deport 'criminal aliens.' His administration said it would also reinstate a 'Remain in Mexico' policy under which people who apply to enter the United States from Mexico must remain there until their application has been decided. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, said Friday on X that program had been reinstated, and that Mexico had deployed some 30,000 National Guard troops to its border. The Mexican foreign ministry did not confirm either claim in its statement. The White House has also halted an asylum program for people fleeing authoritarian regimes in Central and South America, leaving thousands of people stranded on the Mexican side of the border.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-migrant-deportation-flights-arrive-in-latin-america-/7950341.html	2025-01-25T15:58:54-08:00	
Italy's Meloni defends repatriation of Libyan warlord wanted by ICC	ROME — Italy's prime minister addressed growing criticism Saturday of the repatriation of a Libyan warlord wanted by the International Criminal Court, as Giorgia Meloni cited an appeals court order and security concerns. The repatriation of Ossama Anjiem to Libya, a key partner in Europe's efforts to keep migrants from crossing the Mediterranean and landing on its shores, sparked outrage from human rights groups and questions from Italy's opposition parties. Meloni said her government will ask the ICC to clarify why it took months to issue the arrest warrant for Anjiem, also known as Ossama al-Masri, and why it was issued only after he traveled through at least three European countries. 'Al-Masri was released by an order of Rome's Court of Appeal ... It was not a government choice,' Meloni told journalists during a trip to Saudi Arabia. Italy has close ties to Libya's internationally recognized government in Tripoli and relies on it to patrol its coasts and prevent migrants from leaving. Any trial of al-Masri in The Hague could bring unwanted attention to Italy's migration policies and its support of Libya's coast guard. Al-Masri leads the Tripoli branch of the Reform and Rehabilitation Institution, a notorious network of detention centers run by the government-backed Special Deterrence Forces. He was arrested Sunday in Turin, where he reportedly attended the Juventus-Milan soccer match the night before. The ICC warrant, dated the day before his arrest, accused al-Masri of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in Mitiga prison, starting in 2015, that are punishable with life in prison. The court said he was accused of murder, torture, rape and sexual violence. The prison holds political dissidents, migrants and others. Human rights groups for years have documented abuses in Libyan detention facilities where migrants are kept. The ICC said the arrest warrant was transmitted to member states Saturday, including Italy, and that the court had told Italy to contact it 'without delay' if it ran into problems cooperating with the warrant. But Rome's court of appeals ordered al-Masri freed Tuesday, citing a 'procedural error' in his arrest. The ruling said Justice Minister Carlo Nordio should have been informed ahead of time since the ministry handles all relations with the ICC. Al-Masri was sent to Libya aboard an aircraft of the Italian secret services. The ICC said it had not been given prior notice of the appeals court's decision, as required, and was 'yet to obtain verification from the authorities on the steps reportedly taken.' Meloni said Italy's government, 'faced with a dangerous individual, decided to expel him immediately and, as it happens in many cases with dangerous prisoners who are repatriated, didn't use a regular flight, also for passengers' safety.' She said Italy will provide all needed clarifications to the ICC. Opposition parties have asked Meloni to urgently explain the 'very serious' development, while calling on the justice minister to resign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-meloni-defends-repatriation-of-libyan-warlord-wanted-by-icc-/7950350.html	2025-01-25T15:49:55-08:00	
Trump restores US participation in two anti-abortion pacts	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump used his executive authority Friday to restore U.S. participation in two international anti-abortion pacts, including one that cuts off U.S. family planning funds for foreign organizations if they provide or promote abortions. Trump reinstated the Mexico City Policy, which opponents call the 'global gag rule' because they say it silences pro-choice advocates. Established by former President Ronald Reagan in 1984, it has been rescinded by each Democratic president since then and reinstated when a Republican returns to the White House. Abortion is a divisive issue in U.S. politics and was a major issue in the 2024 campaign won by Trump. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled to eliminate a nationwide right to abortion, leaving abortion laws to each of the 50 states. Trump said in his memorandum Friday he was directing Secretary of State Marco Rubio to implement the Mexico City Policy 'to ensure that U.S. taxpayer dollars do not fund organizations or programs that support or participate in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization.' Democrats and abortion rights advocates contend the rule disrupts other forms of health care access and blocks nongovernmental organizations abroad from receiving U.S. funds, even if they use their own money on abortion care. Janeen Madan Keller, a policy fellow at the Center for Global Development, said research showed that the order has led to an increase in unwanted pregnancies and abortions, counter to its intended impact. 'Broadly speaking these decisions are going to really set the United States back in advancing gender equality,' Madan Keller said, in part by limiting the ability of women and girls to complete school and enter the workforce. Rubio also announced Friday the United States was rejoining the Geneva Consensus Declaration, which critics say aims to limit abortion access for millions of women and girls around the world. The declaration was co-sponsored by the United States, Brazil, Uganda, Egypt, Hungary and Indonesia in 2020, when Trump was in office during his first term. It now has more than 35 signatories. The previous Trump administration said the declaration sought better health care for women and the preservation of human life, while also strengthening family as the foundational unit of society and protecting each nation's sovereignty. The State Department said Friday that one of the four objectives of the pact was to 'protect life at all stages.' Trump also issued an executive order related to the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits the use of federal funds to pay for abortion coverage in the United States, and rescinded two of predecessor Joe Biden's executive orders intending to preserve reproductive health services after the Supreme Court overturned the Roe v. Wade ruling on abortion. 'While this EO (executive order) has no immediate impact, it is an indication of the Trump administration doubling down on denying abortion access to people with low incomes,' the women's health care provider Planned Parenthood said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-restores-us-participation-in-two-anti-abortion-pacts-/7950342.html	2025-01-25T15:43:19-08:00	
Tens of thousands protest Germany's far right as Musk endorses AfD	HALLE, GERMANY — Tens of thousands of Germans rallied Saturday against the far right ahead of next month's legislative elections, as U.S. tech billionaire Elon Musk again endorsed the anti-immigrant AfD party. Musk, speaking by video link, told thousands of AfD supporters gathered in the eastern city of Halle that their party was 'the best hope for the future of Germany.' AfD supporters at the rally shouted their approval as party co-leader Alice Weidel looked on smiling. Meanwhile, protesters against the AfD turned out in cities across Germany. The largest gatherings took place in Berlin and Cologne, police revising their turnout figures upward to 35,000 and 40,000 respectively. The protesters in Berlin used their mobile phones to form 'a sea of light for democracy' in front of the Brandenburg Gate, holding letters forming the word 'Resistance.' AfD polling a record AfD is polling at about 20% before Germany's February 23 elections, a record for a party that has shattered a decades-old taboo in post-war Germany against supporting the far right. The mainstream conservative CDU/CSU alliance leads with about 30%, with CDU leader Friedrich Merz the favorite to become chancellor after the elections. Musk, a close associate of U.S. President Donald Trump, told the AfD rally the election was important. 'I think it could decide the entire fate of Europe, maybe the fate of the world,' he said. Musk has rattled European politicians in recent weeks with comments on his social platform X supporting AfD and far-right politicians in other countries, including Britain. Like Trump, the AfD opposes immigration, denies climate change, rails against gender politics, and has declared war on a political establishment and mainstream media it claims limit free speech. Peaceful protests The anti-AfD rallies took place in about 60 towns following calls from a variety of organizations, attracting more people than the police expected. The protests passed peacefully, with banners saying, 'Nazis out' or 'AfD is not an alternative,' a reference to the far-right party's full name 'Alternative for Germany.' The CDU's Merz also came in for criticism. Many protesters fear he is tempted to break his party's policy of refusing to enter into coalition talks with the AfD. There was also a protest in the southern city of Aschaffenbourg, where a deadly knife attack recently by an Afghan migrant further inflamed the debate over immigration. Several thousand also turned out in the eastern city of Halle, where the AfD rally was addressed by Musk, leading to a few incidents. Halle police said they had opened criminal investigations for offenses including assault, insults and disrupting traffic. They said they would also be taking action against 21 people who tried to force a barrier.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-protest-germany-s-far-right-as-musk-endorses-afd-/7950330.html	2025-01-25T15:38:27-08:00	
Trump visits Las Vegas casino to promote his plan to not tax tips	LAS VEGAS, NEVADA — President Donald Trump capped a frenzied first week back in office with a stop in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Saturday to talk about cutting taxes on tips, a 2024 campaign promise he made in the gambling and hospitality hub. Trump took the stage before cheering supporters at the Circa Resort and Casino in front of a large banner reading 'No Tax on Tips' and said economic confidence was soaring in the United States. 'America's decline is over,' he said at the start of his remarks, echoing themes from his inauguration remarks earlier in the week. Since taking office Monday, the new Republican president reversed a myriad of policies put in place by Democratic predecessor Joe Biden and moved to fulfill his vow of remaking and shrinking the federal bureaucracy. In visits Friday to disaster areas in North Carolina and California, Trump pledged federal aid to help those states recover from hurricane and wildfires after floating an idea to shutter the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In Las Vegas, Trump's event was designed to highlight a less controversial pledge to end taxation of income from tips and overtime, a proposal he first made in June as he courted service workers in the presidential swing state of Nevada. The tip-heavy hospitality industry comprises more than a fifth of jobs. 'Can you remember that little statement about tips?' Trump said during one of several inauguration day speeches Monday. 'Anybody remember that little statement? I think we won Nevada because of that statement.' Michael McDonald, Nevada Republican Party chairman, said the idea is attractive to people in the state who are facing high prices for essential goods like food and gas. 'He cares about the no tax on tips, no tax on Social Security. That was something that we brought to the community, and everybody loved it because we're all hurting,' McDonald told local television after welcoming Trump on Friday night. Trump promised to pursue an aggressive agenda of tax cuts if re-elected, which may face some hurdles even in a U.S. Congress controlled by his fellow Republicans. The proposals Trump made on the campaign trail — from extending his 2017 tax cuts to abolishing tax on tips, overtime and Social Security benefits — could add $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, according to the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Trump is pushing a plan to explicitly use revenue from higher tariffs on imported goods to help pay for extending trillions of dollars in tax cuts, an unprecedented shift likely to face opposition from Republican budget hawks concerned about the reliability and durability of tariff revenue. Days before he returned to office, some of his Republican allies in Congress warned that Trump's aggressive tax-cut agenda could fall victim to signs of worry in the bond market. At a closed-door meeting on Capitol Hill, Republicans in the House of Representatives aired concerns that the estimated $4 trillion cost over the next 10 years of extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts could undermine the U.S. government's ability to service its $36 trillion in debt, which is growing at a pace of $2 trillion a year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-visits-las-vegas-casino-to-promote-his-plan-to-not-tax-tips-/7950335.html	2025-01-25T15:10:50-08:00	
Red Cross: Yemen's Houthi rebels freed 153 war detainees	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Yemen's Houthi rebels unilaterally freed 153 war detainees Saturday, the International Committee of the Red Cross said, one of several overtures in recent days to ease tensions after the ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. Previous prisoner releases have been viewed as a means to jumpstart talks over permanently ending Yemen's decadelong war, which began when the Houthis seized the country's capital, Sanaa, in 2014. However, the Houthis' release comes just after they detained another seven Yemeni workers from the United Nations, sparking anger from the world body. Those released previously had been visited by Red Cross staff in Sanaa and received medical checks and other assistance, the organization said while announcing the release. The Houthis had signaled Friday night they planned the release of prisoners. The Red Cross said it 'welcomes this unilateral release as another positive step towards reviving negotiations.' 'This operation has brought much-needed relief and joy to families who have been anxiously waiting for the return of their loved ones,' said Christine Cipolla, the ICRC's head of delegation in Yemen. 'We know that many other families are also waiting for their chance to be reunited. We hope that today's release will lead to many more moments like this.' Abdul Qader al-Murtada, the head of the Houthis' Committee for Prisoners' Affairs, said in a statement carried by Houthi media that those released were 'humanitarian cases' that included the sick, wounded and the elderly. 'The goal of the initiative is to build trust and establish a new phase of serious and honest dealing,' al-Murtada reportedly said. The Red Cross has helped oversee other prisoner releases, including one that saw some 1,000 prisoners swapped in 2020, over 800 detainees exchanged in 2023 and another release in 2024. The rebels said earlier this week they would limit their attacks on ships in the Red Sea corridor and released the 25-member crew of the Galaxy Leader, a ship they seized in November 2023, as the first Gaza ceasefire took hold. The war in Yemen has killed more than 150,000 people, including fighters and civilians, and created one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters, killing tens of thousands more. The Houthis' attacks on shipping during the Israel-Hamas war have helped deflect attention from their problems at home. But they have faced casualties and damage from U.S.-led airstrikes targeting the group for months now, as well as other strikes by Israel. Meanwhile, Yemen's economy is in tatters, something that's put increasing pressure on the Houthis and others in the conflict to potentially negotiate an end to the war. A de facto ceasefire in the conflict, which drew in a Saudi-led coalition in 2015, has largely held for several years now even during the Houthis attacks over the Israel-Hamas war. Yet the Houthis still conducted the raids that saw seven U.N. workers detained, likely alongside others. The rebels previously detained U.N. staffers, as well as individuals associated with the once-open U.S. Embassy in Sanaa, Yemen's capital, aid groups and civil society. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres late Friday demanded the immediate and unconditional release of the seven, as well as all other U.N. workers held by the Houthis, some since 2021. 'The continued targeting of U.N. personnel and its partners negatively impacts our ability to assist millions of people in need in Yemen,' he warned in a statement. 'The Houthis must deliver on their previous commitments and act in the best interests of the Yemeni people and the overall efforts to achieve peace in Yemen.' The U.N. has halted work in Yemen, which provides food, medicine and other aid to the impoverished nation. U.S. President Donald Trump separately has moved to reinstate a terrorism designation he made on the group late in his first term that had been revoked by President Joe Biden, potentially setting the stage for new tensions with the rebels. Analysts have linked the newest U.N. detentions as being connected to the decision, though the Houthis themselves have yet to comment on them. The rebels have been airing repeated programs on television channels they control parading people they describe as working with Western intelligence agencies or the Israelis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/red-cross-yemen-s-houthi-rebels-freed-153-war-detainees-/7950328.html	2025-01-25T14:52:47-08:00	
Trump fires independent inspectors general at US agencies	WASHINGTON — The Trump administration has fired about 17 independent inspectors general at U.S. government agencies, a sweeping action to remove oversight of his new administration that some members of Congress are suggesting violates federal oversight laws. The dismissals began Friday night and were effective immediately, according to two people familiar with the action. They spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public. Neither confirmed the exact number of firings, but an email sent by one of the fired inspectors general said 'roughly 17' inspectors general had been removed. Congress was not given 30-day notices about the removals — something that even a top Republican is decrying. 'There may be good reason the IGs were fired. We need to know that if so,' Senator Chuck Grassley, chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said in a statement. 'I'd like further explanation from President Trump. Regardless, the 30-day detailed notice of removal that the law demands was not provided to Congress,' said Grassley, a Republican. The role of the modern-day inspector general dates to post-Watergate Washington, when Congress installed offices inside agencies as an independent check against mismanagement and abuse of power. Though inspectors general are presidential appointees, some serve presidents of both parties. All are expected to be nonpartisan. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham acknowledged that the firings violated statutes but shrugged it off: 'Just tell them you need to follow the law next time,' he said. Democrats and watchdog groups, however, used the dismissals to raise alarm that Trump was making it easier to take advantage of the government. 'Inspectors General are the cops on the beat preventing bad things from happening,' Max Stier, president and CEO of the nonpartisan Partnership for Public Service, said in a statement. 'Their work saves the taxpayer tens of billions of dollars every year.' The White House did not comment Saturday. Trump was in Las Vegas for a speech focused on his campaign promise to end federal taxation on tips. But the moves were consistent with Trump's first week back in the White House, which has featured a series of steps to remake the federal government. He has used executive orders to impose hiring freezes, cracked down on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and suggested he wants to shutter the Federal Emergency Management Agency and leave disaster recovery up to individual states affected by major emergencies. 'Yesterday, in the dark of night, President Trump fired at least 12 independent inspector generals at important federal agencies across the administration,' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said Saturday on the chamber's floor. 'This is a chilling purge and it's a preview of the lawless approach Donald Trump and his administration are taking far too often as he's becoming president.' The Washington Post, which first reported the firings, said that many were appointees from Trump's first term. Among those inspectors general reportedly removed included those for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense and Education. Spared in this round of dismissals, however, was Michael Horowitz, the longtime Justice Department inspector general who has issued reports on assorted politically explosive criminal investigations over the past decade. In December 2019, for instance, Horowitz released a report faulting the FBI for surveillance warrant applications in the investigation into ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 presidential campaign. But the report also found that the investigation had been opened for a legitimate purpose and did not find evidence that partisan bias had guided investigative decisions. Horowitz's status aside, the move against the watchdogs drew criticism from congressional Democrats. Still, Trump has aggressively challenged the authority of independent agency watchdog groups in the past. In 2020, he replaced multiple key inspectors general, including those leading the Defense Department and intelligence community, as well as the inspector general tapped to chair a special oversight board for the $2.2 trillion economic relief package on the coronavirus. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts called Trump's actions 'a purge of independent watchdogs in the middle of the night.' 'Inspectors general are charged with rooting out government waste, fraud, abuse, and preventing misconduct,' Warren posted on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7950316.html	2025-01-25T14:50:17-08:00

Big Tech wants data centers plugged into power plants; utilities balk	HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA — Looking for a quick fix for their fast-growing electricity diets, tech giants are increasingly looking to strike deals with power plant owners to plug in directly, avoiding a potentially longer and more expensive process of hooking into a fraying electric grid that serves everyone else. It's raising questions over whether diverting power to higher-paying customers will leave enough for others and whether it's fair to excuse big power users from paying for the grid. Federal regulators are trying to figure out what to do about it, and quickly. Front and center is the data center that Amazon's cloud computing subsidiary, Amazon Web Services, is building next to the Susquehanna nuclear plant in eastern Pennsylvania. The arrangement between the plant's owners and AWS — called a 'behind the meter' connection — is the first to come before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For now, FERC has rejected a deal that could eventually send 960 megawatts — about 40% of the plant's capacity — to the data center. That's enough to power more than 500,000 homes. That leaves the deal and others that likely would follow in limbo. It's not clear when FERC, which blocked the deal on procedural grounds, will take up the matter again or how the change in presidential administrations might affect things. 'The companies, they're very frustrated because they have a business opportunity now that's really big,' said Bill Green, the director of the MIT Energy Initiative. 'And if they're delayed five years in the queue, for example — I don't know if it would be five years, but years anyway — they might completely miss the business opportunity.' Driving demand for energy-hungry data centers The rapid growth of cloud computing and artificial intelligence has fueled demand for data centers that need power to run servers, storage systems, networking equipment and cooling systems. That's spurred proposals to bring nuclear power plants out of retirement, develop small modular nuclear reactors, and build utility-scale renewable installations or new natural gas plants. In December, California-based Oklo announced an agreement to provide 12 gigawatts to data center developer Switch from small nuclear reactors powered by nuclear waste. Federal officials say fast development of data centers is vital to the economy and national security, including to keep pace with China in the artificial intelligence race. For AWS, the deal with Susquehanna satisfies its need for reliable power that meets its internal requirements for sources that don't emit planet-warming greenhouse gases, such as coal, oil or gas-fueled plants. Big Tech also wants to stand up their centers fast. But tech's voracious appetite for energy comes at a time when the power supply is already strained by efforts to shift away from planet-warming fossil fuels. They can build data centers in a couple years, said Aaron Tinjum of the Data Center Coalition. But in some areas, getting connected to the congested electricity grid can take four years, and sometimes much more, he said. Plugging directly into a power plant would take years off their development timelines. What's in it for power providers In theory, the AWS deal would let Susquehanna sell power for more than they get by selling into the grid. Talen Energy, Susquehanna's majority owner, projected the deal would bring as much as $140 million in electricity sales in 2028, though it didn't disclose exactly how much AWS will pay for the power. The profit potential is one that other nuclear plant operators are embracing after years of financial distress and frustration with how they are paid in the broader electricity markets. Many say they've been forced to compete in some markets flooded with cheap natural gas and state-subsidized solar and wind energy. Power plant owners also say the arrangement benefits the wider public, by bypassing the costly buildout of long power lines and leaving more transmission capacity on the grid for everyone else. FERC's big decision A favorable ruling from FERC could open the door to many more huge data centers and other massive power users like hydrogen plants and bitcoin miners, analysts say. FERC's 2-1 rejection in November was procedural. Recent comments by commissioners suggest they weren't ready to decide how to regulate such a novel matter without more study. In the meantime, the agency is hearing arguments for and against the Susquehanna-AWS deal. Monitoring Analytics, the market watchdog in the mid-Atlantic grid, wrote in a filing to FERC that the impact would be 'extreme' if the Susquehanna-AWS model were extended to all nuclear power plants in the territory. Energy prices would increase significantly and there's no explanation for how rising demand for power will be met even before big power plants drop out of the supply mix, it said. Separately, two electric utility owners — which make money in deregulated states from building out the grid and delivering power — have protested that the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement amounts to freeloading off a grid that ordinary customers pay to build and maintain. Chicago-based Exelon and Columbus, Ohio-based American Electric Power say the Susquehanna-AWS arrangement would allow AWS to avoid $140 million a year that it would otherwise owe. Susquehanna's owners say the data center won't be on the grid and question why it should have to pay to maintain it. But critics contend that the power plant itself is benefiting from taxpayer subsidies and ratepayer-subsidized services — and shouldn't be able to strike deals with private customers that could increase costs for others. FERC's decision will have 'massive repercussions for the entire country' because it will set a precedent for how FERC and grid operators will handle the waiting avalanche of similar requests from data center companies and nuclear plants, said Jackson Morris of the Natural Resources Defense Council. Stacey Burbure, a vice president for American Electric Power, told FERC at a hearing in November that it needs to move quickly. 'The timing of this issue is before us,' she said, 'and if we take our typical five years to get this perfect, it will be too late.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/big-tech-wants-data-centers-plugged-into-power-plants-utilities-balk-/7950310.html	2025-01-25T14:10:17-08:00	
9 South African soldiers killed as conflict in eastern Congo escalates	Nine South African soldiers have been killed in eastern Congo's conflict zone, the South African defense department said Saturday, as Congolese troops and peacekeepers battled to stop an advance by Rwanda-backed rebels on the city of Goma. Democratic Republic of Congo and its allies earlier repelled an overnight advance on the provincial capital of over 1 million people, two army sources said. The sound of nearby heavy bombardment rocked the city in the early hours. The three-year M23 insurgency in Democratic Republic of Congo's mineral-rich east has intensified in January with rebels seizing control of more territory than ever before, prompting the United Nations to warn of the risk of a broader regional war. As of Friday, two days of fierce fighting had killed two Southern Africans deployed with the U.N. peacekeeping mission and seven others in the Southern African regional bloc's force in Congo, the South African National Defense Force said in a statement. 'The members put up a brave fight to prevent the rebels from proceeding to Goma as was their intention,' it said, adding that the M23 rebels had been pushed back. The deaths follow an escalation in hostilities that also led to the killing of North Kivu's military governor on the front line this week. The situation appeared calm in Goma on Saturday with people tentatively going about their business amid a heavy police presence, Reuters reporters there said. The Congolese government and army did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the status of the fighting in the area. The United Nations said Saturday it had started temporarily relocating its non-essential staff from Goma due to the deteriorating security situation in the province. Hundreds of thousands flee Congo, the U.N. and others accuse neighboring Rwanda of fueling the conflict with its own troops and weapons. Rwanda denies this, but the surge in fighting has prompted renewed calls for it to disengage. 'Rwanda must cease its support for the M23 and withdraw,' the European Union said in a statement Saturday. The Rwandan government did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The M23 briefly managed to take over Goma during a previous rebellion in 2012, prompting international donors to cut aid to Rwanda. Even then, the rebels did not hold as much ground as they do now. The insecurity has also deepened eastern provinces' already dire humanitarian situation with 400,000 more people forced to flee their homes this year alone, according to the U.N. refugee agency. 'The situation facing Goma's civilians is becoming increasingly perilous and the humanitarian needs are enormous,' Human Rights Watch said Saturday. The U.N. Security Council is due to meet Monday to discuss the crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-african-soldiers-killed-as-conflict-in-eastern-congo-escalates-/7950302.html	2025-01-25T13:43:45-08:00	
Analysts say China's mistreatment of detained writer, citizen journalist part of crackdown	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Human rights advocates tell VOA that Chinese authorities' mistreatment of detained Chinese Australian writer Yang Hengjun and Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan is part of Beijing's longstanding crackdown on dissent. 'We have known for a long time that the Chinese government ill-treats and tortures people who are in detention,' said Sophie Richardson, co-executive director of U.S.-based Chinese Human Rights Defenders. 'The Chinese government's consistent failure to deny people in detention adequate care and protect them from ill-treatment and torture is the norm. The fact that nobody has ever been held accountable, either domestically or internationally, for these abuses is a significant part of what enables [this trend,]' she told VOA by phone. Yang, a democracy advocate and prominent spy novelist, was tried in a secret trial under espionage charges in 2021 and given a suspended death sentence last February. Zhang, a former lawyer, was released from prison in May 2024 after serving a four-year sentence for reporting on the COVID-19 outbreak in the Chinese city of Wuhan in early 2020. She was arrested again in August 2024 after repeatedly calling for the release of Chinese activist Zhang Pancheng. Yang's family and friends told VOA by phone that the Australian writer, who has been in Chinese detention for six years, has been denied access to food, medical care, and other daily necessities by Chinese authorities since he was transferred from a detention center in June to the Beijing Municipal No. 2 Prison. 'Prison authorities reduced his monthly allowance from 200 yuan [approximately $27.60] to 100 yuan [approximately $13.80] last November, after he could no longer carry out his assigned chores at a factory in prison due to deteriorating eyesight and fatigue caused by a serious flu,' said Feng Chongyi, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Technology Sydney and Yang's former academic adviser. 'He doesn't have enough money to buy food and warm clothes despite his deteriorating health and the sub-zero temperature in Beijing,' Feng told VOA by phone, adding that prison authorities repeatedly have denied Yang's request for medical treatment. Yang said he did not appeal last year's death sentence because of a lack of trust in China's judicial system, and family members urged Chinese authorities to provide 'adequate and supervised medical care' for him. During a monthly consular visit last November, Yang told Australian diplomats that his prison conditions were 'harsh and unbearable,' and he urged Australian authorities to raise concerns about his situation with Chinese authorities. 'The Australian government, including the Australian Ambassador to China Scott Dewar, has repeatedly expressed concerns about Yang's conditions to the Chinese government, but Beijing hasn't responded favorably to issues raised by Canberra,' Feng said, accusing Beijing of 'intentionally torturing' his former student. With no sign of improvement in Yang's condition, the Sydney-based academic urges Australian authorities to prioritize Yang's case and be tougher with their Chinese counterparts. 'The Australian government should prioritize the rights of its citizens when dealing with China, instead of seeking to normalize economic relations with Beijing when its citizens are mistreated in the Chinese prison,' Feng told VOA. Australian authorities repeatedly have raised Yang's case during meetings with their Chinese counterparts. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong called last year's imposition of a suspended death sentence 'appalling.' 'The government advocates for Dr. Yang at every opportunity, at the highest levels, and we will continue to do so,' a spokesperson for Wong told Australian media this week, adding that the efforts include advocating for Yang's access to appropriate medical care. Yang Hengjun holds a doctorate. VOA has contacted the Chinese Foreign Ministry and the Chinese Embassy in Australia for comments but did not receive a response at the time of publication. Hunger strike Meanwhile, Chinese citizen journalist Zhang Zhan, who was rearrested for public order offenses in August, reportedly has kicked off a new round of hunger strikes at a detention center in Shanghai. According to Chinese Human Rights Defenders, prison authorities have force-fed Zhang through a gastric tube to keep her from becoming malnourished, an act that human rights organizations say constitutes 'torture' under international human rights conventions. This marks the second time Zhang has used a hunger strike to protest her detention. During her four-year prison sentence, which ended in May 2024, Zhang staged a monthslong hunger strike that caused her weight to drop to under 40 kilograms at one point. Teng Biao, a Chinese legal scholar and human rights lawyer based in the United States, expressed concern about Zhang's conditions in detention. 'Normally, Chinese dissidents will face harsher treatments when they are detained for the second or third time, so I'm worried about Zhang's situation in detention,' he told VOA by phone. In his view, Chinese authorities' mistreatment of Yang and Zhang reflects the escalating crackdown on dissidents in China. 'By intensifying the punishment against dissidents, the Chinese government is trying to create an authoritarian environment in which no one can criticize or challenge the authorities,' Teng said. VOA has contacted the Chinese Foreign Affairs Ministry and Pudong Detention Center for comments. In a previous response to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said China is 'a country ruled by law and liberty is protected and respected' in the country. Human rights advocate Richardson said that since the detention of dissidents has become a norm in China, democratic countries should consider increasing the price that Beijing must pay for committing human rights violations. 'Democratic governments have to be much more muscular in demanding releases and withholding aspects of the relationship that Beijing wants or finding ways to punish Beijing for refusing to release people, especially when their own citizens' lives are on the line,' she told VOA. Richardson emphasized she thinks democratic nations must regroup and discuss different punitive measures, such as international investigations, to stem systematic and widespread human rights violations in the People's Republic of China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-say-china-s-mistreatment-of-detained-writer-citizen-journalist-part-of-crackdown/7950279.html	2025-01-25T13:24:46-08:00	
US Senate confirms Noem as homeland security secretary	WASHINGTON — The Senate confirmed Kristi Noem as homeland security secretary Saturday, putting the South Dakota governor in charge of a sprawling agency that is essential to national security and President Donald Trump's plans to clamp down on illegal immigration. Republicans kept the Senate working Saturday to install the latest member of Trump's national security team. Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was confirmed in a dramatic tie-breaking vote Friday night, joining Secretary of State Marco Rubio and CIA Director John Ratcliffe. The Senate will next vote Monday evening on Scott Bessent's confirmation as treasury secretary. Noem, a Trump ally who is in her second term as governor, received some support from Democrats on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee when it voted 13-2 to advance her nomination earlier in the week. Republicans, who already hold the votes necessary to confirm her, have also expressed confidence in her determination to lead border security and immigration enforcement. 'Fixing this crisis and restoring respect for the rule of law is one of President Trump and Republicans' top priorities,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune, Republican from South Dakota, said Friday. 'And it's going to require a decisive and committed leader at the Department of Homeland Security. I believe Kristi has everything it takes to undertake this task.' Democrats are split on how to handle border enforcement and immigration under Trump, with some warming to his hard-line stand. Still, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said he would vote against Noem. He pointed to 'bipartisan solutions to fix the mess at our border,' adding that Noem 'seems headed in the wrong direction.' The homeland security secretary oversees U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. Beyond those agencies, the department is also responsible for securing airline transportation, protecting dignitaries, responding to natural disasters and more. Trump is planning major changes to how the department functions, including involving the military in immigration enforcement and reshaping the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Those plans could immediately put Noem in the spotlight after the new president visited recent disaster sites in North Carolina and California on Friday. During her Senate hearing, Noem was repeatedly asked by Democratic senators whether she would administer disaster aid to states even if Trump asked her not to. Noem avoided saying she would defy the president, but she told lawmakers, 'I will deliver the programs according to the law and that it will be done with no political bias.' Six people cycled through as homeland security secretary during Trump's first four years in office. Noem, who held her state's lone U.S. House seat for eight years before becoming governor in 2019, has risen in the GOP by tacking closely with Trump. At one point, she was even considered to be his running mate. Her political stock took a momentary dip, however, when she released a book last year containing an account of her killing her hunting dog, as well as a false claim that she once met with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. If confirmed, she would be tasked with delivering on Trump's favorite issue, border security. The president's goals of deporting millions of people who entered the country illegally could put Noem, with her experience governing a rural state and growing up on a farm, in a difficult position. In South Dakota, many migrants, some in the country without permanent legal status, power the labor-heavy jobs that produce food and housing. She has so far pledged to faithfully execute the president's orders and copied his talk of an 'invasion' at the U.S. border with Mexico. Noem joined other Republican governors who sent National Guard troops to Texas to assist Operation Lone Star, which sought to discourage migrants. Her decision was especially criticized because she accepted a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire to cover some of the deployment cost. Noem said she opted to send National Guard troops 'because of this invasion,' adding that 'it is a war zone down there.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-noem-as-trump-s-homeland-security-secretary-/7950252.html	2025-01-25T12:19:11-08:00	
Trump visits scenes of natural disasters in California, North Carolina		https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-visits-scenes-of-natural-disasters-in-california-north-carolina-/7950249.html	2025-01-25T12:00:44-08:00	
Trump proposes 'getting rid of FEMA' while touring disaster areas	LOS ANGELES — U.S. President Donald Trump surveyed disaster zones in California and North Carolina on Friday and said he was considering 'getting rid of' the Federal Emergency Management Agency, offering the latest sign of how he is weighing sweeping changes to the nation's central organization for responding to disasters. In fire-ravaged California, the state’s Democratic leaders pressed Trump for federal assistance that he’s threatened to hold up, some setting aside their past differences to shower him with praise. Trump, in turn, pressured local officials to waive permitting requirements so people can immediately rebuild, pledging that federal permits would be granted promptly. Instead of having federal financial assistance flow through FEMA, the Republican president said Washington could provide money directly to the states. He made the comments while visiting North Carolina, which is still recovering months after Hurricane Helene, on the first trip of his second term. 'FEMA has been a very big disappointment,' the Republican president said. 'It’s very bureaucratic. And it’s very slow.' Trump was greeted in California by Governor Gavin Newsom, a Trump critic whom the president frequently disparages. The duo chatted amiably and gestured toward cooperation despite their history. 'We’re going to need your support. We’re going to need your help,' Newsom told Trump. 'You were there for us during COVID. I don’t forget that, and I have all the expectations we’ll be able to work together to get a speedy recovery.' Newsom has praised Trump before when looking for help from the federal government. In the early months of the coronavirus pandemic, he called Trump 'thoughtful' and 'collaborative.' Trump flew over several devastated neighborhoods in Marine One, the presidential helicopter, before landing in Pacific Palisades, a hard-hit community that’s home to some of Southern California’s rich and famous. Accompanied by first lady Melania Trump, he walked a street where all the houses have burned, chatting with residents and police officers. It takes seeing the damage firsthand to grasp its enormity, Trump said after. The fires, which continue to burn, could end up being the costliest natural disasters in U.S. history. 'It is devastation. It really is an incineration,' Trump said. Trump’s brief but friendly interaction with Newsom belied the confrontational stance he signaled toward California earlier in the day. Even on the plane en route to Los Angeles, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt was using Trump’s disparaging nickname for the governor, 'Newscum,' and telling reporters, 'He has wronged the people of his state' and saying Trump was visiting to pressure Newsom and other officials 'to do right by their citizens.' Trump said Los Angeles residents who lost their homes should be able to get back onto their properties immediately to clear them, adding several told him it will be months before they can rebuild. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said residents should be able to return home within the week, but keeping people safe from hazardous materials is a top priority. She said the city was easing the process to get permits, but she was repeatedly interrupted by Trump as she tried to explain the city's efforts. He downplayed the concerns about toxins, saying: 'What's hazardous waste? We're going to have to define that.' Trump has a long history of minimizing the risks of asbestos. In his 1997 book, The Art of the Comeback, Trump called asbestos 'the greatest fireproofing material ever used' and '100% safe, once applied,' and claimed the movement against the insulator was led by the mob, 'because it was often mob-related companies that would do the asbestos removal.' Before flying to California, Trump reiterated that he wants to extract concessions from the Democratic-led state in return for disaster assistance, including changes to water policies and requirements that voters need to show identification when casting ballots. Beyond Trump’s criticism of FEMA, he’s suggested limiting the federal government’s role in responding to disasters, echoing comments from conservative allies who have proposed reducing funding and responsibility. 'I’d like to see the states take care of disasters,' he said in North Carolina. 'Let the state take care of the tornadoes and the hurricanes and all of the other things that happen.' Trump said Michael Whatley, a North Carolina native and chair of the Republican National Committee, would help coordinate recovery efforts in the state, where frustrations over the federal response have lingered. Although Whatley does not hold an official government position, Trump said he would be 'very much in charge.' FEMA helps respond to disasters when local leaders request a presidential emergency declaration, a signal that the damage is beyond the state's ability to handle on its own. FEMA can reimburse governments for recovery efforts such as debris removal, and it gives stopgap financial assistance to individual residents. Trump has criticized former President Joe Biden for his administration’s response to Helene in North Carolina. As he left the White House on Friday morning, he told reporters that 'it’s been a horrible thing the way that’s been allowed to fester' since the storm hit in September, and 'we’re going to get it fixed up. In a small town in western North Carolina, residents told Trump about wading through waist-deep water to escape from their homes while fearing for their lives. Some have battled with insurance companies to get their losses covered. 'We’ve come to North Carolina with a simple message,' Trump said. 'You are not forgotten any longer. You were treated very badly by the previous administration.' FEMA has distributed $319 million in financial assistance to residents, but that hasn't alleviated the feeling of abandonment among residents who are struggling to rebuild their lives. Michael A. Coen Jr., who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Biden administration, said Trump was 'misinformed' about an agency that provides critical help to states when they are overwhelmed by catastrophe. In addition, Coen criticized the idea of attaching strings to assistance. 'I think the American people expect the federal government will be there for them on their worst day, no matter where they live,' he said. Trump tapped Cameron Hamilton, a former Navy SEAL with limited experience managing natural disasters, as FEMA’s acting director.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-proposes-getting-rid-of-fema-while-touring-disaster-areas/7950242.html	2025-01-25T10:58:52-08:00	
What South Asian nations expect from Trump	WASHINGTON — As U.S. President Donald Trump’s second term gets underway, the contours of his administration's South Asia policy are taking shape: India stands front and center, while other regional countries such as Bangladesh and Pakistan prepare to be sidelined. 'With the exception of India, which is a large but special case, the other countries in South Asia, I think, are positioning themselves for somewhat less attention from Washington, somewhat less predictability, and somewhat more bilateral engagement operating through multilateral organizations or multilateral channels,' said Joshua White, a former director for South Asian Affairs at the National Security Council who is now a professor at Johns Hopkins SAIS. India While the Biden administration worked closely with India on a range of issues, including defense and technology, Indian officials see Trump’s return to office as an opportunity for expanded cooperation. Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's warm relationship, forged during Trump’s first term, promises a deeper relationship, officials and experts say. In October, Trump called Modi 'a great friend' and 'the nicest human being.' Modi reciprocated in his congratulatory message, calling Trump a 'dear friend' and pledging to work 'closely together once again.' Beyond the rapport the two leaders share, India, South Asia’s largest country, is a strategic U.S. ally and a counterweight to China’s expanding influence in Asia. The U.S. is also India’s second-largest trading partner, after China. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and national security adviser Mike Waltz, both China hawks and staunch India proponents, are expected to push for deeper bilateral engagement with New Delhi. Underlying India’s importance, Rubio had his first bilateral meeting with S. Jaishankar, India’s minister of external affairs. 'There was a very visible appetite to get this relationship moving, to do more, to raise the bar, to set bigger goals,' Jaishankar said. An early focus in the U.S.-India relationship is mass deportation of undocumented Indian immigrants. India has identified 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants for repatriation to India, Bloomberg news reported this week, showing support for a Trump administration priority. There are nearly 800,000 undocumented Indians living in the U.S., including tens of thousands who illegally entered the country under the Biden administration. Jaishankar said India is opposed to illegal migration and open to the return of migrants in the U.S. illegally. Yet challenges remain in the relationship. Visa delays experienced by Indian citizens 'constrain the people-to-people interactions,' he said. Moreover, the Trump administration's pivot to other geopolitical issues, from the war in Ukraine to the relationship with China, could overshadow relations with India, experts say. 'If they have anything significant to be anxious about, apart from the immigration questions, it will be that this administration will not be as attentive to South Asia as the last administration was,' White said. Pakistan Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif used an optimistic tone on Trump’s inauguration day, pledging to work with the new president to strengthen the U.S.-Pakistan relationship. 'Over the years, our two great countries have worked together closely to pursue peace and prosperity in the region and beyond for our peoples & we shall continue to do so in the future. My best wishes to President Trump for a successful second term in office,' Sharif wrote on X Monday. To engage with the new administration, Islamabad dispatched Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi to Washington to meet with members of Trump’s foreign policy team as well as congressional leaders, Dawn, a leading Pakistani newspaper, reported Friday. Yet U.S.-Pakistan ties remain strained. Early in his first term, Trump suspended most security aid to Pakistan, accusing it of harboring terrorism, before gradually resuming cooperation as his administration began to negotiate an agreement with Afghanistan’s Taliban. Complicating the prospects for improved ties between Washington and Islamabad, former Prime Minister Imran Khan remains in prison, with many members of Congress and some Trump advisers calling for his release. Alluding to those calls, a Pakistani foreign office spokesperson cautioned Thursday against interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs, even as he reiterated hopes for expanded bilateral ties. 'This is part of the principles on which interstate relations are shaped,' the spokesperson, Shafqat Ali Khan, said, according to Dawn. Zamir Akram, a former Pakistan ambassador, noted that Washington tends to view Islamabad through its strategic alliance with China and tensions with India. 'So, this is a difficult environment that we’ll face,' Akram said on a podcast hosted by the Islamabad Policy Research Institute. Bangladesh Bangladesh presents another complex case in the Trump administration's South Asia policy formulation. Following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's ouster last August, the interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, received a wide range of support from the Biden administration. That support is now on the chopping block. Yunus, who has been critical of Trump in the past, nonetheless voiced cautious optimism about bilateral cooperation with the new U.S. administration. In his congratulatory message to Trump, Yunus 'expressed firm belief that both nations would work together to explore new avenues of cooperation,' according to the Bangladeshi Foreign Ministry. The country’s two leading parties — the Bangladesh Nationalist Party and the Awami League — urged continued U.S. support for Bangladeshi democracy and development. 'As a democratic country, I expect America and other democratic nations to support and cooperate in favor of democracy,' BNP Secretary General Mirza Fakhrul Islam Alamgir told VOA. 'I believe the United States will assist in fostering democracy and development in our country.' But Mohammad A. Arafat, a member of the Awami League's central executive committee and a former state minister, criticized the Biden administration’s policy and urged a change in course. 'Unlike the Biden administration, which showed unwavering support for individuals like Dr. Yunus despite allegations of corruption, the Trump administration adopts a noninterventionist approach, refraining from interfering in other countries' internal affairs,' Arafat told VOA. VOA’s Bangla Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-south-asian-nations-expect-from-trump/7950216.html	2025-01-25T10:39:20-08:00	
Taliban conditionally agree to allow Afghan girls to study in Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Taliban authorities in Afghanistan reportedly have agreed to allow female students to pursue higher education in Pakistan, provided that their male guardians also are granted visas to accompany them, according to officials privy to the understanding. The revelation comes as hundreds of Afghan students took entrance examinations on Saturday to secure admission to graduate, postgraduate and Ph.D. programs in Pakistani universities. Officials reported that Afghan refugees living in Pakistan attended designated centers in the cities of Peshawar and Quetta to take their exams, while students in Afghanistan are scheduled to participate online over the next few days. Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan's special envoy for Afghanistan, announced in the lead-up to the tests that nearly 21,000 Afghan candidates, including more than 5,000 females, had submitted their applications for the upcoming summer academic sessions. His office reported 'a significant turnout' of Afghan students at the designated test centers on Saturday but did not provide specific numbers. The Higher Education Commission of Pakistan is conducting entrance tests to select up to 2,000 Afghan students, with one-third of the selected candidates being female. Pakistan expressed its 'profound gratitude' to the Kabul government 'for agreeing to allow successful female candidates to pursue their education, provided that their mahrams [chaperones] are granted visas to accompany them,' said a government official in Islamabad, requesting anonymity due to a lack of authorization to discuss the matter publicly with the media. The official stated that visas would be issued to chaperones 'to allow them to accompany female students, as mandated by Afghan law,' to study in Pakistani institutions. The Taliban did not immediately comment on Pakistani assertions that they would let Afghan girls pursue higher education in the neighboring country. Pakistan offers fully funded scholarships to thousands of students from its war-ravaged, poverty-stricken neighbor. The program for female students was halted, however, after the hardline Taliban regained power in 2021 and banned girls’ education past the sixth grade. They also prohibited Afghan women from traveling or flying without a chaperone. The Higher Education Commission website states that the scholarship program is designed to foster stronger ties with Afghanistan by providing high-quality education to Afghan students in diverse fields, including medicine, engineering, agriculture, management and computer science. The entrance examinations for Afghan students come amid bilateral tensions that have escalated lately over allegations that anti-Pakistan armed groups are using Afghan territory to launch cross-border terrorist attacks. The Taliban deny claims of allowing or sheltering foreign militants that threaten neighboring countries. After assuming office last month, Sadiq visited Afghanistan, where he held extensive talks with Taliban leaders on ways to stabilize bilateral political, security and trade cooperation. He described his meetings with de facto Afghan officials as productive but did not elaborate. The envoy, while addressing a gathering of Afghan and Pakistani civil society and trade representatives in Islamabad this week, said the two countries are collaborating closely to reduce tensions and enhance economic ties and trade. In addition, he said they are trying to strengthen people-to-people connections through cooperation in education and other sectors. Since sweeping back to power 3½ years ago, the Taliban have instituted sweeping restrictions on Afghan women, barring most of them from seeking public and private sector employment and requiring they cover their faces in public. The United Nations has labeled the curbs as 'gender apartheid' and persistently demanded their reversal. The Taliban defend their governance as being in line with Islamic law, or Sharia, and Afghan culture, rejecting criticism and calls for reversing their policies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-conditionally-agree-to-allow-afghan-girls-to-study-in-pakistan/7950142.html	2025-01-25T08:23:14-08:00	
How the oldest known Hebrew book landed in a Washington museum	In 2016, Herschel Hepler was browsing Google Images to practice his paleography — the study of historical writing systems — when he stumbled upon an eerily familiar photo that would lead to a groundbreaking discovery. 'I recognized it immediately and said, 'That’s a manuscript in our collection,'' Hepler, a curator at the Museum of the Bible in Washington, recalls. The museum had recently acquired the manuscript — a rare Jewish prayer book — believing it to be part of the famous Cairo Geniza, a trove of ancient Jewish documents uncovered in a Cairo synagogue in the late 19th century. But the black and white picture in Tablet magazine described the manuscript as a '16th to 17th century Hebrew book of Psalms, said to be from the Bamiyan area' of central Afghanistan. Stunned by the revelation, Hepler set out to verify it. Tracking down the author of the Tablet article, British historian and archaeologist Jonathan Lee, Hepler confirmed that Lee had in fact found the book in an Afghan warlord’s possession in 1998 and photographed the cover and two inside pages. 'Without Jonathan’s documentation from his trip to Bamiyan in 1998, we would still be assuming this is probably from the Cairo Geniza,' Hepler said. But if Hepler was surprised to learn about the book's origin in the remote mountains of Afghanistan, Lee was equally stunned when Hepler revealed that the manuscript had been carbon-dated to the 8th century. 'At that point, I realized that the discovery was of major importance,' Lee said via email. Recognizing their combined expertise — Hepler in Hebrew manuscripts and Lee in Afghan history — the duo joined forces and invited in other experts. Their yearslong research not only established the manuscript as the oldest-known Hebrew book but also unearthed evidence that Jews had lived in Afghanistan — and along the ancient Silk Roads — for longer than historians previously believed. But the thrill of discovery was dampened by the realization that the manuscript had probably been smuggled out of war-torn Afghanistan and bought on the antiquities market. At the time, the museum, founded by the Green family, owners of the Hobby Lobby arts and craft company, was still reeling from its acquisition of artifacts smuggled from Iraq and Egypt. The museum faced a significant challenge: Before it could showcase it to the world, it needed to legitimize its ownership of the manuscript. This required years of delicate negotiations with New York’s small Afghan Jewish community and an Afghan government teetering on the brink of collapse. The stakes were high, and the path to secure the manuscript’s rightful place in the museum would prove be too complex and demanding. Lee’s discovery Lee, who has spent the better part of the last five decades researching and writing about Afghan history and archaeology, discovered the book by chance. In April 1998, he was guiding a Japanese TV crew in Bamiyan and was on the lookout for a Bactrian language inscription and gold coins looted from an ancient Buddhist shrine. At the time, the Bamiyan Valley, with its famed Buddha statues still standing, was controlled by a local Shiite insurgent group, while the Taliban ruled most of the rest of the country. The anti-Taliban group’s leader, Karim Khalili, kept a collection of antiquities, among them the cache of gold coins Lee had been looking for. Lee photographed them. 'Then, his [Khalili’s] advisers brought in a miscellaneous collection of other antiquities that included the ALQ,' Lee said, using the acronym for the 'Afghan Liturgical Quire,' the Hebrew book in the Bible Museum’s collection. A local man affiliated with the Shiite insurgent group had found the book under a collapsed roof in a cave the prior year and given it to Khalili. Unversed in Hebrew, Khalili apparently showed the book to other foreigners visiting Bamiyan, trying to figure out what it was. 'I was told it had been found in Bamiyan, but then everything is found in Bamiyan,' Lee said. As Lee recalls, the pocket-size book looked remarkably well-preserved for its age. 'The cover was somewhat bent, damaged and watermarked, but the folios were relatively well-preserved, and most of the texts readable,' he said. To Lee, that suggested the manuscript was 'not that old.' He left Afghanistan and for years didn’t give it much thought. How and when the manuscript left Afghanistan remains unknown. The 1990s were a dark period for Afghanistan’s rich cultural heritage. As armed groups fought over territory, their men — often directed by their commanders and guided by traffickers — plundered the country’s vast archaeological sites and ransacked its museums. Seventy percent of the national museum’s treasures vanished, according to one estimate, many ending up in private collections and some reputable institutions. 'There is a long history of illicit export of antiquities from the country that goes back for decades but ultimately back to colonial times,' said Cecilia Palombo, a University of Chicago professor who has researched the plunder of Afghan antiquities. A leading researcher with extensive experience in Afghanistan said the manuscript was likely taken out of the country after the Taliban overran Bamiyan in late 1998. The researcher spoke on condition of anonymity. Research by the Bible museum found that an unnamed Khalili deputy made multiple sales attempts in the United States and Europe between 1998 and 2001 before 'apparently' offloading it to a private collector in London in fall 2001. The collector kept it for a decade or more before Hobby Lobby bought it in 2013 and donated it to the museum. The office of Khalili, who later served as a vice president, declined a VOA interview request. The Tablet article Although Lee had found the book in Afghanistan, he didn’t know how significant it was. On returning to England, he showed his photographs to a Hebrew specialist, who thought it was from the 16th or 17th century. Then, after a cache of ancient documents dubbed the 'Afghan Geniza' surfaced on the international art market, Lee decided to publish his photograph, along with an article about Afghan Jewish history. Citing the book as an example of 'Jewish material [turning up] occasionally' in Afghanistan, he wrote that the 'whereabouts of this manuscript is now unknown.' He would find out four years later. That's when, 'out of the blue,' Hepler contacted him via LinkedIn and told him the manuscript was not the Book of Psalms but a prayer book, comprising Sabbath prayers, poetry and a partial Haggadah, the Jewish text recited at the Passover seder. The Green family bought the book from an Israeli antiquities dealer in 2013 during a buying spree of ancient artifacts. Some of these items were later returned after it was discovered they had been illegally taken out of Iraq and Egypt. The Afghan Liturgical Quire came with a forged provenance of its own, tracing the manuscript to collectors in London in the 1950s, masking any ties to Afghanistan. With Lee’s documentation, the museum was able to correct its provenance. The museum had initially thought the book was from the 9th century, but a second carbon-dating test performed in 2019 showed it dates to the 8th century, making it two centuries older than the previous oldest-known Hebrew book in the world. The discovery electrified experts. For Hebrew scholars, the discovery offered the earliest evidence of a bound Hebrew book. For Afghanistan specialists, it highlighted 'how significant this region was in respect of the history of the Middle East, Inner Asia and Northern India, and Afghanistan's ancient connectivity with cultures and religious traditions,' Lee said. Yet the realization that it had been smuggled out of Afghanistan cast a cloud over its legitimacy. Afghan laws and the 1970 UNESCO Convention make it illegal to export cultural artifacts and heritage items without government approval. To legitimize its custody of the manuscript, the museum adopted what it calls a 'human rights-based approach' to cultural heritage. Invoking the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the museum argued that the Afghan people and Afghan Jews living in New York have a right to access the manuscript. 'One of the things this project is focused on is on access — so, access to the Afghan Jewish community, access to the people of Afghanistan,' Hepler said. To get the backing of both stakeholders, the museum initiated discussions with officials of the former Afghan government and members of the Jewish community in New York. These efforts culminated in the signing of a memorandum of understanding in 2021 with the Afghan embassy in Washington before the Taliban takeover, ensuring the document would be held in custodianship. The Afghan ambassador at the time, Roya Rahmani, did not respond to a request for an interview. Another former Afghan ambassador wrote a letter of support for the project. Jack Abraham, head of the Afghan Jewish Federation who was born in Afghanistan, said his group offered its full support for keeping the manuscript in the United States. 'I told [Hepler], ‘What you have in your hands is our heritage. It belongs to us. It could be any of our forefathers,’' Abraham said. But some Afghans see it as equally part of their heritage. 'This is the property of Afghanistan and must be returned to Afghanistan,' a senior former government official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Barnett Rubin, a leading Afghanistan scholar and an advisor on the ALQ project, said both communities can legitimately lay claim to the book. 'The museum wanted to have the approval of any one of the two main entities that might have a claim on it to their custody of it,' Rubin said. With a custodianship agreement secured, the museum launched an exhibit in September, celebrating the project as an interfaith collaboration among Jews, Christians and Muslims. A second exhibit is planned for New York starting this month. While the Bible Museum technically owns the manuscript, Hepler said Afghanistan and the Afghan Jewish community 'have a lot of agency in this custodianship.' To that end, the museum plans to provide one high-quality replica to the Jewish community and three to major cultural institutions in Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-the-oldest-known-hebrew-book-landed-in-a-washington-museum/7949998.html	2025-01-25T06:47:15-08:00	
China’s support for Myanmar regime backfires; scam syndicates thrive	WASHINGTON — Reports of Chinese citizens trafficked into scam centers along the Thai-Myanmar border are prompting renewed questions about Beijing’s reliance on Myanmar’s military regime to tackle transnational crime. Analysts warn China’s strategy in Myanmar leaves citizens vulnerable while potentially bolstering criminal networks in the conflict-ridden Southeast Asia country. Recent high-profile abduction cases have sparked outrage among the Chinese public, including the reported luring of Chinese actor Wang Xing to Myawaddy, a Thai-Myanmar border town, by scammers posing as film producers. Chinese embassies in Myanmar and Thailand have warned citizens about high-paying job offers that often lead to forced labor. Thai officials reported that actor Wang Xing was trafficked into a scam syndicate operating in areas controlled by an ally of Myanmar’s military, the Karen Border Guard Force, or BGF. Speaking to local media, Brigadier General Saw Maung Win of the BGF Battalion 3 confirmed that the BGF had handed Chinese actor Wang Xing over to Thai authorities but denied involvement in the trafficking, claiming only to have assisted in the rescue operation. 'These incidents involving Chinese citizens trafficked to Myawaddy are handled cautiously by Chinese authorities,' said Hla Kyaw Zaw, a China-Myanmar analyst. 'But when action is required, China tends to pressure Thailand rather than directly addressing the situation in Myanmar.' Jason Tower of the United States Institute of Peace echoed similar concerns. 'China’s support for the Myanmar military comes at great cost to its own population,' Tower said, referencing a publicly available database with close to 2,000 names of people across China who have gone missing in Myanmar in recent years. Subsequently, Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi urged Southeast Asian nations to take decisive action against online gambling and telecom fraud, emphasizing the need for 'relevant' countries to fulfill their responsibilities without explicitly naming Myanmar. At a meeting with ASEAN envoys on Jan. 16, he highlighted the growing threat these crimes pose, particularly along the Thai-Myanmar border, which has endangered citizens of China and other countries. Chinese and Thai police have jointly arrested 12 suspects connected to trafficking, with investigations ongoing and efforts underway to apprehend more suspects. On Friday, China's Ministry of Public Security said it was 'making every effort' to crack down on the scam compounds and 'rescue trafficked people.' China’s ‘carrot’ approach Tower said that China appears to favor a 'carrot' approach in its dealings with Myanmar’s military. In 2024, the Chinese Ministry of Public Security awarded its highest honor, the Golden Great Wall Commemorative Medal, to Myanmar’s home affairs minister, Lieutenant General Yar Pyae, for joint efforts against transnational crime. However, analysts argue that despite China’s support, Myanmar’s military focuses on territorial battles rather than combating scam operations. According to Tower, Myanmar’s military lacks the capacity and the political will to address these syndicates effectively because the Myanmar military must rely on militia leader Saw Chit Thu to maintain control over Myawaddy, a crucial trade hub. Saw Chit Thu, the leader of the BGF, has been sanctioned by the United States, United Kingdom and European Union for his role in protecting Chinese gangs and scam operations. Scam networks reshuffle China’s aggressive crackdowns on scam networks along its northern border with Myanmar in recent years have pushed many scam operations to relocate to Myawaddy, Karen State, far from Beijing’s immediate oversight. Unlike northern Myanmar, where China has exerted direct pressure, Myawaddy’s geographical distance and political dynamics pose unique challenges to Beijing. Hla Kyaw Zaw said that China has seen some success in cracking down on online scams near its borders, but these efforts are largely localized. The measures have been less effective in other areas, such as Myawaddy, and scams continue to thrive. 'China closely monitors illegal activities in and around Myawaddy but depends on Thailand’s cooperation to address these issues,' Hla Kyaw Zaw said. In response to VOA's inquiries regarding scam operations, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar highlighted recent joint combat efforts by China and Myanmar against online scam operations. According to the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar’s announcement on Tuesday, China will soon launch the second phase of its 'Jingyao Joint Law Enforcement Operation' initiative, a multinational effort with Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam to combat telecom fraud and transnational crime, following a first phase that resulted in over 70,000 arrests regionally and the rescue of 160 victims, mainly from northern Myanmar along the China border. Social media uproar Chinese actor Wang’s abduction sparked outrage on Chinese social media platforms, along with a growing database of families whose relatives have disappeared under similar circumstances. A joint letter from the families of 174 people believed to be trapped in Myanmar went viral on China’s social media platform, Sina Weibo, on Jan. 9. A political and strategic dilemma As scam networks grow more sophisticated, analysts say Beijing faces a challenging balancing act between protecting its citizens and maintaining its strategic interests in Myanmar. Experts such as Tower are urging Beijing to reassess its priorities. 'China’s strategy is failing,' Tower argued. 'The reality is, as you can see, how easily Chinese [civilians] are still trafficked into the Myanmar military Border Guard Force territory,' he said. 'It’s not able to deal with these problems with the military.' However, balancing crackdowns without destabilizing the Myanmar regime presents a challenge. 'China seems to be losing on both fronts,' Tower said. 'This is a really tricky issue. On one hand, China doesn’t want the Myanmar military regime to collapse. And it recognizes that if it goes back to using that stick, it’s going to speed up the collapse of the Myanmar military.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-support-for-myanmar-regime-backfires-scam-syndicates-thrive/7950028.html	2025-01-25T06:04:38-08:00	
Moldovan president visits Kyiv to talk energy, security	KYIV, UKRAINE — Moldovan President Maia Sandu visited Kyiv on Saturday for talks with Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelenskyy amid growing tensions in Transnistria, a pro-Russian separatist enclave of Moldova that neighbors Ukraine. The territory, which has a population of half a million, has seen heating, hot water and electricity cut-offs since the start of the year because a Kyiv-Moscow gas transit contract that had allowed Russian gas to flow there has expired. 'We'll discuss security, energy, infrastructure, trade and mutual support on the EU path,' Sandu wrote on X as she arrived in the Ukrainian capital. There was a demonstration in Transnistria on Friday to call on Moldova to facilitate the transit of Russian gas and end the energy crisis, local media reported. Transnistria used to receive gas from Russia via a pipeline that crossed Ukraine and Moldova. Kyiv has refused to renew the transit contract, which expired on Jan. 1, abruptly ending Russian gas supplies to Transnistria, which has declared a state of emergency. The rest of Moldova has been spared gas cuts thanks to gas and electricity imports from neighboring Romania. With Ukraine's struggle against a Russian invasion nearly in its fourth year, Moldova is afraid the conflict could expand onto its territory in case of Russian attempts to destabilize Transnistria. In an interview with AFP, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean on Wednesday accused Moscow of trying to generate 'instability' in Moldova. He said the crisis could only be resolved if Russian troops stationed in Transnistria since a war against Moldova in 1992 are pulled out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovan-president-visits-kyiv-to-talk-energy-security/7949962.html	2025-01-25T03:30:55-08:00	
UN chief says 7 more workers detained by Houthi rebels in Yemen	SANAA, YEMEN — Yemen's Houthi rebels have detained another seven UN employees, the United Nations chief said on Friday, their latest move to target aid workers. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres called for the 'immediate and unconditional' release of all aid staff held in Yemen, which is suffering one of the world's worst humanitarian crises. 'Their continued arbitrary detention is unacceptable,' Guterres said in a statement, adding that the United Nations was working to secure the release of those being held. The Iran-backed Houthis have detained dozens of staff from U.N. and other humanitarian organizations, most of them since the middle of last year. Guterres said the 'continued targeting of UN personnel and its partners negatively impacts our ability to assist millions of people in need in Yemen.' Reeling from a decade of war, Yemen is mired in a humanitarian catastrophe with more than 18 million people needing assistance and protection, according to the United Nations. Following the latest detentions, the United Nations has suspended 'all official movements into and within' areas held by Houthis, the office of the resident U.N. coordinator for Yemen said. The detentions come after U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the Houthis placed back on the U.S. list of foreign terrorist organizations. Relisting the Houthis will trigger a review of U.N. agencies and other nongovernmental organizations working in Yemen that receive U.S. funding, according to the executive order signed on Wednesday. Mohammed al-Basha of the Basha Report, a U.S.-based risk advisor, called the latest detentions 'an expected reaction' to the 'terrorist' designation. 'They assume that by detaining U.N. staff they're going to be able to pressure the international community to pressure the Trump administration,' he said. No immediate comment was available from the Houthis, who seized the capital, Sanaa, in 2014 and rule large parts of the impoverished country. The rebels, saying they are acting in solidarity with the Palestinians, have been attacking the Red Sea shipping route and firing on Israel since the outbreak of the Gaza war, prompting reprisal strikes from U.S., Israeli and British forces. With a Gaza ceasefire starting last Sunday, the Houthis have made conciliatory moves, including releasing the 25-strong international crew of the Galaxy Leader, a cargo ship they seized in the Red Sea in November 2023. The rebels have also promised to tone down the Red Sea attacks and have said they would stop targeting Israel if it sticks to the ceasefire. The Houthis have been at war with a Saudi-led coalition since 2015, although hostilities have fallen sharply since a U.N.-brokered ceasefire in 2022. Since the start of the war, the Houthis have kidnapped, arbitrarily detained and tortured hundreds of civilians, including U.N. and NGO workers, according to rights groups. In June, the rebels detained 13 U.N. personnel, including six employees of the Human Rights Office, and more than 50 NGO staff plus an embassy staff member. They claimed they had arrested 'an American-Israeli spy network' operating under the cover of humanitarian organizations — allegations emphatically rejected by the U.N. Human Rights Office. Two other U.N. human rights staff had already been detained since November 2021 and August 2023, respectively. In early August, the Houthis stormed the UNHCR office, forced staff to hand over the keys, and seized documents and property, before returning it later that month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-says-7-more-workers-detained-by-houthi-rebels-in-yemen/7949954.html	2025-01-25T03:05:38-08:00	
Drone attack on hospital in Sudan's Darfur kills 30, source says	PORT SUDAN, SUDAN — A drone attack on one of the last functioning hospitals in El-Fasher in Sudan's Darfur region killed 30 people and injured dozens, a medical source said Saturday. The bombing of the Saudi Hospital on Friday evening 'led to the destruction' of the hospital's building where emergency cases were treated, the source told AFP, requesting anonymity for fear of retaliation. It was not immediately clear which of Sudan's warring sides had launched the attack. Since April 2023, the Sudanese army has been at war with the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces, who have seized nearly the entire vast western region of Darfur. They have besieged El-Fasher, the state capital of North Darfur, since May, but have not managed to claim the city, where army-aligned militias have repeatedly pushed them back. According to the medical source, the same building had been hit by an RSF drone 'a few weeks ago.' Attacks on health care have been rampant in El-Fasher, where medical charity Doctors Without Borders said this month the Saudi Hospital was 'the only public hospital with surgical capacity still standing.' Across the country, up to 80% of health care facilities have been forced out of service, according to official figures. The war has so far killed tens of thousands, uprooted more than 12 million and brought millions to the brink of mass starvation. In the area around El-Fasher, famine has already taken hold in three displacement camps -- Zamzam, Abu Shouk and Al-Salam -- and is expected to expand to five more areas including the city itself by May, according to a U.N.-backed assessment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drone-attack-on-hospital-in-sudan-s-darfur-kills-30-source-says/7949955.html	2025-01-25T03:01:39-08:00	
Hamas set to release hostages in next exchange for prisoners held by Israel	Hamas was set Saturday to release four Israeli women held as hostages in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in the second swap under the ceasefire deal in Gaza. The four women are Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag, Hamas said Friday. All four women are Israeli soldiers who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that it had received the list via mediators and that its response would be provided later. The exchange is expected to begin on Saturday afternoon. On Jan. 19, the first day of the ceasefire, Hamas released three Israeli women in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners. In the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, as well as increased humanitarian aid and a withdrawal of the Israeli military from some parts of Gaza. The Israel-Hamas war began with the Hamas attack on Israel in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but has previously said more than half of those killed have been women and children. Israel’s response has also displaced the majority of the territory’s population and destroyed most of the enclave. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Ahead of the Saturday exchange, the United Nations Human Rights Office warned on Friday that increased violence in the occupied West Bank could threaten the ceasefire in Gaza. Since Tuesday, Israeli operations in the West Bank have killed at least 12 Palestinians and injured 40 others, 'most of them reportedly unarmed,' United Nations Human Rights office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said. 'It is very concerning that what’s happening today in the West Bank may have an impact on the ceasefire in Gaza. It is imperative that the cease-fire in Gaza holds,' he said. Hundreds of Jenin residents fled their homes as the Israeli military destroyed several houses on the third day of a major operation in the West Bank city on Thursday. Israeli officials said the Jenin operation was aimed at what the military said were Iranian-backed militant groups in the refugee camp next to the city, which has been a hub for armed Palestinian groups for years. 'We are also concerned by repeated comments from some Israeli officials about plans to expand settlements further still and a fresh breach of international law,' Al-Kheetan said. 'We recall again that the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population into territories it occupies also amounts to a war crime.' Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the center of an independent state, since the 1967 Middle East war. Most countries view the Jewish settlements that Israel has built there as illegal, but Israel cites historical and Biblical ties to the land. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-set-to-release-hostages-in-next-exchange-for-prisoners-held-by-israel/7949930.html	2025-01-25T01:18:24-08:00	
Buoyed by Trump's promises, Uzbeks seek closer ties to US	TASHKENT, UZBEKISTAN/WASHINGTON — Uzbekistan is expected to push to deepen relations with the United States in the coming year, a position that is broadly popular among Uzbeks across the country, VOA found during a recent reporting trip. With more than 37 million people, Uzbekistan, Washington's strategic partner in Central Asia, accounts for more than half of the population of the region, which includes Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, and Turkmenistan. 'I understand that the U.S. prefers dealing with us in the C5+1 format — five republics plus Uncle Sam — but we want more bilateral attention, at least for now,' said Sherbek Artikov, a young Uzbek hoping to study political science in America. Artikov is aware that many of his fellow Uzbeks are often denied U.S. visas and that hundreds of them have been deported since 2019 as undocumented immigrants. Yet, he remains optimistic: 'I believe over time, Washington will see that Uzbeks are not only reliable strategic partners but also hardworking, compassionate people — both as migrants and visitors.' In recent conversations with a VOA reporter traveling across Tashkent, Ferghana, Bukhara, Samarkand, and Surkhandarya, most Uzbeks expressed enthusiasm about U.S. President Donald Trump's return to the White House. They hoped his administration would foster stronger connections with the people of Uzbekistan, not just its government. From journalists and activists to entrepreneurs and educators, they want Trump to fulfill his promises to end the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East. 'We are a peaceful region, despite the continuous turmoil in neighboring Afghanistan, but these conflicts deeply trouble us,' said Zuhra Amonova, an English teacher in Bukhara. Calls for new approach As relations between Washington and Central Asian nations have evolved, there have been some calls by American experts for creating a new diplomatic approach, shifting the U.S. government away from grouping the countries with South Asian nations and instead aligning them more with the Caucasus. Veteran bureaucrats who have worked with these regions at the State Department and the Pentagon told VOA that Washington's view of this part of the world has increasingly been seen through a Russian lens since the U.S. exit from Afghanistan. Ikboljon Qoraboyev, a professor at Maqsut Narikbayev University in Astana, Kazakhstan, says the Central Asia-Caucasus proposal reflects the region's crucial role between China and Russia and the growing significance of the Middle Corridor, a transit route across the Caspian Sea that carries goods westward to European markets. 'Central Asian policymakers may welcome the change, as their previous alignment with South Asia felt misaligned with their identity,' Qoraboyev told VOA. 'But U.S. policymakers must recognize each country's distinct interests, rather than relying solely on regional frameworks.' Like many experts VOA spoke to, he points out that Central Asian governments are eager for closer ties with the U.S., seeking investment, political support, development aid, and expanded educational and technological exchanges. These are among the key factors in the policy recommendations by Eric Rudenshiold, a former White House, Congress, and USAID official, now a senior fellow at the Caspian Policy Center. 'Successful U.S. engagement in the Trans-Caspian region will preserve the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Caucasus and Central Asia,' Rudenshiold said at a forum in Washington ahead of the inauguration. He emphasized that such an approach would benefit the U.S. while creating opportunities in energy development, trade, and connectivity. Rudenshiold believes that promoting American values in this way could spur economic and political reforms in the region and shape democratic institutions. 'The Trans-Caspian region is becoming a vital geopolitical and economic crossroads, important to U.S. interests as it counters Russia's restrictions on the region's gas, oil, and uranium supplies and China's efforts to control next-generation energy,' he wrote in a strategic brief. Washington needs security agreements and closer partnerships in the region, Rudenshiold argued, 'due to shared concerns over renewed terrorist threats and its geostrategic location bordering Russia, China, Afghanistan, and Iran.' Leaders encourage Trump visit In congratulatory messages to Trump, regional leaders have invited him to visit. No U.S. president has ever toured Central Asia and the Caucasus. In a letter to Trump, Uzbekistan President Shavkat Mirziyoyev wrote that his country 'deeply values and appreciates the U.S. policy of consistently supporting the independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity of our nation.' He credited Trump's first term for renewing the strategic partnership, adding: 'We are committed to further developing our long-term cooperation within bilateral and multilateral frameworks.' The Trump administration has yet to outline its priorities both in Central Asia and the Caucasus. Rudenshiold and his center are pressing to appoint a special representative for these regions. Javlon Vakhabov, Uzbekistan's former ambassador to the U.S. and Canada who now heads the International Institute for Central Asia in Tashkent, also advocates for deeper political dialogue. 'In an era of global uncertainty, Central Asia seeks to collectively champion its interests on the international stage and coordinate efforts to address shared challenges,' Vakhabov told VOA. 'A high-level U.S. visit to Uzbekistan would underscore the region's importance.' Vakhabov sees great potential in the Middle Corridor, where secondary routes via Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan could strengthen supply chains and diversify transportation lines. He highlights the Uzbekistan–Afghanistan—Pakistan railway, 'which will reduce delivery times from 35 days to just three and cut shipping costs by two-thirds.' Vakhabov agrees with Rudenshiold that U.S. support for such initiatives would enhance regional stability and attract more American businesses. Touting Uzbekistan's natural resources, he underlines that collaboration on essential minerals and rare earth elements could help the U.S. strengthen 'defense, manufacturing, and technological competitiveness.' Some yearn to learn The U.S. has a long history of cooperation with Central Asian countries on counterterrorism and border security. Vakhabov recommends expanding that cooperation 'since they serve common interests.' The Human Rights Watch 2025 annual report describes Central Asia as a region where autocratic regimes systematically violate freedoms, reforms are stalled or superficial, and security forces hold significant power, undermining the rule of law. Uzbeks interviewed by VOA this winter expressed mixed views on the U.S. role in promoting justice and freedom, but most admired its democratic system. 'We need to grasp how democracy works in practice,' said Dilrabo Zaripova, a small business owner in Samarkand. 'From what we saw in this U.S. presidential election, it requires a strong will and commitment. I don't think we're there yet. But having close ties with America would help us learn from its resilience and complex experience.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/excited-about-trump-s-promises-uzbeks-hopeful-for-closer-engagement/7949771.html	2025-01-24T23:23:21-08:00	
One of last Auschwitz survivors makes telling the stories his mission	HAIFA, ISRAEL — Naftali Furst will never forget his first view of the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, on Nov. 3, 1944. He was 12 years old. SS soldiers threw open the doors of the cattle car, where he was crammed in with his mother, father, brother, and more than 80 others. He remembers the tall chimneys of the crematoria, flames roaring from the top. There were dogs and officers yelling in German 'Get out, get out!' forcing people to jump onto the infamous ramp where Nazi doctor Josef Mengele separated children from parents. Furst, now 92, is one of a dwindling number of Holocaust survivors able to share first-person accounts of the horrors they endured, as the world marks the 80th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazis' most notorious death camp. Furst is returning to Auschwitz for the annual occasion, his fourth trip to the camp. Each time he returns, he thinks of those first moments there. 'We knew we were going to certain death,' he said from his home in Haifa, northern Israel, earlier this month. 'In Slovakia, we knew that people who went to Poland didn't return.' Strokes of luck Furst and his family arrived at the entrance to Auschwitz on Nov. 3, 1944 -– one day after Nazi leader Heinrich Himmler ordered the cessation of the use of the gas chambers ahead of their demolition, as the Soviet troops neared. The order meant that his family wasn't immediately killed. It was one of many small bits of luck and coincidences that allowed Furst to survive. 'For 60 years, I didn't talk about the Holocaust, for 60 years I didn't speak a word of German even though it's my mother tongue,' said Furst. In 2005, he was invited to attend the ceremony to mark the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Buchenwald, where he was liberated on April 11, 1945, after being moved there from Auschwitz. He realized there were fewer and fewer Holocaust survivors who could give first-person accounts, and he decided to throw himself into memorial work. This will be his fourth trip to a ceremony at Auschwitz, having also met Pope Francis there in 2016. Some 6 million European Jews were killed by the Nazis during the Holocaust — the mass murder of Jews and other groups before and during World War II. Soviet Red Army troops liberated Auschwitz-Birkenau on Jan. 27, 1945, and the day has become known as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. An estimated 1.1 million people, mostly Jews, were killed in Auschwitz-Birkenau. Just 220,000 Holocaust survivors are still alive, according to the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany, and more than 20% are over 90. A meeting place after the war Furst, originally from Bratislava, then part of Czechoslovakia, was just 6 when the Nazis first started implementing measures against the country's Jews. He spent ages 9 to 12 in four different concentration camps, including Auschwitz. His parents had planned to jump off of the cattle car on the way to the camp, but people were packed so tightly they couldn't reach the doors. His father instructed the entire family, no matter what, to meet at 11 Sulekova St. in Bratislava after the war. Furst and his brother were separated from their mother. After numbers were tattooed on their arms, they also were taken from their father. They lived in Block 29, without many other children. As the Soviet army closed in on the area, so close they could hear the booms from the tanks, Furst and his brother, Shmuel, were forced to join a dangerous journey toward Buchenwald, marching for three days in the cold and snow. Anyone who lagged behind was shot. 'We had to prove our desire to live, to do another step and another step and keep going,' he said. Many people gave up, longing to end the hunger and thirst and cold, and just sat down, where they were shot by the guards. 'We had this command from my father: 'You must adapt and survive, and even if you're suffering, you must come back,'' Furst recalled. Furst and his brother survived the march, and an open-car train ride in the snow, but they were separated at the next camp. When Furst was liberated from Buchenwald, captured in a famous photo that included Nobel laureate Elie Wiesel in the bunkbeds, he was sure he was alone in the world. But within months, just as Furst's father had instructed, the four family members reunited at the address they memorized, the home of family friends. The rest of their family –- grandparents, aunts, uncles — were all killed. His family later moved to Israel, where he married, had a daughter, four grandchildren and three great-grandchildren, with another on the way. 'We couldn't imagine this tragedy' On Oct. 7, 2023, Furst awoke to the Hamas attack on southern Israel, and immediately thought of his granddaughter, Mika Peleg, and her husband, and their 2-year-old son, who live in Kfar Aza, a kibbutz on the border with Gaza where scores of people were killed or kidnapped. 'It just kept getting worse all day, we couldn't get any information what was happening with them,' said Furst. 'We saw the horrors, that we couldn't imagine this type of horror is happening in 2023, 80 years after the Holocaust.' Toward midnight on Oct. 7, Peleg's neighbors sent word that the family had survived. They spent almost 20 hours locked inside their safe room with no food or ability to communicate. Her husband's parents, who both lived on Kfar Aza, were killed. Despite his close connection, comparisons between Oct. 7 and the Holocaust make Furst uncomfortable. 'It's awful and terrible and a catastrophe, and hard to describe, but it's not a Holocaust,' he said. As awful as the Hamas attack was for his granddaughter and others, the Holocaust was a multi-year 'death industry' with massive infrastructure and camps that could kill 10,000 people a day for months at a time, he said. Furst, who was previously involved in coexistence work between Jews and Arabs, said his heart also goes out to Palestinians in Gaza, although he believes Israel needed to respond militarily. 'I feel the pain of everyone who is suffering, everywhere in the world, because I think I know what suffering is,' he said. Furst knows that he is one of very few Holocaust survivors still able to travel to Auschwitz, so it's important for him to be present there to mark the 80th anniversary. These days, he is telling his story as many times as he can, taking part in documentaries and movies, serving as the president of the Buchenwald Prisoner's Association and working to create a memorial statue at the Sered' concentration camp in Slovakia. He feels a responsibility to be the mouthpiece for the millions who were killed, and people can relate to the story of a single person more than the hard numbers of 6 million deaths, he said. 'Whenever I finish, I tell the youth, the fact that you were able to see living testimony (from a Holocaust survivor) puts a requirement on you more than someone who did not: you take it on your shoulders the obligation to continue to tell this.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-of-last-auschwitz-survivors-makes-telling-the-stories-his-mission/7949857.html	2025-01-24T23:21:32-08:00	
US pressure mounts on Thailand over 48 Uyghur detainees as hunger strike continues	WASHINGTON — The plight of 48 Uyghur detainees in Thailand has drawn international scrutiny as the group’s hunger strike protesting their possible return to China stretches into day 15 with the U.S. State Department, U.N. officials and activists voicing concern. 'By international human rights standards, such a prolonged hunger strike requires authorities to address grievances and ensure the detainees’ well-being,' said Rushan Abbas, executive director of the Campaign for Uyghurs and chairperson of the World Uyghur Congress executive committee. The group of Uyghurs has been held in Bangkok’s Immigration Detention Centre (IDC) since 2014, fleeing alleged persecution in China’s Xinjiang region. After more than a decade of detention there, their future remains precarious amid mounting calls for Thailand to uphold its human rights commitments. US and Thai response A U.S. State Department spokesperson told VOA late Thursday that Washington is 'following this situation closely' and 'deeply concerned by the reports.' The spokesperson told VOA that the United States is engaging with the Royal Thai Government on the matter. 'We continue to urge the Royal Thai Government to respect the principle of non-refoulement and to uphold its respective non-refoulment obligations under international law,' the spokesperson said. 'As Secretary [of State Marco] Rubio indicated during his confirmation hearing, he is prepared to use diplomacy and leverage the longstanding U.S.-Thailand alliance to engage the Royal Thai Government on the reported imminent repatriation of Uyghur detainees to China.' At a press conference on Friday, Thailand’s Foreign Ministry said 'no decision has been made' regarding the Uyghur detainees. 'Any decision on this matter will be based on relevant domestic legal frameworks, human rights principles, especially the principle of non-refoulement, including Thailand’s obligation to refrain from returning people to where they will face torture or enforced disappearance,' said Nikorndej Balankura, the ministry’s director general of information. 'For the time being no decision has been made. I can assure their safety.' Advocates sound alarm Despite assurances from Thai officials, human rights advocates remain skeptical, warning of the severe consequences if the Uyghur detainees are repatriated to China. The 48 men, arrested in 2014 alongside over 300 other Uyghurs attempting to cross into Malaysia via human trafficking routes from China’s Yunnan province, have been detained in Thailand for more than a decade. In 2015, 109 of the Uyghurs were forcibly deported to China, sparking international outrage, with their fates still unknown. Meanwhile, 173 women and children were resettled in Turkey, and five detainees, including two children, have died since 2014. Abbas expressed alarm over the uncertain future of the Uyghur detainees, drawing a parallel to the 'devastating precedent' set in 2015. 'These 48 men could face the same dark fate as those deported nearly a decade ago. The Thai government must not repeat the mistakes of 2015,' Abbas said. 'At that time, despite making similar assurances as today’s, Thai authorities sent 109 Uyghur men to China. They likely disappeared into the black hole of a regime infamous for torture and genocide.' Abbas also cited concerns that the deportations could occur imminently, possibly before the Thai prime minister’s scheduled visit to China on Feb. 4. 'It seems they are trying to gain leverage from China by acting before the visit,' she told VOA in a phone interview. The stakes in 2025, Abbas emphasized, are even higher than in 2015. 'If Thailand chooses to deport these Uyghurs despite the U.S. genocide determination and the U.N. finding of crimes against humanity, it would be a grave violation of international law and an affront to the principles of human rights,' she said. 'Thailand should prepare for a tsunami of condemnation and face severe economic and political consequences.' In 2021, the U.S. formally designated China’s treatment of the Uyghurs as genocide, and in a 2022 report, the U.N. human rights office stated that China’s actions in Xinjiang may amount to crimes against humanity, including torture, forced labor, and forced sterilization. China’s response China has repeatedly denied the U.N. and U.S. determinations of genocide, asserting that its actions in Xinjiang are aimed at combating separatism, extremism and terrorism – what Beijing refers to as the 'three evils.' The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok weighed in last Wednesday, alleging the Uyghur detainees had terrorist affiliations. 'A small number of individuals, enticed by external forces, fled abroad and even joined the 'East Turkestan Islamic Movement' [ETIM], a terrorist organization recognized by the United Nations, becoming terrorists themselves,' the embassy stated on its website. However, the narrative surrounding ETIM has evolved. While the group was designated a terrorist organization by the U.N. in 2002, the U.S. delisted it in 2020. A report by the Congressional Research Service at the time cited a lack of 'clear and convincing evidence of ETIM's existence.' Health deterioration According to U.N. experts, the detainees’ health is rapidly deteriorating. In a statement earlier this week, they said 23 of the 48 suffer from serious health conditions including diabetes, kidney disfunction, lower body paralysis, skin diseases, gastrointestinal illnesses, and heart and lung conditions. 'It is essential they be provided with the necessary and appropriate medical care,' the report said. U.S. Representative Gregory Meeks, ranking member of the U.S. House Foreign Affairs Committee, issued a statement on Wednesday condemning any potential deportation. 'If these Uyghurs are deported back to the PRC, Thailand would be violating the customary practice of nonrefoulement and its commitments as State Party to the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment,' he said, using the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. Meeks called on the Thai government to guarantee the detainees' protection, provide them with access to asylum procedures, and ensure they receive the medical care they need.

App provides immediate fire information to Los Angeles residents	OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA — From his home in northern California, Nick Russell, a former farm manager, is monitoring the Los Angeles-area fires. He knows that about 600 kilometers south, people in Los Angeles are relying on his team’s live neighborhood-by-neighborhood updates on fire outbreaks, smoke direction, surface wind predictions and evacuation routes. Russell is vice president of operations at Watch Duty, a free app that tracks fires and other natural disasters. It relies on a variety of data sources such as cameras and sensors throughout the state, government agencies, first responders, a core of volunteers, and its own team of reporters. An emergency at his house, for example, would be 'much different' from one at his neighbor's house .4 kilometers away, Russell said. 'That is true for communities everywhere, and that’s where technology really comes in.' Watch Duty's delivery of detailed localized information is one reason for its success with its 7 million users, many of whom downloaded the app in recent weeks. It acts as a virtual emergency operations center, culling and verifying data points. Watch Duty’s success points to the promise that technologies such as artificial intelligence and sensors will give residents and first responders the real-time information they need to survive and fight natural disasters. Google and other firms have invested in technology to track fires. Several startup firms are also looking for ways to use AI, sensors and other technologies in natural disasters. Utility firms work with Gridware, a company that places AI-enhanced sensors on power lines to detect a tree branch touching the line or any other vibrations that could indicate a problem. Among Watch Duty’s technology partners is ALERTCalifornia, run by the University of San Diego, which has a network of more than 1,000 AI-enhanced cameras throughout the state looking for smoke. The cameras often detect fires before people call emergency lines, Russell said. Together with ALERTCalifornia’s information, Russell said, 'we have become the eyes and ears' of fires. Another Watch Duty partner is N-5 Sensors, a Maryland-based firm. Its sensors, which are placed in the ground, detect smoke, heat and other signs of fire. 'They're like a nose, if you will, so they detect smoke anomalies and different chemical patterns in the air,' Russell said. Watch Duty is available in 22 states, mostly in the western U.S., and plans to expand to all states. While fire has been its focus, Watch Duty also plans to track other natural disasters such as tornadoes, hurricanes, earthquakes and tsunamis, Russell said. 'Fire is not in the name,' he said. 'We want to be that one-stop shop where people can go in those times of duress, to have a source that makes it clear and concise what’s happening.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/app-provides-immediate-fire-information-to-los-angeles-residents/7949884.html	2025-01-24T20:34:28-08:00	
Trump says US government is behind California during visit to fire-stricken state	U.S. President Donald Trump said the federal government is standing behind California 100% in the aftermath of devastating wildfires and said during a visit to the state on Friday that he would come back as much as needed. 'The first lady and I are in California to express a great love for the people of California,' Trump told a gathering of local leaders at a fire station in Los Angeles’ Pacific Palisades neighborhood. The neighborhood was one of the worst hit by the recent fires, with rows of homes left in ashes. Trump participated in a walking tour of the area earlier in the day and also surveyed recovery efforts from a helicopter as firefighters in the Los Angeles area continued to confront multiple blazes amid high winds and dry conditions. 'I don’t think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating it is, until you see it,' Trump said after the tour. The Palisades Fire is about 77% contained and has burned through nearly 9,500 hectares of land, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Trump has criticized California leaders for water policies that he says have exacerbated the recent wildfires. He said before traveling to California that he would 'take a look at a fire that could have been put out if they let the water flow, but they didn’t let the water flow.' California Governor Gavin Newsom has rejected the president’s assertion, and other state legislators have said the fierce wildfires placed extreme demand on a municipal system not designed to battle such blazes. Newsom greeted Trump as he arrived on the tarmac in Los Angeles on Friday. The two were cordial and shook hands. 'I have all the expectations we’re going to be able to work together,' Newsom said. Trump responded: 'We’re going to get it fixed.' During the gathering with community leaders, Trump said that Los Angeles residents who lost homes should be allowed back onto their properties immediately, challenging Mayor Karen Bass to speed up the cleanup process. 'People are willing to get a dumpster and do it themselves and clean it up. There is not that much left, it is all incinerated,' Trump said. Bass said, 'the most important thing is for people to be safe,' but promised residents should be able to return home within the week. Trump promised that federal permits to rebuild would be granted promptly and urged local officials to do the same. Before visiting California, Trump first visited North Carolina, where he was briefed on monthslong recovery efforts of the damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Speaking to reporters at Asheville Regional Airport, Trump said FEMA 'has been a very big disappointment' and said he is considering 'getting rid' of the agency. FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency that has been responding to disasters in both California and North Carolina. 'It’s very bureaucratic. And it’s very slow,' Trump said of the agency. Trump continued to express dissatisfaction with FEMA while in California, calling it a 'big disappointment.' Trump, a Republican, has broached using federal disaster assistance as a bargaining chip during unrelated legislative negotiations over government borrowing, or as leverage to push California to alter its water policies. 'Playing politics with people’s livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the southern California wildfire victims and to our brave first responders,' Representative Young Kim, a Republican from Orange County, south of Los Angeles, said in a recent statement. Trump has also suggested putting more responsibility on individual states to respond to disasters. 'I’d rather see the states take care of their own problems,' he said in a Wednesday interview with Fox News. 'FEMA is getting in the way of everything.' Michael A. Coen Jr., who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Biden administration, said Trump has been 'misinformed' about the agency, and he took exception to what he characterized as Trump’s inclination to play politics with disaster relief. Ahead of Trump’s visit to southern California, firefighters continued to fight multiple fires in the Los Angeles region. The second-largest fire, known as the Eaton Fire, is now 95% contained after burning through more than 5,600 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The Hughes Fire in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles near Castaic Lake started Wednesday, prompting evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people. Health advisories for smoke and windblown dust and ash have been issued for surrounding areas. 'Smoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy,' Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County’s health officer, said in a statement. Firefighters received help fighting the Hughes Fire overnight with aerial water drops from helicopters. The fire is now 56% contained and has burned more than 4,200 hectares of land, according to the Cal Fire. The Laguna Fire in Ventura County initially prompted evacuation orders for California State University Channel Islands and University Glen, but the orders were downgraded to warnings Thursday afternoon. That fire is 70% contained after charring nearly 40 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The U.S. Storm Prediction Center said high winds, low humidity and dry conditions continued to cause 'elevated' fire weather conditions on Friday. There is a chance for some relief in the coming days. The National Weather Service said rain is expected in the area beginning Saturday. Forecasters expect up to a centimeter of rain across much of the Los Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even more rain in limited locations. The potential for those storms has prompted concerns about the possibility of mudslides, with debris flowing down hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of wildfires. The fires that broke out in southern California on Jan. 7 have killed at least 28 people and destroyed an estimated 16,000 buildings. The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-us-government-is-behind-california-during-visit-to-fire-stricken-state/7949879.html	2025-01-24T19:57:49-08:00	
Russian deepfake videos target Ukrainian refugees, including teen	New online videos recently investigated by VOA's Russian and Ukrainian services show how artificial intelligence is likely being used to try to create provocative deepfakes that target Ukrainian refugees. In one example, a video appears to be a TV news report about a teenage Ukrainian refugee and her experience studying at a private school in the United States. But the video then flips to footage of crowded school corridors and packets of crack cocaine, while a voiceover that sounds like the girl calls American public schools dangerous and invokes offensive stereotypes about African Americans. 'I realize it's quite expensive [at private school],' she says. 'But it wouldn't be fair if my family was made to pay for my safety. Let Americans do it.' Those statements are total fabrications. Only the first section — footage of the teenager — is real. The offensive voiceover was likely created using artificial intelligence (AI) to realistically copy her voice, resulting in something known as a deepfake. And it appears to be part of the online Russian information operation called Matryoshka —‚ named for the Russian nesting doll — that is now targeting Ukrainian refugees. VOA found that the campaign pushed two deepfake videos that aimed to make Ukrainian refugees look greedy and ungrateful, while also spreading deepfakes that appeared to show authoritative Western journalists claiming that Ukraine — and not Russia — was the country spreading falsehoods. The videos reflect the most recent strategy among Russia's online disinformation campaign, according to Antibot4Navalny, an X account that researches Russian information operations and has been widely cited by leading Western news outlets. Russia's willingness to target refugees, including a teenager, shows just how far the Kremlin, which regularly denies having a role in disinformation, is prepared to go in attempting to undermine Western support for Ukraine. Targeting the victims A second video targeting Ukrainian refugees begins with real footage from a news report in which a Ukrainian woman expresses gratitude for clothing donations and support that Denmark has provided to refugees. The video then switches to generic footage and a probable deepfake as the woman's voice begins to complain that Ukrainian refugees are forced to live in small apartments and wear used clothing. VOA is not sharing either video to protect the identities of the refugees depicted in the deepfakes, but both used stolen footage from reputable international media outlets. That technique — altering the individual's statements while replicating their voice — is new for Matryoshka, Antibot4Navalny told VOA. 'In the last few weeks, almost all the clips have been built according to this scheme,' the research group wrote. But experts say the underlying strategy of spoofing real media reports and targeting refugees is nothing new. After Russia's deadly April 2022 missile strike on Ukraine's Kramatorsk railway station, for example, the Kremlin created a phony BBC news report blaming Ukrainians for the strike, according to Roman Osadchuk, a resident fellow at the Atlantic Council's Digital Forensic Research Lab. During that same period, he noted, Russia also spread disinformation in Moldova aimed at turning the local population against Ukrainian refugees. 'Unfortunately, refugees are a very popular target for Russian disinformation campaigns, not only for attacks on the host community ... but also in Ukraine,' Osadchuk told VOA. When such disinformation operations are geared toward a Ukrainian audience, he added, the goal is often to create a clash between those who left Ukraine and those who stayed behind. Deepfakes of journalists, however, appear designed to influence public opinion in a different way. One video that purports to contain audio of Bellingcat founder Eliot Higgins, for example, claims that Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region is just a bluff. 'The whole world is watching Ukraine's death spasms,' Higgins appears to say. 'There's nothing further to discuss.' In another video, Shayan Sardarizadeh, a senior journalist at BBC Verify, appears to say that 'Ukraine creates fakes so that fact-checking organizations blame Russia,' something he then describes as part of a 'global hoax.' In fact, both videos appear to be deepfakes created according to the same formula as the ones targeting refugees. Higgins tells VOA that the entirety of the audio impersonation of his own voice appears to be a deepfake. He suggests the goal of the video was to engage factcheckers and get them to accidentally boost its viewership. 'I think it's more about boosting their stats so [the disinformation actors] can keep milking the Russian state for money to keep doing it,' he told VOA by email. Sardarizadeh did not respond to a request for comment in time for publication. Fake video, real harm The rapid expansion of AI over the past few years has drawn increased attention to the problem of deepfake videos and AI images, particularly when these technologies are used to create non-consensual, sexually explicit imagery. Researchers have estimated that over 90% of deepfakes online are sexually explicit. They have been used both against ordinary women and girls and celebrities. Deepfakes also have been used to target politicians and candidates for public office. It remains unclear, however, whether they have actually influenced public opinion or election outcomes. Researchers from Microsoft's Theat Analysis Center have found that 'fully synthetic' videos of world leaders are often not convincing and are easily debunked. But they also concluded that deepfake audio is often more effective. The four videos pushed by Matryoshka — which primarily uses deepfake audio — show that the danger of deepfakes isn't restricted to explicit images or impersonations of politicians. And if your image is available online, there isn't much you can do to fully protect yourself. Today, there's always a risk in 'sharing any information publicly, including your voice, appearance, or pictures,' Osadchuk said. The damage to individuals can be serious. Belle Torek, an attorney who specializes in tech policy and civil rights, said that people whose likenesses are used without consent often experience feelings of violation, humiliation, helplessness and fear. 'They tend to report feeling that their trust has been violated. Knowing that their image is being manipulated to spread lies or hate can exacerbate existing trauma,' she said. 'And in this case here, I think that those effects are going to be amplified for these [refugee] communities, who are already enduring displacement and violence.' How effective are deepfakes? While it is not difficult to understand the potential harm of deepfakes, it is more challenging to assess their broader reach and impact. An X post featur phony videos of refugees received over 55,000 views. That represents significant spread, according to Olga Tokariuk, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue. 'It is not yet viral content, but it is no longer marginal content,' she said. Antibot4Navalny, on the other hand, believes that Russian disinformation actors are largely amplifying the X posts using other controlled accounts and very few real people are seeing them. But even if large numbers of real people did view the deepfakes, that doesn't necessarily mean the videos achieved the Kremlin's goals. 'It is always difficult ... to prove with 100% correlation the impact of these disinformation campaigns on politics,' Tokariuk said.

US Senate approves Hegseth as defense secretary by 51-50 vote	The U.S. Senate has approved Pete Hegseth, President Donald Trump’s nominee to serve as defense secretary, on a mostly party-line 51-50 vote. Vice President J.D. Vance broke the 50-50 tie in the 100-member Senate, casting the deciding vote. It is only the second time in U.S. history that a vice president, who is president of the Senate, would have to break a tie for a nominee. The vote late Friday followed days of Senate debate over Hegseth’s fitness for the top civilian role in the U.S. military, managing the nation’s armed forces. In his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Hegseth told lawmakers he would bring back accountability to the nation’s military. He received support from Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Senator Roger Wicker, who said, 'Pete Hegseth has the determination and the tools to achieve real change. He will inject a new warrior ethos into the Pentagon, a spirit that can cascade from the top down.' But Hegseth faced criticism from Senate Democrats over his statements about women and transgender people serving in the military, as well as allegations of sexual assault, drunkenness and financial mismanagement of two nonprofits serving U.S. veterans that he led. Earlier this week, senators received an affidavit from Danielle Hegseth, Hegseth's former sister-in-law, alleging he was abusive towards his second ex-wife, Samantha Hegseth. She did not describe the abuse and said she did not witness it. In a statement to NBC News, which first reported the story, Samantha Hegseth said, 'There was no physical abuse in my marriage.' Senator Jack Reed, the top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said Thursday he was not satisfied with Hegseth’s answers to his questions about reports that the Trump administration would implement a board to screen senior military officers for their fitness to lead. 'We've seen it happen in other places around the world, where militaries are undermined and subjected by political leaders that have a particular political point of view and passion, and they become essentially not an army but an extension of the political aspirations of the Great Leader. We can't see that here in America,' Reed said. Hegseth, a former television host at the conservative Fox News Channel, also served as an officer in the Army National Guard in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay and is the author of several books. 'I don't have a similar biography to defense secretaries of the last 30 years,' Hegseth told senators in his opening statement, 'But as President Trump also told me, we've repeatedly placed people atop the Pentagon with the supposed right of credentials, whether they are retired generals, academics or defense contractor executives. And where has it gotten us?' Republican senators praised Hegseth for his fresh perspective. 'Mr. Hegseth will bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the bureaucracy. He will focus relentlessly on the war fighter and the military's core missions, deterring wars and winning the ones we must fight,' Wicker said during the confirmation hearings. Hegseth said his priorities if confirmed as secretary of defense would focus on the threat posed by China and defense of the homeland, while reorienting the U.S. away from entanglements in the Middle East. He also pledged to restore morale and end diversity initiatives that he sees as harmful to establishing a merit-based military. Asked how he sees his potential role, Hegseth replied, 'Getting anything that doesn't contribute to our democracy out of how decisions are made inside the Pentagon. What gender you are. What race you are. Your views on climate change. Your conscience and your faith should have no bearing on whether you get promoted or whether you're selected to go to West Point or where you go to school. Only thing that should matter is, ‘How capable are you at your job? How excellent are you at your job?’' Hegseth is the first secretary of defense to have served as a junior officer on the front lines, and the first secretary from the generation that fought in post-9/11 wars. Senate Democrats said Hegseth’s experience running two nonprofits benefiting military veterans, with fewer than 100 employees, was not sufficient experience to run the massive U.S. Department of Defense. 'We're hiring you to be the CEO of one of the most complex, largest organizations in the world. We're the board of directors here. I don't know of any corporate board of directors that would hire a CEO, that said, you know, ‘I supervised 100 people before,’' Democratic Senator Gary Peters. The Defense Department oversees more than 3 million service members and a budget of $857 billion. Hegseth also faced allegations of sexual assault and public drunkenness during his time at Fox News. Reed said the FBI background investigation into Hegseth was insufficient. 'You lack the character and composure and competence to hold the positions of defense,' Reed said, noting he has voted for all nine previous nominees for secretary of defense, including nominees during Trump’s first term. All Cabinet nominees undergo a background check and an ethics review. Hegseth faced allegations of financial mismanagement of the two nonprofits where he served as executive director — Vets for Freedom, and Concerned Vets for America. After a 2009 audit of Vets for Freedom, Hegseth admitted the organization was half a million dollars in debt, and he was demoted. During his time at Concerned Vets for America, Hegseth faced whistleblower allegations of personal misconduct and financial mismanagement. Hegseth said the allegations were part of a coordinated smear campaign by left-wing media and largely came from anonymous sources. 'We undertook this responsibility with obligation to the troops to do right by them, for our war fighters. And what became very evident to us from the beginning, there was a coordinated smear campaign orchestrated in the media against us that was clear from moment one. And that it wasn't about me. Most of it was about President Donald Trump, who's had to endure the very same thing for much longer amounts of time, and he endured it — to his credit — in incredibly strong ways,' Hegseth said during his confirmation. Hegseth has also faced criticism for past remarks about diversity in the U.S. military. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren said Hegseth had done 'a very big about-face in a short period of time' due to Trump’s nomination of him as secretary of defense. Warren said last week, 'For 12 years, you were quite open about your views — and your views were consistently the same: Women are inferior soldiers, sailors, Marines, airmen and Guardians. Then on November 9, 2024, just 32 days after your last public comments saying that women absolutely should not be in combat, you declare that ‘Some of our greatest warriors are women.’' Five women who served in combat wrote letters of support of Hegseth’s nomination. Hegseth pledged that women would have access to ground combat roles during his tenure as secretary of defense. 'Given the standards remain high, and we'll have a review to ensure standards have not been eroded in any one of these cases,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-approves-hegseth-as-defense-secretary-by-51-50-vote/7949878.html	2025-01-24T19:30:42-08:00	
Driver rams anti-government rally in Serbia's capital, hurts protester	BELGRADE, SERBIA — A woman rammed a car into a crowd of anti-government protesters in Serbia's capital and injured one of them Friday, police said, as a student-led strike shut down businesses and drew tens of thousands of people to demonstrations around the country. The nationwide protests took place on the same day that President Aleksandar Vucic held a big afternoon rally with thousands of supporters in the central town of Jagodina, his coalition stronghold, to counter the persistent anti-government protests that have challenged his tight grip on power for nearly three months. Vucic told his supporters that the country has been 'attacked both from outside and inside' by the anti-government protests. 'It is not accidental that that they have attacked Serbia from abroad,' Vucic said, pointing out Serbia's friendly relations with Russia and China, and a refusal to impose sanctions on Moscow because of the war in Ukraine. 'That is what they want to crush, but we must not allow it. That is our strength,' he told the cheering crowd. Call for talks Vucic also called for a dialogue with the striking students, who have received widespread support from all walks of life in Serbia, at the same time weakening popular support for his party. The students have rejected negotiations on their demands with Vucic. The protesters have blocked traffic daily in Serbia to protest the deaths of 15 people killed in the November collapse of a train station canopy that critics have blamed on government corruption. The government denies blame for the deaths. Police in Belgrade said that they detained the 24-year-old driver who rammed into a crowd of protesters in a section of the city called New Belgrade. The injured victim, a 26-year-old woman, was hospitalized; her condition was described as stable. A similar incident took place during a blockade last week in Belgrade, when a car rammed into protesting students, seriously injuring a young woman. Many in Serbia believe the huge concrete canopy at a train station in the northern city of Novi Sad fell down because of sloppy reconstruction work that resulted from corruption. Weekslong protests demanding accountability for the crash have been the biggest since Vucic came to power more than a decade ago. He has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms despite formally seeking European Union membership for Serbia. It wasn't immediately possible to determine how many people and companies joined the students' call for a one-day general strike on Friday. They included restaurants, bars, theaters, bakeries, shops and bookstores. 'Let's take freedom in our hands,' students told the citizens in their strike call. At his rally in Jagodina, Vucic announced the formation in March of a nationwide political movement in the style of Russian President Vladimir Putin's United Russia movement to help ensure the dominance of his right-wing Serbian Progressive Party. 'You are all welcome to the movement of big change and future,' Vucic said. He said that the movement will include people who aren't members of any political party. 'We need new energy,' Vucic said. Foreign influence alleged The president and the country's mainstream media have accused the students of working under orders from foreign intelligence services to overthrow the authorities while pro-government thugs have repeatedly attacked protesting citizens. The 15-minute traffic blockades on Friday started at 11:52 a.m., the exact time of the canopy collapse in Novi Sad. Serbian universities have been blockaded for two months, along with many schools. A lawyers association also has gone on strike, but it remained unclear how many people stayed away from work in the state-run institutions on Friday. Protest marches were held Friday in Belgrade, Novi Sad, the southern city of Nis and other smaller cities — even in Jagodina before Vucic's arrival. 'Things can't stay the same anymore,' actor Goran Susljik told N1 regional television. 'Students have offered us the possibility of change.' Serbia's prosecutors have filed charges against 13 people for the canopy collapse, including a government minister and several state officials. But the former construction minister, Goran Vesic, has been released from detention, fueling doubts about the investigation's independence. The main railway station in Novi Sad was renovated twice in recent years as part of a wider infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/driver-rams-anti-government-rally-in-serbia-s-capital-hurts-protester-/7949871.html	2025-01-24T19:14:24-08:00	
Trump visits fire-stricken California, vows 'to get it fixed'	U.S. President Donald Trump toured parts of California damaged by wildfire as firefighters in the Los Angeles area continued to confront multiple blazes amid high winds and dry conditions. Trump surveyed recovery efforts from a helicopter on Friday, including flying over the Pacific Palisades neighborhood where a fire left rows of homes in ashes. The Palisades Fire is about 77% contained and has burned through nearly 9,500 hectares of land, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. Trump has criticized California leaders for water policies that he says have exacerbated the recent wildfires. He said before traveling to California that he would 'take a look at a fire that could have been put out if they let the water flow, but they didn't let the water flow.' California Governor Gavin Newsom has rejected the president's assertion, and other state legislators have blamed the fierce wildfires for placing extreme demand on a municipal system not designed to battle such blazes. Newsom greeted Trump as he arrived on the tarmac in Los Angeles on Friday. The two were cordial and shook hands. 'I have all the expectations we're going to be able to work together,' Newsom said. Trump responded: 'We're going to get it fixed.' Trump calls FEMA 'big disappointment' Before visiting California, Trump first visited North Carolina, where he was briefed on monthslong recovery efforts for the damage caused by Hurricane Helene. Speaking to reporters at Asheville Regional Airport, Trump said FEMA 'has been a very big disappointment' and said he is considering 'getting rid' of the agency. FEMA is the Federal Emergency Management Agency that has been responding to disasters in both California and North Carolina. 'It's very bureaucratic. And it's very slow. Other than that, we're very happy with them,' Trump said of the agency. Trump, a Republican, has broached using federal disaster assistance as a bargaining chip during unrelated legislative negotiations over government borrowing, or as leverage to push California to alter its water policies. 'Playing politics with people's livelihoods is unacceptable and a slap in the face to the Southern California wildfire victims and to our brave first responders,' Representative Young Kim, a Republican from Orange County, south of Los Angeles, said in a recent statement. Trump has also suggested putting more responsibility on individual states to respond to disasters. 'I'd rather see the states take care of their own problems,' he said in a Wednesday interview with Fox News. 'FEMA is getting in the way of everything.' Michael A. Coen, Jr., who served as chief of staff at FEMA during the Biden administration, said Trump has been 'misinformed' about the agency, and he took exception with what he characterized as Trump's inclination to play politics with disaster relief. 50,000 told to evacuate Ahead of Trump's visit to southern California, firefighters continued to fight multiple fires in the Los Angeles region. The second-largest fire, known as the Eaton Fire, is now 95% contained after burning through more than 5,600 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The Hughes Fire in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles near Castaic Lake started Wednesday, prompting evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people. Health advisories for smoke and windblown dust and ash have been issued for surrounding areas. 'Smoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy,' Dr. Muntu Davis, Los Angeles County's health officer, said in a statement. Firefighters received help fighting the Hughes Fire overnight with aerial water drops from helicopters. The fire is now 56% contained and has burned more than 4,200 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The Laguna Fire in Ventura County initially prompted evacuation orders for California State University Channel Islands and University Glen, but the orders were downgraded to warnings Thursday afternoon. That fire is 70% contained after charring nearly 40 hectares of land, according to Cal Fire. The U.S. Storm Prediction Center said high winds, low humidity and dry conditions continued to cause 'elevated' fire weather conditions on Friday. Saturday forecast includes rain There is a chance for some relief in the coming days. The National Weather Service said rain is expected in the area beginning Saturday. Forecasters expect up to a centimeter of rain across much of the Los Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even more rain in limited locations. The potential for those storms has prompted concerns about the possibility of mudslides, with debris flowing down hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of wildfires. The fires that broke out in Southern California on January 7 have killed at least 28 people and destroyed an estimated 16,000 buildings. The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes.

Afghan refugees in Pakistan worry as US suspends resettlement program	WASHINGTON — The Sultani family was nearing the final stages of their case to resettle in the U.S., though their plan was disrupted after President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Jan. 20 suspending the relocation of refugees to the U.S. 'My family and I couldn’t sleep at night' since the executive order was signed, said 50-year-old Ahmad Zahir Sultani, who fled to Pakistan alongside his wife and four children a few months after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in August 2021. 'We are very worried ... as we face an uncertain future,' said Sultani, who worked with U.S.-run projects in Afghanistan before the U.S. pulled out of the country in 2021. Just hours after his swearing-in as the 47th President of the U.S., Trump signed the executive order suspending the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program beginning Jan. 27. The Sultani family was identified as a Priority 1 case for resettlement under that program. 'This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligned with the interest of the United States,' stated the order. The order calls on the secretary of the Homeland Security Department, in consultation with the secretary of state, to report to the president within 90 days if the program 'would be in the interests of the United States.' The order added that every 90 days, a report would be submitted to the president until he 'determine[s] that resumption of the USRAP is in the interests of the United States.' Sultani and other Afghan refugees who have been waiting in Pakistan for resettlement in the U.S. told VOA that staying in Pakistan would be 'very difficult' for them as the crackdown on Afghan refugees continues in Islamabad, where the Sultanis currently reside. 'We are facing harassment and arrests by the police [in Pakistan]. And we can’t go back to Afghanistan as we fled because of the threats there,' Sultani said. According to Pakistan’s Foreign Office in July, among more than 44,000 Afghans living in Pakistan to be relocated to third countries, about 25,000 Afghan refugees are waiting to be resettled in the U.S. Fahimi Zahid, an Afghan activist living in Islamabad, told VOA that after the suspension of their relocation program to the U.S., Afghan refugees in Pakistan are 'very concerned' about their future in Pakistan. 'In the past, refugees had a hope that the U.S. was in talks with Pakistan to ensure they wouldn’t face any harassment,' she said, 'but after the executive order, it is for sure that Afghans would face further harassment and deportation.' According to the U.S. State Department, more than 180,000 Afghans were relocated in the U.S. from August 2021, after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, to December 2024. Thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during its two-decade war in Afghanistan are still waiting to be relocated to the U.S. Shawn VanDiver, the president of AfghanEvac, a California-based coalition of organizations helping the U.S., told VOA that until the USRAP resumes, 'there won’t be any travel. Refugees won’t be flying here or anywhere else.' U.S. media reported Wednesday that the flights of Afghan refugees who were supposed to be relocated to the U.S. were canceled only days before the order would go into effect. VanDiver said the order mainly would affect Afghan refugees with Priority 1 and Priority 2 cases. He said he and others at AfghanEvec are trying to have President Trump issue 'an exemption for Afghans.' 'People that pass security and waiting medical and all that, we got to make sure they get here,' he added. VanDiver noted that somewhere between 150,000 to 200,000 Afghans have resettlement cases. Sultani said that he and other Afghan refugees who waited for years to be relocated to the U.S. are now facing an uncertain future. 'Going back to Afghanistan is no option for us, and here [in Pakistan] we face many problems,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-refugees-in-pakistan-worry-as-us-suspends-resettlement-program/7949844.html	2025-01-24T17:58:23-08:00

State Department freezes new funding for nearly all US aid programs worldwide	WASHINGTON — The State Department ordered a sweeping freeze Friday on new funding for almost all U.S. foreign assistance, making exceptions for emergency food programs and military aid to Israel and Egypt. The order threatened a quick halt to many of the billions of dollars in U.S.-funded projects globally to support health, education, development, job training, anti-corruption, security assistance and other efforts. The U.S. provides more foreign aid globally than any other country, budgeting about $60 billion in 2023, or about 1% of the U.S. budget. Secretary of State Marco Rubio's order, delivered in a cable sent to U.S. embassies worldwide, specifically exempted emergency food programs, such as those helping to feed millions in a widening famine in warring Sudan. The cable spells out the execution of the aid-freezing executive order President Donald Trump signed on Monday. But Friday's order especially disappointed humanitarian officials by not including specific exemptions for lifesaving health programs, such as clinics and immunization programs. A globally acclaimed anti-HIV program, the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was among those apparently included in the spending freeze, slated to last at least three months. Known as PEPFAR, the program is credited with saving 25 million lives, including those of 5.5 million children, since it was started by Republican President George W. Bush. Some aid projects began receiving their first stop-work orders under the freeze Friday afternoon. Some leading aid organizations also were interpreting the directive as an immediate stop-work order for U.S.-funded aid work globally, a former senior U.S. Agency for International Development official said. Many would likely cease operations immediately so as not to incur more costs, the official said. The official was not authorized to speak publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Suspending funding 'could have life or death consequences' for children and families around the world, said Abby Maxman, head of Oxfam America. 'By suspending foreign development assistance, the Trump administration is threatening the lives and futures of communities in crisis, and abandoning the United States' long-held bipartisan approach to foreign assistance which supports people based on need, regardless of politics,' Maxman said in a statement. At the United Nations, deputy spokesman Farhan Haq said: 'These are bilateral decisions but nonetheless we expect those nations who have the capability to generously fund development assistance.' While Rubio's order exempted military assistance to allies Israel and Egypt from the freeze, there was no indication of a similar waiver to allow vital U.S. military assistance to Ukraine through. The Biden administration pushed military aid to Ukraine out the door before leaving office because of doubts about whether Trump would continue it. But there is still about $3.85 billion in congressionally authorized funding for any future arms shipments to Ukraine, and it is now up to Trump to decide whether to spend it. The sweeping freeze begins enforcement of a pledge from Trump and other Republicans to crack down on U.S. aid programs. Florida Republican Representative Brian Mast, the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, promised this week that Republicans would question 'every dollar and every diplomat' in the State Department's budget to ensure it met their standards for strict necessity. The freeze is necessary to ensure that 'appropriations are not duplicated, are effective and are consistent with President Trump's foreign policy,' the global cable stated. Within the next month, standards for a review of all foreign assistance are expected to be set to ensure that it is 'aligned with President Trump's foreign policy agenda,' the cable said. And within three months, the government-wide review is expected to be completed with a subsequent report to be produced for Rubio to make recommendations to the president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-department-freezes-new-funding-for-nearly-all-us-aid-programs-worldwide/7949764.html	2025-01-24T16:02:23-08:00

Pandas are back in Washington, delighting National Zoo visitors	washington — Giant pandas have returned to the National Zoo in Washington, drawing joyful crowds. Two pandas, Bao Li and Qing Bao, made their public debut Friday in front of hundreds of excited fans, the first pandas at the zoo in more than a year. Lisa Barham came all the way from Cleveland, Ohio, with her son to see them. 'It's just fantastic to be able to experience this as a family,' she told VOA’s Mandarin Service. Bao Li is the son of Bao Bao, a giant panda who was born at the National Zoo in 2013 and was returned to China. 'I brought my little boy to see Bao Bao's little boy,' Barham said. The pair of pandas, who are both 3 years old, rolled in Washington’s newly fallen snow and munched on bamboo. Crowds lined up for hours before the zoo opened at 8 a.m. to catch a glimpse of the bears. The pandas arrived from China in October but have been in quarantine while their enclosure was renovated. National Zoo director Brandie Smith told VOA that the pandas are 'a symbol of happiness and joy.' 'The pandas to me are such a success story … a story of panda friendship between our cultures,' she said. Because of conservation efforts, the giant panda is no longer on the endangered species list. However, it is still listed as 'vulnerable.' Smith said that at the start of the zoo’s program with pandas, which began in the 1970s, the focus was on producing more pandas to create an 'insurance population' for the planet. 'We accomplished that, and now the focus is really on habitat,' she said. About 1,864 giant pandas live in their native habitat in Asia while another 600 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world, according to the National Zoo’s website. Any cubs born to the new pandas are returned to China to join that country’s breeding program. The pandas are in Washington on a 10-year lease from China. The National Zoo says it is paying the China Wildlife and Conservation Association $1 million per year for the animals. At an opening ceremony at the zoo Friday morning, students from Yu Ying Public Charter School, a dual Chinese and English school in Washington, wore panda ears and sang a song about friendship. The school's executive director, Carlie Fisher, told VOA that the 'pandas represent peace and goodwill.' The zoo relaunched its popular Panda Cam on Friday, with 40 cameras streaming images of the furry bears throughout the day. The site had 75,000 views by 11:30 a.m. on Friday, according to zoo officials. VOA Mandarin Service reporter Calla Yu contributed to this report. Some information came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pandas-are-back-in-washington-delighting-national-zoo-visitors/7949534.html	2025-01-24T14:31:36-08:00	
In Turkey, watchdogs note wave of arrests of Kurdish media	WASHINGTON/ISTANBUL — Turkish authorities this month detained six Kurdish journalists from cities across the country. All six are accused of being members of a 'terrorist organization,' a common charge used in legal cases against media in Turkey. The arrests came the same week that Turkey was named a leading jailer of journalists. Data from the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, show 11 journalists currently detained for their work in Turkey, five of whom are Kurdish. Kurds are one of the world’s largest stateless ethnic groups, an estimated 30 million of whom span the Middle East countries of Iran, Iraq, Syria and Turkey. Across those regions, CPJ data show, 10 Kurdish media workers are detained. CPJ Chief Executive Jodie Ginsberg told VOA the trend of minorities targeted for arrest is seen globally. 'Again, this is something that we see when we look at the prison numbers more generally as often a targeting, particularly of minority communities, journalists representing those communities,' Ginsberg said. The most recent media arrests in Turkey involved journalists at the Yeni Yasam daily newspaper and at Guncel Productions. Sukru Alpsoy, a lawyer for the journalists, told VOA their work was presented as evidence in the case. VOA called the Istanbul Chief Prosecutor’s Office but did not receive a response. The CPJ data offer a snapshot of journalists in custody on Dec. 1 of each year. But media analysts say many more are held throughout the year. In Turkey, seven journalists were among a group of people arrested at a protest in December over the deaths in northern Syria of two journalists. An estimated 24 journalists have been detained in the past two months, according to Bianet Media Monitoring. Istanbul-based journalist Diren Yurtsever told VOA she believes authorities want to stop the media from reporting. A reporter for the Kurdish Mezopotamya News Agency, Yurtsever spent six months in custody last year on terrorism charges. 'We face charges such as 'membership of a terrorist organization,' 'propaganda for a terrorist organization' or 'financing,'' she told VOA. 'But when we look at the issue of membership in the organization and the files of journalists, we see that the grounds for accusations are mostly news reports. 'I can say that there is a great injustice against journalists and a serious threat to the law and freedom of expression is manifesting itself,' she said. Dicle Muftuoglu, a Mezopotamya editor and co-chair of the Tigris Euphrates Journalists Association, said the arrests are linked to coverage. 'Members of the court or any force cannot interfere with the issues that a journalist discusses in his program, the news he makes, or the problems he raises on social media,' said Muftuoglu. 'But today we see that they are interfering in all of this.' The Turkish embassy in Washington did not respond to VOA’s email requesting comment. In response to the latest arrests, the Coalition for Women in Journalism called for the detainees to be freed. 'This crackdown is part of a growing pattern of systematic repression, with the Kurdish press facing relentless persecution,' the media group said in a statement. Turkey ranks 158 out of 180 on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment. This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-turkey-watchdogs-note-wave-of-arrests-of-kurdish-media/7949520.html	2025-01-24T14:30:00-08:00

Legal team files UN complaint over jailed Bangladeshi journalists	WASHINGTON — Amid the political chaos in Bangladesh in August that included the ouster of the country's prime minister, journalists Farzana Rupa and Shakil Ahmed were arrested at an airport in the capital, Dhaka, while attempting to travel to Paris. More than 150 days have passed since then, and the married couple remains jailed in the South Asian country on accusations that their legal team rejects as politically motivated. 'This is a particularly absurd example of using the law to target critics, but unfortunately, it's still resulting in them remaining in prison,' human rights lawyer Caoilfhionn Gallagher, who is leading the couple's international legal team, told VOA. The international legal team representing the journalists filed a complaint Wednesday with the United Nations over their detention, which analysts say underscores broader challenges facing journalists in Bangladesh. Massive student-led protests erupted in Bangladesh in June 2024 and ultimately led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigning and fleeing to India. She had led the country since 2009. About 870 people died in the protests, according to the health ministry led by interim Bangladesh government. While covering the violent demonstrations, several journalists were attacked, and two were killed, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Many of journalists who have been targeted were viewed as pro-Hasina. Rupa and Ahmed are among four journalists viewed as pro-Hasina who were still jailed in Bangladesh as of early December, according to CPJ. Rupa and Ahmed both worked at the Ekattor TV channel, which was considered pro-Hasina, and were critical of the protests, according to the Coalition for Women in Journalism. Police claimed Rupa and Ahmed had incited Hasina's former government to kill protesters. The reporters were arrested in connection with the murder case of a garment worker who died during a demonstration in early August in Dhaka. Bangladeshi journalist Khairuzzaman Kamal, who previously worked with Rupa and is friends with Ahmed, said they are good journalists. 'They maintain their professional ethics very much,' said Kamal, of the Bangladesh Manobadhikar Sangbadik Forum journalist association. But other analysts say that, like many journalists in Bangladesh, they were pro-Hasina — but that doesn't mean they should be imprisoned on politically motivated charges. Even though Bangladesh has experienced significant media growth over the past 20 years, a lack of openness surrounding ownership and political affiliation has raised questions about editorial independence and threatened trust in the media, according to media reports. Gallagher, who is based in London, said the case against her clients is an example of retaliatory lawfare, which is when governments use and abuse the law to target critics. 'The intellectual hoops you have to jump through to claim that journalism in itself may have contributed to a mindset, which may have contributed to an attack, which may have contributed to a death is just legally nonsensical,' Gallagher said. Kamal agreed. 'It is a fabricated murder case against them because they are journalists,' the journalist said. By filing a complaint with the U.N. Working Group on Arbitrary Detention, Gallagher said she hopes the group will determine that Rupa and Ahmed's jailings are arbitrary. 'What we're seeing here is entirely unjust imprisonment without due process,' she added. Bangladesh's Embassy in Washington, U.N. office in Geneva, and Foreign Ministry did not reply to VOA's emails requesting comment. Press freedom threatened Press freedom has been under threat for years in Bangladesh, according to watchdog groups such as Amnesty International and Reporters without Borders. Hasina's government was long accused of using severe tools, such as intimidating family members of exiled journalists, and harsh laws to stifle dissent and repress the media. In her last year in power, Bangladesh fell to 165th place out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index, the country's worst ranking ever. 'It was very clear during Hasina's 15 years of rule in Bangladesh that the media was under tight control for a long time, and journalists have been constantly targeted because of their reporting,' Beh Lih Yi, CPJ Asia program coordinator, told VOA. Mubashar Hasan, a fellow at the University of Oslo, agreed. Hasan, who researches authoritarianism and press freedom in Bangladesh, told VOA that for years it was risky for journalists to report critically on issues involving the military and the prime minister's office. 'There were no-go places for their journalism,' Hasan said. After Hasina resigned in early August, Bangladesh formed an interim government led by politician and Nobel Peace Prize winner Mohammad Yunus. In an October interview with the country's largest paper, Prothom Alo, Yunus appeared to advocate for press freedom. 'Write as you please. Criticize,' he said. 'Unless you write, how will we know what is happening or not happening?' And in a November interview with the Bangladeshi newspaper The Daily Star, Yunus recognized that the murder accusations against journalists without evidence were unfair, saying, 'This was hurriedly done, following the old laws and practices.' More than 140 journalists have faced these accusations, according to Reporters Without Borders. The interim government's stated commitment to defend press freedom is a good sign for the future, Beh said. But in practice, the forms of repression facing journalists have merely changed shape under the interim government. Four journalists are still in jail, and in November, demonstrators attacked the offices of two major newspapers. Authorities have also frozen the bank accounts of several journalists, and the interim government canceled press accreditations for more than 160 reporters. 'What we are very alarmed by is even though the interim government has pledged to reform, what is happening does not actually reflect that commitment,' Beh said. 'They must not adopt the previous regime's playbook by using the law to target critics or by using the previous regime's playbook to settle old scores.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/legal-team-files-un-complaint-over-jailed-bangladeshi-journalists-/7949488.html	2025-01-24T14:15:00-08:00

US cities get creative clearing snow, ice after rare winter storm	Days after a winter storm dropped ice and record-breaking snow, cleanup efforts were underway Thursday in several major Southern U.S. cities such as New Orleans, Louisiana, where crews were removing snow the same way they remove trash, drink cups and plastic beads after Mardi Gras celebrations. Temperatures were gradually rising across the U.S. South, bringing hopes that remaining snow and ice would melt away. 'We have to be honest with ourselves — we're from Louisiana, we know crawfish, we know football, but we don't really know snow and ice and that's okay,' said Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development spokesperson Daniel Gitlin. 'It's going to go away and we're better off letting Mother Nature do what she needs to do right now.' Up to 320 kilometers (200 miles) of interstate highways were expected to remain closed until Friday due to treacherous patches of black ice, Gitlin said. Louisiana has nearly run out of its salt supply after treating roads, he added. In New Orleans, a private waste management firm has been contracted to repurpose equipment that's typically used to clean up Mardi Gras beads and cups to clear snow from the streets. IV Waste President Sidney Torres said his company has deployed a 15,000-liter (4,000-gallon) 'flusher' truck to spray water on the ground to soften the ice for removal in the historic and festive French Quarter. The truck normally sprays lemon-scented fragrance 'to get rid of that funky liquor, urine, puke smell from the night before,' Torres said. 'We're finding new solutions and better techniques to dealing with this.' Arkansas sent Louisiana snowplows, dump trucks, salt spreaders and other equipment, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said. Snow likely breaks records The snowfall likely broke several records across the region, including in Florida where a preliminary report of 25 centimeters (10 inches) in one town would set a record for the state, if confirmed. Snow totals reached 8 centimeters (3 inches) this week in Savannah, Georgia, the most that the state's oldest city has recorded since December 1989. The snow was lighter in metro Atlanta, Georgia, where the southern suburbs saw more snow and ice than areas north of the city. In Covington, southeast of Atlanta, Jesse Gentes used a flame thrower to de-ice the roads in his subdivision. In better weather, he typically uses the flame thrower for brush removal, he told television station WSB-TV. Light freezing rain was forecast Thursday in the port city of Brunswick and surrounding Glynn County, where local officials had imposed an overnight curfew because of icy roads and frigid temperatures. Officials opened three warming stations where people could escape the biting chill, and nearly 4,000 residents of the county were still without power Thursday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us. South Carolina reported at least one death in the storm. A 71-year-old man died from a medical condition while shoveling snow Thursday morning in Berkeley County, Coroner Darnell Hartwell said. About 8-10 centimeters (3-4 inches) of snow fell in the area, according to the National Weather Service. The snow and ice had staying power and left a mess on the roads in coastal South Carolina. In Charleston, South Carolina, ice that melted and then refroze overnight closed the James Island Connector, a bridge that links the city to its western suburbs. Police said on social media that 'while crews are working hard, it is unlikely to reopen soon.' Schools and county offices remained closed as officials in most areas south and east of the state capital, Columbia, asked people to stay home at least one more day. It was a similar story in North Carolina, where slick roads remained a danger to drivers after snow melted and then refroze overnight. Schools were also affected, including in Cumberland County where Fayetteville is located, where the school system announced that students would have an 'asynchronous' learning day allowing students to complete assignments at home. Several other school districts operated on a two-hour delay. Some school systems in central and south Alabama remained closed Thursday because of concerns about the remaining ice on roads or the possibility of frozen pipes in schools. In coastal Baldwin County, sections of Interstate 65 and Interstate 10 were shut down because of ice. Across the South, airports were gradually recovering from the weather interruption. Nationwide, about 600 flights scheduled to fly into or out of U.S. airports had been canceled by midday Thursday — a marked improvement over previous days when the storm was at its peak, according to the flight tracking service FlightAware.com. Parts of river freeze Meanwhile in the northeast, places like New York were still dealing with bitter cold temperatures despite moments when the sun peeked through the clouds. Parts of New York's Hudson River turned to ice Thursday during recent cold weather in the city. The frozen surface split into blocks of ice with the city's majestic skyline looming on the distant bank of the river. The National Weather Service has issued a warning for wind chills in eastern parts of the U.S. In New York, the city is dealing with temperatures below zero degrees Celsius (around 20 degrees Fahrenheit) which are expected to last through the weekend.

Nigeria seeks $910 million to tackle worsening humanitarian crisis	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian authorities and the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs have launched an appeal for $910 million to address an escalating humanitarian crisis in the northeastern states of Borno, Adamawa and Yobe. The 2025 Humanitarian Needs and Response Plan was unveiled Thursday at the U.N. House in Abuja. The appeal aims to raise nearly a billion dollars to provide lifesaving assistance to some 3.6 million people affected by the more than 15 years of insurgency and insecurity in northeast Nigeria. Officials said humanitarian needs have worsened recently due to climate shocks, including devastating floods, and deepening economic issues. Mohammed Malick Fall, the U.N. resident coordinator in Nigeria, highlighted the growing challenges. 'This occasion underscores our collective resolve as a community to millions of people here in Nigeria. We have seen a spike in the number of people facing food insecurity. We have also seen a rise in children suffering from malnutrition,' he said. 'In 2024, we experienced perhaps one of the worst floods. 'Humanitarian interventions are key in saving lives, but they can't be the solution for all the problems across Nigeria. What is required also is for development to step in, that we double down on peace building,' Fall added. The 2025 plan prioritizes food security, health care, water and sanitation, with a particular focus on vulnerable groups such as women, children and people with disabilities. The plan also seeks to tackle the root causes of poverty and underdevelopment while building the resilience of vulnerable communities. Fall noted that just 57% of last year’s funding target was achieved — a number that was still slightly higher than the global average. Nigeria’s Minister of Humanitarian Affairs, Nentawe Yilwatda, underscored the importance of taking a proactive approach to the emergency. 'The 2025 Humanitarian Response Plan prioritizes saving lives, building resilience, and adopting adaptive strategies to address evolving challenges with limited resources. This plan shifts from a reactive to a proactive approach, aiming to mitigate disasters before they occur,' Yilwatda said. 'While the focus remains on Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states, it also acknowledges growing humanitarian needs in the northwest and north-central regions.' Borno, Adamawa and Yobe states have been grappling with terrorism from Boko Haram and widespread insecurity from armed gangs for over 15 years, creating one of Africa's most severe humanitarian crises. Zubaida Umar, director-general of Nigeria's National Emergency Management Agency, emphasized the need for collaboration. 'The success of this plan lies in collaboration, synergy, and a people-centered approach. The numbers in this report represent real lives — children, women and men, families whose resilience inspires us to act with urgency and compassion,' Umar said. The U.N. estimates that 33 million Nigerians will face food insecurity in 2025, up from 26.5 million last year. Among them, 2.5 million children are at risk of dying from severe acute malnutrition without immediate intervention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-seeks-910-million-to-tackle-worsening-humanitarian-crisis/7949382.html	2025-01-24T12:11:57-08:00	
Hamas announces hostages to be released in next exchange	Hamas on Friday announced the names of four Israeli women hostages whom the militant group is set to release Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in the second swap under the ceasefire deal in Gaza. The four women are Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag, Hamas said. All four women are Israeli soldiers who were abducted from the Nahal Oz base in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas launched its attack. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed that it had received the list via mediators and that its response would be provided later. The exchange is expected to begin on Saturday afternoon. On Jan. 19, the first day of the ceasefire, Hamas released three Israeli women in exchange for 90 Palestinian prisoners. In the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas is expected to release 33 hostages in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel, as well as increased humanitarian aid and a withdrawal of the Israeli military from some parts of Gaza. The Israel-Hamas war began with the Hamas attack on Israel in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 others hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and fighters but has previously said more than half of those killed have been women and children. Israel’s response has also displaced the majority of the territory’s population and destroyed most of the enclave. Ahead of the Saturday exchange, the United Nations Human Rights Office warned on Friday that increased violence in the occupied West Bank could threaten the ceasefire in Gaza. Since Tuesday, Israeli operations in the West Bank have killed at least 12 Palestinians and injured 40 others, 'most of them reportedly unarmed,' United Nations Human Rights office spokesperson Thameen Al-Kheetan said. 'It is very concerning that what’s happening today in the West Bank may have an impact on the ceasefire in Gaza. It is imperative that the ceasefire in Gaza holds,' he said. Hundreds of Jenin residents fled their homes as the Israeli military destroyed several houses on the third day of a major operation in the West Bank city on Thursday. Israeli officials said the Jenin operation was aimed at what the military said were Iranian-backed militant groups in the refugee camp next to the city, which has been a hub for armed Palestinian groups for years. 'We are also concerned by repeated comments from some Israeli officials about plans to expand settlements further still and a fresh breach of international law,' Al-Kheetan said. 'We recall again that the transfer by Israel of its own civilian population into territories it occupies also amounts to a war crime.' Israel has occupied the West Bank of the Jordan River, which Palestinians want as the center of an independent state, since the 1967 Middle East war. Most countries view the Jewish settlements that Israel has built there as illegal, but Israel cites historical and Biblical ties to the land.

Ahead of election, media group accuses Belarus of crimes against humanity	WASHINGTON — Ahead of Belarus’ presidential election this weekend, a media advocacy group filed a complaint Friday with the International Criminal Court accusing the country’s longtime leader of crimes against humanity against journalists. The complaint, filed by Reporters Without Borders, known by French acronym RSF, accuses President Alexander Lukashenko of orchestrating a harsh crackdown on independent media that began after he claimed victory in the disputed 2020 election. That election was widely seen as rigged, with opposition candidates jailed or forced to flee. Security forces violently suppressed the subsequent mass protests. Paris-based RSF cited in its complaint the imprisoning and persecution of journalists and displacement of media workers as examples of crimes against humanity. 'RSF calls on the ICC Prosecutor to include these crimes against journalists in its preliminary investigation,' Antoine Bernard, RSF’s director of advocacy and assistance, said in a statement. Since the crackdown on independent media began, Belarus has ranked among the worst jailers of journalists in the world, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Belarusian media experts say the dire environment has made it harder to access credible information. 'The Belarusian information space is tightly controlled by the government,' Natalia Belikova, the head of international cooperation at Press Club Belarus, told VOA from Warsaw. Repression against journalists and activists has been increasing in the lead up to the election, she said. Press Club Belarus counts more than 40 journalists currently jailed in the country. The European Parliament and exiled Belarusian leader Svetlana Tikhanovskayahave condemned the upcoming election in Belarus as a sham. Since 2020, the Belarusian government has pressured independent media through raids on news outlets, blocking websites and designating media organizations as 'extremist.' The harsh environment forced some reporters to quit their jobs. Meanwhile, hundreds of other journalists fled into exile, according to the Belarusian Association of Journalists. 'For five years, the Belarusian regime has systematically persecuted independent voices, starting with journalists,' Jeanne Cavelier, the head of RSF’s Eastern Europe and Central Asia desk, said in a statement. Belikova said she thinks the complaint to the ICC is significant. 'On the level of raising the profile of repression in Belarus, especially against journalists and free press, I think this is a very important move,' she said. But Belikova added that she wasn’t sure whether the complaint will improve the crisis facing Belarusian journalists. The office of the ICC prosecutor said it does not comment on complaints but confirmed it had received one from RSF. The Belarusian Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment for this story. The assault on independent media has created an environment where state-run propaganda can thrive, according to analysts. Beginning last week, the Belarusian state-run television network ONT has aired a series of propaganda films that feature three jailed journalists. The journalists are seen in prison facilities, looking emaciated and exhausted as they are asked questions. The journalists — Ihar Losik and Andrey Kuznechyk, who work for VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, and Ihar Karney, who previously contributed to RFE/RL — are jailed on charges that press freedom groups view as politically motivated. The ONT propaganda series accused the journalists of trying to 'set Belarus on fire.' 'It is a very bad and malicious practice. It is against all human rights,' Belikova said about the interviews. Belikova said the interviews were likely intended to discredit RFE/RL in the eyes of Belarusians. RFE/RL’s Belarusian Service is one of the main independent outlets delivering independent news to people inside the country. RFE/RL said it had no comment on the interview series. Despite the proliferation of state-run propaganda, Belarusians still regularly access banned news sites. The five biggest sites had over 17 million visits in December 2023, according to a 2024 JX Fund report. Belarus has a population of around 9 million people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ahead-of-election-media-group-accuses-belarus-of-crimes-against-humanity/7949238.html	2025-01-24T10:55:49-08:00

Lunar New Year travel offers boost to China’s economic woes	China’s annual mass migration ahead of the Lunar New Year will peak with billions of trips anticipated during this year’s holiday, which begins Tuesday. An estimated 9 billion trips are expected. This year’s holiday lasts from Jan. 28 through Feb. 4 and marks the arrival of the Year of the Snake. Authorities in China extended the annual break an extra day, so the public holiday will last eight days this year. During the holiday, travel is expected to pick up domestically and internationally. The government said it expects trips by train to surpass 510 million, with 90 million more traveling by air. Inside the country, most will travel by car. For trips overseas, travel to Southeast Asia has surged, with ticket volumes to Vietnam, Singapore and Indonesia rising by more than 50%, according to data from the World Travel and Tourism Council. Additionally, demand for travel to Hong Kong has nearly doubled, and Japan is seeing a 58% increase in airline ticket purchases. While the Lunar New Year is known as a festive time characterized by colorful lanterns, parades and lion dances, it holds more than just cultural significance to Chinese authorities who see the period as an opportunity to boost a sluggish economy. That is one key reason authorities increased the holiday to eight days. They also launched several efforts to help revive weak consumer spending, such as promoting winter-themed holiday destinations and ensuring affordable airfares, according to officials at a State Council press conference in Beijing. Despite the efforts, Reuters reported businesses and consumers appear to be spending less than usual during the holiday season, citing concerns over a prolonged property slump and worries over job security. Throughout the past year, China has implemented a series of measures aimed at addressing those concerns, including stimulus measures such as cutting interest rates, increasing pensions and widening trade-in programs for consumer goods. One industry that appears to have gotten a boost from the festival season is cinema. The film industry in China had struggled recently, seeing a 22.6% decrease in total box office revenue in 2024. However, according to data from Maoyan, a Chinese ticketing platform, movie tickets exceeded $55 million by Jan. 23, the fastest presales for the Lunar New Year season. A large part of that increased demand has been from the film 'Legends of the Condor Heroes,' starring Xiao Zhan, an actor and singer who is also a brand ambassador for luxury goods companies such as Gucci and Tod's. Shops and restaurants also hope to see an increase in spending that mirrors the film industry over the course of the holiday.

Court bars Oath Keepers founder from Washington without approval	WASHINGTON — A federal judge on Friday barred Oath Keepers founder Stewart Rhodes from entering Washington without the court's approval after U.S. President Donald Trump commuted the far-right extremist group leader's 18-year prison sentence for orchestrating an attack on the U.S. Capitol four years ago. U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta issued the order two days after Rhodes visited the Capitol, where he met with at least one lawmaker, chatted with others and defended his actions during a mob's attack on Jan. 6, 2021. Rhodes was released from a Maryland prison a day earlier. Mehta’s order also applies to other Oath Keepers members who were convicted of charges that they participated in a violent plot to attack the Capitol.	https://www.voanews.com/a/court-bars-oath-keepers-founder-from-washington-without-approval/7949095.html	2025-01-24T09:29:46-08:00	
Drought led to 71,000 ‘excess deaths’ in Somalia, report shows	WASHINGTON — A study finds that severe drought plaguing parts of Somalia since 2022 has killed at least 71,000 people beyond the number expected. About 40% of the lives lost were children under the age of 5, said the study, commissioned by the U.N. Children’s Fund, the World Health Organization and Somalia’s Ministry of Health. The study covered the period between January 2022 and June 2024. In an interview with VOA Somali, Dr. Najib Isse Dirie, the deputy director for research at Mogadishu’s SIMAD University, which helped carry out the study, said the excess deaths were the result of five failed rainy seasons that brought parts of Somalia to the brink of famine. 'During the drought and after, the people experienced a significant 'drought-related excess' in different cases,' he said. 'Living in overcrowding IDP camps, loss of their livelihoods, and the lack of rainfall severely impacted their crop yields and made them vulnerable.' Speaking at the report launch in Mogadishu on Wednesday, the WHO’s representative to Somalia, Dr. Renee van De Weerdt Renhilde, said the study is an unpleasant reminder. 'The findings of this study highlight the profound impact that the 2022–2024 drought has had on the lives of the Somali people. ... This is a stark reminder of the urgent need for continued support and resilience-building efforts in Somalia,' she said. 'This also underlines the critical importance of strengthening Somalia’s health emergency prevention, preparedness, readiness and resilience system to effectively respond to emergencies and provide sustained care for people in need,' she added. 'WHO continues to collaborate with the Somali government and partners to ensure that communities are not only protected during crises but also empowered to withstand and recover from future shocks.' At the launching ceremony, Somali Health Minister Dr. Ali Hadji Adam Abubakar explained his county’s plans to limit the impact of future droughts by giving priority to vulnerable children and women. 'For my ministry, our focus is on creating a strong and robust health system as the cornerstone of a healthy and thriving Somali society,' Abubakar said. As it launched an appeal this week to raise $1.43 billion, the U.N. issued a warning that about 6 million people in Somalia will require humanitarian aid this year. In a statement, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said, 'Somalia continues to face a complex, protracted humanitarian crisis,' pointing out that conflict, insecurity, disease outbreaks, and recurrent shocks from climatic phenomena such as drought and floods further worsen Somalia's humanitarian needs. In 2011, a famine in Somalia killed more than a quarter-million people. The study was commissioned by UNICEF and the WHO and carried out by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, Imperial College London, and Somalia’s SIMAD University.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drought-led-to-71-000-excess-deaths-in-somalia-report-shows/7949102.html	2025-01-24T09:26:52-08:00	
London court says US mom can be extradited in children's killings	LONDON — A London judge on Friday rejected a U.S. mother's challenge to be extradited to Colorado to face murder charges in the deaths of two of her young children. Judge John Zani said in Westminster Magistrates Court that it would now be up to the British Home Secretary to order Kimberlee Singler returned to the United States. Singler, 36, is accused of two counts of first-degree murder in the December 2023 shooting and stabbings of her 9-year-old daughter and 7-year-old son, and one count of attempted murder in the knife slashing of her 11-year-old daughter. She also faces three counts of child abuse and one count of assault. Singler’s attorney had argued that sending her back to the U.S. would violate European human rights law, in part, because she faces a sentence of life in prison without parole in Colorado if convicted of first-degree murder. Such a sentence would be inhumane because it offers no prospect for release even if she is rehabilitated, attorney Edward Fitzgerald said. Fitzgerald said that despite an option for a Colorado governor to commute her sentence at some point, it was 'political suicide' to do so. Experts for the defense had originally said that a life sentence had never been commuted in Colorado. But prosecutors later found that Governor John Hickenlooper in 2018 commuted life sentences of five men convicted of murder. The defense countered that three of those sentences were not life without parole and two were for men who committed their crime between the ages of 18 and 21, which is sometimes considered a mitigating factor at sentencing because of their relative youth. 'This defendant, Kimberlee Singler, has no real prospect of release no matter what progress she makes' behind bars, Fitzgerald said. Prosecutor Joel Smith said the judge only had to consider if there is a mechanism that could allow Singler to be freed someday. 'Prospect of release — that is not your concern,' Smith told the judge at a hearing in December. Zani said in his ruling that there was an option in Colorado to release an inmate serving a life sentence. 'I am satisfied that the defendant has failed to vault the hurdle necessary in order to succeed in the challenges raised,' the judge said. Fitzgerald said he planned to appeal. Singler has denied that she harmed her children. She told police that her ex-husband had either carried out the killings or hired a hitman. Singler had superficial knife wounds and was initially treated as a victim. But that changed when her surviving daughter, who initially said she had been attacked by an intruder, told police her mother tried to kill her. After her daughter changed her story, police sought to arrest Singler on Dec. 26, but she had fled. She was found four days later in London’s posh Chelsea neighborhood and arrested. The girl told police that her mother gave the children milk with a powdery substance to drink and told them to close their eyes as she guided them into a sibling’s bedroom, prosecutors said. Singler cut her neck and, as the girl begged her to stop, she slashed her again. The girl said her mother had a gun. 'The defendant told her that God was telling her to do it and that the children’s father would take them away,' Smith said at a previous hearing. Police found Aden Wentz, 7, and Elianna 'Ellie' Wentz, 9, dead when they entered the Colorado Springs apartment on Dec. 19. They had been shot and stabbed. Although Singler blamed her husband, authorities said he had a solid alibi backed up by GPS records that showed he had been driving a truck at the time of the killings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/london-court-says-us-mom-can-be-extradited-in-children-s-killings/7949040.html	2025-01-24T08:37:07-08:00	
Afghan Taliban condemn ICC arrest warrants for leadership	ISLAMABAD — Afghanistan's ruling Taliban on Friday condemned the International Criminal Court's request for arrest warrants against their supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, and his chief justice for alleged persecution of women and girls. The Taliban’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs refuted the warrants as 'devoid of just legal basis, duplicitous in nature and politically motivated.' The strongly worded English-language statement follows Thursday’s announcement by the chief ICC prosecutor that he was seeking arrest warrants for the reclusive Akhundzada and Abdul Hakim Haqqani, who has been serving as the chief justice of the country since the Taliban seized power in 2021. Prosecutor Karim Khan cited a thorough investigation and evidence collected in the process for concluding that the Taliban leaders 'are criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women.' Khan said that persecution has persisted since the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan after nearly two decades of insurgency against the internationally recognized Kabul government and U.S.-led Western forces. 'It is unfortunate that such baseless allegations are being leveled against the honorable leaders of the Islamic Emirate [Taliban government] at a time when Afghanistan enjoys nationwide peace, its people have breathed a sigh of relief … and numerous other miseries and inhumane activities have been eradicated,' the Taliban ministry asserted. The Taliban takeover has almost ended years of war-related hostilities in the impoverished South Asian nation, leaving millions of Afghans in need of humanitarian assistance. 'Regrettably, this institution had turned a blind eye to the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by foreign forces and their domestic allies during their twenty-year occupation of Afghanistan,' the Taliban statement claimed Friday. Akhundzada has issued dozens of edicts over the past three years in line with his interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia, from his base in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar. The decrees have instituted sweeping restrictions on women and girls that the United Nations has labeled as 'gender apartheid.' The Haqqani-led Taliban Supreme Court has implemented what it claims is a Sharia-based criminal justice system, leading to public floggings of hundreds of Afghan men and women in packed sports stadiums on allegations such as adultery, sodomy, eloping, and other crimes. Several Afghans also have been executed publicly under what the Taliban described as the Islamic concept of retributive justice, known as qisas. Girls older than 12 are banned from pursuing education, including attending institutions that train midwives and nurses. Most women are prohibited from working in both the public and private sectors. They are blocked from visiting public parks, gyms, and baths. The Taliban have mandated that females cover their faces in public and that they cannot travel long distances without a male guardian — making Afghanistan the only country in the world to impose such bans on women and girls. The de facto authorities have rejected persistent U.N.-led calls for reversing all restrictions on the female Afghan population. 'Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable. Afghan survivors, in particular women and girls, deserve accountability before a court of law,' Khan said on Thursday. Amnesty International on Friday described the ICC prosecutor’s application for arrest warrants against the two Taliban leaders as an 'important step toward justice for Afghan women' and other vulnerable groups in the country. 'This is a crucial step to hold accountable all those allegedly responsible for the gender-based deprivation of fundamental rights to education, to free movement and free expression, to private and family life, to free assembly,' said Agnes Callamard, Amnesty’s secretary-general. She also urged the ICC prosecutor to 'reconsider his decision in 2021 to deprioritize investigations' into war crimes allegedly committed by former Afghan government security apparatus, the U.S. military, and allied troops during their 20-year presence in Afghanistan. 'This decision risks contributing to perceptions of a selective approach to international justice, which prioritizes the interests of powerful states and their allies over the right to justice of victims of crimes under international law,' Callamard said, referring to Thursday’s announcement by the ICC prosecutor. The U.S.-led foreign forces withdrew from Afghanistan just days after Taliban insurgents swept back to power in Kabul.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-taliban-condemn-icc-arrest-warrants-for-leadership/7949054.html	2025-01-24T08:27:16-08:00

Chocolate industry braces as Ivory Coast expects dire cocoa crop	Ivory Coast expects to record one of the worst mid-crop cocoa harvests of the last 15 years this season with production seen no higher than 300,000 metric tons compared with a yearly average of 500,000 tons, regulator and industry sources said. A poor harvest could add upward pressure to cocoa prices, which are already around record highs after nearly tripling last year. Analysts have said the chocolate industry is in for a rough 2025 that could see shelf prices increase by a percentage in the teens. Ivory Coast is the world's top cocoa producer, but a lack of rain and excessive heat since November across all its 13 growing regions have stalled development of the mid-crop harvest, which is meant to start in April. The unfavorable conditions mean that the first beans will start to arrive in ports in June at the earliest, provided the weather improves and rains return in the coming weeks, the sources said. 'There is no sign of any production at all on almost any plantation in the country,' said a pod counter who had just visited Ivory Coast farms. His words echo those of two regulator officials, who said that after touring farms their team decided to lower the outlook for cocoa production to 300,000 metric tons from 400,000 tons. 'Like everyone else, we're seeing the same thing. The mid-crop harvest will be one of the worst in 15 years,' one of the officials said. He added that the regulator had sold only about 250,000 tons in export contracts to grinders, preferring to be cautious. The regulator sources said the entire mid-crop harvest would be sold to local grinders to guarantee them the volumes necessary to maintain their activity. A dozen planters and middlemen across the West African country described the situation as unprecedented, characterized by a total absence of flowers and small pods after those that appeared in December and January dried up in the high heat. 'Even if the rain comes today ... it's already too late,' said Paul Kouame Kouakou, who owns four hectares of cocoa in Duekoue, a town in west Ivory Coast. It usually takes a flower around 22 weeks to become a mature pod. While the harvest was expected to start in April, there will be no cocoa until at least June, the farmer said. 'Usually, it's around November and December that we get the rains that herald the mid-crop harvest, but this year there's been no rain so far, and February and March are the hottest months,' said another pod counter. He visited dozens of plantations that did not have any sign of flowers or pods, which he called 'very bad news' for the crop.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chocolate-industry-braces-as-ivory-coast-expects-dire-cocoa-crop/7948916.html	2025-01-24T07:03:37-08:00

Israeli forces to stay in south Lebanon beyond withdrawal deadline	JERUSALEM — Israeli forces will remain in southern Lebanon beyond a Sunday deadline stipulated in a ceasefire deal with Hezbollah because the terms of the agreement have not been fully implemented, the Israeli prime minister's office said on Friday. Under the agreement, which began on Nov. 27, Hezbollah weapons and fighters must be removed from areas south of the Litani River and Israeli troops should withdraw as the Lebanese military deploys into the region, all within a 60-day timeframe due to conclude on Sunday at 4 a.m. The deal, brokered by the United States and France, ended more than a year of hostilities between Israel and the Iran-backed Hezbollah. The fighting peaked with a major Israeli offensive that left Hezbollah severely weakened and displaced more than 1.2 million people in Lebanon. The United States, Britain and other Western countries have designated Hezbollah as a terror group. Netanyahu's office said in a statement that the Israeli military's withdrawal process was 'contingent on the Lebanese army deploying in southern Lebanon and fully and effectively enforcing the agreement, while Hezbollah withdraws beyond the Litani.' 'Since the ceasefire agreement has not yet been fully enforced by the Lebanese state, the gradual withdrawal process will continue, in full coordination with the United States,' the statement said. There was no immediate comment from Lebanon or Hezbollah. The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Hezbollah said on Thursday that any delay of Israel's withdrawal would be an unacceptable breach of the agreement, with which the Lebanese state would have to deal 'through all means and methods guaranteed by international charters.' Israel said its campaign against Hezbollah aimed to secure the return of tens of thousands of people forced to leave their homes in northern Israel by Hezbollah rocket fire. It inflicted major blows on Hezbollah during the conflict, killing leader Hassan Nasrallah and thousands of the group's fighters and destroying much of its arsenal. Hezbollah was further weakened in December when its Syrian ally, Bashar al-Assad, was toppled, cutting its overland supply route from Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-forces-to-stay-in-south-lebanon-beyond-withdrawal-deadline/7948894.html	2025-01-24T06:36:49-08:00

Russia, Ukraine report large-scale overnight drone attacks	Officials in Ukraine say Russia launched a barrage of drones in an overnight attack Friday killing at least two civilians, wounding several others and damaging commercial and residential buildings. The interior ministry said two victims were killed by drone debris in the central Kyiv region. It said a multistory residential building and commercial buildings were among the infrastructure that sustained damage during the attack. Meanwhile, Russia’s Defense Ministry said air defenses intercepted and destroyed some 120 drones over a dozen regions, including Moscow, overnight Friday, launched by Ukraine. No casualties were reported. U.S. President Donald Trump said Thursday he would talk soon with Russian President Vladimir Putin to try to push the Russian leader to end his nearly three-year war on neighboring Ukraine. 'Millions of young lives are being wasted. That war is horrible,' Trump, via video link from Washington, told global business leaders meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. He said that 'Ukraine is ready to make a deal,' although no peace negotiations have been announced. 'This is a war that never should’ve started.' Trump, three days into his second term in the White House, said he would ask Saudi Arabia and OPEC to cut global oil prices, now about $77 a barrel, to curb Russia’s oil revenues, which it uses to fund the war. 'If the price comes down,' Trump said, 'the war in Ukraine will end immediately.' 'It’s so important to get that done,' he said. 'It’s time to end it.' Trump’s new remarks on the war came a day after he described the conflict as a 'ridiculous war' and told Putin in a social media message that if he didn’t move to end it, the U.S. would impose new tariffs, taxes and sanctions on Russian exports to the West. But the Kremlin was unmoved by Trump’s threat, saying Thursday it did not see any particularly new elements in U.S. policy toward Russia. 'He likes these methods, at least he liked them during his first presidency,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Peskov said Russia remains ready for 'mutually respectful dialogue' with the United States as Trump starts a four-year term in the White House. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-report-large-scale-overnight-drone-attacks/7948654.html	2025-01-24T01:29:46-08:00	
US agents raid New Jersey worksite as Trump escalates immigration crackdown	WASHINGTON — U.S. immigration agents rounded up undocumented migrants as well as American citizens in a raid of a Newark, New Jersey, worksite on Thursday that the city's mayor said involved detaining a military veteran and violations of the people's rights. The raid in New Jersey's most populous city, hailed in the past by Mayor Ras Baraka for its 'sanctuary' policies protecting migrants, follows President Donald Trump's pledge to deport millions of immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally. Trump issued a raft of executive orders after taking office on Monday that aim to clamp down on illegal immigration. He has taken steps to punish officials who resist enforcement of his sweeping crackdown. In a raid of a business establishment in Newark, outside New York City, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents failed to produce a warrant as they detained 'undocumented residents as well as citizens,' Baraka said in a statement. 'One of the detainees is a U.S. military veteran who suffered the indignity of having the legitimacy of his military documentation questioned,' Baraka said. In a statement, an ICE spokesperson said that agents 'may encounter U.S. citizens while conducting field work and may request identification to establish an individual’s identity as was the case during a targeted enforcement operation at a worksite today in Newark.' The spokesperson said that ICE was investigating the incident. Baraka said the raid had violated the citizens' rights under the U.S. Constitution. 'Newark will not stand by idly while people are being unlawfully terrorized,' he said. Neither Baraka nor ICE identified the business raided by name. White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said on X that the Trump administration arrested 538 people Thursday, describing all of them as 'illegal immigrant criminals.' She said they included members of a Venezuelan prison gang and people convicted of sex crimes. Leavitt did not provide more details. A range of studies by academics and think tanks have shown that immigrants do not commit crime at a higher rate than native-born Americans. Other studies find that immigrants in the U.S. illegally also do not commit crimes at a higher rate. Sanctuary cities Baraka, the Newark mayor, is one of the first local officials in the U.S. to issue a statement on a specific raid following the start of Trump's immigration crackdown. In 2017, he signed an executive order cementing Newark's sanctuary status and was a vocal opponent of Trump's immigration policies during the president's first term. Of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally or with temporary status in 2022, about 44% lived in states with 'sanctuary' laws that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities. That figure does not include those in sanctuary cities and counties in places without a statewide law, such as New Mexico. U.S. media outlets reported that federal law enforcement and ICE agents had arrested nearly 500 undocumented migrants wanted for outstanding crimes in sanctuary cities, including some from New York and New Jersey. The reports cited ICE officials who said the arrests took place Tuesday and Wednesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agents-raid-new-jersey-worksite-as-trump-escalates-immigration-crackdown/7948613.html	2025-01-23T22:31:51-08:00	
Houthi rebels release crew of vessel seized in Red Sea in 2023	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Yemen's Houthi rebels have released the crew of the Galaxy Leader, a vehicle carrier seized in November 2023 at the start of their attacks on shipping in the Red Sea corridor over the Israel-Hamas war. The move by the Iranian-backed Houthis marks their latest effort to de-escalate their attacks following a ceasefire in Gaza. However, it came as U.S. President Donald Trump moved to reinstate a terrorism designation he made on the group late in his first term that had been revoked by President Joe Biden, potentially setting the stage for new tensions with the rebels. The Houthis said they released the sailors after mediation by Oman, a sultanate on the eastern edge of the Arabian Peninsula that's long been an interlocutor with the Houthis. A Royal Air Force of Oman jet took a flight to Yemen earlier Wednesday and took off again about an hour after the Houthi announcement with the crew, who smiled as they stepped off into freedom in Muscat. The Houthis also said Hamas separately requested the release of the ship's crew of 25, who included mariners from the Philippines, Bulgaria, Romania, Ukraine and Mexico. 'This step comes in support of the ceasefire agreement in Gaza,' the Houthis said in a statement on rebel-controlled SABA news agency. In the Philippines, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. confirmed the release of 17 Filipino crew members, describing the moment as an 'utmost joy.' The Filipinos returned to their home country Thursday to welcomes from their families and government officials. Bulgaria’s Foreign Ministry confirmed the release of two Bulgarians identified by officials as the ship’s captain, Lyubomir Chanev, and assistant captain, Danail Veselinov. A government jet was on the way to Oman to bring the Bulgarians home, the ministry said. Hans Grundberg, the United Nations’ special envoy to Yemen, called the crew’s release 'heartwarming news that puts an end to the arbitrary detention and separation that they and their families endured for more than a year.' 'This is a step in the right direction, and I urge Ansar Allah to continue these positive steps on all fronts, including ending all maritime attacks,' he added, using another name for the Houthis. Vessel's link to Israeli billionaire The Houthis said they hijacked the Galaxy Leader over its connection to Israel. The attack launched the rebels' campaign targeting ships in international waters in the Red Sea, the Gulf of Aden and the Bab el-Mandeb Strait that connects them. A representative for the Galaxy Leader's owners had no comment Wednesday. The Bahamas-flagged vessel is affiliated with an Israeli billionaire, Abraham 'Rami' Ungar, who is known as one of the richest men in Israel. The Houthi attack on the Galaxy Leader saw the rebels launch a helicopter-borne raid. Propaganda footage of the raid has been played constantly by the Houthis, who even shot a music video aboard the ship at one point. On Monday, the Houthis signaled they now will limit their attacks in the Red Sea corridor to only Israeli-affiliated ships after a ceasefire began in the Gaza Strip, but warned wider assaults could resume if needed. However, it likely won’t be enough to encourage global firms to reenter the route that’s crucial for cargo and energy shipments moving between Asia and Europe. Their attacks have halved traffic through the region, cutting deeply into revenues for Egypt, which runs the Suez Canal linking the Red Sea to the Mediterranean. The release of the vessel's crew now may have been an effort to curry favor with the U.S., though the ship still remains moored off the Yemeni port city of Hodeida. 'This gesture by the Houthis may be intended as a goodwill measure towards the new Trump administration,' said Yemen expert Mohammed al-Basha, of the Basha Report risk advisory firm. However, Trump signed an order urging Secretary of State Marco Rubio to reinstate a foreign terrorist organization designation on the Houthis. Rubio separately called Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, who have led a coalition battling the Houthis since 2015. 'Under President Trump, it is now the policy of the United States to cooperate with its regional partners to eliminate the Houthis’ capabilities and operations, deprive them of resources, and thereby end their attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea,' the White House said. Biden lifted the designation early in his term, citing the humanitarian threat that the sanctions posed to ordinary Yemenis and to back an de facto ceasefire that still broadly holds in Yemen's war. Houthi attacks targeted over 100 commercial ships The Houthis have targeted over 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023, after Hamas’ surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel’s military offensive has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials who do not distinguish between civilians and combatants but say women and children make up more than half the fatalities. The Houthis have sunk two vessels in their campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels had maintained that they only targeted ships linked to Israel, the U.S., or the U.K. However, many of the ships attacked had little or no connection, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of Houthi attacks has slowed in recent weeks, particularly involving ships at sea. That may be due in part to the U.S. airstrike campaign. The U.S. and its partners alone have struck the Houthis over 260 times, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthi-rebels-release-crew-of-vessel-seized-in-red-sea-in-2023-/7948607.html	2025-01-23T22:15:20-08:00	
US Air Force looks to upgrade Cyprus airbase as humanitarian staging post for the Middle East	NICOSIA, CYPRUS — Experts from the U.S. Air Force are looking at ways to upgrade Cyprus' premier air base for use as a humanitarian staging post in future operations in the Middle East, a Cypriot official told The Associated Press on Thursday. Cyprus, which is only 184 kilometers from the Lebanese capital, Beirut, has acted as a transit point for the repatriation of foreign nationals fleeing conflict in the Middle East and beyond on numerous occasions in the past. It has also served as a transit point for humanitarian aid to Gaza. Experts from the 435th Contingency Response Group based out of Ramstein, Germany, will spend the next few days at Andreas Papandreou Air Force Base to assess the upgrade needed to accommodate a wide array of U.S. air assets and other forces. A key priority is to ensure air traffic safety in and around the base, which abuts the island's second-largest civilian airport, the official said. The base's location makes it easy to transfer evacuees onto civilian aircraft at the adjacent airport for their trip home. The official spoke to the Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he's not authorized to speak publicly about the details of the experts' visit. Air traffic safety would need to be enhanced through new high-tech installations, including state-of-the-art radar, to ensure the independent operation of civilian and military aircraft at safe distances. 'The Americans are very specific on safety issues and want to make some upgrades to further improve the base's safety,' the official said. Other essential upgrades include expanding both the base itself and the runway to accommodate more transport and fighter aircraft. Hardened shelters to protect those air assets are also envisioned. The Cyprus government agreed to the air base upgrade assessment following the recent deployment of a U.S. Marine contingent at the base. The Marines, who were equipped with V-22 Osprey tiltrotor military transport and cargo aircraft, were on stand-by in the event of a swift evacuation of US citizens from nearby Lebanon during Israel's strikes against Hezbollah targets late last year. Deputy government spokesman Yannis Antoniou told the state broadcaster Thursday that any use of the base by the forces of the U.S. or other nations would require prior Cyprus government approval. He insisted the air base would not act as a forward base for military strike operations against targets in the region. 'We've shown interest in working with (US. Forces) because we consider this to serve the vital interests of the Cyprus Republic,' Antoniou said, adding that in their report, the USAF experts will offer an estimate of the upgrade costs and which percentage of those the US government would be willing to cover. Bilateral relations between European Union member Cyprus and the U.S., especially in terms of military cooperation, have grown significantly over the last few years following a pledge by Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides to affirm the ethnically divided country's 'clear Western orientation.' A manifestation of those ties was last week's directive by former President Joe Biden that allows Cyprus to buy arms from the U.S. government and get surplus American military equipment. The Cypriot government noted the development as a tangible acknowledgment of Cyprus' reliability as a U.S. partner in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-air-force-looks-to-upgrade-cyprus-airbase-as-humanitarian-staging-post-for-the-middle-east/7948601.html	2025-01-23T21:09:23-08:00	
VOA Kurdish: Crackdown in Iran's Kurdistan: Arrests amid protests of death sentences	Several individuals in Sanaa, Saqiz and Sardasht, in Iran’s Kurdistan region, have been arrested for participating in strikes protesting the death sentences of Pakhshan Azizi and Varisha Moradi, two ethnic Kurdish women. The Kurdistan Human Rights Network (KHRN) reported the detention of six citizens in Sanaa, while three others were arrested in Saqiz and Sardasht by the Ministry of Intelligence. The strikes, organized by six Kurdish political parties, aimed to prevent the executions through peaceful civil action. In response, Iranian security forces threatened market representatives, sealed shops and took measures to suppress the protests.

Italy's highest court upholds slander conviction of Amanda Knox	Italy's highest court on Thursday upheld the slander conviction of American defendant Amanda Knox in a case related to the sensationalized 2007 murder of her British roommate. Knox was convicted of slandering her former boss, Congolese bar owner Patrick Lumumba, by falsely accusing him of murdering Meredith Kercher. A 21-year-old exchange student, Kercher was found stabbed to death in 2007 in the Perugia apartment she shared with Knox. While being interrogated, Knox, who was 20 at the time, signed two statements prepared by police regarding her accusation against Lumumba. Knox later wrote a handwritten note questioning her false accusation. Last year, an appeals court in Florence handed Knox a three-year sentence for wrongly accusing Lumumba. Knox, now 37 years old, had already served nearly four years during the investigation, initial murder trial and first appeal. She was convicted twice before Italy's highest court finally exonerated her of the crime in 2015. She is not at risk of any more jail time. Knox had appealed the slander conviction based on a European Court of Human Rights ruling that said her rights had been violated by police failure to provide a lawyer and adequate translator during a lengthy night of questioning just days after Kercher was killed. With the appeal, Knox was aiming to clear her name in Rome's Court of Cassation in the last remaining legal case against her following a nearly two-decades-long legal saga. But on Thursday, Judge Monica Boni confirmed the slander conviction. Knox, who did not attend the court, maintained her innocence in a post on X. 'It's a surreal day,' Knox said. 'I've just been found guilty yet again of a crime I didn't commit.' Knox's lawyer, Carlo Dalla Vedova, said he was surprised by the conviction. 'We cannot believe it. A totally unjust decision for Amanda and unexpected in our eyes,' he said. 'We are incredulous.' But Lumumba said he was satisfied with the verdict. 'Amanda was wrong. This verdict has to accompany her for the rest of her life,' he told The Associated Press. Rudy Guede, originally from the Ivory Coast, was eventually found guilty and sentenced to 16 years in prison for killing Kercher. He was released in 2021 after serving most of his sentence. He denied killing Kercher. Knox's lengthy legal saga was fodder for tabloids around the world and spawned books, movies and documentaries. Knox herself is currently producing a Hulu mini-series about her wrongful conviction and fight to clear her name. Social activist Monica Lewinsky is also producing the series. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-highest-court-upholds-slander-conviction-of-amanda-knox/7948531.html	2025-01-23T17:45:21-08:00

Multiple blazes continue in southern California	Firefighters in southern California continued to confront multiple blazes on Thursday amid high winds and dry conditions. The Hughes Fire in the mountains northwest of Los Angeles near Castaic Lake broke out Wednesday, prompting authorities to issue evacuation orders for more than 50,000 people. Health advisories for smoke and windblown dust and ash have been issued for areas near the Hughes Fire. 'Smoke and ash can harm everyone, even those who are healthy,' Dr. Muntu Davis, L.A. County’s health officer, said in a statement. The Laguna Fire in Ventura County resulted in evacuation orders for California State University Channel Islands and University Glen, but the orders were downgraded to warnings Thursday afternoon. The evacuation warning for the Sepulveda Fire near Interstate 405 late Wednesday was lifted after firefighters stopped the fire’s progress after it had burned through less than 1 square kilometer. The U.S. Storm Prediction Center said Thursday the 'very gusty' offshore Santa Ana winds will continue in southern California with gusts that could reach as high at 105 kph in some mountain ranges. The winds, combined with Southern California’s 'very low humidity and dry antecedent conditions,' prompted the center to continue a Critical Risk of Fire Weather alert for Thursday and an Elevated Fire Weather Outlook for Friday. Firefighters received help fighting the Hughes Fire with overnight aerial water drops from helicopters. The fire, northwest of Los Angeles, swelled to burn an area of more than 41 square kilometers near the Lake Castaic recreation area. The fire was about 14% contained early Thursday as forecasters warned of another day of dry and windy conditions that could make it difficult to keep fires from spreading. There is a chance for some relief in the coming days. The National Weather Service said some rain is expected in the area beginning Saturday. Forecasters expect up to a centimeter of rain across much of the Los Angeles area, while localized thunderstorms could bring even more rain in limited locations. The potential for those storms has prompted concerns about the possibility of mudslides, with debris flowing down hilly areas that have been scorched by several weeks of wildfires. In addition to the Hughes Fire, crews are still battling the Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in the foothills to the north of the city. The Palisades fire, at 95 square kilometers, is about 70% contained, while the Eaton, at 56 square kilometers, is about 95% contained, according to file officials. The fires that broke out in Southern California on Jan. 7 have killed at least 28 people and destroyed an estimated 16,000 buildings. The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes. U.S. President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the response to the fire, is expected to travel to Los Angeles on Friday. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/multiple-blazes-continue-in-southern-california/7948529.html	2025-01-23T17:08:31-08:00	
Trump orders release of last JFK, RFK, King assassination files	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump ordered the declassification Thursday of the last secret files on the assassination of the late U.S. President John F. Kennedy, a case that still fuels conspiracy theories more than 60 years after his death. Trump signed an executive order that will also release documents on the 1960s assassinations of JFK's younger brother, Robert F. Kennedy, and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. 'That's a big one, huh? A lot of people have been waiting for this for years, for decades,' Trump told reporters as he signed the order in the Oval Office of the White House. After signing the order, Trump passed the pen he used to an aide, saying, 'Give that to RFK Jr.,' JFK's nephew and the current president's nominee to become secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services. The order Trump signed requires the 'full and complete release' of the JFK files, without redactions that he accepted back in 2017 when releasing most of the documents. 'It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay,' the order said. Trump had previously promised to release the last of the files, most recently at his inauguration on Monday. The U.S. National Archives has released tens of thousands of records in recent years related to the November 22, 1963, assassination of President Kennedy but held thousands back, citing national security concerns. It said at the time of the latest large-scale release, in December 2022, that 97% of the Kennedy records — which total 5 million pages — had now been made public. The Warren Commission that investigated the shooting of the charismatic 46-year-old president determined that it was carried out by a former Marine sharpshooter, Lee Harvey Oswald, acting alone. But that formal conclusion has done little to quell speculation that a more sinister plot was behind Kennedy's murder in Dallas, Texas, and the slow release of the government files has added fuel to various conspiracy theories. A gesture to RFK Jr. Trump's move is partly a gesture to one of the most prominent backers of those conspiracies — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. himself. RFK Jr. said in 2023 there was 'overwhelming evidence the CIA was involved' in his uncle JFK's murder and 'very convincing' evidence the agency was also behind the 1968 assassination of his own father, Robert F. Kennedy. The former attorney general was killed while campaigning for the Democratic nomination for president. Sirhan Sirhan, a Palestinian-born Jordanian, was convicted of his murder. Thousands of John Kennedy assassination-related documents from the National Archives were released during Trump's first term in office, but he also held some back on national security grounds. Then-President Joe Biden said at the time of the December 2022 documents release that a 'limited' number of files would continue to be held back at the request of unspecified 'agencies.' Previous requests to withhold documents have come from the CIA and FBI. Kennedy scholars have said the documents still held by the archives are unlikely to contain any bombshell revelations or put to rest the rampant conspiracy theories about the assassination of the 35th U.S. president. Oswald, who had at one point defected to the Soviet Union, was shot to death two days after killing Kennedy by a nightclub owner, Jack Ruby, as he was being transferred from the city jail. Hundreds of books and movies such as the 1991 Oliver Stone film 'JFK' have fueled the conspiracy industry, pointing the finger at Cold War rivals Russia or Cuba, the Mafia and even Kennedy's vice president, Lyndon Johnson. King was assassinated in April 1968 in Memphis, Tennessee. James Earl Ray was convicted of the murder and died in prison in 1998, but King's children have expressed doubts in the past that Ray was the assassin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-orders-release-of-last-jfk-rfk-king-assassination-files/7948500.html	2025-01-23T16:58:39-08:00	
Fighting reaches outskirts of eastern Congo's largest city as rebels close in	GOMA, CONGO — Panic spread in eastern Congo's main city on Thursday, with M23 rebels steadily inching closer to Goma and seizing a nearby town as they battle the Congolese army. Bombs were heard going off in the city's distant outskirts, and hundreds of wounded civilians were brought in to the main hospital from the area of the fighting. The rebel group has been making significant advances in recent weeks, closing in on Goma, which is home to around 2 million people and a regional hub for security and humanitarian efforts. On Thursday, the rebels took Sake, a town only 27 kilometers (16 miles) from Goma and one of the last main routes into the provincial capital still under government control, according to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo, along the border with Rwanda, in a decades-long conflict that has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced by the fighting. Earlier this month, the M23 captured the towns of Minova, Katale and Masisi, west of Goma. 'The people of Goma have suffered greatly, like other Congolese,' an M23 spokesperson, Lawrence Kanyuka, said on X. 'M23 is on its way to liberate them, and they must prepare to welcome this liberation.' The M23 seized Goma in 2012 and controlled it for over a week. As news of the fighting spread, schools in Goma sent students home Thursday morning. 'We are told that the enemy wants to enter the city. That's why we are told to go home,' Hassan Kambale, a 19-year-old high school student, said. 'We are constantly waiting for the bombs.' Congo, the United States and U.N. experts accuse Rwanda of backing the M23, mainly composed of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army over a decade ago. Rwanda's government denies the claim but last year admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. On Wednesday, Congo's minister of communication, Patrick Muyaya, told French broadcaster France 24 that war with Rwanda is an 'option to consider.' Late Thursday, Guterres condemned, 'in the strongest terms, the renewed offensive launched by the 23 March Movement [M23],' including the 'seizure of Sake.' 'This offensive has a devastating toll on the civilian population and heightened the risk of a broader regional war,' Guterres' statement read. He also urged 'all parties to uphold human rights and international humanitarian law.' Earlier in the day, Congolese authorities claimed that the military pushed back an attack from the 'Rwandan army' on Sake. The Associated Press was unable to verify if Rwanda's army took part in the offensive. 'The population is in panic. The M23 now control large parts of the town,' said Leopold Mwisha, president of civil society of the area of Sake. Guterres said he was 'deeply troubled' by the most recent reports about the 'presence of Rwandan troops on Congolese soil and continued support to the M23.' The U.S. Embassy in Congo's capital, Kinshasa, in a notice Thursday warned of 'an increase in the severity of armed conflict near Sake' and advised U.S. nationals in North Kivu province, which includes Goma, to be on the alert in case they needed to leave their homes on short notice. The United Kingdom also issued a travel advisory that said M23 now controls Sake and urged British nationals to leave Goma while roads remained open. Many Sake residents have joined the more than 178,000 people who have fled the M23 advance in the last two weeks. The CBCA Ndosho hospital in Goma was stretched to the limit, with hundreds of newly wounded on Thursday. Thousands escaped the fighting by boat on Wednesday, making their way north across Lake Kivu and spilling out of packed wooden boats in Goma, some with bundles of their belongings strapped around their foreheads. Neema Matondo said she fled Sake during the night, when the first explosions started to go off. She recounted seeing people around her torn to pieces and killed. 'We escaped, but unfortunately,' others did not, Matondo told AP. Mariam Nasibu, who fled Sake with her three children, was in tears — one of her children lost a leg, blown off in the relentless shelling.

NUUK, GREENLAND — The mineral wealth on the Arctic island of Greenland is in the global spotlight after U.S. President Donald Trump said he wants to take control of the territory from Denmark, prompting alarm from European allies. Trump's words were echoed in a January 12 interview on 'Fox News Sunday' by Vice President JD Vance, who said, 'There is a deal to be made in Greenland,' and that the island has 'a lot of great natural resources.' Until now, Greenland's mining industry has struggled to turn a profit, but could that be about to change? 'Full of minerals' Greenland currently has only one active commercial mine — White Mountain —located north of the capital, Nuuk, and gets its stark, monochrome color from anorthosite rock, which is rich in calcium deposits and other minerals. The mine's operator, Lumina Sustainable Materials, ships the rock from Greenland's western coastline to Asia, Europe and North America, where it is used to make a variety of products such as fiberglass, paint, fillers, cement and polymers. Efforts are under way to exploit aluminum deposits within the anorthosite. 'Greenland is a country full of minerals. We have, literally, minerals available all over the place,' Bent Olsvig Jensen, Lumina's managing director in Greenland, told VOA in an interview. Dozens of other mining companies from around the world are conducting exploration and feasibility studies across Greenland, although White Mountain remains the only commercial operation currently trading. China competition The minerals include plentiful rare earth elements such as lithium and scandium, which are critical for devices such as batteries. Global supply chains for those elements are currently dominated by China. Trump has repeatedly said that U.S. control of Greenland is necessary for 'international security.' His comments caused a political storm in Greenland and Denmark, but mining companies see an opportunity. 'His interest in Greenland can actually help the industry get access to further investment, which is needed for the industry to develop in Greenland,' Jensen said. 'So, yes, I definitely welcome it. And I think it's important that both from the industry side but also from the political side in Greenland that we position ourselves towards Trump and the U.S.' 'Not for sale' Greenland's government is largely autonomous, although Denmark is responsible for the island's security. Naaja Nathanielsen, Greenland's minister for resources, emphasized the government's long-held response to Trump's interest: Open for business, but not for sale. 'We do want American investments. We do want collaboration with the U.S. State Department, and we've been trying to advocate for that for some time,' she told VOA. Greenland signed a deal with Trump during his first administration in 2019 to boost the mining industry. 'The U.S. funded our direct marketing towards investors all over the world, and this agreement has just come to its end. So we've been trying to … get engagement from the U.S. for some time now in order to renew this deal,' Nathanielsen said. Challenges Despite widespread recognition of Greenland's mineral wealth, attracting investment in mining has been a long-term problem. 'For many years now, we have seen that there has been some hesitance in the investor environment to engage in high-risk, long-term projects. We only have one American-owned license at the moment. In comparison, we have 23 from Canada, 23 from the U.K. and about 10 from Denmark. So, it's not an area where you see a lot of U.S. engagement as of now. Of course we welcome it, and there's plenty of opportunity,' Nathanielsen said. Greenland's government is pushing for full independence from Denmark. Supporters hope the island's mineral wealth could one day provide the economic foundation for full statehood. But there's a long way to go, said Ulrik Pram Gad, an analyst at the Danish Institute for International Studies in Copenhagen. 'If you want minerals out of the ground and financing Greenlandic self-sufficiency economically, then you will need to have the uptake in the international processing going,' Gad told VOA. 'And then, probably you'll have to think very closely about how to make sure that these mining projects benefit people who live close to them, rather than being a new version of imperialist extraction. Because then, the Greenlanders might not want it in the end,' he explained. The risk doesn't always end in reward. Rubies and pink sapphires were extracted at the Aappaluttoq mine until 2023, when its operator, Greenland Ruby, went bankrupt, $71 million in debt. The company is restructuring and seeking new investors, with a goal of restarting operations. Greenland's 2.1 million square kilometers of land is icebound for much of the year. 'Obviously, we are in the middle of the Arctic, so there are some logistical challenges,' Jensen of Lumina said. 'Not all of Greenland is open all year round. However, that is something that we can plan our way out of.' Jensen added that investors must have patience to make a profit. 'It takes time to develop a project from the early-stage exploration until you actually have a mine where you can extract and start selling. And as we all say in mining, 'Time is money.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/will-trump-spark-a-mineral-gold-rush-in-greenland-/7948233.html	2025-01-23T16:29:02-08:00

Trump signs executive orders on AI, cryptocurrency and issues more pardons	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday signed an executive order related to AI to 'make America the world capital in artificial intelligence,' his aide told reporters in the White House's Oval Office. The order sets a 180-day deadline for an Artificial Intelligence Action Plan to create a policy 'to sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance in order to promote human flourishing, economic competitiveness, and national security.' Trump also told his AI adviser and national security assistant to work to remove policies and regulations put in place by former President Joe Biden. Trump on Monday revoked a 2023 executive order signed by Biden that sought to reduce the risks that artificial intelligence poses to consumers, workers and national security. Biden's order required developers of AI systems that pose risks to U.S. national security, the economy, public health or safety to share the results of safety tests with the U.S. government, in line with the Defense Production Act, before they were released to the public. Trump also signed an executive order creating a cryptocurrency working group tasked with proposing a new regulatory framework for digital assets and exploring the creation of a cryptocurrency stockpile. The much-anticipated action also ordered that banking services for crypto companies be protected, and banned the creation of central bank digital currencies that could compete with existing cryptocurrencies. The order sees Trump fulfill a campaign trail pledge to be a 'crypto president and promote the adoption of digital assets.' That is in stark contrast to Biden's regulators that, in a bid to protect Americans from fraud and money laundering, cracked down on crypto companies, suing exchanges Coinbase, Binance, Kraken and dozens more in federal court, alleging they were flouting U.S. laws. The working group will be made up of the Treasury secretary, attorney general and chairs of the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodity Futures Trading Commission, along with other agency heads. The group is tasked with developing a regulatory framework for digital assets, including stablecoins, a type of cryptocurrency typically pegged to the U.S. dollar. The group is also set to 'evaluate the potential creation and maintenance of a national digital asset stockpile ... potentially derived from cryptocurrencies lawfully seized by the Federal Government through its law enforcement efforts.' In December, Trump named venture capitalist and former PayPal executive David Sacks as the crypto and artificial intelligence czar. He will chair the group, the order said. Finally, Trump signed pardons for 23 anti-abortion protesters on Thursday in the Oval Office of the White House. The pardons came a day before anti-abortion protesters were due to descend on Washington for the annual March for Life.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-signs-executive-orders-on-ai-cryptocurrency-issues-more-pardons-/7948209.html	2025-01-23T15:08:40-08:00

Kidnapped Israeli Russian researcher alive; Baghdad working on release	WASHINGTON — Iraqi officials said that an Israeli Russian researcher, who was kidnapped by an Iraqi militia nearly two years ago, is alive, and that they are working to secure her release. Iraqi Foreign Minister Fuad Hussein on Thursday told an Axios reporter in Davos, Switzerland, that Elizabeth Tsurkov, a Princeton doctoral candidate, is alive and that Iraqi Prime Minister Mohammed al-Sudani was working on her release, according to Reuters. Tsurkov, 39, was abducted in Baghdad in March 2023 shortly after her arrival in the Iraqi capital. The dual Israeli Russian citizen had traveled to Iraq to conduct fieldwork for her dissertation. Israeli citizens are forbidden from traveling to Iraq, but Tsurkov used her Russian passport to enter the country, according to the Israeli government. The Israeli government said in July 2023 that Tsurkov was being held by Kataib Hezbollah, a powerful Shia militia that has ties to the Iraqi government and Iran. In November 2023, Kataib Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, released a proof-of-life video of Tsurkov, the only confirmed evidence of her fate to date. Her sister, Emma Tsurkov, said the family was 'pleased to see the Iraqi government acknowledge what we already know: Elizabeth is alive and being held hostage in Iraq by militias aligned with the Iraqi prime minister. 'At the same time, we are fed up with empty promises from the Iraqi government to get her released with no real follow-through,' she told VOA. Last year, Emma Tsurkov and two other siblings launched an extensive campaign in Washington during an official visit by Sudani. During a panel discussion hosted by the Atlantic Council, Emma Tsurkov interrupted the Iraqi leader, protesting Baghdad’s inaction in securing her sister’s release. In response, Sudani stated that his government had formed a task force to follow up with Tsurkov’s case. The U.S. State Department had confirmed that Tsurkov’s case was raised by former President Joe Biden during his White House meeting with Sudani. Emma Tsurkov said the family 'knows that Elizabeth’s case is already on the radar of the new SPEHA,' referring to Adam Boehler, President Donald Trump’s nominee for special presidential envoy for hostage affairs. Boehler must be confirmed by the U.S. Senate before he can formally begin his role. 'We are confident the Trump team will hold the Iraqi government accountable and make Elizabeth’s safe return a real priority and not just a talking point like the last administration,' Emma Tsurkov said. VOA contacted the State Department for comment but did not receive a response in time for publication. This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kidnapped-israeli-russian-researcher-alive-baghdad-working-on-release/7948151.html	2025-01-23T14:18:43-08:00	
Elon Musk and the legacy of moguls in American politics	Business has been intertwined with American politics since before the nation’s founding. And although unelected business leaders play a major role in financing campaigns and policy initiatives, few in recent memory have taken as personal and public a role in politics as Elon Musk. Even before the 2024 election, the South African-born entrepreneur often interacted with the U.S. government via his companies. His electric car manufacturer, Tesla, has received green energy subsidies, while his company Space X holds multiple contracts with NASA and the U.S. military to provide space-launch services, develop vehicles and operate flights. Through SpaceX, Musk also played a key role in U.S. support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia’s invasion by providing Starlink satellite internet terminals to Ukrainian forces. Musk’s involvement in the war became a source of concern after reports emerged that he was directly making decisions regarding the terminals’ use in the field and was in personal contact with Russian President Vladimir Putin and other top Russian officials. Musk attained an even more notable role in the media through his 2022 purchase of social media platform Twitter, which had become a de facto public square where journalists, companies and government officials made public announcements and engaged in discussion alongside regular users. Renaming the site X, Musk overhauled verification and content moderation policies to combat what he described as left-wing bias, reinstating President Donald Trump’s account as well as multiple accounts that had been banned for hate speech. As the presidential election drew near, Musk used the platform to boost Trump’s policy positions, eventually making campaign appearances alongside him and sitting in on his calls with foreign leaders. Musk’s involvement culminated in the businessman being announced as head of a new advisory commission on government efficiency, named after an internet meme and cryptocurrency that Musk himself had popularized. But while Musk’s involvement in U.S. politics may be unusual compared to his contemporaries, it recalls earlier eras when larger-than-life business leaders exercised great influence over the country’s affairs. J.P. Morgan (1837-1913) Having made his early career on Wall Street, John Pierpont Morgan gained fame by reorganizing the country’s booming railroad industry in the wake of the Civil War. By organizing conferences among railroad companies and consolidating the ones he held shares in, he helped create an integrated rail system, as he would later do with the nation’s steel production. When the economic panic of 1893 saw the U.S. running out of gold reserves, Morgan’s company stepped in to bail out the government, supplying gold in exchange for Treasury bonds. Then in 1907, when a financial panic threatened to collapse the nation’s banks, Morgan was again credited with saving the country by bringing together bank executives and forcing them to agree on a mutual stabilization plan. Morgan is remembered as a serious businessman who prioritized stability over speculation and supported hospitals, museums and universities through his philanthropic efforts. But Morgan’s integration of railroad and steel industries created monopolies that inspired the nation’s earliest antitrust laws. Moreover, the fact that the U.S. government twice had to rely on a private businessman to bail out its finances became a major cause for concern, leading to the creation of the Federal Reserve. Henry Ford (1863-1947) Henry Ford is best known for developing the first mass-produced automobile, making what was previously a luxury product affordable for the average consumer. Beyond the road, Ford popularized the assembly line and the 40-hour workweek as well as setting higher wage standards under the reasoning that better-paid and happier workers would be more productive and able to buy the cars they made. Ford believed that industry and consumerism would not only benefit the economy but promote world peace, actively campaigning against war as a waste of productivity. Having failed to prevent U.S. entry into World War I, Ford dutifully supplied the war effort and quieted his activism, but he still ran for U.S. Senate in 1918 — a race he narrowly lost. Yet not all aspects of Ford’s reputation have aged well. The tycoon’s paternalistic and generous approach to his employees went hand-in-hand with his adamant opposition to unionization efforts and worker strikes, which were suppressed by force. His pacifism had a darker side as well. Ford was notably antisemitic and believed that Jewish people had been responsible for World War I as well as multiple ills in American society. After buying the Dearborn Independent newspaper in 1918, Ford used it to publish multiple antisemitic conspiracy theories, stopping only after threats of a boycott against his companies. As part of the America First Committee, Ford campaigned against U.S. entry into World War II and continued to do business with Nazi Germany up until the U.S. declared war in 1941. William Randolph Hearst (1863-1951) As owner of the San Francisco Examiner and the New York Morning Journal, Hearst built a media empire while pioneering a form of sensationalistic reporting that came to be known as 'yellow journalism.' The Journal’s exaggerated reports of Spain’s colonial violence in Cuba inflamed American opinion and increased calls to intervene. When Congress eventually declared war on Spain in 1898, Hearst personally traveled to Cuba to cover the conflict. Hearst’s media operations would later expand to more than two dozen newspapers in multiple cities, as well as magazines and book publishers. After setting his sights on politics, Hearst briefly served in the U.S. House of Representatives for New York’s 11th district but narrowly lost subsequent mayoral and gubernatorial bids. Hearst’s papers had published editorials violently denouncing President William McKinley, and he was blamed for incitement upon McKinley’s assassination in 1901. Initially a progressive populist, Hearst shifted toward right-wing isolationism in the wake of World War I and the 1917 Russian Revolution. While denouncing President Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal policies as anti-American, Hearst expressed admiration for Hitler and published articles by the German leader. Nevertheless, Hearst supported U.S. entry into World War II following the attack on Pearl Harbor, shifting his focus to promoting anti-Asian sentiment and the internment of Japanese Americans. Today, Hearst is remembered as the real-life inspiration for the film 'Citizen Kane,' which was made during his lifetime and which he sought to block from being released. Conclusion Tycoons who shaped American politics in past eras inspired admiration and controversy, their impact becoming clear only in hindsight. It remains to be seen whether Musk’s influence will outlast the Trump administration, and whether other modern-day moguls will follow his example.	https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-and-the-legacy-of-moguls-in-american-politics/7948108.html	2025-01-23T13:35:08-08:00	
Senate confirms Trump’s choice for CIA director	washington — U.S. lawmakers confirmed a key member of President Donald Trump’s national security team Thursday, voting 74-25 to make John Ratcliffe director of the country’s premier spy agency. The vote came three days after Trump took the oath of office as the 47th president of the United States and three days after a plea from the top Republican and Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee for a speedy vote on Ratcliffe’s nomination to lead the CIA. 'Our world is far too dangerous for any delay in having a Senate-confirmed leader in charge of the CIA,' Senators Tom Cotton and Mark Warner said in a statement Monday, after their committee advanced Ratcliffe by a 14-3 margin. Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence during Trump’s first term in office, earned praise from Republican lawmakers following his confirmation hearing last week. 'Under the Biden administration, the intelligence community made some notable misses,' Senate Majority Leader John Thune, a Republican, told fellow lawmakers Tuesday, citing failures to anticipate the rapid collapse of the U.S.-supported Afghan government in 2021 and the incorrect predictions that Russian forces would quickly overrun Ukrainian defenses at the start of the Kremlin’s invasion. 'Mr. Ratcliffe brings the right experience and the right approach to the CIA,' he said. 'The nation needs a strong, capable and aggressive CIA,' Cotton, the Senate Intelligence Committee chairman, told Ratcliffe at his confirmation hearing last week. 'I believe the men and women you will lead want to serve in just that kind of agency. They joined the CIA, after all, not a church choir or a therapy session,' he added. But the confirmation vote was delayed after criticism from some leading Democrats. 'I want the record to show that I strongly oppose the nomination,' Democrat Ron Wyden said Tuesday. 'In 2020, I opposed his confirmation to be director of national intelligence because I believe his partisanship and willingness essentially went to the proposition of doing what would please Donald Trump,' he said. 'Unfortunately, his actions as head of national intelligence only confirmed my concerns.' Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer echoed that opposition before Thursday’s vote. 'I will respectfully vote no, not because of our political difference, which of course exists, but because I am deeply worried that Mr. Ratcliffe will be unable to stand up to people like Donald Trump and Tulsi Gabbard, who are known to falsify intelligence,' he said. 'There may be no agency more important than the CIA that has to be fact-based. Sometimes, these facts will lead to inconvenient conclusions for his superiors and the president,' he said. 'It’s in those cases where truth, not fiction, not ideology, must prevail, and I have my doubts that Mr. Ratcliffe will be able to hold firm.' Gabbard, a veteran of the U.S. Army National Guard and a former Democratic lawmaker, is Trump’s choice to be the next director of national intelligence. Her confirmation hearing has been scheduled for next week, when she will be asked about accusations from both Democrats and some Republicans that she has repeated Russian disinformation and about her 2017 meeting with former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who stands accused of war crimes. Ratcliffe’s opponents have accused him of defying Congress and withholding information in the 2018 murder of Washington Post journalist Jamal Khashoggi – a killing that U.S. intelligence concluded was ordered by Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. They also have criticized Ratcliffe, in his role as director of national intelligence, for the September 2020 release of a Russian intelligence assessment that seemed to back Trump’s allegations of nefarious activity by his opponent in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Democrat Hillary Clinton. But that decision, and others by Ratcliffe to push back against previous U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia had endeavored to help Trump win the 2016 election, is part of what endeared him to the president. Ratcliffe indicated during his confirmation hearing that substantial changes would be in store for the CIA, saying it needed to be more aggressive both in collecting human intelligence and in countering U.S. adversaries. 'We will collect intelligence, especially human intelligence, in every corner of the globe no matter how dark or difficult,' he told lawmakers at the time. 'We will conduct covert actions at the direction of the president, going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do. 'To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,' Ratcliffe added. 'If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.' That mantra, according to some analysts, has resonated with both Republicans and Democrats. 'There was criticism throughout the hearing that the CIA has gone soft on collecting human intelligence, on stealing foreign adversary secrets,' Tyler McBrien, the managing editor of Lawfare, told VOA. 'A lot of criticisms about how the CIA has failed to predict in the past four years major geopolitical events, including the fall of the Assad regime and even the New Orleans terrorist attack. 'Ratcliffe really is focused on that human intelligence aspect and also a reorientation toward what he sees as the biggest national security threat, which is China,' McBrien said. Ratcliffe has promised lawmakers that under his leadership the CIA will deliver insights free of political bias and that he will not lead a purge of employees based on their perceived political views or perceived loyalty to Trump. He also promised to reinvigorate CIA investigations into the cause of Havana Syndrome — the name given to a series of brain injuries and other serious health ailments that have struck hundreds of U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials. And he voiced support for maintaining controversial U.S. surveillance authorities under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, calling it an indispensable tool.

Trump promises global businesses lower taxes for products made in US, tariffs if not	U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday invited global businesses to manufacture their products in the U.S. and promised them lower taxes but warned if they choose to produce their goods elsewhere, they would have to pay tariffs to export them to the United States. 'America is back and open for business,' Trump, in a video linkup from Washington, told corporate leaders meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. 'My message to every business in the world is very simple: Come make your product in America, and we will give you among the lowest taxes of any nation on Earth,' Trump said. 'But if you don't make your product in America, which is your prerogative, then, very simply, you will have to pay a tariff.' Trump, three days into his second term in the White House, said he wants to cut the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21 to 15%, although that needs approval from his political allies in the Republican-controlled Congress. Lawmakers have begun debating how to extend and reshape personal and corporate tax cuts enacted in 2017 during Trump's first term in office. Trump promised the U.S. would supply Europe with the liquified natural gas it needs but contended that the European Union treats the United States 'very, very unfairly' with the extent of regulations it imposes on American businesses operating in the 27-nation bloc. The president complained specifically about tariffs and environmental impact statements for new construction projects, calling them 'things you shouldn't have to do.' Trump promised that his administration would make the U.S., already the world's biggest economy, 'a manufacturing superpower' and said the government during his four-year term would eliminate 10 business regulations for every new one that is imposed. He said he plans to ask Saudi Arabia and the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries to cut the price of oil they produce to boost the global economy. He contended that if the current global oil price — about $77 a barrel — is cut, 'the war in Ukraine will end immediately.' Russia uses revenue from its own oil production to help fund its three-year war on neighboring Ukraine. Trump said that in the global economy, the U.S. 'just wants to be treated fairly by other countries.' He said the U.S. wants to have a 'fair relationship' with China, the world's second-biggest economy. 'We don't want to take advantage,' he said of Washington-Beijing relations. 'We just want to have a level playing field.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-promises-global-businesses-lower-taxes-for-products-made-in-us-tariffs-if-not/7947988.html	2025-01-23T12:37:27-08:00

US lawmakers seek to end China's special trade status, import exemption	WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers introduced a bipartisan bill on Thursday that would revoke China's preferential trade status with the United States, phase in steep tariffs and end the 'de minimis' exemption for low-value Chinese imports. The bill, introduced by John Moolenaar, the Republican chair of the House of Representatives select committee on China, comes after President Donald Trump issued a memo on Monday asking his cabinet to assess legislation on the Permanent Normal Trade Relations designation for Beijing. Congress approved PNTR for China in 2000, paving the way for its entry into the World Trade Organization. But the U.S. has routinely found the large role of the state in China's economy, including hefty government subsidies for strategic industries, to violate the global trade body's rules. Trump, who has railed against China's vast trade surplus with the U.S., has vowed more duties on Chinese goods. Moolenaar's Restoring Trade Fairness Act was co-sponsored by Democratic Representative Tom Suozzi and introduced with a companion bill in the Senate. Moolenaar said granting China PNTR had ushered in waves of Chinese imports, depleted U.S. manufacturing and made the U.S. susceptible to economic coercion from its 'foremost adversary.' 'This gamble failed,' Moolenaar said in a statement. 'This legislation will safeguard U.S. national security, enhance supply chain resilience, and bring manufacturing jobs back to America and our allies.' China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The path for the bill to become law was not immediately clear, but Republicans hold majorities in both the House and Senate. Lawmakers from both parties say they want to increase U.S. companies' ability to compete with China. Waves of U.S. tariffs by Trump in his first term and by the Biden administration had effectively ended PNTR treatment for China. Nonetheless, the proposed legislation would end annual recertification of the designation and codify minimum 35% tariffs for non-strategic goods and minimum 100% tariffs for strategic goods. The duties would be phased in over five years — 10% in the first year, 25% in the second year, 50% in year four and 100% by year five. The bill would also end de minimis treatment for certain 'covered nations,' including China. Trump has called for changes to the $800 de minimis duty-free exemption for low-value shipments often blamed for illicit imports of fentanyl precursor chemicals from China. Critics of de minimis say it contributes to the United States' trade deficit with China — $279 billion in 2023, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-seek-to-end-china-s-special-trade-status-import-exemption/7947991.html	2025-01-23T11:59:41-08:00	
US judge temporarily blocks Trump's order ending birthright citizenship	SEATTLE, WASHINGTON — A U.S. federal judge on Thursday temporarily blocked President Donald Trump's executive order redefining birthright citizenship, calling it 'blatantly unconstitutional' during the first hearing in a multistate effort challenging the order. The temporary restraining order sought by Arizona, Illinois, Oregon and Washington was the first to get a hearing before a judge and applies nationally. The case is one of five lawsuits being brought by 22 states and several immigrant rights groups across the country. The suits include personal testimonies from attorneys general who are U.S. citizens by birthright and name pregnant women who are afraid their children won't become U.S. citizens. U.S. District Judge John Coughenour, a Ronald Reagan appointee, began the hearing by grilling the administration's attorneys, saying the order 'boggles the mind.' 'This is a blatantly unconstitutional order,' Coughenour told Brett Shumate, a Justice Department lawyer. Coughenour said he's been on the bench for more than four decades and couldn't remember seeing another case where the action challenged was so clearly unconstitutional. Shumate said he respectfully disagreed and asked the judge for an opportunity to have a full briefing on the merits of the case, rather than the judge issuing a 14-day restraining order blocking its implementation. Trump's executive order, which he signed on Inauguration Day, is slated to take effect on Feb. 19. It could affect hundreds of thousands of people born in the country, according to one of the lawsuits. In 2022, there were about 255,000 births of citizen children to mothers living in the country illegally and about 153,000 births to two such parents, according to the four-state suit filed in Seattle. The Trump administration argued in papers filed Wednesday that the states don't have grounds to bring a suit against the order and that no damage has yet been done, so temporary relief isn't called for. The administration's attorneys also clarified that the executive order only applies to people born after Feb. 19, when it is to take effect. The U.S. is among about 30 countries where birthright citizenship — the principle of jus soli or 'right of the soil' — is applied. Most are in the Americas; Canada and Mexico are among them. The lawsuits argue that the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship for people born and naturalized in the U.S., and states have been interpreting the amendment that way for a century. Ratified in 1868 in the aftermath of the Civil War, the amendment says: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' Trump's order asserts that the children of noncitizens are not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States and orders federal agencies to not recognize citizenship for children who don't have at least one parent who is a citizen. A key case involving birthright citizenship unfolded in 1898. The Supreme Court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was a U.S. citizen because he was born in the country. But some advocates of immigration restrictions have argued that the case clearly applied to children born to parents who were both legal immigrants. They say it's less clear whether it applies to children born to parents living in the country illegally. Trump's order prompted attorneys general to share their personal connections to birthright citizenship. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, for instance, a U.S. citizen by birthright and the nation's first Chinese American elected attorney general, said the lawsuit was personal for him. 'There is no legitimate legal debate on this question. But the fact that Trump is dead wrong will not prevent him from inflicting serious harm right now on American families like my own,' Tong said this week. One of the lawsuits aimed at blocking the executive order includes the case of a pregnant woman, identified as 'Carmen,' who is not a citizen but has lived in the United States for more than 15 years and has a pending visa application that could lead to permanent residency status. 'Stripping children of the 'priceless treasure' of citizenship is a grave injury,' the suit says. 'It denies them the full membership in U.S. society to which they are entitled.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-judge-temporarily-blocks-trump-s-order-ending-birthright-citizenship/7947939.html	2025-01-23T11:48:53-08:00

UK teenager jailed for at least 52 years for girls' murders	LONDON — A British teenager who murdered three young girls at a Taylor Swift-themed dance event was jailed for at least 52 years on Thursday, for an atrocity prosecutors said was so violent it appeared he had tried to decapitate one of the victims. On Monday, Axel Rudakubana, 18, admitted carrying out the killings last July in the northern English town of Southport, a crime which was followed by days of nationwide rioting. Rudakubana will likely spend the rest of his life in jail for the murders of Bebe King, 6, Elsie Dot Stancombe, 7, and Alice Dasilva Aguiar, 9, who were among 26 children attending the summer vacation event. He also pleaded guilty to 10 charges of attempted murder, as well as to producing the deadly poison ricin and possessing an al-Qaida training manual. Two of his victims suffered 'horrific injuries which ... are difficult to explain as anything other than sadistic in nature,' prosecutor Deanna Heer told Liverpool Crown Court. Judge Julian Goose described Rudakubana's actions as 'evil,' saying: 'I am sure that Rudakubana had a settled and determined intention to carry out these offenses and that, had he been able to, he would have killed each and every child, all 26 of them, as well as any adults who got in his way.' The judge sentenced Rudakubana in his absence after he refused to return to court, having twice been removed for interrupting the hearing. Goose said he was not allowed by law to impose a life sentence without the possibility of parole as Rudakubana was 17 at the time of his crimes, but added: 'It is likely that he will never be released and that he will be in custody for all his life.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-teenager-jailed-for-at-least-52-years-for-girls-murders/7947723.html	2025-01-23T09:06:36-08:00	
Rubio heads to Central America amid Trump's push to reclaim Panama Canal	U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio is scheduled to visit Panama and other countries in Central America amid President Donald Trump’s push to reclaim the Panama Canal and Washington’s efforts to curb illegal migration. The trip is expected to mark Rubio’s first foreign visit as secretary of state. U.S. news outlet Politico reported that Rubio’s itinerary includes stops in Panama, Guatemala, El Salvador, Costa Rica and the Dominican Republic. A State Department spokesperson told VOA, 'We don’t have any travel to announce at this time.' President Trump has said he has not ruled out the possibility of either military or economic measures to achieve his stated goal of bringing the Panama Canal back under U.S. control. Earlier this week, Rubio outlined his foreign policy priorities, including halting the mass entry of undocumented migrants into the United States. 'The State Department will no longer undertake any activities that facilitate or encourage mass migration,' Rubio said in a statement. 'Our diplomatic relations with other countries, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, will prioritize securing America’s borders, stopping illegal and destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal immigrants' to their home countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-heads-to-central-america-amid-trump-s-push-to-reclaim-panama-canal/7947641.html	2025-01-23T08:32:29-08:00	
Vietnam's media restructuring will lead to more propaganda, critics warn	HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM — Critics warn that Vietnam's ongoing push to restructure the country's media will allow authorities to have tighter control over news outlets and more effectively spread propaganda. The media restructuring started in 2019 when former Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc signed the 'National Press Development and Management Planning until 2025' policy. According to the plan, 180 press organizations will be shut down, and 8,000 reporters and editors will lose their jobs. Phil Robertson, director of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates, told VOA the media restructuring has become more severe under General Secretary To Lam, who took over as leader of the Communist Party after the July 2024 death of his predecessor, Nguyen Phu Trong. 'There's little doubt that this so-called ‘reform’ will result in the Vietnamese people getting even less real news,' Robertson wrote in an email. 'This is precisely the path one expects an authoritarian like To Lam to take, doubling down on government control of what the people hear and see.' To Lam’s broader ambitions for government reform include consolidating 14 ministries into seven. Under the government’s plan, dubbed Resolution 18, each ministry will be allowed to have one official news publication, further cutting the number of news outlets in the country. The move could cut the number of news outlets in half, some analysts say. The government plans to concentrate resources into six national media conglomerates. The six outlets include Nhan Dan — the newspaper of the Communist Party — as well as the outlets of the Defense Ministry and Public Security Ministry. Vietnam Television will become the sole national television channel, absorbing smaller broadcasters. On Jan. 15, broadcasts for 13 channels operating under Vietnam Multimedia Corporation, or VTC, ended, along with Voice of Vietnam TV and Nhan Dan TV. VTC was the country’s second-most-popular television broadcaster and had been operating for 20 years. One 21-year-old journalism student was working as an intern at VTC in Hanoi when it shut down at midnight on Jan. 15. He said all the staff gathered on the first floor and had a countdown until all the TV monitors were turned off. Afterwards, they had fireworks. He said approximately 1,000 VTC employees lost their jobs that night. 'Everyone was crying,' he said, asking to be referred to as Justin. 'After 20 years working at the station, doing a lot of collaboration, doing a lot of programs, doing a lot of special news, they have been kicked out for no reason. That's how they are feeling.' A regular VTC viewer in northern Vietnam who described herself as a housewife said it's painful to see the broadcast shuttered. 'Honestly, I don't want any channel to close,' she wrote on Facebook in Vietnamese. 'I consider those channels as family members. Losing a channel is like losing a person.' 'Bitter medicine' On Dec. 1, To Lam spoke during a national conference on the implementation of Resolution 18. He stated the restructuring is designed to streamline the political system and remove institutional bottlenecks. 'This is really a difficult issue,' To Lam said. 'It will involve thoughts, feelings, aspirations and affect the interests of a number of individuals and organizations. 'The implementation in many units will certainly encounter difficulties,' the General Secretary said. 'However, we still have to proceed because to have a healthy body, sometimes we have to ‘take bitter medicine.’' Trinh Huu Long, a democracy advocate and co-founder of the Taiwan-based nonprofit Legal Initiatives for Vietnam, said the government is rushing to finalize its media restructuring and the consolidation of government ministries. 'Everyone is working around the clock,' he said. 'They're planning to finish everything in March, when the Congress will hold a special session to rubber stamp this massive restructure.' Nguyen Hong Hai, a senior lecturer at Hanoi's VinUniversity, told VOA that while working in the public sector, he saw the need for reform firsthand. 'There's the fact that there are a lot of employees who are not working, in the real sense, and there's a lot of waste,' he said. 'Every society needs reforms. But the thing is, how to do it effectively?' Justin, the journalism student in Hanoi, supports the government reforms although he said change is happening 'too fast' and without new opportunities for those who lost their livelihoods. That includes his uncle, who worked for VTC for some 20 years. 'We have cried, but we still 100% agree with what the government decided,' he said. 'We just want to comment, ‘Please, if you want to kick me out, give me a new job.’ … Do not change so rapidly so that people will be shocked, like right now, kicked out from the job and with no other proposal for the future.' Pushing propaganda Long said that as Hanoi focuses its resources into six national media conglomerates, authorities will have more power to push Hanoi's agenda. 'The government will invest in a small number of state agencies to make them a lot more effective in propaganda,' Long said. 'The number one function of every state-media outlet is to promote and defend the [Communist] Party. Serving readers is secondary.' In a November 2024 report, Legal Initiatives for Vietnam stated that there are currently 17 independent journalists behind bars in the country, all of whom were jailed within the last five years. While all media outlets in Vietnam undergo government censorship, some outlets are funded by private corporations, although they must receive their licenses from government ministries. Long said these semi-privatized outlets, which have been the most professionalized and provided news which has not entirely aligned with Hanoi and government policy, are being pushed out. 'The quality is going to go south very, very quickly,' he said. Long gave the example of Zing News. In July 2023 the news site was suspended for three months after it was investigated by the Ministry of Information and Communications. The outlet came back after the suspension but was rebranded as Z News and the quality and frequency of its content was greatly downgraded, effectively making the outlet 'irrelevant,' Long said. He said that the outlet was punished for writing articles about Russia's war on Ukraine that created 'pro-Ukraine sentiment among the Vietnamese public.' 'They published a lot of articles about the Ukraine war that fell out of the [Communist] Party's line, which is always to be pro-Russia,' Long said. A researcher of Vietnamese media, who asked to remain anonymous due to safety concerns, told VOA that the digitizing of national media allows it to 'masquerade' propaganda as news. 'I think it's very depressing. … It's going to be uniform news, and it's going to be only from the government's point of view,' the researcher said. 'There's going to be fewer and fewer people dedicated to work as journalists and seeking out the news that matters to the Vietnamese people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-media-restructuring-will-lead-to-more-propaganda-critics-warn/7947621.html	2025-01-23T08:26:04-08:00	
ICC seeks arrest warrants for top Taliban leaders in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — The chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court announced Thursday that he is seeking arrest warrants for high-ranking Taliban leaders in Afghanistan accused of crimes against humanity, citing widespread discrimination against the country’s female population. Karim Khan identified the suspects as the Taliban supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, and his chief justice, Abdul Hakim Haqqani, saying his action is based on a thorough investigation and evidence collected in the process. 'My Office has concluded that these two Afghan nationals are criminally responsible for persecuting Afghan girls and women … and persons whom the Taliban perceived as allies of girls and women,' Khan stated. He noted that the persecution has been ongoing since August 2021, when the Taliban regained control of Afghanistan and imposed their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. Khan said, without elaborating, that his office would soon file additional applications seeking arrests of other senior Taliban members. ICC judges are now required to review the applications before deciding whether to issue an arrest warrant for Akhundzada and Haqqani. Experts anticipate the process could take weeks or even months. 'These applications recognize that Afghan women and girls, as well as the LGBTQI+ community, are facing an unprecedented, unconscionable, and ongoing persecution by the Taliban,' Khan stated. 'Our action signals that the status quo for women and girls in Afghanistan is not acceptable. Afghan survivors, in particular women and girls, deserve accountability before a court of law,' added the chief prosecutor. The Hague-based ICC is mandated to rule on the world’s worst offenses, such as war crimes and crimes against humanity. The court has no police force and relies on its 125 member states to execute its arrest warrants. Taliban officials did not immediately offer any response to the ICC announcement. Akhundzada, who governs the country from the southern city of Kandahar, has issued numerous edicts over the past three-and-a-half years, imposing extensive restrictions on Afghan women and girls that the United Nations has condemned as 'gender apartheid.' Girls are banned from pursuing education beyond the sixth grade, including attending institutions that train midwives and nurses. Most women are prohibited from working in both the public and private sectors. They are blocked from visiting public parks, gyms, and baths. The Taliban have mandated that females cover their faces in public and that they cannot travel long distances without a male guardian — making Afghanistan the only country in the world to impose such bans on women and girls. The U.N. and global rights groups have condemned the bans and demanded the Taliban reverse their restrictions on women, saying they are a key sticking point in the Afghan authorities’ pursuit of official recognition for their government in Kabul. The Taliban have vehemently defended their governance, asserting that their policies align with Sharia and Afghan culture. Taliban leaders say all Afghan citizens’ rights are provided for under Islamic law.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-seeks-arrest-warrants-for-top-taliban-leaders-in-afghanistan/7947612.html	2025-01-23T07:57:11-08:00

Same-sex marriages in Thailand now legal	Bangkok — Hundreds of LGBTQ+ couples married in Thailand Thursday as the kingdom became the third place in Asia to legalize same-sex unions. The decision carries serious economic potential in that country. The new law came into effect on Thursday, following only Taiwan and Nepal in Asia. It also makes Thailand the first Southeast Asian nation to recognize same-sex marriage, in a region of several Muslim-majority nations where homosexuality is outlawed on religious grounds. Now, in an administrative change that carries major consequences, the word 'spouse' replaces 'husband' and 'wife' in statutes, unlocking access for same-sex couples to practical benefits previously only enjoyed by heterosexual marriages. Those include the ability to adopt children, take out joint mortgages, pass on property after death, benefit from next-of-kin status and receive state benefits - as well as crucial medical rights to give consent on behalf of their partners in an emergency. Across the country, from Krabi in the south to Chiang Mai in the north, couples married in registration ceremonies that ranged from intimate at local government offices to a mass wedding at a downtown shopping mall in Bangkok. Thai national Rittigiat Subma married his Chinese partner, Xichen Lin, in Bang Rak district, Bangkok’s most popular district for marriage. Pride rainbow flags and umbrellas hung above the offices, while a three-piece band provided the soundtrack to the weddings. 'I’m so happy. It’s long overdue,' Rittigiat told VOA. 'My partner and I can now take a loan together to buy a house, we can access other equal benefits and make big medical decisions for one another.' 'I can get a spouse visa after we register our marriage here and move to Australia with him for his work.' Proudly holding the red-bound marriage certificate book, his spouse, Xichen Lin. said the pair - who are both 27 and work for tech firms - knew they wanted to get married within weeks of meeting each other. 'Had this bill not been passed there wouldn’t be a relationship for us, because one of the premises of our relationship is that we’re going to have a future.' With no legal possibilities for gay couples in China where same-sex marriage is illegal, he said Thai law has unlocked that possibility. 'We are able to live a normal life now just like a regular couple; we can tell the others that we are married … we can share assets and represent each other in legal circumstances.' Despite the joy and celebration, there were notes of caution from LGBTQ+ advocates who say their equality efforts continue beyond the same-sex bill. 'The law may take effect today but that doesn’t mean discrimination against LGBTQ+ community has changed overnight,' said Tunyawaj Kamolwongwat, a lawmaker for the progressive People’s Party, and a key driver of the law change. 'There is a long journey ahead of us with other laws needing to catch up … now we have to follow up on an array of issues including pregnancy through assisted reproductive technologies, [and] foreign citizenship for LGBTQ+ partners ...' Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has reaped the political dividends from the legal change, which follows years of delayed efforts to get same-sex marriage codified. 'With the power of love by all of you, today Thailand marks a historic day in making the world know that we embrace every kind of love, every gender that is a fundamental part of democracy,' Paetongtarn, now at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, said in a prerecorded video message. There are also big hopes for an economic bounce, with companies from insurance and mortgages to hotels keen to cash in on the so-called pink baht. Paetongtarn’s government has put same-sex marriages under the kingdom’s 'soft power' drive - alongside Thai pop music and movies - sensing an economic opportunity from a reputation for openness and hosting weddings and honeymoons in one of the world’s top tourist destinations. A study by travel platform Agoda said that Thailand’s marriage equality legislation is set to deliver an additional 4 million international visitors per year and increase tourism revenue by nearly $2 billion annually – within two years after it is enacted. Thai official data says around 9% of the population - or 4.4 million people - identify as LGBTQ+, representing a domestic marriage market of around $50 million. Dujruedee Thaithumnus, a wedding consultant on the tourist haven of Koh Samui in the Gulf of Thailand, said the island was ready for the inflow of couples. 'It will boost the economy of the entire island … from musicians who play at weddings, to make-up artists and flower shops to photographers and hotels. The island is already packed as it is. I can’t imagine after the law change is official.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/same-sex-marriages-in-thailand-now-legal/7947517.html	2025-01-23T07:05:15-08:00	
Emilia Perez' tops Oscar nominations in fire-hit Hollywood	LOS ANGELES — Transgender cartel musical 'Emilia Perez' topped this year's Oscar nominations, earning 13 nods in an announcement on Thursday postponed by the devastating Los Angeles wildfires. French director Jacques Audiard's Mexico-set musical, released by Netflix, shattered the record for the most Academy Award nominations for a non-English-language movie. It was followed by epic immigrant saga 'The Brutalist' and show-stopping musical adaptation 'Wicked,' which each picked up 10 nominations. Bob Dylan biopic 'A Complete Unknown' and Vatican thriller 'Conclave' bagged eight nods apiece. Voting deadlines had to be extended this month, as Los Angeles — the home city of the Academy Awards — was devastated by multiple blazes that have killed more than two dozen people and forced tens of thousands to flee. Nominees were unveiled in subdued circumstances, as a town that typically fixates on the Oscars race was instead fixated on new fires burning north of the city. Even so, the glitzy Oscars ceremony itself is still set for March 2, and the stars and studios who have spent months and millions of dollars campaigning learned if they have made the coveted final shortlists. 'Emilia Perez,' in which a narco boss transitions to life as a woman and turns her back on crime, picked up nods for best picture, best director and best international film, as well as multiple song, score and sound nods. Its star, Karla Sofia Gascon, became the first openly trans acting nominee in best actress, and Zoe Saldana was nominated for best supporting actress. Their more famous co-star, Selena Gomez, who has been criticized for her Spanish-language dialogue, missed out. Even so, the Netflix film easily surpassed the most nominated non-English-language movie ever — a record previously held by 'Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon' and 'Roma,' each with 10. In best actor, firm favorite Adrien Brody was nominated for 'The Brutalist' along with Timothee Chalamet ('A Complete Unknown'), Ralph Fiennes ('Conclave') and Colman Domingo ('Sing Sing'). But in an unexpected pick sure to ruffle a few feathers in the new White House, the fifth and final spot went to Sebastian Stan, for his unsettling transformation into a young Donald Trump in 'The Apprentice.' The movie drew threats of lawsuits from Trump's attorneys, particularly for a scene in which the new U.S. president is shown raping his wife. In arguably the morning's biggest surprise, Jeremy Strong, who plays the youthful Trump's sinister mentor Roy Cohn, was also nominated in his supporting role. He edged out the likes of Denzel Washington ('Gladiator II'). Meanwhile, in an intense race for best actress, A-listers Angelina Jolie and Nicole Kidman — who went all-out with their performances in 'Maria' and 'Babygirl,' respectively — missed out entirely. Instead, comeback queen Demi Moore, who charmed the industry with her Golden Globes acceptance speech for body horror-satire 'The Substance,' was nominated and is seen as the favorite. Her rivals include Gascon, 'Anora' star Mikey Madison, 'Wicked' lead Cynthia Erivo and Brazil's Fernanda Torres for 'I'm Still Here.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/emilia-perez-tops-oscar-nominations-in-fire-hit-hollywood/7947487.html	2025-01-23T07:01:46-08:00

UK watchdog targets Apple, Google mobile ecosystems with new digital market powers	London — Google's Android and Apple's iOS are facing fresh scrutiny from Britain's competition watchdog, which announced investigations Thursday targeting the two tech giants' mobile phone ecosystems under new powers to crack down on digital market abuses. The Competition and Markets Authority said it launched separate investigations to determine whether the mobile ecosystems controlled by Apple and Google should be given 'strategic market status' that would mandate changes in the companies' practices. The watchdog is flexing its newly acquired regulatory muscles again after the new digital market rules took effect at the start of the year. The CMA has already used the new rules, designed to protect consumers and businesses from unfair practices by Big Tech companies, to open an investigation into Google's search ads business. The new investigations will examine whether Apple or Google's mobile operating systems, app stores and browsers give either company a strategic position in the market. The watchdog said it's interested in the level of competition and any barriers preventing rivals from offering competing products and services. The CMA will also look into whether Apple or Google are favoring their own apps and services, which it said 'often come pre-installed and prominently placed on iOS and Android devices.' Google's YouTube and Apple's Safari browser are two examples of apps that come bundled with Android and iOS, respectively. And it will investigate 'exploitative conduct,' such as whether Apple or Google forces app makers to agree to 'unfair terms and conditions' as condition for distributing apps on their app stores. The regulator has until October to wrap up the investigation. It said it could force either company to, for example, open up access to key functions other apps need to operate on mobile devices. Or it could force them to allow users to download apps outside of their own app stores. Both Google and Apple said the work 'constructively' with the U.K. regulator on the investigation. Google said 'Android's openness has helped to expand choice, reduce prices and democratize access to smartphones and apps. It's the only example of a successful and viable open source mobile operating system.' The company said it favors 'a way forward that avoids stifling choice and opportunities for U.K. consumers and businesses alike, and without risk to U.K. growth prospects.' Apple said it 'believes in thriving and dynamic markets where innovation can flourish. We face competition in every segment and jurisdiction where we operate, and our focus is always the trust of our users.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-watchdog-targets-apple-google-mobile-ecosystems-with-new-digital-market-powers/7947387.html	2025-01-23T05:11:10-08:00	
Rubio says US committed to Philippines in call about China's 'dangerous' actions	New U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio discussed China's 'dangerous and destabilizing actions in the South China Sea' with his Philippine counterpart on Wednesday and underscored the 'ironclad' U.S. defense commitment to Manila. 'Secretary Rubio conveyed that (China's) behavior undermines regional peace and stability and is inconsistent with international law,' the U.S. State Department said in a statement on the call with Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo. The Philippines has been embroiled in wrangles at sea with China in the past two years and the two countries have faced off regularly around disputed features in the South China Sea that fall inside Manila's exclusive economic zone. Rubio's call came after he hosted counterparts from Australia, India and Japan in the China-focused 'Quad' forum on Tuesday, the day after President Donald Trump returned to the White House. The four recommitted to working together. Quad members and the Philippines share concerns about China's growing power and analysts said Tuesday's meeting was designed to signal continuity in the Indo-Pacific and that countering Beijing would be a top priority for Trump. In the call with Manalo, Rubio 'underscored the United States' ironclad commitments to the Philippines' under their Mutual Defense Treaty and discussed ways to advance security cooperation, expand economic ties and deepen regional cooperation, the statement said. China's foreign ministry said its activities in the waters were 'reasonable, lawful and beyond reproach.' Speaking at a regular press conference, ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the United States was 'not a party' to the South China Sea dispute and had 'no right to intervene' in maritime issues between China and the Philippines. 'Military cooperation between the U.S. and the Philippines should not undermine China's sovereignty and maritime rights and interests in the South China Sea, nor should it be used to endorse the illegal claims of the Philippines,' Mao said. The Philippines, a U.S. defense treaty ally, is among the first countries to engage with the new U.S. administration to discuss critical security matters, Manila's defense department said in a statement. Its defense secretary Gilberto Teodoro and U.S. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz met at the White House on Thursday to reaffirm the enduring alliance between their two countries. Just ahead of Trump's inauguration, the Philippines and the United States carried out their fifth set of joint maritime exercises in the South China Sea since launching the joint activities in 2023. Security engagements between the allies have soared under Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr., who has moved closer to Washington and allowed the expansion of military bases that American forces can access, including facilities facing the democratically governed island of Taiwan, which China claims as its own. Visiting the Philippines last week, Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya said a trilateral initiative to boost cooperation launched by Japan, the U.S. and the Philippines at a summit last year would be strengthened when the new U.S. administration took over in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-says-us-committed-to-philippines-in-call-about-china-s-dangerous-actions-/7947364.html	2025-01-23T04:41:17-08:00	
India open to return of undocumented Indians in the United States	New Delhi — Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar has said New Delhi is open to the return of undocumented Indians in the United States. His comments came following a meeting with U.S. foreign secretary Marco Rubio in Washington during which illegal immigration was one of the issues discussed. Saying that New Delhi was firmly opposed to illegal migration, he told reporters that 'We have always taken the view that if there are any of our citizens who are not here legally, if we are sure that they are our citizens, we have always been, you know, open to their legitimate return to India.' He said it is a position India takes with every country. Jaishankar was addressing a news conference in Washington on Wednesday, a day after his meeting with Rubio. After taking office, U.S. President Donald Trump issued executive orders that aim to clamp down on illegal immigration and deport those who are in the U.S. illegally. Indians made up the third-largest group of unauthorized immigrants in the U.S. in 2022 behind Mexico and El Salvador, according to Pew Research Center. It estimated their number at 725,000. Analysts see India’s proactive stand on facilitating the return of illegal Indian migrants in the U.S. as a move to address a key concern of the Trump administration as New Delhi prepares to navigate more complicated issues, including trade and tariffs. 'Among a range of issues, where there are divergences between India and the U.S., this is one area where India can show it is transparently doing something, allowing it greater space to maneuver in other areas,' according to Harsh Pant, vice president of studies at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'In other areas, such as the economy and trade, it is very difficult to do things which the new Trump administration may want India to do, and it would take time.' Jaishankar said that New Delhi is currently verifying the identities of those eligible for deportation and precise numbers of illegal migrants cannot be determined. The United States has identified some 18,000 undocumented Indian migrants to be sent back home, for which India will verify and start the process of deportation, Bloomberg reported earlier this week, citing people familiar with the matter. Deportations of Indians in the United States who lack proper documentation have been taking place – a group of Indian nationals was repatriated by the U.S. in October, for example. The Indian foreign minister Jaishankar also spoke in support of legal migration channels. 'As a government, we are obviously very much supportive of legal mobility because we do believe in a global workplace. We want Indian talent and Indian skills to have the maximum opportunity at the global level,' he said at his press conference. The H-1B visa program, which brings skilled foreign workers to the United States, has been a subject of debate in the U.S. in recent years, with some strongly criticizing the program for negatively impacting American workers. Proponents assert those skilled workers benefit U.S. companies and employers. Indians, most of them professionals working in the technology industry, are among the biggest beneficiaries of the visa program. Analyst Pant says India is on a 'stronger wicket' where H-1B visas are concerned. 'On this issue, India has also been getting support from companies in the U.S. So politically, that is a safer issue for India to handle because there is a domestic support base for India,' Pant said. Elon Musk is among those who have expressed strong support for the program. Trump, who had been critical of the program, last month spoke in its favor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-open-to-return-of-undocumented-indians-in-the-united-states/7947323.html	2025-01-23T03:45:03-08:00	
Taliban flog 12 Afghans, including women, for adultery, eloping	Islamabad — Taliban justice officials in Afghanistan said Thursday that 12 people, including two women, had been publicly flogged this week after being tried and charged with adultery, sodomy, eloping, and having 'illicit relations.' The regime’s Supreme Court announced the punishments, saying they were carried out in the southeastern Khost and northern Parwan provinces, with members of the judiciary, administrative staff, and ordinary citizens present as onlookers. Each of the twelve defendants received the maximum of 39 lashes and prison terms ranging from eight months to three years. The top court acknowledged that the sentences were imposed by provincial courts and implemented only after its approval. At least 35 Afghans have been publicly flogged in this month alone, according to the Supreme Court data. Hundreds of men and women have been flogged in packed sports stadiums across Afghanistan, while six people have been publicly executed under what the Taliban described as the Islamic concept of retributive justice, known as qisas. The United Nations and global human rights organizations have persistently decried the floggings and other forms of corporal punishment as contrary to Afghanistan’s international human rights obligations, demanding the Taliban cease the practice. Taliban leaders, who regained power in 2021, defend their criminal justice system and governance at large, saying they are based on their strict interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. Authorities have banned Afghan girls from pursuing secondary and university-level education and prohibited women from seeking employment in most public and private workplaces. Women must also publicly cover their faces and travel with a male guardian. No country has officially recognized the Taliban as legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, mainly over their harsh treatment of women and other human rights concerns. China and the United Arab Emirates have acknowledged a Taliban ambassador without recognizing the Afghan government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-flog-12-afghans-including-women-for-adultery-eloping/7947313.html	2025-01-23T03:35:00-08:00	
Trump designates Yemen's Houthis as a 'foreign terrorist organization'	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday re-designated Yemen's Houthi movement, known formally as Ansar Allah, as a 'foreign terrorist organization,' the White House said. The move will impose harsher economic penalties than the Biden administration had applied to the Iran-aligned group in response to its attacks on commercial shipping in the Red Sea and against U.S. warships defending the critical maritime chokepoint. Proponents of the move say it is overdue, though some experts say it could have implications for anyone seen as aiding the Houthis, including some aid organizations. 'The Houthis' activities threaten the security of American civilians and personnel in the Middle East, the safety of our closest regional partners, and the stability of global maritime trade,' the White House said in a statement. The Houthis, who control most of Yemen, have carried out more than 100 attacks on ships plying the Red Sea since November 2023, saying they were acting in solidarity with Palestinians over Israel's war against Hamas in Gaza. They have sunk two vessels, seized another and killed at least four seafarers. The attacks have disrupted global shipping, forcing firms to re-route to longer and more expensive journeys around southern Africa for more than a year. The group has targeted the southern Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden, which are joined by the narrow Bab al-Mandab strait, a chokepoint between the Horn of Africa and the Middle East. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. military sought to intercept Houthi attacks to safeguard commercial traffic and waged periodic strikes to degrade Houthi military capabilities. But it did not target the group's leadership. At the start of his presidential term in 2021, Joe Biden had dropped Trump's terrorist designations to address humanitarian concerns inside Yemen. Confronted with the Red Sea attacks, Biden last year designated the group as a 'Specially Designated Global Terrorist' organization. But his administration held off on applying the harsher FTO designation. British charity Oxfam said the move would worsen the suffering of Yemeni civilians, disrupting vital imports of food, medicine, and fuel. 'The Trump administration is aware of these consequences but chose to move forward anyway, and will bear responsibility for the hunger and disease that will follow,' Oxfam America's director of peace and security, Scott Paul, said in a statement. David Schenker, who was assistant secretary of state for Near Eastern affairs in the first Trump administration, said Trump's move on Wednesday was an obvious, early step to respond to what he described as one of Iran's leading proxy forces in the Middle East. 'While the redesignation likely won't have a positive impact on the group's behavior, the measure suggests the new administration is not looking to induce (or cajole) the Iranians to negotiations through blandishment,' Schenker told Reuters. The Trump administration said the U.S. will work with regional partners to eliminate Houthi capabilities, deprive it of resources 'and thereby end its attacks on U.S. personnel and civilians, U.S. partners, and maritime shipping in the Red Sea.' The designation will also trigger a broad review of U.N. partners, non-governmental organizations and contractors operating in Yemen, the White House said. 'The President will direct USAID to end its relationship with entities that have made payments to the Houthis, or which have opposed international efforts to counter the Houthis while turning a blind eye towards the Houthis’ terrorism and abuses,' the White House said. The Houthis in recent days have signaled they were scaling back attacks in the Red Sea following a multiphase cease fire deal between Israel and Hamas. Earlier on Wednesday, the group released the crew of the Galaxy Leader commercial ship more than a year after they seized their Bahamas-flagged vessel off the Yemeni coast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-designates-yemen-s-houthis-as-a-foreign-terrorist-organization-/7947289.html	2025-01-23T02:28:32-08:00

Israeli military says it killed 2 militants connected to West Bank bus attack	Israel’s military said Thursday it killed two Islamic Jihad militants who were involved in a deadly attack on a bus in the West Bank earlier this month. The Israel Defense Forces said its troops killed the militants in the village of Burqin amid an exchange of fire after the militants had barricaded themselves in a building. One Israeli soldier was injured in the attack, the military said. Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz praised the operation Thursday and said Israel will continue its operation targeting terrorists in the Jenin refugee camp in the West Bank to ensure it does not become a base for attacks. Israel launched the operation on Tuesday, days after it began a ceasefire with Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Violence in the Israeli-occupied West Bank increased after the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli counterassault in Gaza. Palestinian health officials say Israeli raids and attacks by Israeli settlers have killed more than 800 Palestinians in the West Bank during that time. Israel’s military says at least 29 Israelis, including soldiers have been killed. The Gaza war began with the Hamas attack in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took 250 people hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, with most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The U.S. State Department said new Secretary of State Marco Rubio pledged to help Israeli free the remaining hostages as he spoke by telephone Wednesday with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Rubio 'congratulated the Prime Minister on Israel’s successes against Hamas and Hezbollah' and highlighted that maintaining 'steadfast support for Israel is a top priority' for the United States under President Donald Trump, according to a statement from State Department spokesperson Tammy Bruce. Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, said it will release another round of hostages on Saturday. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday that the next group of hostages would be four Israeli women, who would be set free in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Shortly after the six-week ceasefire began, Hamas released three hostages while Israeli freed 90 Palestinian prisoners. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-military-says-it-killed-2-militants-connected-to-west-bank-bus-attack-/7947265.html	2025-01-23T01:21:58-08:00	
Gabon to hold presidential election April 12	LIBREVILLE, GABON — Gabon's transitional government said presidential elections would be held on April 12, a key step to reestablish civilian rule after a coup ended the Bongo dynasty's decades-long reign. Government spokesman Seraphin Akure Davain made the announcement early Thursday following a Cabinet meeting. 'Voting will start at 7 a.m. and end at 6 p.m. in line with current laws,' he said. The oil-rich central African country, which had been under the rule of the Bongo family for 55 years, adopted a new constitution in a November referendum. It provided for a maximum of two seven-year presidential terms, no prime minister and no dynastic transfer of power. On Monday, a new law allowed military officials to stand in elections, subject to certain conditions. Transitional President General Brice Oligui Nguema, who swiftly took over as leader after the August 2023 coup, has made no secret of his ambitions to remain in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-to-hold-presidential-election-april-12/7947252.html	2025-01-23T00:18:35-08:00	
Chad opposition protests final election results won by transitional president’s party	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chad's Constitutional Council has ignored opposition calls to set aside results of last month’s parliamentary elections for gross irregularities and fraud, and proclaimed the ruling party of Chad's president, Field Marshal Mahamat Idriss Deby, the winner. Officials said nominations for senatorial elections to end the transition are open, but the opposition insisted another transitional government should be formed and transparent elections organized to end the three-decade Deby family rule. Officials in Chad said opposition leaders assembled Wednesday in the capital, N'djamena, to protest the election results published Tuesday by the Constitutional Council, the central African nation’s highest court. Clement Sianka, spokesperson of Chad's National Assembly of Democrats, an opposition political party that participated in the Dec. 29 polls, said he took part in the protest because his party is surprised that the council refused to annul the elections he said were marred by fraud, low voter participation and intimidation of civilians Chad's military considered to be opposition supporters. Sianka said that by ordering government troops to chase opposition party representatives from polling stations, Deby, who in December declared himself as field marshal, the highest rank in Chad's military, once more sent a strong message to civilians that he wants to take power at any cost and continue the three-decade rule begun by his father, Idriss Deby Itno. Sianka said fraud was alarming, with ballot boxes confiscated and stuffed by supporters of Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement, or MPS, party in front of helpless civilians. He said the MPS party declared its candidates as winners in towns and villages where civilians obeyed opposition boycott calls and elections did not take place. Sianka spoke on Chad’s state TV on Wednesday. According to the final results published by the country’s Constitutional Council on Tuesday, the MPS won124 seats in the 188-member National Assembly. Sixty-four women were voted in as lawmakers, according to the official results, an increase of 36 women over Chad's last legislative period, which ended in 2011. Officials say financial difficulties have made it impossible for legislative polls to be held since 2011. The opposition said the polls, the first in over a decade, should be set aside because most of Chad's roughly 8.3 million voters heeded opposition calls for a boycott. There were no indications the polls were to be free, fair and transparent as civilians already knew that Deby wanted to confiscate power, Chad's opposition said. However, Chad's Constitutional Council said voter turnout was over 50%, and the elections were peaceful with no major incidents that could affect the outcome of polls. Chad's Political Actors Consultation Group, or GCAP, a coalition of several dozen political parties, on Wednesday said democracy was stifled during Chad's three-year transition period. GCAP said Deby, who took power as a military ruler in 2021, persecutes critical opposition leaders to maintain the rule of his father. Idriss Deby spent three decades in power until he died while fighting rebels in April 2021. GCAP said Deby should hand power to a civilian capable of managing another transition during which transparent elections will be organized for a return to democratic rule. The group did not say who they think will manage the transition are advocating. Chad's opposition also accused the elections management body of rigging elections to favor Deby, who appoints and can fire the elections management body’s officials. Chad's Constitutional Council has neglected calls for an immediate end to the country’s transitional government and the cancellation of the Dec. 29 elections. The council says such calls are intended to bring chaos in Chad. On Wednesday the National Agency for the Management of Elections or ANGE reiterated calls on qualified civilians to prepare their nomination papers before a Jan. 24 deadline and run in the country's first senatorial elections, to be organized in April. Officials say the senatorial election will be the last polls to be organized by the transitional government in its efforts to hand power over to civilian rule. Ahmed Bartchiret, president of ANGE, said ANGE will not accept intimidation by opposition parties that want to disrupt Chad's unity and create chaos. He said ANGE will organize free, fair and transparent elections as it freely organized a constitutional referendum and presidential elections to hand over power to civilian rule as desired by the peace-loving people of Chad. Chad's opposition has always contested the outcome of elections since Deby became transitional president. Deby said he respects the verdict of the ballot and called on civilians to work with democratically elected officials for the development of Chad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-opposition-protests-final-election-results-won-by-transitional-president-s-party/7947242.html	2025-01-23T00:05:32-08:00	
Deadly Russian missile attack hits Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region	Officials in southern Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia region said Thursday a Russian ballistic missile attack killed at least one person and injured 24 others. Regional Governor Ivan Fedorov said on Telegram that Russian drones also destroyed an energy facility and knocked out power to tens of thousands of people. In the Mykolaiv region, Governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram that Ukrainian air defenses shot down nine Russian drones. Debris from the drones damaged several houses, Kim said. Ukraine’s military also shot down several drones over the Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it shot down four Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod region located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Trump-Putin U.S. President Donald Trump told his Russian counterpart, Vladimir Putin, on Wednesday to end his 'ridiculous war' against Ukraine or the United States would soon impose new 'high levels' of taxes, tariffs and sanctions on any Russian exports to the West. Trump, two days into his second term in the White House, told Putin in a social media post that he was 'not looking to hurt Russia' and that the U.S. 'must never forget' that Russia helped the U.S. win World War II, but that it was time to end Moscow’s nearly three-year invasion of neighboring Ukraine. 'All of that being said,' Trump noted on his Truth Social account, 'I’m going to do Russia, whose Economy is failing, and President Putin, a very big FAVOR. Settle now, and STOP this ridiculous War! IT’S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE.' 'If we don’t make a ‘deal,’ and soon,' Trump said he would 'have no other choice' but to impose the taxes, tariffs and sanctions. Under President Joe Biden, who left office on Monday, the United States and its European allies frequently sanctioned key sectors of the Russian economy and oligarch friends of Putin, worsening the country’s economy but failing to stop the war. Trump said, 'Let’s get this war, which never would have started if I were President, over with! We can do it the easy way, or the hard way - and the easy way is always better. It’s time to 'MAKE A DEAL.' NO MORE LIVES SHOULD BE LOST!!!' There was no immediate response from Putin to Trump’s demands.

South Korea investigators recommend Yoon be charged with insurrection, abuse of power	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean investigators recommended Thursday that impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol be charged with insurrection and abuse of power, as they handed over the results of their probe into his ill-fated declaration of martial law to prosecutors. The official charges against Yoon were 'leading an insurrection and abuse of power,' the Corruption Investigation Office said after a 51-day probe into his Dec. 3 attempt to suspend civilian rule. The CIO said it 'decided to request the Seoul Central District Prosecutors' Office file charges against the sitting President, Yoon Suk Yeol, in connection with allegations including leading insurrection.' Yoon had 'conspired with the former Minister of National Defense and military commanders on December 3, 2024,' it said. The leader, currently suspended from duties, 'declared martial law with the intent to exclude state authority or disrupt the constitutional order, thereby inciting riots.' Under the South Korean legal system, the case file of the suspect -- identified as 'Yoon Suk Yeol: president' -- will now be handed to prosecutors, who have 11 days to decide whether to charge him, which would lead to a criminal trial. The prosecutors' office has 'complied with the CIO's request for a case transfer,' the investigators said. Yoon was arrested in a dawn raid last week on insurrection charges, becoming the first sitting South Korean head of state to be detained in a criminal probe. South Korea was plunged into political chaos by Yoon's botched martial law declaration, which lasted just six hours before lawmakers voted it down. They later impeached him, stripping him of his duties. Since his arrest, Yoon has refused to be questioned by the CIO, which is in charge of the criminal probe. He has declined to cooperate with the probe and 'consistently maintained an uncooperative stance,' Lee Jae-seung, deputy CIO chief, said in briefing to reporters. Yoon's security detail also 'obstructed searches and seizures, including access to secure communication devices like classified phones,' Lee said. The CIO said it had decided, in view of Yoon's efforts to block their investigation, it would be 'more efficient' for prosecutors to handle the case, as they have the authority to indict suspects. His lawyers have repeatedly said the CIO has no authority to investigate insurrection. Yoon's legal team said Thursday that they urged prosecutors to 'conduct an investigation that adheres to legal legitimacy and due process.' 'Abused authority' During the night of Dec. 3, Yoon purportedly ordered troops to storm the National Assembly and prevent lawmakers from voting down his declaration of martial law. The CIO said its probe found that Yoon 'abused his authority by compelling police officers from the National Assembly Guard Unit and martial law forces to perform duties beyond their obligations.' He also 'obstructed the exercise of lawmakers' rights to demand the lifting of martial law,' it added. Yoon has denied instructing top military commanders to 'drag out' lawmakers from parliament to prevent them from voting down his decree. Yoon, who remains head of state, is being held in a detention center. In addition to the criminal probe, he is also facing a Constitutional Court case, where judges will decide whether to uphold his impeachment, which would officially remove him from office. If the court rules against Yoon, he will lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. Yoon, who attended a court hearing this week, will appear again Thursday when the judges will call witnesses to hear details of how martial law unfolded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-investigators-recommend-yoon-be-charged-with-insurrection-abuse-of-power/7947234.html	2025-01-22T23:41:22-08:00	
Earthquakes above magnitude 5 strike Philippines	MANILA, Philippines — Two earthquakes jolted the Philippines several hours apart on Thursday, authorities said, but there were no immediate reports of injuries or major damage. A magnitude 5.8 quake occurred off the town of San Francisco in Southern Leyte province in the central region of Visayas at 7:39 a.m, according to the Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology. A magnitude 5.4 earthquake followed four hours later that hit Siocon town in the southern Mindanao region. The agency had recorded at least 68 aftershocks from the Visayas tremor. There were no immediate reports of injuries from either tremor. San Francisco police chief Barnie Catig said the earthquake in the town was brief but strong. 'Some of the picture frames in our shelves fell off,' Catig said by phone. No one was injured, but at least 18 houses and government buildings had minor damage, Catig said. At least one highway had fissures from the tremor but remained passable, he said. 'We're still conducting a full assessment,' Catig said. Earthquakes are common in the Philippines, which is located in the Pacific Ocean's 'Ring of Fire', where volcanic activity and earthquakes frequently occur.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquakes-above-magnitude-5-strike-philippines/7947230.html	2025-01-22T23:13:44-08:00	
2 soldiers dead, 12 wounded in ambush by ex-Philippine rebels	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Former Muslim rebels ambushed government troops assigned to escort U.N. staff visiting the southern Philippines, killing two soldiers and wounding 12 others, the military said Thursday. Wednesday's attack came more than 10 years after the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) signed a peace agreement with Manila, ending a decades-old armed campaign initially for a separate state and later Muslim self-rule in Asia's bastion of Catholicism. A military statement said the soldiers were 'fired upon by unidentified armed personalities' in Basilan island, triggering a firefight that left two soldiers dead and 12 others wounded. The commander of the army unit, Brigadier General Alvin Luzon, said Thursday MILF gunmen attacked the troops who had been dispatched to 'provide area security' to a United Nations team that was to visit a development project in the former MILF stronghold. The U.N. visit was later aborted due to the firefight, he added. The U.N. country office in the Philippines did not immediately respond to AFP's request for comment. The peace treaty had led to the creation of a self-rule area in a Muslim-populated region in the southern Philippines, now run by Chief Minister Ahod Ebrahim, the former MILF chief. However, the process of decommissioning the weapons of thousands of MILF fighters following a lengthy armed campaign that left thousands dead is yet to be completed. Ebrahim said in a statement sent to AFP that the regional Bangsamoro government -- which includes the island province of Basilan -- was 'deeply saddened by the unfortunate encounter' with MILF members. He urged all parties to 'remain calm as we work towards addressing this incident through appropriate channels,' while stressing the regional government 'remains steadfast in its commitment to the full implementation' of the peace treaty. Philippine Army commander Lieutenant General Roy Galido condemned the attack and said his forces are 'working closely with local government units and law enforcement agencies to ensure that the perpetrators of this treacherous act face the full consequences of their actions.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/soldiers-dead-12-wounded-in-ambush-by-ex-philippine-rebels/7947229.html	2025-01-22T23:13:11-08:00	
Analysts: China normalizing its claims to maritime zone shared with South Korea	WASHINGTON — South Korea should increase efforts to prevent China from normalizing its claims to sovereignty over a disputed maritime area in waters the two countries share, analysts say. China has been doing it for decades in the South China Sea, analysts say, where it has been using so-called gray zone tactics to assert its claims over vast stretches of maritime territory — claims contested by several neighboring countries in the area. Recent Chinese activity in the waters it shares with South Korea has prompted analysts' warnings that Beijing is doing the same to Seoul. South Korean officials said earlier this month that China had installed a steel structure in disputed waters west of South Korea, The Chosun Daily in Seoul reported. Using reconnaissance satellites, South Korean intelligence agencies detected the structure last month and estimate that it exceeds 50 meters in width and height, The Chosun Daily said. The structure was spotted in the disputed area known as the Provisional Measures Zone, or PMZ, in the Yellow Sea, which South Korea calls the Western Sea. The zone is where the exclusive economic zones of the two countries overlap. The zone was established in 2001 to manage the overlapping claims to the area. Building any kind of facility and conducting activities unrelated to fishing are banned in the area until the dispute is settled. China installed two similar structures in a nearby area in April and May, prompting protests by South Korea. 'Gray zone strategy' 'It is likely that these recent actions are tied to a gray zone strategy that slowly encroaches on this area in ways that over the long-term reinforces their claims,' said Terence Roehrig, an Asia-Pacific security expert and lecturer at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 'The goal of a gray zone strategy is to slowly force the target state to accept a new normal in the area. Seoul must ensure that does not happen by continuing to assert its position and insist that the delimitation of these waters be settled through negotiation,' Roehrig continued. 'China views the Yellow Sea as a crucial area for its security and potential gateway into the Chinese heartland. It is likely that eventually, these structures may have some military use,' he added. Gray zone tactics blur the line between what is legal and illegal through paramilitary coercions designed to weaken an adversary over time. China's tactics have included building artificial islands and making incursions, pushing the boundary of what is allowed to project military power and control sea routes. 'The incident demonstrates China is using the same strategy it employed in the South China Sea with South Korea now,' said Rahman Yaacob, research fellow for the Southeast Asia program at the Lowy Institute. According to Yaacob, China has used gray tactics to build civilian structures in the South China Sea since the early 1990s. China installed structures in Mischief Reef back then, saying their purpose was to support fishermen, he said. 'We now know Mischief Reef has been converted into a military base on an artificial island,' Yaacob said. China now has a military base on an artificial island it built on Mischief Reef, which is in the Spratly Islands. Mischief Reef is also claimed by multiple countries that protest China's military buildup. Admiral John Aquilino, the former U.S. Indo-Pacific commander, said in 2022 that China seemed to have completed the construction of missile arsenals, aircraft hangers, radar systems and other military facilities in Mischief Reef. David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said China might want access to 'the mineral rights under the sea and to be able to transit freely in the area so it can control commerce and flow of activities in the area' close to South Korea. Sustained structures in the region could impact naval operations of South Korea and the U.S., he continued. 'It's important that South Korea, in particular, but also the United States, Japan and other allies do not allow China to normalize its activities,' Maxwell added. 'That's what it wants to do — normalize its presence so it can claim it as its sovereign [maritime] territory.' In response to South Korea's protests, China said last year that the structures were for supporting fishing activities. The Yellow Sea is a key fishing site for China. 'It's certainly possible that the structures are used to support fishing activities,' said Tabitha Grace Mallory, a founder and CEO of China Ocean Institute and a University of Washington professor focusing on China's ocean policy. 'The fact that these structures are being built unilaterally in the PMZ is just unnecessarily provocative,' she added. Telling VOA on Tuesday that he is 'not familiar with the situation,' Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said, 'I would like to point out that China is a responsible country that has always carried out distant-water fishery and marine scientific activities in accordance with laws and regulations.' Exploiting political turmoil Some analysts say China could be taking advantage of Seoul's political situation to install the structure in the disputed waters. The installation coincides with the political chaos stemming from South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived declaration of martial law. 'China is helping to create the political chaos in South Korea so that it can conduct these activities inside South Korea's economic exclusive zone' and 'act with impunity,' Maxwell said. Others are unsure whether the two incidents are related. 'I don't know if this is explicitly tied to exploiting [South Korea's] political turmoil,' said Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation chair in Korea studies at the Brookings Institution. 'But Beijing may be testing South Korea's political resolve over disputed maritime claims, especially if we anticipate that the Trump administration will press [Seoul] to do more to counter Chinese threats in the Indo-Pacific,' Yeo continued. Patrick Cronin, the Asia-Pacific security chair at the Hudson Institute, said Beijing does not want to push South Korea too hard, although it has an opportunity to do so, because 'China has an interest in opening a healthy relationship with South Korea, especially at a time when it thinks it is going to have a more amendable government in place.' Cronin was referring to main opposition Democratic Party leader Lee Jae-myung, considered pro-China, having a shot at running for the next presidential election, which could be held in few months if the Constitutional Court rules in favor of Yoon's impeachment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-china-normalizing-its-claims-to-maritime-zone-shared-with-south-korea/7947215.html	2025-01-22T22:18:10-08:00	
Hundreds to wed as Thai same-sex marriage law comes into force	Bangkok — Hundreds of same-sex couples are set to tie the knot in Thailand on Thursday as it becomes by far the largest nation in Asia to allow equal marriage. A mass LGBTQ+ wedding in the capital, organized by campaign group Bangkok Pride with city authorities, expects hundreds of marriage registrations as the law comes into effect. Transgender woman Ariya 'Jin' Milintanapa, who has waited two decades for this moment, told AFP she was 'psyched.' 'This day is important not just for us, but for our kids as well. Our family will finally become one,' she said. Thailand ranks highly on indexes of LGBTQ+ legal and living conditions, and public attitudes, and Thursday's milestone makes it the first Southeast Asian country to allow equal marriage. The kingdom's same-sex marriage bill was passed in a historic parliamentary vote last June, the third place in Asia to do so after Taiwan and Nepal. The law was ratified by King Maha Vajiralongkorn in October and comes into effect after 120 days. The law on marriage now uses gender-neutral terms in place of 'men,' 'women,' 'husbands' and 'wives,' and also grants adoption and inheritance rights to same-sex couples. More than 30 countries around the world have legalized marriage for all since the Netherlands became the first to allow same-sex unions in 2001. Couples will be able to register at the main mass wedding at Bangkok's central Siam Paragon shopping mall and district offices nationwide from 8 a.m. on Thursday. It marks the culmination of years of campaigning and thwarted attempts to pass equal marriage laws. Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said during a celebratory photoshoot last week: 'No matter your gender or who you love, love knows no limits or expectations. Everyone will be protected under the same laws.' Thailand has long had an international reputation for tolerance of the LGBTQ+ community, and opinion polls reported in local media have shown overwhelming public support for equal marriage. However, much of the Buddhist-majority kingdom retains traditional and conservative values and LGBTQ+ people say they still face barriers and discrimination in everyday life. Thai activists have been pushing for same-sex marriage rights for more than a decade, with their advocacy stalled by political turbulence in a country regularly upended by coups and mass street protests. Siritata Ninlapruek, an LGBTQ+ activist, described the journey as a challenging, bittersweet battle. 'I am extremely happy, but my fight for the community continues,' she said. She emphasized the need for gender identity recognition beyond biological sex. 'Whether male, female or non-binary, people should have the right to identify as they wish.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-to-wed-as-thai-same-sex-marriage-law-comes-into-force/7947206.html	2025-01-22T21:11:28-08:00	
Researchers: Houthis have advantages in protecting leaders from threatened strikes	WASHINGTON — Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi terror group appears to be well-positioned to shield its leaders from retaliatory strikes recently threatened by Israel, international researchers tell VOA. Israel also faces its own challenges in potentially engaging in long-distance targeting of Houthi leaders, but those researchers say the Israeli threat to Houthi rule is likely to grow in the future. Israel has carried out five long-distance airstrikes on Houthi infrastructure and other targets in Yemen since last July, in retaliation for the Houthis firing hundreds of drones and missiles as part of an Iranian proxy war launched against Israel in October 2023. The Biden administration had labeled the Houthis a Specially Designated Global Terrorist organization last January, citing their use of missiles supplied by Iran to attack Red Sea shipping. President Donald Trump, who took office this week, signed an order on Wednesday starting a monthlong process of further penalizing the Houthis with a designation as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. After Israel’s latest Yemen strike on Jan. 10, Defense Minister Israel Katz issued a videotaped warning to Houthi leaders, saying Israel will 'hunt you down' – repeating a threat that he first made last month to 'decapitate' the Houthi leadership. Houthi leader Abdul-Malek al-Houthi issued a defiant videotaped message of his own on Monday, saying his militia will monitor an Israel-Hamas ceasefire that took effect a day earlier in Gaza and 'escalate' conflict with Israel 'if (it) breaches' the deal. The Houthi leader is known for being elusive and issuing videotaped statements from undisclosed locations. Mohammed Albasha, a Yemeni American former journalist and founder of U.S.-based consultancy Basha Report that specializes in Middle East and North Africa risk assessments, told VOA that he has not observed any public meetings involving al-Houthi in Yemen since 2015. That is when a Saudi-led coalition began an offensive to try to oust the Houthis from the Yemeni capital, Sanaa, which the militia stormed into the year before. In a series of interviews for this report, Albasha and other international researchers specializing in Yemen said they suspect that al-Houthi has been hiding for years in the mountains of his clan’s home base of Saada province in northwestern Yemen, along with other senior figures of his militia. 'I don’t think Israeli threats have changed the behavior of Houthi leaders much,' said Wolf-Christian Paes, a researcher at the International Institute for Strategic Studies. 'Since 2015, they have fought Saudi and Emirati forces who tried to target their leadership, which made them very security conscious,' Paes said. 'Al-Houthi has rarely met U.N. or other foreign visitors in person or given interviews to journalists.' Ely Karmon, a researcher at Israel’s International Institute for Counterterrorism, said Houthi leaders appear to have tightened those precautions in response to recent developments, including Israel’s five strikes on Yemen, dozens of U.S.-led strikes on Houthi targets in Yemen since last January, and Israeli attacks on Iranian proxy leaders elsewhere in the region. Karmon noted that 10 days after Israel’s first airstrike in Yemen on July 20, 2024, the Houthis’ patron, Iran, held a swearing-in ceremony for its new president, Massoud Pezeshkian, and al-Houthi did not travel to the Islamic republic to attend. Hamas political chief Ismail Haniyeh, another Iranian proxy leader, did travel to the Iranian capital for the inauguration and was assassinated in an Israeli bombing hours after the event. April Longley Alley, a researcher at the U.S. Institute of Peace, said the Houthis also are likely to be skeptical of using transmitting technology anywhere near their top leader. Israel used communications devices to attack Hezbollah on consecutive days in September, first detonating thousands of rigged pagers and then hundreds of rigged walkie-talkies that it surreptitiously delivered to the Lebanese terror group. Ten days after the pager attack, Israel assassinated Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike on his southern Beirut stronghold, giving the Houthis more cause to bolster the protection of al-Houthi, the researchers said. Beyond the Houthis’ home base in Saada, the militia has a political leadership running an internationally unrecognized authority in Sanaa, called the Supreme Political Council. Albasha, the former journalist, said the council’s prime minister and other ministers are not involved in military matters and operate under the authority of the militia’s senior commanders from Saada and the Houthi clan. The researchers said Houthi political leaders and spokesmen appear regularly in public in Sanaa, but typically in settings with many civilians present, giving those officials a human shield from potential aerial attacks. In the latest such appearance on Wednesday, the Houthis’ Supreme Political Council prime minister, Ahmed Ghaleb Nasser al-Rahawi, appeared at a government auditorium where several hundred people gathered to commemorate the 2004 killing of Hussein al-Houthi, a brother of the militia’s current leader, by forces of Yemen’s then-President Ali Abdullah Saleh. But the researchers said the Houthis’ tactics for shielding their leaders from attack also have drawbacks. 'Houthi military leaders are going to be very skeptical of using phones, and that is likely going to make it harder and more time consuming for them to exchange messages between Saada and Sanaa,' Longley Alley said. Ari Heistein, an Israel-based researcher with the Counter Extremism Project, said Houthi military leaders risk losing relevance in running their regime if they disconnect from electronic communications for prolonged periods. 'Running a country of more than 32 million people with serious problems is hard to do from isolation in a remote environment,' Heistein said. The researchers said it is harder for Israel to strike leaders of the Houthis than those of Hezbollah and other Iranian proxy groups located nearer its borders because Yemen is more than 2,000 kilometers away. That distance requires several hours of flight time for Israeli warplanes to reach their targets, versus minutes for the same warplanes to reach neighboring territories. They said Israel also lacks in Yemen the same kind of human intelligence sources that it established in Lebanon and Palestinian territories before the start of the recent conflict, when it perceived Yemen to be a relatively low threat. Karmon, the counterterrorism researcher, said that if the ceasefire in Gaza holds and the Houthis refrain from firing more projectiles at Israel in the coming weeks and months, he expects Israel to focus on closing what he called a 'huge' intelligence gap in Yemen. He said Israel could utilize long-range drones, satellites, human sources and intelligence-sharing with the U.S. and regional partners to do that. Heistein said Israel likely will use its surprise September attacks on Hezbollah, which were years in the making, as a model for dealing with threats from Yemen. 'If the Houthis quiet down for a while, the next time they begin causing trouble, particularly for Israel and international shipping, Israel probably will have a plan in place to take out their leadership,' Heistein said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/researchers-houthis-have-advantages-in-protecting-leaders-from-threatened-strikes/7947198.html	2025-01-22T20:40:03-08:00

New wildfire erupts in Southern California	A new wildfire erupted Wednesday in Southern California, scorching more than 39 square kilometers of trees and brush in the mountains north of Los Angeles. The Hughes Fire is the latest wildfire to erupt in parched Southern California. It is burning near Lake Castaic, a recreation area about 65 kilometers from the Eaton and Palisades fires that are continuing to burn in the region for a third week. The fire, less than 1 square kilometer when first reported, quickly grew to 20 square kilometers with the aid of the Santa Ana winds, the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said. It was later reported to be 39 square kilometers in size. 'This fire had a robust response today, and as you can see behind us, the responders are doing great work to try to contain this fire,' Joe Tyler, director of Cal Fire, said. 'Certainly, we are not out of the woods yet.' Winds were gusting at 67 kph Wednesday afternoon and expected to increase to 96 kph in the evening and throughout Thursday, the National Weather Service posted on X. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said that 31,000 people were ordered to evacuate, and about 23,000 were under evacuation warnings. Kayla Amara drove to a Castaic neighborhood to retrieve items from a friend’s home. As she was packing, she grabbed a hose and began watering down the property. 'I hope there's a house here to return to,' Amara said as police cars raced through the streets and flames engulfed trees in the distance. Before the Hughes Fire, firefighters and Southern California residents were bracing for the possibility of more wildfires fueled by the strong dry winds. Rain is forecast, but meteorologists have warned it would not be enough to end the fires. Forecasters predict a 60% to 80% chance of rain in the region beginning Saturday, with rainfall totals in most areas not exceeding 0.8 centimeters. The National Weather Service said dangerous fire conditions would persist in the region through Thursday or Friday. Cal Fire spokesman David Acuna said officials are concerned that the Palisades and Eaton fires could break their containment lines. The chance of thunderstorms bringing heavier rainfall has raised fears of mudslides, with debris flowing down hilly areas that have been scorched by two weeks of wildfires. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said an executive order she signed Tuesday is designed to curb the flow of toxic debris from the region’s fires and protect the area’s beaches and oceans. 'This is to prevent additional damage to areas already ravaged by fire and also to protect our watershed, beaches and ocean from toxic runoff,' the mayor said. City workers will remove toxic materials and set up barriers to direct the flow of debris into the sewer system. In addition, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors has approved emergency measures facilitating the installation of flood control infrastructure and the removal of sediment in the burned areas. Residents are being encouraged to be ready to evacuate at a moment’s notice with their prepared emergency evacuation kits. They are also being encouraged to look at the city’s website to learn how to protect themselves from ash in the air that can include heavy metals, arsenic and other harmful substances, according to L.A. County Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer. The fires that broke out in Southern California on January 7 have killed at least 28 people and destroyed thousands of buildings. The death toll is expected to climb as emergency workers comb through the ashes. President Donald Trump, who has been critical of the response to the fire, is expected to travel to Los Angeles this week. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-wildfire-erupts-in-southern-california-/7947166.html	2025-01-22T19:09:37-08:00

Europe posts record year for clean energy	A record 47% of the European Union's electricity now comes from solar and other renewables, a report Thursday said, in yet another sign of the growing gap between the bloc's push for clean energy and the new U.S. administration's pursuit of more fossil fuels. Nearly three-quarters of the EU's electricity doesn't emit planet-warming gases into the air — with another 24% of electricity in the bloc coming from nuclear power, a report released by the climate energy think tank Ember found. This is far higher than in countries like the United States and China, where nearly two-thirds of their energy is still produced from carbon-polluting fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Experts say they're encouraged by Europe's fossil fuel reductions, particularly as the U.S. looks set to increase its emissions as its new president pledges cheaper gas prices, has halted leases for wind projects and pledged to revoke Biden-era incentives for electric vehicles. 'Fossil fuels are losing their grip on EU energy,' said Chris Rosslowe, an energy expert at Ember. In 2024, solar power generated 11% of EU electricity, overtaking coal which fell below 10% for the first time. Clean wind power generated more electricity than gas for the second year in a row. 2024 data wasn't available for all countries. Ember's data for the world's largest generators of electricity for 2023 show Brazil with the largest share of its electricity from renewables, almost 89%, with much of that coming from hydroelectric power. Canada had about 66.5%, China 30.6%, France 26.5%, the U.S. 22.7% and India 19.5%. One reason for Europe's clean power transition moving at pace is the European Green Deal, an ambitious policy passed in 2019 that paved the way for climate laws to be updated. As a result of the deal, the EU made their targets more ambitious, aiming to cut 55% of the region's emissions by the end of the decade. The policy also aims to make Europe climate neutral — reducing the amount of additional emissions in the air to practically zero — by 2050. Hundreds of regulations and directives in European countries to incentivize investment in clean energy and reduce carbon pollution have been passed or are in the process of being ratified across Europe. 'At the start of the Deal, renewables were a third and fossil fuels accounted for 39% of Europe's electricity,' Rosslowe said. 'Now fossils generate only 29% and wind and solar have been driving the clean energy transition.' The amount of electricity generated by nuclear energy has remained relatively stable in the bloc. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has also spurred the move to clean energy in Europe. Gas prices skyrocketed — with much of Europe's gas coming from Russia becoming unviable — forcing countries to look for cheaper, cleaner alternatives. Portugal, Netherlands and Estonia witnessed the highest increase in clean power in the last five years. The transition to clean power helped Europe avoid more than $61 billion worth of fossil fuel imports for generating electricity since 2019. 'This is sending a clear message that their energy needs are going to be met through clean power, not gas imports,' said Pieter de Pous, a Brussels-based energy analyst at European think tank E3G. De Pous said the EU's origins were 'as a community of coal and steel because those industries were so important,' but it is now rapidly becoming a 'community of solar and wind power, batteries and smart technologies.' Nuclear growth in the bloc, meanwhile, has slowed. Across the European Union, retirements of nuclear plants have outpaced new construction since around the mid-2000s, according to Global Energy Monitor. As President Trump has pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement aimed at curbing warming and is pursuing a 'drill, baby, drill' energy policy, Rosslowe said the EU's leadership in clean power becomes all the more important. 'It's about increasing European energy independence, and it's about showing this climate leadership,' he said. On Tuesday, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen said: 'Europe will stay the course, and keep working with all nations that want to protect nature and stop global warming.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-posts-record-year-for-clean-energy/7947111.html	2025-01-22T17:14:43-08:00

US House passes immigrant detention bill	WASHINGTON — The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday gave final approval to a bill that requires the detainment of unauthorized migrants accused of theft and violent crimes, marking the first legislation that President Donald Trump can sign as Congress, with some bipartisan support, swiftly moved in line with his plans to crackdown on illegal immigration. Passage of the Laken Riley Act, which was named after a Georgia nursing student who was murdered last year by a Venezuelan man, shows just how sharply the political debate over immigration has shifted to the right following Trump's election victory. Immigration policy has often been one of the most entrenched issues in Congress, but a crucial faction of 46 politically vulnerable Democrats joined Republicans to lift the strict proposal to passage on a 263-156 vote tally. 'For decades, it has been almost impossible for our government to agree on solutions for the problems at our border and within our country,' said Senator Katie Britt, an Alabama Republican. She called the legislation 'perhaps the most significant immigration enforcement bill' to be passed by Congress in nearly three decades. Still, the bill would require a massive ramp up in U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement's capabilities, but it does not include any new funding. Meanwhile, Trump has launched a slew of executive orders intended to seal off the U.S. border with Mexico to immigration and ultimately deport millions of migrants without permanent legal status in the U.S. On Wednesday, Trump also canceled refugee resettlement, and his administration has signaled that it intends to prosecute local law enforcement officials who do not enforce his new immigration policies. Republican congressional leaders have made it clear they intend to follow suit. Their toughest challenge, however, will be finding a way to approve the funding to implement Trump's hardline plans. 'What he's doing is kickstarting what will ultimately be our legislative agenda,' said House Speaker Mike Johnson. House Republicans initially passed the legislation last year with support from 37 Democrats. It then languished in the Democratic-controlled Senate. This year, Republicans, now with control of both congressional chambers, have made it their top priority. When it came before the Senate, 12 Democrats voted in favor of passage, and when the House voted on a version of the bill earlier this month, 48 Democrats supported it. 'While the bill is not perfect, it sends a clear message that we think that criminals should be deported,' said Representative Tom Suozzi, a New York Democrat who has called on his party to support tougher immigration enforcement. Under the legislation, federal authorities would be required to detain any migrant arrested or charged with crimes such as shoplifting. The scope of the proposal was widened in the Senate to also include those accused of assaulting a police officer or crimes that injure or kill someone. The bill also gives legal standing to state attorneys general to sue the federal government for harm caused by federal immigration decisions. That gives states new power in setting immigration policy at a time when they have been trying to push back against presidential decisions under both the Trump and Biden administrations. Ultimately, even the Trump administration is likely to struggle to implement the new requirements unless Congress follows up later this year with funding. Republicans are strategizing how to push their priorities through Congress using a party-line process known as budget reconciliation. They have put the cost of funding Trump's border and deportation priorities at roughly $100 billion. The Department of Homeland Security has estimated the Laken Riley Act would cost $26.9 billion in the first year to implement, including an increase of 110,000 ICE detention beds. Most Democrats criticized the lack of funding in the bill as proof that it is a piecemeal approach that would do little to fix problems in the immigration system and saddle federal authorities with new requirements. 'The bill's authors claimed it's going to result in the arrest and detention of serious criminals, but it will not do that because it's a totally unfunded mandate,' said Democratic Senator Chris Murphy. Others raised concerns that the bill would strip due process rights for migrants, including minors or recipients of the Deferred Action for Unaccompanied Minors program. Senator Alex Padilla, a Democrat, said that federal authorities would now be forced to prioritize detention of migrants arrested for low-level crimes like shoplifting, rather than those who commit violent felonies. On the whole, there is no evidence that immigrants are more prone to violent crime. Several studies have found immigrants commit crimes at lower rates than those born in the U.S. Groups that advocate for restrictive immigration policies dispute or dismiss those findings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-passes-immigrant-detention-bill/7947071.html	2025-01-22T16:53:26-08:00	
Beijing's lack of clarity about Rubio sanctions sparks speculation in China	washington — Beijing’s lack of clarity about whether it will lift sanctions previously placed on Marco Rubio — the new U.S. secretary of state and a China hawk — has sparked speculation on Chinese social media about whether Rubio will become the first American diplomat in his position who can’t visit China. On Baidu, China’s most popular search engine, sitting atop the trending chart Tuesday night was the question, 'Will China remove sanctions on the new U.S. Secretary of State?' On Weibo, China’s microblogging site similar to X, netizens wonder if Rubio will become the first U.S. secretary of state who won’t be able to come to China. 'This guy has been barred from entering China, let alone visiting China,' one Weibo user commented. 'It’s now a question how he will be able to deal with China.' Tough on China Rubio, the first Cabinet member of the second Trump administration to be confirmed by the Senate, was sworn in Tuesday. He was one of the toughest congressional lawmakers on China during his 14-year tenure as a senator. Rubio introduced bills, made statements and worked with rights groups that were highly critical of China’s human rights record and growing influence around the world. A Chinese state media article once called him 'one of America's most radical anti-China politicians.' In 2020, within a month, the Chinese government sanctioned Rubio twice. The first was announced in July of that year as part of the retaliation against the U.S. government’s sanctions against a Chinese government department and four officials in Xinjiang for human rights violations alleged to have taken place in the region. The second one was announced in August after Washington sanctioned 11 Chinese and Hong Kong officials. 'I don’t want to be paranoid, but I am starting to think they don’t like me,' Rubio tweeted sarcastically back then after learning about the sanctions. During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio reaffirmed his position on China, asserting that China remains the 'biggest threat' to the United States in the 21st century. 'If we don’t change course, we are going to live in the world where much of what matters to us on a daily basis from our security to our health will be dependent on whether the Chinese allow us to have it or not,' he said during the hearing. On China’s heavily censored internet, most of the comments on his swearing-in have been negative. In a proposed Cabinet lineup that includes candidates who are controversial, Rubio stands out as one with bipartisan support. He received a unanimous 99 confirmation votes. Experts say that how Rubio approaches China will depend largely on President Donald Trump. 'Rubio has a long history of working on China. But everyone in the Cabinet is loyal to Trump. I do think Trump will be the ultimate decision maker on China,' Yun Sun, a senior fellow and co-director of the East Asia Program and director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, told VOA Mandarin. 'Any China policy will be a balance of issues to reach what Trump defines as American national interests. Hawkish views and friendly views will both be a part of the deal,' she said. Necessary to 'maintain contact' In his new role, Rubio has put Beijing in a peculiar position. The Chinese government has not publicly sent a clear signal regarding questions about whether it will lift sanctions on him to allow him to visit. When asked if China would drop the sanctions, Guo Jiakun, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, said Tuesday at the daily press conference, 'China will firmly defend national interests. In the meantime, it's necessary for high-level Chinese and American officials to maintain contact in an appropriate way.' Recent online speculation about Rubio has evolved since social media users noticed the Chinese government ostensibly changed its translation of Rubio’s name. Claims circulated that Beijing changed the translation so that it could lift sanctions on Rubio without looking embarrassed, because now China can say the sanctions were aimed at a different person than Rubio. But the so-called new translation isn’t new at all. The first translation has been the most widely used for Rubio in Chinese government documents and media. However, as early as 2019, People’s Daily, Beijing’s flagship state media outlet and a mouthpiece of the Chinese Communist Party, used the second translation to refer to Rubio in an attack article. Transcripts from China’s foreign ministry also show that when the two sanctions on him were unveiled in 2020, Rubio was referred to by a third variation of his name. The speculation garnered so much attention that Mao Ning, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry, was asked about it on Wednesday at a press conference. 'I am not yet aware of what you mentioned,' she said.

Gangs could overrun Haiti capital if aid falls short, UN chief says	United Nations — Haiti's capital could become overrun by criminal gangs if the international community does not step up aid to a United Nations-backed security mission there, U.N. chief Antonio Guterres warned in a report Wednesday. More money, equipment and personnel are needed for the Kenya-led international force, Guterres said, adding that any further delays risk the 'catastrophic' collapse of Haiti's security institutions and 'could allow gangs to overrun the entire metropolitan area' of Port-au-Prince. The U.N. secretary-general lamented that the mission is 'still not deployed to full strength,' limiting its capacity to support the Haitian national police. Haiti's Foreign Minister Jean-Victor Harvel Jean-Baptiste, speaking at a meeting of the U.N. Security Council, said that the country faced 'major difficulties' that threaten not just the population but also 'the very survival of the state.' The Security Council gave the green light in October 2023 to the Multinational Security Support (MSS) mission designed to support Haiti's authorities in their fight against gang violence. But since then, just under 800 of the 2,500 police officers hoped for have been deployed. More than 5,601 people were killed in Haiti last year as a result of gang violence, about a thousand more than in 2023, the U.N. said. In the report, Guterres said setbacks in Haiti's political process have 'contributed to a climate in which these atrocities have become possible.' Haiti currently has no president or parliament and is ruled by a transitional body, which is struggling to manage extreme violence linked to criminal gangs, poverty and other challenges. The U.N. also recorded 315 lynchings of people allegedly affiliated with gangs as well as 281 cases of alleged summary executions by police. More than a million Haitians have been forced to flee their homes, three times as many as a year ago. The Caribbean nation has suffered from decades of instability, but the situation escalated last February when armed groups launched coordinated attacks in the capital to overthrow then-Prime Minister Ariel Henry. Unpopular and unelected, Henry stepped down in April, his resignation eventually giving way to a transitional government, which had by November fired its interim prime minister and replaced him with current Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime. The U.N. Special Representative in Haiti, Maria Isabel Salvador, criticized the 'increasing fragmentation' of the temporary council. 'While there is progress on the political front and reason to be timidly hopeful, the transition framework remains fragile,' she told the U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. Salvador said the humanitarian situation had reached 'alarming levels,' saying that over six million people -- nearly half the population -- required humanitarian assistance. The United States had, under former President Joe Biden, backed a request by Haitian authorities to transform the security mission into a U.N. peacekeeping force, but faced opposition from China and Russia. So far, the mission has had limited impact on the frequency of attacks by armed groups, who are accused of committing numerous murders, rapes and kidnappings for ransom. The attacks have also targeted key buildings and infrastructure, which forced the closure of the capital's airport to commercial flights in November.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gangs-could-overrun-haiti-capital-if-aid-falls-short-un-chief-says/7947093.html	2025-01-22T16:47:31-08:00	
Trump signals aggressive stance as US races China in AI development	Before he had been in office for 48 hours, President Donald Trump sent a clear signal that to outpace China, his administration will be pursuing an aggressive agenda when it comes to pushing the United States forward on the development of artificial intelligence and the infrastructure that powers it. On his first day in office, Trump rescinded an executive order signed in 2023 by former President Joe Biden that sought to place some guardrails around the development of more and more powerful generative AI tools and to create other protections for privacy, civil rights and national security. The following day, Trump met with the leaders of several leading technology firms, including Sam Altman, CEO of Open AI; Larry Ellison, chairman of Oracle; and Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank, to announce a $500 billion private sector investment in AI infrastructure known as Stargate. 'Beginning immediately, Stargate will be building the physical and virtual infrastructure to power the next generation of advancements in AI, and this will include the construction of colossal data centers,' Trump said in a media event at the White House on Tuesday. Specifically, Stargate will invest in the creation of as many as 10 huge data centers in the United States that will provide the computing for artificial intelligence systems. The first data center is already under construction in Texas. The massive private sector investment will create up to 100,000 U.S. jobs, the executives said. Keeping AI in the US 'What we want to do is, we want to keep it in this country,' Trump said. 'China is a competitor, and others are competitors. We want it to be in this country, and we're making it available. I'm going to help a lot through emergency declarations, because we have an emergency. We have to get this stuff built.' The assembled tech leaders took the opportunity to praise the new president. 'I think this will be the most important project of this era,' Altman said. 'We wouldn’t be able to do this without you, Mr. President.' Janet Egan, a senior fellow in the technology and national security program at the Center for a New American Security, said that all the signals Trump is sending indicate he is serious about maintaining the United States’ current advantages in the development of advanced AI. 'I think this shows that he's going to have a really clear mind as to how to partner closely with the private sector to enable them to speed up and run fast,' Egan said. 'We've also seen him take direct action on some of the bottlenecks that are impeding the development of AI infrastructure in the U.S., and a particular focus is energy.' OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, has relied on Microsoft data centers for its computing. The firm reportedly discussed with the Biden administration the regulatory hurdles of planning and permitting when building data centers. In a policy paper released earlier this month, OpenAI cited the competition with China, laying out its policy proposals to 'extending America’s global leadership in AI innovation.' 'Chips, data, energy and talent are the keys to winning on AI — and this is a race America can and must win,' the paper said. 'There’s an estimated $175 billion sitting in global funds awaiting investment in AI projects, and if the U.S. doesn’t attract those funds, they will flow to China-backed projects — strengthening the Chinese Communist Party’s global influence.' Patrick Hedger, director of policy at NetChoice, a technology trade association, told VOA that the Stargate announcement 'immediately signaled to me that private capital is more than willing to come off the sidelines these days with the new Trump administration.' As part of his flurry of executive actions on Monday, Trump eliminated several preexisting executive orders placing limits on fossil fuel extraction and power generation. In the White House event on Monday, Trump also noted that AI data centers consume vast amounts of electricity and said he would be clearing the way for Stargate and other private companies to invest in new energy generation projects. China competition While Trump eliminated many of Biden’s executive orders immediately on Monday, he does not appear to have taken action against some of the former president’s other AI-related initiatives. Last year, Biden took several steps to restrict China’s access to cutting-edge technology related to AI, specifically, restricting the ability of companies that sell advanced semiconductors and the machinery used to produce them to Chinese firms. On that issue, Egan said, Trump and Biden appear to be on the same page. 'I think it's important to also note the continuity in how Trump's approaching AI,' she said. 'He, too, sees it as a national security risk and national security imperative. ... So, I think we should expect to see this run-fast approach to AI complemented by continued efforts to understand and manage emerging risks. Particularly cyber, nuclear, biological risks, as well as a more muscular approach to export controls and enforcement.' Speed and safety Louis Rosenberg, CEO and chief scientist at Unanimous AI and a prominent figure in the field for decades, told VOA he thinks there is a bipartisan consensus that AI needs to be developed speedily but also responsibly. 'At the highest level, the accelerating risks around frontier AI is not a partisan issue,' he wrote in an email exchange. 'Both parties realize that significant safeguards will be needed as AI gets increasingly intelligent and flexible, especially as autonomous AI agents get released at large scale.' Rosenberg said the most significant question is how the U.S. can remain the global leader in AI development while making sure the systems that are deployed are safe and reliable. 'I suspect the Trump administration will address AI risks by deploying its own targeted policies that are not as broad as the Biden executive order was but can address real threats much faster,' he wrote. 'The Biden executive order was very useful in raising the alarm about AI, but from a practical perspective it did not provide meaningful protections from the important emerging risks. 'Ultimately we need to find a way to move fast on AI development and move fast on AI protection. We need speed on both fronts,' Rosenberg said.

Trump escalates campaign against diversity, threatens private sector probes	U.S. President Donald Trump escalated his campaign against diversity programs on Tuesday by pressuring the private sector to join the initiative and telling government employees in offices administering such programs they would be placed on paid leave. On his first day in office, Trump issued a series of executive orders to end diversity, equity and inclusion programs, which attempt to promote opportunities for women, ethnic minorities, LGBTQ+ people and other traditionally underrepresented groups. Civil rights advocates have argued that such programs are necessary to address long-standing inequities and structural racism. Trump and his supporters say DEI programs end up unfairly discriminating against other Americans and weaken the importance of candidates' merit in job hiring or promotion. In an executive order issued on Tuesday, Trump revoked executive orders dating as far back as 1965 on environmental actions, equal employment opportunities and encouragement to federal contractors to achieve workforce balancing on race, gender and religion. The 1965 order that was revoked was signed by then-President Lyndon Johnson to protect the rights of workers employed by federal contractors and ensure they remained free from discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or national origin, according to the Labor Department. The Trump executive order seeks to dissuade private companies that receive government contracts from using DEI programs and hiring on the basis of race and sex — what the order called 'illegal DEI discrimination and preferences' — and asks government agencies to identify private companies that might be subject to civil investigation. 'As a part of this plan, each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars,' the order said. Full details on how the Trump administration would enforce 'civil compliance investigations' were not immediately available. The order issued on Tuesday stipulates that federal and private-sector employment preferences for military veterans could continue. The executive order was celebrated by conservative activists and Republican leaders. It was also met with condemnation from civil rights leaders who are strategizing how to respond to Trump's actions. Reverend Al Sharpton, founder and president of the National Action Network, formally announced Wednesday the organization and its partners plan to identify two companies in the next 90 days that will be boycotted for abandoning DEI pledges. Reuters first reported the coordinated action ahead of Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Basil Smikle Jr., a political strategist and policy adviser, said he was troubled by the Trump administration's assertion that diversity programs were 'diminishing the importance of individual merit, aptitude, hard work and determination' because it suggested women and people of color lacked merit or qualifications. 'There's this clear effort to hinder, if not erode, the political and economic power of people of color and women,' Smikle said. 'What it does is opens up the door for more cronyism,' he said. The White House did not immediately respond to a request from Reuters to address criticism from civil rights advocates. Separately, the Trump administration instructed U.S. federal government departments and agencies to dismantle all DEI programs, advising employees of such programs that they would be immediately placed on paid leave. The government should by the end of business on Wednesday inform employees of any government offices or units focused exclusively on DEI that their programs will be shut down and employees placed on leave, the Office of Personnel Management said in a memorandum. The Tuesday memo also included a template for agency heads to use, encouraging federal employees to report alleged attempts by 'some in government to disguise' continued use of DEI programs and initiatives 'by using coded or imprecise language.' A directive, using nearly identical wording, was distributed Wednesday to staff at various federal agencies and departments, including the State Department, according to a memo viewed by Reuters. Trump also signed a memorandum on Tuesday that ends a Biden administration initiative to promote diversity in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), ordering the FAA administrator to immediately stop DEI hiring programs, the White House said. Trump ordered the FAA to conduct a safety review that would replace any employees who fail to demonstrate their competence. 'President Trump is immediately terminating this illegal and dangerous program and requiring that all FAA hiring be based solely on ensuring the safety of airline passengers and overall job excellence,' the White House said in a fact sheet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-escalates-campaign-against-diversity-threatens-private-sector-probes-/7946801.html	2025-01-22T15:20:23-08:00	
Austin Tice's mother travels to Syria to search for missing son	WASHINGTON/DAMASCUS, SYRIA — At a recent press conference in the Four Seasons Hotel in Syria's capital, Damascus, Debra Tice made clear that she would never give up searching for her son, Austin. A former U.S. Marine-turned-journalist, Austin Tice was detained at a checkpoint in Syria in 2012. Little has been heard or seen of him since, but he is believed to have been held in Damascus. After the Bashar al-Assad government fell in December, U.S. officials made a few short visits to Syria, but Tice's family said they had expected more. Debra said she had hoped the U.S. government would send an official search team, but she wasn't shocked that they didn't. 'You can't even believe it. It's heartbreaking,' she said. Watch related report by Cristina Caicedo Smit and Liam Scott: In the weeks after the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — known as HTS — overthrew the Assad government, hundreds of people were released from prisons run by the former government. Scenes of families reuniting had raised hope among the Tice family. Just days before Assad fell, the family had convened in Washington to say they had received recent evidence confirming Tice was alive. At the press conference on Monday, Debra said that she feels solidarity with the many Syrians who have had a family member disappear. These families 'understand the pain that we carry every day, that our families carry, that the nieces and nephews that have never met their uncles carry,' she said. 'For all the mothers whose sons were disappeared in these dungeons, our hearts are joined,' she said. When Roger Carstens, the U.S. hostage envoy for the Biden and first Trump administration, visited Damascus in late December, he told reporters that U.S. officials weren't able to be on the ground for extended periods of time to search for Tice. Trump's new nominee for the hostage envoy position is Adam Boehler, whose confirmation hearing has yet to be scheduled. Watch related report by Cristina Caicedo Smit: On the ground in Syria, the Washington-based nonprofit Hostage Aid Worldwide has been leading efforts to locate Tice. Soon after Assad fell, the team began searching former prisons and buildings, including one that the group's president, Nizar Zakka, described as a secret detention center. The facility was dark and grimy. Like in previous prisons they inspected, they found documents, but no people. 'We are learning more and more about how the prison systems operate in Syria, how it was operating, how it was moving, who managed what,' Zakka told VOA after a search. 'It's going to take time to find Austin.' In December, the U.S. State Department announced it was increasing its award to $10 million for information about Tice's whereabouts. 'I understand the State Department, that they're outside of Syria and they want to feel like they're doing something,' Zakka said. But the increased reward has led to an increase in tips with unhelpful information, he said. A State Department spokesperson told VOA that efforts to find Tice remain under way. 'We are working to get U.S. officials into Damascus for additional trips to help direct the search and will do so as soon as we confirm the conditions are safe and local authorities can accommodate the visit,' the spokesperson said in a Thursday statement. Advocates say it feels as if the search for Tice has fallen on civil society groups, rather than the U.S. government. 'It definitely feels like that — that they're standing back at this time,' according to Bill McCarren, the executive director at the National Press Club's Press Freedom Center in Washington. 'There does need to be a more sustained effort,' said McCarren, who has worked on Tice's case for years. In Damascus, Tice's mother said she was hopeful that the new Trump administration would help secure her son's release. 'I have great hope that the Trump administration will sincerely engage in diligent work to bring Austin home,' she said. 'His people have already reached out to me.' While visiting the Syrian capital, she also met with Syria's new de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa. 'It was so wonderful to learn that they are dedicated and determined to bring home my son,' she said. But for Zakka of Hostage Aid Worldwide, the Syrian transitional government is also making it harder for his organization to search for Tice. Soon after Assad fell, Zakka said his group had a lot of freedom. But now, 'there's more restrictions every day,' Zakka said. 'It's getting difficult.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/austin-tice-s-mother-travels-to-syria-to-search-for-missing-son/7946775.html	2025-01-22T15:02:10-08:00	
Russia's Arctic militarization behind Trump's focus on Greenland	Nuuk, Greenland — A blizzard whips the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe Islands flags above the Joint Arctic Command headquarters overlooking the harbor of Nuuk, the capital of Greenland. The small military outpost staffed by around 80 personnel oversees Danish security for the vast Arctic island of some 2.1 million square kilometers. Greenland’s government is largely autonomous, but the island is part of the Danish Kingdom, and Denmark retains responsibility for its security. U.S. President Donald Trump has made clear his determination to take ownership of the island for the United States and hasn’t ruled out using economic or military force. Speaking hours after his inauguration, Trump reiterated his view that U.S. control was necessary for 'international security' because, he explained, 'You have Russian boats all over the place. You have China boats all over the place, warships. And [Denmark] can't maintain it.' Russian missiles The United States has long viewed Greenland as vitally important for its defense, explained Marc Jacobsen, an analyst at the Royal Danish Defense College in Copenhagen. 'There's no doubt that it's geostrategically important in defending the U.S. national security against Russian missiles,' Jacobsen told VOA. 'The shortest route for Russian missiles towards the U.S. is via the North Pole, via Greenland.' Russia has invested heavily in its Arctic military footprint in recent years. Its northernmost Nagurskoye air base on Siberia’s northern coast hosts nuclear-capable strategic bombers, missile and surveillance systems. Russian nuclear submarines patrol the Arctic seas, while a growing fleet of nuclear-powered ice breakers projects Kremlin power across the region. China and Russia have conducted joint military drills in the Arctic. Beijing is also seeking access to valuable minerals beneath the ice. 'There is definitely a threat, especially from Russian military capacities in that region. And NATO countries are right now moving to increase their capacity,' Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen, also of the Royal Danish Defense College, told VOA. Denmark’s defense Denmark’s military capabilities on Greenland consist of four aging naval patrol vessels, a surveillance plane and dog sled patrols. Copenhagen announced plans last month to invest in new surveillance drones, two new ships and additional personnel, along with upgrading an existing air base to accommodate F-35 fighter jets. The exact cost has yet to be decided, but the government said it would spend a 'double-digit billion amount' in Danish kroner, or at least $1.5 billion. Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen admitted, however, that the government has failed to invest in Greenland’s security. 'We have neglected for many years to make the necessary investments in our ships, in the aircraft that will help to monitor our kingdom, and that is what we are now trying to do something about,' he told reporters on Jan. 9. 'We will hopefully create an investment package where we will strengthen our ability to monitor what is happening in the Arctic, and also for some new capacities to be put into place.' Denmark hopes the upgrades will go toward 'meeting American demands for increasing the surveillance of Greenland,' Jacobsen said. US Space base The U.S. military has been present in Greenland since World War II, when American forces were deployed to the island following Denmark’s fall to Nazi Germany. At the height of the U.S. deployment, Greenland hosted more than 10,000 U.S. service personnel. The Pituffik Space Base on Greenland’s northwest coast, formerly known as the Thule Air Base, is the United States’ northernmost military facility. It now hosts around 200 military personnel, alongside missile warning, defense and space surveillance systems. 'The military protection of Greenland de facto relies on the U.S.,' Rahbek-Clemmensen said. 'And the big question is then whether the U.S. wants to enhance that presence, perhaps to be able to do other types of military operations in that area.' That may be why, he added, Danish officials appear to be approaching the issue in a manner that maintains good U.S. relations. 'The Danish government has been trying to touch on that word 'control' that Trump uses, which is a very ambiguous term,' he added. 'What does control mean? Does it mean owning a piece of territory? Or does it mean having a certain amount of military equipment on that territory?' US-Danish relations At Denmark’s Arctic command center in Nuuk, the U.S. flag flies alongside the Danish, Greenlandic and Faroe Islands colors. The building also hosts the U.S. Consulate — a sign that, for the time being, U.S.-Danish relations remain cordial. Before Trump’s inauguration, the U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen said there were no plans to expand U.S. military presence in Greenland. That could change under the new president. For now, Denmark and its European allies are hoping that Trump’s comments are part of a strategy to force NATO allies to spend more on defense. 'There's an important element which is about his personality, which he brings into the way that U.S. diplomacy, or his diplomacy, is carried out,' Jacobsen said. 'In a positive light, if the USA increases its presence in the Arctic, it will increase the NATO presence, because the seven Arctic states — besides Russia — we are all members of NATO now.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-arctic-militarization-behind-trump-s-focus-on-greenland/7946621.html	2025-01-22T14:31:53-08:00	
Georgia's Zourabichvili says US shouldn't back government that is result of 'rigged elections'	washington — Last December, Georgia’s parliament chose Mikheil Kavelashvili, a close ally of ruling Georgian Dream party founder Bidzina Ivanishvili, as the country’s new president. He replaced Salome Zourabichvili, who had won the presidency in 2018 in a popular vote. Zourabichvili was the country’s fifth president. Opposition parties and Zourabichvili contend that the country’s October 2024 parliamentary elections, which Georgian Dream officially won with 54.09% of the vote, were rigged, and that therefore neither Georgian Dream’s victory nor Kavelashvili’s replacement of Zourabichvili as president was legitimate. The opposition parties have refused to enter parliament and work with Georgian Dream members and are demanding new elections. Zourabichvili was in Washington to attend the inauguration of President Donald Trump at the invitation of Representative Joe Wilson, a Republican from South Carolina. While in the U.S. capital, she spoke with Voice of America. The following transcript of that interview has been edited for brevity and clarity: VOA: Thank you for being here at VOA. We know that you attended the inauguration of the 47th president of the United States but also had a chance to meet with members of President Trump’s Cabinet. What was your main message during those meetings? Salome Zourabichvili, former president of Georgia: Well, those … were more social encounters before the inauguration and before the confirmation of those Cabinet members. I met them during different receptions and at [an inaugural] ball. So it was not a place for [a] formal meeting [or] for relaying formal messages. It's very important that contact was established. My short message was that Georgia [is] at a very crucial turning point today, in a region that is very important for the United States and for the United States’ interests, and so there should be immediate attention for what is happening in Georgia, in the Caucasus, in the Black Sea, from the new administration. VOA: You often say that Georgia needs the U.S., but the U.S. also needs Georgia. Why should Georgia be important for the United States, and what role could Georgia play in the South Caucasus [and] the wider region? Zourabichvili: First of all, because the Russians know that more than anybody else: They always said historically that whoever controls Tbilisi … controls the Caucasus. And that is even more important today, at a time when this region is becoming very important for control of the Black Sea. ... The ports of the Black Sea are very important. And it's not a coincidence that Russia started the war against Ukraine also for control of that part of the Black Sea coast, starting with Crimea in 2014. And it's no coincidence that the hybrid war Russia … has started with the elections in Georgia, also with the elections in Romania, and to rig the elections, in a very different manner, in Moldova – so those three countries, if you look at the map, are countries of the Black Sea. So the strategy of Russia is very clear. Hence the strategy of the United States should be [a] continuation of what it has been over the years, which was to consolidate Georgia … [as] a stronghold of democracy. [The] Georgian army would not exist were it not for American support. So I think that shows that this was not just for sympathy of, but because there was a serious, real American interest in supporting Georgia. And I'm confident that these interests are still there and even more today than maybe in the past. VOA: You were invited to attend the inauguration by Congressman Joe Wilson, one of the authors in the U.S House of Representatives of the MEGOBARI Act [aimed at bolstering democracy and countering Russian influence in Georgia], and the Georgian Nightmare Non-Recognition Act [prohibiting the U.S. from recognizing the Ivanishvili regime and recognizing Zourabichvili as Georgia’s legitimate president]. Could you explain why you think it is so important for the U.S. government not to recognize the current Georgian government? Zourabichvili: I think it is not possible for a country like the United States to recognize a government that is the result of rigged elections and anti-constitutional acts … a regime in which no independent institution is left; all the institutions are just nominated by one party and one-man rule. That is really destroying everything that the United States has been doing in this country. Building institutions — not only the army; it's all the institutions — support for reform of the justice system, creation of the anti-corruption system and all of that, which is really the work of more than 30 years since the independence of Georgia. What is happening today is really destroying all of that. VOA: You, the opposition and part of Georgian people are asking for new elections. Is that the main demand at this moment? Zourabichvili: I'm still hoping that the de facto leaders [of Georgia] would recognize that stability of the country is the most important thing and would come to terms with helping the country by [holding] new elections, through some compromise with the opposition. But as time goes by, there's probably less and less hope that they would come to such a sensible solution. And what will then happen most probably is that the regime will dissolve, because it cannot resist either the sanctions, the economic and financial situation that we are getting into, the fact that it's rejected by the vast majority of the country and is isolated from all the partners, Americans and Europeans, that have been really supporting Georgia over the years. VOA: Different experts we talk with say that Georgia is not going to be a top priority of the Trump administration. How do you plan to bring Georgia to its attention? Zourabichvili: Well, we probably are never going to be the top priority, and I hope it won't be, because that means a crisis of a different level, which we don't want. Again, we do not want instability. But I think that what is happening in Georgia is quite important as an example. I don't think America [can] accept a country [that] has been supported and, really, constructed as a state by the United States, [making] friends with terrorist movements, with Iran, with China, and [handing over] strategic interests on the Black Sea, the port of Anaklia, or new communications lines, to China, which is what is happening.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-s-zourabichvili-says-us-shouldn-t-back-government-that-is-result-of-rigged-elections-/7946741.html	2025-01-22T14:07:59-08:00

Trump administration freezes many health agency reports, online posts	The Trump administration has put a freeze on many federal health agency communications with the public through at least the end of the month. In a memo obtained by The Associated Press, acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Dorothy Fink told agency staff leaders Tuesday that an 'immediate pause' had been ordered on — among other things — regulations, guidance, announcements, press releases, social media posts and website posts until such communications had been approved by a political appointee. The pause also applies to anything intended to be published in the Federal Register, where the executive branch communicates rules and regulations, and the Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention scientific publication. The pause is in effect through February 1, the memo said. Agencies subject to the HHS directive include the CDC, the National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration — entities that fight epidemics, protect the nation's food supply, and search for cures to diseases. HHS officials did not respond to requests for comment on the pause, which was first reported by The Washington Post. Four federal health officials speaking on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to discuss the issue confirmed the communication pause to the AP. A former HHS official said Wednesday that it's not unusual for incoming administrations to pause agency communications for review. But typically, officials working on the president's transition team have the process for issuing documents running smoothly by inauguration day. 'The executive branch is a hierarchy,' said Steven Grossman, who now consults for food and drug companies, in an email. 'Whether stated publicly or not, every new administration wants important commitments and positions to wait until new teams are in place and some semblance of hierarchy restored.' A pause is reasonable as a changing executive branch takes steps to become coordinated, said Dr. Ali Khan, a former CDC outbreak investigator who is now dean of the University of Nebraska's public health college. 'The only concern would be is if this is a prelude to going back to a prior approach of silencing the agencies around a political narrative,' he added. During his first term, President Donald Trump's political appointees tried to gain control over the CDC's MMWR journal, which had published information about the COVID-19 pandemic that conflicted with messaging from the White House. Fink wrote in her memo that some exceptions would be made for communications affecting 'critical health, safety, environmental, financial or nation security functions,' but that those would be subject to review. The FDA on Tuesday and Wednesday posted notices about warning letters sent to companies and a drug safety notice. A consumer advocacy group said the communications pause could still threaten public safety. Americans depend on timely information from the CDC, the FDA and other agencies to avoid foodborne illnesses and stay aware of other health issues, said Dr. Peter Lurie, president of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. 'When it comes to stopping outbreaks, every second counts,' Lurie said in a statement. 'Confusion around the vaguely worded gag order is likely to lead to unnecessary delay in publishing urgent public alerts during active outbreaks.' He was echoed by Dr. Jeffrey Klausner, a University of Southern California public health expert. 'Local health officials and doctors depend on the CDC to get disease updates, timely prevention, testing and treatment guidelines and information about outbreaks,' Klausner wrote in an email. 'Shutting down public health communication stops a basic function of public health. Imagine if the government turned off fire sirens or other warning systems.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-administration-freezes-many-health-agency-reports-online-posts/7946719.html	2025-01-22T13:53:52-08:00

Nigeria's new BRICS partner status sparks economic optimism, debate	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian authorities said this week that the nation’s new partnership status with the BRICS bloc could unlock critical opportunities in trade, investment and agriculture. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu’s special adviser told Lagos-based Channels Television that the partnership, which became official Friday, is pivotal to promoting trade, investment, food security, infrastructure development and energy security. The adviser, Daniel Bwala, said the pact enables Nigeria to forge deeper strategic relationships with BRICS members beyond traditional bilateral partnerships. BRICS — an acronym for the founding members of Brazil, Russia, India and China, with South Africa added a year later — is a political and economic bloc. BRICS introduced the 'partner country' category in October. Partner nations are a step below full membership. Economist Emeka Okengwu praised the arrangement. 'Look at the members of BRICS and the economies that they bring to the table. Brazil is probably the biggest producer of livestock and its products globally, then to aircraft, aviation and renewable energy,' Okengwu said. 'Look at Russia, India, China and South Africa, Egypt and Ethiopia. These are big populations. If you put them together, they probably bring 10 times the value of whatever Europe and America can give to you,' he said. In total, the 10 BRICS member states make up 40% of the global economy and 55% of the global population. In a statement, Nigeria’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said that the country’s participation in BRICS reflects its commitment to leveraging global economic opportunities to advance national development goals. Last December, Nigeria intensified efforts to join not only BRICS but also the G20 organization of the world’s major economies and the BRICS New Development Bank. Okengwu said the partnership will help Nigeria at 'being productive, taking goods and services in there, being able to meet global standards and being competitive.' 'It would've been horrible if Nigeria was not in BRICS and then we would've been left hanging with all these challenges we're having with our neighbors in the Sahel,' Okengwu said. Despite the optimism, analysts say Nigeria faces significant hurdles. The country’s struggling economy and inadequate infrastructure raise concerns about its capacity for meaningful growth through BRICS. There's also concern about how Nigeria will balance its alliances with Western nations while deepening ties with BRICS. However, Ndu Nwokolo, an economist with Nextier, suggested the challenge is manageable. 'It's about how smart you are to benefit from everybody,' Nwokolo said. 'With what we're seeing by some of the pronouncements of [U.S.] President [Donald] Trump, Nigeria may benefit from it because already Trump is talking about increasing taxes [tariffs] even within ally states. 'So, if he's going to do that with countries we think are traditional partners, so who's telling you that he will not do more with countries that he considers outsiders,' he said. 'So, we're looking at a situation where countries that are not originally traditional allies of America will try to pull together, and Nigeria may benefit from that.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-s-new-brics-partner-status-sparks-economic-optimism-debate/7946666.html	2025-01-22T13:06:38-08:00	
Trump's agriculture secretary pick led group opposed to ethanol, farm subsidies	President Donald Trump's pick to run the Agriculture Department, Brooke Rollins, led an organization that opposed ethanol mandates and farm subsidies, major programs she could influence if confirmed, according to a Reuters review of the group's policy statements. That background may put Rollins at odds with farm state lawmakers at her nomination hearing on Thursday and revive concerns in the powerful corn and biofuel lobbies about Trump's mixed record on ethanol during his first term in office. 'The hearing is a perfect occasion to renounce the misleading and demonstrably false statements made about ethanol by some of her colleagues more than a decade ago,' said Geoff Cooper, president and CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association, an ethanol trade group. Rollins was president and CEO of the Texas Public Policy Foundation from 2003 to 2018, during which time the oil industry-backed nonprofit argued that government support for ethanol contributed to higher emissions and rising food and fuel prices. The oil industry has seen ethanol as a threat to its share in the gasoline market. It says a federal mandate requiring the biofuel to be blended into the nation's fuel supply costs it a fortune in compliance costs. 'As a way to save the planet, not many policies are worse than government-backed ethanol. It’s bad for the economy, bad for the environment, doesn’t reduce greenhouse gases and has led to rapidly rising food prices,' said one article published by the Texas group in 2012. In 2017, Rollins endorsed Kathleen Hartnett White, the longtime director of the group's energy program, to serve as Trump's chair of the White House's Council on Environmental Quality. The White House later withdrew her nomination after a contentious hearing that included criticism of her ethanol positions from farm state senators. White had supported a 2008 effort by then-Texas Governor Rick Perry to partly waive the ethanol blending program, known as the Renewable Fuel Standard, in the state. The Environmental Protection Agency, which administers the program, denied Perry's request. During Rollins' tenure, the group also called for the elimination of farm subsidies in a 2016 report titled The Policymaker's Guide to Corporate Welfare. The report said offering loan guarantees to farmers to start or expand their operations 'introduces distortions into the marketplace.' The USDA issues billions of dollars in direct and guaranteed loans each year to support the domestic farm economy. Rollins, who served as acting director of the White House Domestic Policy Council during Trump's first term, is set to appear before the Senate Agriculture Committee for her nomination hearing on Thursday. 'Brooke Rollins will work to enact the president’s agenda, and you can look to President Trump’s past statements of support for biofuels to understand the administration’s position on this issue,' said Anna Kelly, a spokesperson for the Trump administration transition team. During his 2017-21 term, Trump boosted corn-based ethanol by enabling year-round sales of higher ethanol blends of gasoline, but he also angered the ethanol industry by expanding the use of waivers exempting small refiners from the federal blending requirement. Ethanol trade group Growth Energy said it supported Rollins' nomination and believed the Trump administration would support the ethanol industry's priorities. During the Biden administration, Rollins led the America First Policy Institute, a policy organization closely tied to Trump that has expressed skepticism about climate change. More than 400 state and national agriculture groups wrote to Senate Agriculture Committee leaders John Boozman and Amy Klobuchar on January 15 to endorse Rollins. 'Her close working relationship with incoming President Trump will ensure that agriculture and rural America have a prominent and influential voice at the table when critical decisions are made in the White House,' the letter said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-agriculture-secretary-pick-led-group-opposed-to-ethanol-farm-subsidies-/7946665.html	2025-01-22T12:39:46-08:00	
Trump revokes humanitarian parole for migrants from 4 countries	Washington — U.S. President Donald Trump ended on Monday a humanitarian parole program that benefited Cubans, Nicaraguans, Venezuelans, and Haitians. Under the executive order called 'Securing Our Borders,' which outlines various immigration-related actions, President Trump aimed to take 'all appropriate action' to build the border wall, deploying defense personnel to the southern border, and detain irregular migrants. It also asks for elimination of certain parole programs. One such program, the CHNV program (Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, Venezuela) allowed up to 30,000 individuals per month from those countries to enter the United States legally and stay for a period of up to two years, provided they had a U.S.-based supporter. As of December 2024, about 531,690 people had entered the country under that program, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. Beneficiaries were required to have a valid passport, arrange their own travel, and pass national security and public safety vetting, among other criteria. The Biden White House announced the CHNV parole program on January 5, 2023. Officials at the time said the initiative was part of the administration's efforts to discourage unlawful entries along the U.S. southern border. The program was modeled on the Ukraine program and an earlier Venezuelan program. Immediate effects The executive order took effect immediately. That means that no new applications will be accepted from individuals seeking to sponsor those migrants. Elizabeth Jacobs of the Center for Immigration Studies, a Washington-based group that advocates restricting immigration to the U.S., told VOA that those who have received parole already through this program will likely be allowed to remain in the United States as parolees until their parole period expires.' At that time, Jacobs said, those individuals would be 'without status' and at risk of deportation. Programs like CNHV were a way 'Americans have been able to legally and safely sponsor newcomers in need of refuge to come to the United States, including Afghan allies,' Nazanin Ash, CEO of Welcome.US, wrote on their website. 'Those who had parole protection before January 20 will have to seek immigration status through other means or risk deportation from the United States,' Cori Alonso-Yoder, told VOA. She is an immigration law professor at George Washington University. The executive orders do not indicate that humanitarian parole will be revoked for current beneficiaries of the program, said Doris Meissner of the Migration Policy Institute in Washington during a press call on Tuesday. However, 'they certainly will not renew it.' 'So what happens to those people? If they stay in the U.S. once the two-year period ends, they will, of course, fall into unauthorized status. They will lose their work authorization and will certainly be subject to deportation,' she noted. Other legal options The program was not a path to U.S. citizenship or permanent residence. However, according to immigration lawyers, beneficiaries may be able to adjust their immigration status from temporary parole to a more permanent one, such as a visa or sponsorship through a U.S. relative, which can lead to a green card. Cubans, after a year in the U.S., can apply for permanent residence under the Cuban Adjustment Act. Venezuelans and Haitians may qualify for Temporary Protected Status, which provides relief from deportation and work authorization. They could also apply for asylum along with Nicaraguans. However, they must demonstrate a credible fear of persecution in their home countries based on race, religion, nationality, social group, or political opinion.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-revokes-humanitarian-parole-for-migrants-from-four-countries/7946518.html	2025-01-22T11:47:16-08:00	
At least 2 students injured in shooting at Nashville high school, police say	NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE — At least two students were wounded by gunfire at a Nashville high school Wednesday but the situation has been contained, police said. Metro Nashville Police spokesperson April Weatherly could not immediately describe the conditions of those who were shot at Antioch High School, which has about 2,000 students and is located in a neighborhood of Nashville about 16 kilometers southeast of downtown. The shooter is believed to have shot two students before shooting themself, according to Weatherly, who could not immediately say if the shooter was a student. School officials are asking parents not to go to the high school to pick up their children. They were asked to go to a nearby hospital instead. Students will be bused there as they are released from the school by police. The FBI in Nashville referred questions to the Metro Nashville Police Department, which is leading the investigation, spokesperson Elizabeth Clement-Webb said in an email. She said Nashville police had not asked for the FBI's help in the investigation as of early Wednesday afternoon. In March 2023, a shooter killed three 9-year-olds and three adults at a private Christian elementary school in the city, The Covenant School.	https://www.voanews.com/a/students-injured-in-shooting-at-nashville-high-school-police-say/7946512.html	2025-01-22T11:24:42-08:00	
Pentagon to send up to 1,500 active duty troops to help secure US-Mexico border, officials say	WASHINGTON — The Pentagon will begin deploying as many as 1,500 active duty troops to help secure the southern border in the coming days, U.S. officials said Wednesday, putting in motion plans President Donald Trump laid out in executive orders shortly after he took office to crack down on immigration. Acting Defense Secretary Robert Salesses was expected to sign the deployment orders on Wednesday, but it wasn't yet clear which troops or units will go, and the total could fluctuate. It remains to be seen if they will end up doing law enforcement, which would put American troops in a dramatic new role, not done in recent history. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the announcement has not yet been made. The active duty forces would join the roughly 2,500 U.S. National Guard and Reserve forces already there. There are currently no active duty troops working along the border. The forces are expected to be used to support border patrol agents, with logistics, transportation and construction of barriers. They have done similar duties in the past, when both Trump and former President Joe Biden sent active duty troops to the border. Troops are prohibited by law from doing law enforcement duties on the border, but that may change. Trump has directed through executive order that the incoming secretary of defense and incoming homeland security chief report back within 90 days if they think an 1807 law called the Insurrection Act should be invoked. That would allow those troops to be used in civilian law enforcement on U.S. soil. The widely expected deployment, coming in Trump's first week in office, was an early step in his long-touted plan to expand the use of the military along the border. In one of his first orders on Monday, Trump directed the defense secretary to come up with a plan to 'seal the borders' and repel 'unlawful mass migration.' On Tuesday, just as Trump fired the Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Linda Fagan, the service announced it was surging more cutter ships, aircraft and personnel to the 'Gulf of America' — another nod to the president's directive to rename the Gulf of Mexico. Trump said during his inaugural address on Monday that 'I will declare a national emergency at our southern border. All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places in which they came.' In his first term, Trump also ordered active duty troops to the border to help the Department of Homeland Security and border control agents, in response to a caravan of migrants slowly making its way through Mexico toward the United States in 2018. In executive orders signed Monday, Trump suggested the military would help DHS with 'detention space, transportation (including aircraft), and other logistics services.' U.S. active duty troops are forbidden from doing law enforcement duties under the Posse Comitatus Act, a 19th century federal law. So they can't arrest or detain people at the border, unless the president acts to invoke the Insurrection Act. The Insurrection Act allows presidents to call on reserve or active duty military units to respond to unrest in the states, an authority that is not reviewable by the courts. During the 2018 deployment, more than 7,000 active duty troops were sent to Texas, Arizona and California, including military police, an assault helicopter battalion, various communications, medical and headquarters units, combat engineers, planners and public affairs units. At the time, the Pentagon was adamant that active duty troops would not do law enforcement. So they spent much of their time transporting border patrol agents to and along the border, helping them erect additional vehicle barriers and fencing along the border, assisting them with communications and providing some security for border agent camps. The military also provided border patrol agents with medical care, pre-packaged meals and temporary housing. Normally, in deployments to the border in support of the Department of Homeland Security, Pentagon officials request specifics from DHS on what needs to be accomplished, and military leaders then decide what troops should go and how many.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-to-send-up-to-1-500-active-duty-troops-to-help-secure-us-mexico-border-officials-say/7946463.html	2025-01-22T11:00:43-08:00	
US lawmakers warn of ‘emboldened’ terror threat	WASHINGTON — Top Republican lawmakers are calling for U.S. security agencies to quickly change course under President Donald Trump to better confront threats from terror groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida. The House Homeland Security Committee on Wednesday issued an update threat assessment, highlighting the New Year’s Day truck ramming attack in New Orleans, which killed 14 people, as well as the June 2024 arrest of eight Tajik nationals with suspected Islamic State ties. 'Make no mistake — all of the lights are still blinking red,' said committee chair Republican Representative Mark Green in a statement. 'The New Orleans terrorist attack was a stark reminder that the terror threat to America is alive and persistent,' said Green. 'Foreign terrorist organizations and jihadist networks abroad remain committed to recruiting and radicalizing individuals on U.S. soil.' Green’s comments harken back to a 2023 warning from then-FBI Director Christopher Wray, made in the aftermath of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel, which officials said seemed to inspire terror groups around the world. 'I've never seen a time where all the threats, or so many of the threats, are all elevated, all at exactly the same time,' Wray said at the time. Last year, Wray warned the FBI was increasingly concerned about a coordinated terror attack on the U.S. like the March 2024 Islamic State terror attacks on a Moscow concert hall. The Department of Homeland Security's 2025 annual threat assessment, issued this past October, warned, 'The terrorism threat environment in the United States over the next year will remain high.' And it attributed the biggest danger to individuals who are not necessarily affiliated with established terror groups. 'The threat will continue to be characterized primarily by lone offenders or small cells motivated to violence by a combination of racial, religious, gender, or anti-government grievances; conspiracy theories; and personalized factors,' it said. Green on Wednesday blamed the increased threat on the administration of former President Joe Biden, saying terror groups have been 'emboldened by the national security blunders of the past four years.' The committee’s 'Terror Threat Snapshot' cited more than 50 terrorism cases in 30 U.S. states since April 2021 and 187 terrorism arrests, attacks and plots in Western Europe since the start of 2023. Democrats expressed some disappointment, arguing the comments have not been backed up by the committee’s actions to date. 'It’s a bit confusing,' according to one staffer, who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity in order to respond to the chair’s comments. 'Why haven’t they had substantive hearings on foreign terrorism and homegrown violent extremism?' Meanwhile, a new report Wednesday by the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies cautioned that while there is reason to be concerned about the exploits and ambitions of groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida, the threat inside the United States does not appear to be growing. 'Longer-term trends suggest that jihadist terrorism in the United States is not resurgent,' according to the report. 'Groups such as the Islamic State and al-Qaida have filled more of an inspirational role rather than directly orchestrating attacks on the United States,' it said. 'The average lethality of jihadist terrorist attacks has also fallen since the peak of the [Islamic State] caliphate.' The CSIS report found there were a yearly average of 38 recorded attacks or plots in the U.S. from 2020 to 2023, but only 21 recorded plots or attacks during the first 11 months of 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-warn-of-emboldened-terror-threat/7946462.html	2025-01-22T10:55:02-08:00	
Islamic State claims killing of Chinese national in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — Taliban authorities in northeastern Afghanistan said Wednesday that a gun attack resulted in the death of a Chinese national, while his local interpreter escaped unharmed. An Afghanistan-based Islamic State affiliate, IS-Khorasan, claimed responsibility for the deadly overnight shooting in Takhar province, which sits on the country’s border with Tajikistan. The terrorist outfit said on its Amaq media outlet that its 'soldiers' used a machine gun to target the Chinese man. Taliban officials said the slain foreigner was working for a mining company in the country. Mohammad Akbar, the provincial police chief, said the Chinese citizen was being driven with his interpreter to the Dasht-e-Qala district late Tuesday when their vehicle was ambushed. Akbar said that foreign travelers must notify local police before embarking on a road trip, but he said the deceased Chinese citizen failed to do so. The police officer added that an investigation into the attack was underway. 'I believe our embassy in Afghanistan will track the information over what’s happened and do its utmost to protect the lawful rights and interests of Chinese citizens and their safety,' said Mao Ning, a spokesperson for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, during a press conference in Beijing when asked about the shooting incident. Tuesday’s fatal assault on a Chinese national in Afghanistan marked the first such incident since December 2022, when IS-Khorasan militants stormed a Kabul hotel popular with Chinese investors. That attack resulted in the deaths of three Afghans and injuries to 18 people, including five Chinese nationals. The Taliban regained control of Afghanistan in August 2021, when the United States and its Western allies withdrew their troops from the country after a nearly two-decade-long presence. While de facto Afghan rulers assert they have restored peace and order to the conflict-torn country since seizing power, IS-Khorasan has conducted repeated high-profile attacks targeting Taliban leaders, key religious figures and members of the Afghan minority Shiite community. No country has officially recognized the fundamentalist Taliban as legitimate rulers in Kabul, mainly over their sweeping curbs on Afghan women’s rights and freedoms and other human rights concerns. China was the first country to appoint an ambassador to Afghanistan and recognized a Taliban ambassador in Beijing since the group took control. It also has enhanced bilateral trade and investment ties with the de facto Kabul government to help stabilize the Afghan economy and deal with a dire humanitarian crisis. Chinese investors have signed significant agreements with Kabul in the Afghan mining and oil sectors since the Taliban takeover. Analysts suggest that China’s security concerns are motivating its growing diplomatic and economic engagement with the Taliban to prevent the country from descending into chaos again, which could lead to militants using Afghan territory as a base for launching terrorist attacks against Chinese interests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-claims-killing-of-chinese-national-in-afghanistan/7946312.html	2025-01-22T09:59:17-08:00	
Reporter's Notebook: Navigating journalism in the 'new' Syria	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — 'Here’s a good first line for you,' says VOA photojournalist Yan Boechat as we drive up to a former ruling party office in Damascus. On the building are murals depicting Hafez al-Assad, the deceased dictator of Syria, and his son and successor, Bashar al-Assad, who fled Syria when the regime fell in December. 'The line is, ‘This may be one of the few places in Syria where pictures of Hafez are still intact,’' Boechat says. And he is correct. Most of Syria’s public art of the Assads has been torn down or defaced. At the entrance to Damascus’ main market, posters of Bashar al-Assad’s face are placed on the ground for residents to stomp on. But in this neighborhood, populated almost entirely by former regime soldiers and their families, the pictures remain untouched. As we get out to take pictures, a young soldier on a motorcycle zips over. His hair is scruffy, and his face is covered with a green, polyester neck scarf. He greats us politely, and my male colleagues shake his hand. The soldiers of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, also known as HTS, don’t shake women’s hands. 'It’s better if you coordinate with us,' the soldier says, after our translator explains that we are journalists, reporting on post-regime Syria. 'It’s over,' says Boechat, half sighing and half laughing. He doesn’t mean a definitive end to the new days of a free press in Syria. But it’s certainly the end of locals in this neighborhood speaking openly. They are former regime fighters, and the new bosses are former rebels. 'Every day it’s a little more,' I joke when we get in the car to follow the soldier to his base. When we first arrived in Syria in December, there were no regulations for the press, or really anything. Rebels had taken over Syria only days before. They hadn’t had time to set rules. But on this trip, this was starting to change. We had to apply for entry and stop by the Ministry of Information for reporting permits. And now, soldiers on the streets were asking questions. Of course, it’s still more free than under the Assads. If the regime was still in charge, we could have been arrested for reporting on our own. During Bashar al-Assad’s rule, I applied for journalism visas — unsuccessfully — multiple times. A friend of a friend in the old Ministry of Information later told me my applications never reached them. The embassy officers would 'file it to the trash,' like those of other unwanted Western reporters, we assumed. As we arrive with the young soldier at his base — a low, single room shack by the roadside — our translator, Husam Yunso, speaks to the soldiers. They tell us to ignore the locals in the neighborhood and delete the videos of them. 'They are regime supporters and liars,' one soldier says. They offer us a tour. We know that no one will speak openly when we are accompanied by armed guards, but they seem to be genuinely trying to help. 'It’s becoming more like Turkey,' Yunso says when we are back in the car. Like in Turkey, Yunso points out, the security forces interrupted our work but didn’t threaten us. 'Let’s hope it stays at the level of Turkey,' Yunso says. After the fall The days after the regime fell were a free-for-all. In city squares, flags waved and music blasted. Elated rebels fired AK47s into the air. As fighters freed thousands of prisoners, families crowded inside the emptied facilities, searching for clues about their missing loved ones. Journalists flocked to Syria’s borders. Boechat, Yunso and I first crossed a few days later in a small bus packed with our equipment, a Syrian family and bags of bananas. At an abandoned border-crossing station on the Syrian side, an HTS soldier, dressed in well-worn fatigues, poked his head into the window. 'Do you have any explosives?' he asked, before dissolving into laughter and waving us through. On the road to Damascus, we saw abandoned military vehicles, their contents, including regime uniforms, scattered. An explosion near one such scene unnerved me. It turned out to be on the site of an already bombed weapons depot, courtesy of Israel. Presumably, some explosives were popping off from the fire. On the way, Boechat regaled us with tales of the regime days, when journalists were assigned a 'minder.' The minder could help secure interviews or translate, but their main job was to report back to the government about what the journalists were doing. Minders also served as a constant reminder not to touch taboo subjects. A week later and still minder-free, we entered Sednaya Prison, the flagship house of torture for political prisoners under the Assad regime. It may not have been the worst in the country, but it was the most notorious. Thousands of prisoners were freed from it when the rebels took over. Many left physically battered and mentally devastated, described by one former prisoner, named only as Ahmed, as 'mummies, not people.' Much of the trauma, Ahmed told us, came from witnessing nonstop deadly beatings and executions. When asked if he thought the families searching for lost relatives would find them, he replied, 'There is no one. … They were all killed.' Establishing order By the time we returned to Syria in early January, the new Ministry of Information was up and running. Housed in the same building, it even had some of the same staff. Nabih Bulos, the Middle East chief for the Los Angeles Times, greeted one such worker, and the men embraced. 'I never forget a face,' said Bulos, who worked in Syria multiple times under the old guard. In the offices, there was some confusion, but no more than usual when trying to get permits for reporting. We finally left with a promise that a general permit would be sent via WhatsApp. We neither received that document, nor were we asked to present it. A week later, the Ministry of Information sent an online form for journalists, asking them to detail work plans before they arrive. Like most new governmental institutions in Syria, press officials were still establishing their systems. It’s not yet clear how free the press will be to report. So far, there has been no indication that journalists will be watched 24 hours a day, persecuted and sometimes even disappeared or killed, as was done under Assad rule. But the fear of oppression is present. 'We have nothing to be scared of anymore,' says one market seller, when we ask for an on-camera interview. His friends, two men leaning against the building and smoking, laugh and agree. 'But yet, we are afraid to talk to the media.' Late last week, as I left Syria, I found rows of cars waiting on the Syrian side of the border at around 6 a.m. The new leadership had manned the stations near the entrance to Lebanon. 'Under the regime, this was much faster,' says the taxi driver, while we wait to cross. 'These guys are too slow.' Boechat remained in Damascus to spend a few more days reporting. Among other things, there was that tour of the neighborhood where former regime soldiers live. But the young soldier never answered our calls or texts, so Boechat went as before, without a guide. In the neighborhood, he took pictures again of the old Baath Party building. But now, the paintings of the Assads had been blacked out or removed. Boechat met another HTS soldier, Omar, a thin, bearded man in a camouflage sun hat who spoke about the history of violence between the neighborhood and rebel groups. It was clear from his speech that not all was forgiven. 'There was a warehouse here where they used to take detainees … and torture them to death,' he said in an on-camera interview. After leaving the area, Boechat headed up to a mountain that under the regime had been off limits to journalists and most other people. Near a checkpoint, he found families having tea on the grass. A white and gold Islamic flag was perched in the barrel of a large Soviet machine gun mounted on the back of a pickup truck. Boechat lifted his camera and asked if he could shoot. 'Sure, no problem,' said a soldier, posing with his fingers in a victory sign. A nearby radio cackled, and a commander swept over to Boechat, telling him to delete the picture. Boechat said that he would do it later, but the commander wanted to see it happen on the spot. 'You cannot have that picture,' he said. 'Delete it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/reporter-s-notebook-navigating-journalism-in-the-new-syria-/7946299.html	2025-01-22T09:54:33-08:00	
Justice Department takes aim at local, state officials over immigration enforcement	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Justice Department has threatened local and state authorities with prosecution if they fail to cooperate with President Donald Trump's immigration policies, which include a pledge to deport millions of undocumented immigrants. Citing a constitutional clause concerning division of power, acting deputy attorney general Emil Bove said in a memorandum that 'federal law prohibits state and local actors from resisting, obstructing, and otherwise failing to comply with lawful immigration-related commands.' 'The Department of Justice shall investigate incidents involving any such misconduct for potential prosecution,' Bove added in the memo issued late Tuesday and published by U.S. media on Wednesday. Trump announced new restrictions on immigration and asylum in the United States hours after taking office on Monday, including a plan to send troops to the U.S.-Mexico border and end birthright citizenship. The Republican president vowed during his White House campaign to carry out the largest mass deportation of migrants in U.S. history. Bove said a newly created Sanctuary Cities Enforcement Working Group would identify 'state and local laws, policies, and activities that are inconsistent with Executive Branch immigration initiatives and, where appropriate, to take legal action to challenge such laws.' A number of Democratic-controlled 'sanctuary cities' in the United States restrict cooperation with federal immigration authorities. 'Laws and actions that threaten to impede Executive Branch immigration initiatives, including by prohibiting disclosures of information to federal authorities engaged in immigration enforcement activities, threaten public safety and national security,' Bove said. Bove, who served as one of Trump's personal lawyers before being named to the Justice Department, also directed the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Forces to participate 'in the execution of President Trump's immigration-related initiatives.' The FBI and other agencies should 'review their files for identifying information and/or biometric data relating to non-citizens located illegally in the United States' and turn it over to the Department of Homeland Security to facilitate removals, he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/justice-department-takes-aim-at-local-state-officials-over-immigration-enforcement-/7946305.html	2025-01-22T09:26:11-08:00	
China braces for potential trade war after Trump threatens to impose tariffs	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China is bracing for potential tariffs after U.S. President Donald Trump threatened to slap a 10% duty on Chinese imports as early as Feb. 1. At a regular press briefing Wednesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning stressed China’s commitment to defending its 'national interests.' 'We have always believed that there are no winners in a trade war or a tariff war,' she said. Following Trump’s remarks, China’s benchmark CSI 300 Index dropped 0.9% Wednesday, ending a four-day winning streak. The Hong Kong-listed Hang Seng China Enterprises Index, which tracks Chinese stocks, fell 2%. Beijing’s reactions come after Trump said his team was looking at potentially imposing a 10% tariff on Chinese imports because China has been 'sending fentanyl into the U.S. through Mexico and Canada.' 'Probably February 1st is the date we're looking at,' the U.S. president told reporters Tuesday at the White House. Trump’s comment comes one day after he appeared to be holding off on imposing tariffs on imports from China, and he directed federal agencies to investigate U.S. trade deficits and unfair trade practices with other countries on Monday. On Chinese social media, the U.S. president’s threat was met with a mixed response. Some internet users said the 10% tariff could be followed by a series of duties imposed against Chinese goods, while others criticized Trump for being unpredictable and inconsistent with his decisions. 'Why does the U.S. go through all this trouble? In the end, the American people are the ones who would have to pay because if China doesn’t export goods, American people won’t even have Christmas trees,' Chinese internet user Fortune Axe Brother wrote in a post on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Some analysts say the threat to impose tariffs as early as Feb. 1 could be the U.S. president’s 'negotiating gambit' to force concessions from China. 'Compared to the 25% tariffs that Trump has threatened to impose on Mexico and Canada, the 10% tariff on Chinese imports seems like Trump going easy on China,' said Dexter Roberts, a non-resident fellow at Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub. In Roberts’ view, the threat reflects Trump’s desire to 'cut some sort of deal' with Beijing. 'If China comes through with what Trump views as concessions that are good for him and the U.S., he is very likely not to pursue those tariffs right away,' Roberts told VOA by phone. While it remains unclear whether the U.S. will follow through on the threat, some Chinese people say their export businesses already have been affected by concerns about potential U.S. tariffs on Chinese imports since last year. 'Even before Trump’s latest comments, some of our American customers had already pre-ordered a lot of goods from us since his election victory in November,' a Chinese winter apparel exporter surnamed Yuan in Shanghai, who asked to be identified only by his last name due to security concerns, told VOA in a written response. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration, American companies increased their purchases from China in the last few months of 2024. China’s official customs data shows that Chinese companies exported goods worth almost $50 billion to the U.S. in December 2024, marking a 10.7% increase from a year before. To avoid the U.S. tariffs, some Chinese companies have moved production to countries in Southeast Asia or Latin America, such as Vietnam and Mexico, in recent years. 'After Trump launched a trade war against China during his first term, some of our American customers asked my company to move production to Vietnam,' a manager at a consumer electronics manufacturer in Guangzhou surnamed Li, who asked to be identified only by his last name due to security concerns, told VOA in a written response. Despite these preparations, experts say Chinese businesses will still struggle to deal with a potential trade war that Trump may launch against China during his second term. 'Trump already has experience in launching a trade war against China, and his administration is looking at targeting Chinese efforts to avoid U.S. tariffs by potentially imposing tariffs on Southeast Asian countries or Mexico,' He Jiangbing, an independent Chinese economic commentator, told VOA by phone. Since China has largely relied on exports to drive its economic growth in recent years, Roberts said potential tariffs imposed by the U.S. government could seriously affect China’s economic growth. 'China’s export sector would be hit hard by the tariffs and that means the whole Chinese economy would be hit hard,' he told VOA, saying the trend would have a 'knock-on effect' on domestic consumption. 'Exporters are employers so they might have to lay off workers and cut wages. People who have been laid off may spend less money and that will hurt the Chinese economy,' Roberts added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-braces-for-potential-trade-war-after-trump-threatens-to-impose-tariffs-/7946261.html	2025-01-22T08:54:05-08:00	
Death toll in flooding, landslides in Indonesia rises to 21	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesian rescuers retrieved four more bodies after they resumed their search Wednesday for people missing after floods and landslides on Indonesia's main island of Java, bringing the death toll to 21. Water from flooded rivers tore through nine villages in Pekalongan regency of Central Java province, and landslides tumbled onto mountainside hamlets after the torrential rains Monday. Videos and photos released by National Search and Rescue Agency showed workers digging desperately in villages where roads and green-terraced rice fields were transformed into murky brown mud and villages were covered by thick mud, rocks and uprooted trees. National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said flooding triggered a landslide that buried two houses and a cafe in the Petungkriyono resort area. The disasters all together destroyed 25 houses, a dam and three main bridges connecting villages in Pekalongan. At least 13 people were injured, and nearly 300 people were forced to flee to temporary government shelters. The search and rescue operation that was hampered by bad weather, mudslides and rugged terrain was halted Tuesday afternoon due to heavy rain and thick fog that made devastated areas along the rivers dangerous to rescuers. On Wednesday, they searched in rivers and the rubble of villages for bodies and survivors in worst-hit Kasimpar village, said Budiono, who heads a local rescue office. Scores of rescue personnel recovered three mud-caked bodies, including a 5-month old baby, as they searched a Petungkriyono area where tons of mud and rocks buried two houses and a cafe. Another body was pulled out from under a broken bridge near a river in Kasimpar village. Rescuers are still searching for five people reported missing. Landslides and floods were also reported in many other provinces, Muhari said. On Monday, a landslide hit five houses in Denpasar, on the tourist island of Bali, killing four people and leaving one missing. Heavy seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile floodplains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-in-flooding-landslides-in-indonesia-rises-to-21/7946246.html	2025-01-22T08:44:21-08:00	
Rubio: US foreign policy will focus on core national interests	New U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said Wednesday that core national interests will be at the heart of American diplomacy as President Donald Trump embarks on his second four-year term in the White House. Rubio, the first of Trump’s Cabinet nominees to win Senate confirmation and take office, said in a mission statement that all U.S. spending and efforts on foreign affairs 'must be justified with the answer to three simple questions: Does it make America safer? Does it make America stronger? Does it make America more prosperous?' He said that 'to advance our national interest, we will build a more innovative, nimble, and focused State Department. This will require replacing some priorities, deemphasizing some issues, and eliminating some practices.' Rubio, 53, echoed Trump’s early promises to end masses of undocumented migrants from entering the U.S. 'The State Department will no longer undertake any activities that facilitate or encourage mass migration,' Rubio said. 'Our diplomatic relations with other countries, particularly in the Western Hemisphere, will prioritize securing America’s borders, stopping illegal and destabilizing migration, and negotiating the repatriation of illegal immigrants' to their home countries. Rubio said the State Department will end any efforts to promote diversity, equity and inclusion in hiring, in line with orders Trump issued on day one of his new term. 'This order will be faithfully executed and observed in both letter and spirit,' Rubio said, 'We must reward performance and merit.' He said foreign policy efforts 'must return to the basics of diplomacy by eliminating our focus on political and cultural causes that are divisive at home and deeply unpopular abroad. This will allow us to conduct a pragmatic foreign policy in cooperation with other nations to advance our core national interests.' In addition, he said the U.S. 'must stop censorship and suppression of information' and 'reprioritize truth.' He emphasized 'the fundamental truth that America is a great and just country whose people are generous and whose leaders now prioritize Americans’ core interests, while respecting the rights and interests of other nations.' With Trump announcing he will pull the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement — joining Iran, Libya and Yemen as the only countries that will officially not adhere to the pact to limit global warming — Rubio said the State Department 'will use diplomacy to help President Trump fulfill his promise for a return to American energy dominance.' 'Amid today’s reemerging great power rivalry,' Rubio said, 'I will empower our talented diplomatic corps to advance our mission to make America safer, stronger, and more prosperous.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-us-foreign-policy-will-focus-on-core-national-interests/7946236.html	2025-01-22T08:40:35-08:00	
Botswana closes doors on foreign teachers, truck drivers	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — A Botswanan official said this week the nation will no longer issue work permits to foreign teachers and truck drivers in order to protect local jobs. Minister of Labor and Home Affairs Pius Mokgware told a group of unemployed teachers protesting in Gaborone that the government already has stopped issuing permits to foreign educators and truck drivers. He said that last month the government rejected 140 applications for work permits. Thabang Kopelo, who was representing the unemployed teachers, said they want the new government, which took office in October, to go a step further. 'We now demand the cancellation and the immediate suspension of issuing of work permits to teachers who come from outside of Botswana. ... There are [already] thousands and thousands' of local teachers, Kopelo said. The group’s actions weren’t xenophobic, Kopelo said, but a plea to the government to prioritize citizens in hiring teachers. 'In other countries ... they are being attacked,' Kopelo said. 'Derogatory language is being used against them. We are not moving in that approach; we are fellow brothers and sisters.' In neighboring South Africa, clashes between migrants and locals have often turned deadly, with citizens arguing foreigners are taking their jobs. Gaborone-based Congolese teacher Patrice Okomi said there is not much foreign workers can do except abide by the host government’s regulations. 'We are here at the mercy of the government, and it is entirely up to the Botswana authorities to decide our future,' Okomi said. 'If the feeling is that we have overstayed our welcome, there is not much we can do except to prepare for our exit.' Botswana’s stable economy has attracted migrant workers, the majority fleeing hardship in neighboring Zimbabwe. According to figures from the government office Statistics Botswana, there are 4,581 holders of foreign work permits in Botswana, with teachers comprising 18% of the total.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-closes-doors-on-foreign-teachers-truck-drivers/7946183.html	2025-01-22T08:08:18-08:00	
Murdoch's UK tabloids apologize to Prince Harry, admit intruding on Diana	LONDON — Prince Harry claimed a monumental victory Wednesday as Rupert Murdoch's U.K. tabloids made an unprecedented apology for intruding in his life over decades and agreed to pay substantial damages to settle his privacy invasion lawsuit. News Group Newspapers offered a 'full and unequivocal apology to the Duke of Sussex for the serious intrusion by The Sun between 1996 and 2011 into his private life,' Harry's attorney, David Sherborne, read from a statement in court. The statement even went beyond the scope of the case to acknowledge intruding on the life of Harry's mother, the late Princess Diana, and the impact it had on his family. 'We acknowledge and apologize for the distress caused to the duke, and the damage inflicted on relationships, friendships and family, and have agreed to pay him substantial damages,' the settlement statement said. His phone was hacked, and he was spied on It was the first time News Group has acknowledged wrongdoing at The Sun, a paper that once sold millions of copies with its formula of sports, celebrities and sex — including topless women on Page 3. Harry had vowed to take his case to trial to publicly expose the newspaper's wrongdoing and win a court ruling upholding his claims. In a statement read by his lawyer, Harry claimed he achieved the accountability he sought for himself and hundreds of others, including ordinary people, who were snooped on. News Group acknowledged 'phone hacking, surveillance and misuse of private information by journalists and private investigators' aimed at Harry. News Group had strongly denied those allegations before trial. 'This represents a vindication for the hundreds of other claimants who were strong-armed into settling without being able to get to the truth of what was done to them,' Sherborne said outside the High Court in London. Wrongdoing alleged at the top The bombshell announcement came after the trial's start was postponed a day as last-minute settlement talks heated up outside court. Harry, 40, the younger son of King Charles III, and Tom Watson, a former Labour Party member of Parliament, were the only two remaining claimants out of more than 1,300 others who had settled lawsuits against News Group Newspapers over allegations their phones were hacked and investigators unlawfully intruded in their lives. The company engaged in 'perjury and cover-ups' to obscure the truth for years, deleting 30 million emails and other records, Harry and Watson said in a joint statement read by Sherborne. 'There was an extensive conspiracy,' the statement said, in which 'senior executives deliberately obstructed justice.' News Group said in a statement that it would have disputed at trial that evidence was destroyed and that it continues to deny those allegations. While News Group had issued an unreserved apology for its wrongdoing at the shuttered News of the World, it had never done so at The Sun and had vehemently denied those allegations. The statement read by Sherborne took aim at Rebekah Brooks, now the CEO overseeing News Group, who had been the editor at The Sun when she was acquitted at a criminal trial in a phone hacking case. 'At her trial in 2014, Rebekah Brooks said, 'When I was editor of The Sun, we ran a clean ship,'' he said. 'Ten years later when she is CEO of the company, they now admit, when she was editor of The Sun, they ran a criminal enterprise.' News Group apologized for wrongdoing by private eyes hired by The Sun, but not for anything done by its journalists. Two cases down, one to go In all the cases that have been brought against the publisher since a widespread phone hacking scandal forced Murdoch to close News of the World in 2011, Harry's case got the closest to trial. Murdoch closed the paper after the Guardian reported that the tabloid's reporters had in 2002 hacked the phone of Milly Dowler, a murdered 13-year-old schoolgirl, while police were searching for her. Harry's case against News Group was one of three he brought accusing British tabloids of violating his privacy by eavesdropping on phone messages or using private investigators to unlawfully help them score scoops. His case against the publisher of the Daily Mirror ended in victory when the judge ruled that phone hacking was 'widespread and habitual' at the newspaper and its sister publications. During that trial in 2023, Harry became the first senior member of the royal family to testify in court since the late 19th century, putting him at odds with the monarchy's desire to keep its problems out of view. The outcome in the News Group case raises questions about how his third case — against the publisher of the Daily Mail — will proceed. That trial is scheduled next year. Source of a bitter feud Harry's feud with the press dates to his youth, when the tabloids took glee in reporting on everything from his injuries to his girlfriends to dabbling with drugs. But his fury with the tabloids goes much deeper. He blames the media for the death of his mother, who was killed in a car crash in 1997 while being chased by paparazzi in Paris. He also blames them for the persistent attacks on his wife, actor Meghan Markle, that led them to leave royal life and flee to the United States in 2020. The litigation has been a source of friction in his family, Harry said in the documentary 'Tabloids On Trial.' He revealed in court papers that his father opposed his lawsuit. He also said his older brother, William, Prince of Wales and heir to the throne, had settled a private complaint against News Group that his lawyer has said was worth over 1 million pounds ($1.23 million). 'I'm doing this for my reasons,' Harry told the documentary makers, although he said he wished his family had joined him. Harry was originally one among dozens of claimants, including actor Hugh Grant, who alleged that News Group journalists and investigators they hired violated their privacy between 1994 and 2016 by intercepting voicemails, tapping phones, bugging cars and using deception to access confidential information.	https://www.voanews.com/a/murdoch-s-uk-tabloids-apologize-to-prince-harry-admit-intruding-on-diana/7946082.html	2025-01-22T07:11:50-08:00	
TikTok's US reprieve comes as other countries limit social media use	Singapore — TikTok’s short-lived shutdown in the United States has opened a wider debate in other countries regarding access to popular social media platforms by children. TikTok went dark temporarily Sunday in the U.S. after a new law banning it went into effect. The law required TikTok’s Chinese-owned parent company ByteDance to sell the app’s U.S. operation due to national security concerns over its ties to Beijing. After his inauguration on Monday, President Donald Trump signed an executive order halting the ban for 75 days, giving ByteDance additional time to find a buyer. The order provides relief to the app’s 170 million American users, many of them young adults. More than 60% of teenagers in the U.S. ages 13 to 17 use TikTok, with most of them accessing the platform daily, according to data from the Pew Research Center. The U.S. is not the only country looking to regulate social media and other platforms such as online gaming. While the reasons behind the restrictions vary, a growing number of countries already regulate technology or are proposing legislation to restrict its use. In Australia, a high-profile social media ban for young adults under the age of 16 will take effect at the end of the year, prohibiting them from creating accounts on TikTok, Facebook, Instagram, X and Snapchat. The government said the ban was a necessary measure to protect children. 'Social media is doing harm to our kids, and I'm calling time on it,' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters last November. Websites like YouTube that do not require an account to view content will likely be excluded from the ban. The Australian government said the onus will be on the social media companies to 'take reasonable steps' to prevent children under 16 from creating accounts on their platforms. Companies that do not comply could face fines of more than $30 million. Details of how the law will be enforced remain scarce, with age verification technologies currently being trialed. Some young Australian users of the platforms remain skeptical about how effective a ban will be. 'I think people will manage to find ways around it, maybe by lying about their age,' 15-year-old Theodore Cagé told VOA. While Cagé concedes that social media can be a 'big distraction from school,' he is against a blanket ban, favoring more measured approaches such as limiting screen time or blocking specific content. 'I reckon it definitely should be more targeted, not just a total ban on everything, because there's a lot of good stuff out there. It's not all bad,' he said. The impending ban has also raised concerns that some children will be left isolated. 'Social media serves as a lifeline for those youth who do not have supportive homes or local environments. They can find supportive communities on social media', Lisa Given, a professor of information sciences at RMIT University in Melbourne, told VOA. Australia’s ban will be closely watched, especially by countries in Asia that are considering their own restrictions for young users. Indonesia’s communications minister said the Southeast Asian nation is planning a minimum age for social media use and discussed plans last week with President Prabowo Subianto. In neighboring Singapore, teenagers under 18 will be moved to a more restrictive Teen Accounts on Instagram starting January 21. The city-state also issued guidelines in schools to limit screen time for children. Starting March 31, app stores in Singapore will block children under 12 from downloading apps, including TikTok and Instagram. But in the Southeast Asian financial hub, which prides itself on technological advancements and connectivity, social media still plays a significant role in the daily lives of young people. Platforms like Snapchat and Instagram 'are pretty important for engaging in new relationships or finding new friendships,' 17-year-old Pablo Lane of Singapore told VOA. 'It [social media] has had big benefits for me, just broadening the scope of people I can contact.' China has gone further than other countries in Asia to control children’s access to online networks. In 2021, Beijing introduced new measures restricting children under 18 to just three hours a week. And in late 2024, new guidelines from China’s cybersecurity regulator called for mobile devices to be equipped with a 'minors mode' that would limit screen time for children under 18, including an overnight curfew. The setting, which parents can turn off, restricts 16 to 18-year-olds to two hours of phone use a day, with eight to 16-year-olds allowed just one hour. Jeremy Daum, a senior fellow at Yale Law School’s Paul Tsai China Center, said China is also focused on protecting children from harmful content online rather than implementing blanket bans. 'They're really trying, from a number of different angles, to make a safe web for kids,' he Daum. Questions remain over whether China’s model could apply elsewhere.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiktok-s-us-reprieve-comes-as-other-countries-limit-social-media-use/7946040.html	2025-01-22T06:32:36-08:00

Trump order suspending refugee resettlement affects US Afghan allies, says advocacy group	Washington — President Trump’s executive order suspending the U.S. refugee program would affect the resettlement of thousands of Afghans who helped the U.S. during the war in Afghanistan, an advocacy group said. AfghanEvac, a California-based coalition of organizations helping U.S. Afghan allies to resettle in the U.S., said Monday that the pause in all refugee resettlements would affect Afghan allies who are awaiting relocation to the U.S. 'Thousands of Afghan allies who have completed almost all required steps in the refugee process would be immediately impacted by a refugee resettlement pause, and thousands more who are currently undergoing processing would remain in limbo,' AfghanEvac said, in a statement on its X account. President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Monday that called the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program detrimental to U.S. interests and suspending it beginning on January 27. 'This order suspends the USRAP until such time as the further entry into the United States of refugees aligned with the interest of the United States,' stated the executive order. It called on the secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, in consultation with the secretary of state, to report to the president within 90 days if the program 'would be in the interests of the United States.' The order added that every 90 days, a report would be submitted to the president until he 'determine[s] that resumption of the USRAP is in the interests of the United States.' According to Shawn VanDiver, president of AghanEvac, more than 180,000 Afghans were relocated in the U.S. from August 2021, after the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, to December 2024. Thousands of Afghans are still waiting to be relocated to the United States. AfghanEvac said that the order would not only have an impact on at-risk Afghans living in hiding but also on the family members of the active-duty U.S. troops. Earlier, Reuters reported that the flights of 1,660 Afghans cleared by the U.S. government to resettle in the U.S. were canceled. But the president of AfghanEvac, Shawn VanDiver, said in a post on X that no flights were canceled. 'To be clear: flights have not yet been canceled for anyone,' VanDiver said. Omar Samad, a former Afghan diplomat living in the U.S., told VOA that the ban is part of a larger package and it will impact Afghans who are waiting to be relocated to the U.S. 'It is going to be reviewed by the U.S. agencies, and it is possible that they that the U.S. make an exception for Afghans,' Samad added. VanDiver said that the coalition of organizations helping Afghans are working to 'secure exemptions for Afghan allies.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-order-suspending-refugee-resettlement-affects-us-afghan-allies-says-advocacy-group-/7945982.html	2025-01-22T05:48:05-08:00

China executes 2 mass murderers	In November, China suffered the deadliest mass murder in the past decade. Seventy days later, on Monday, China executed the perpetrator, along with another killer responsible for a subsequent attack. The speed of the verdict and punishment was applauded by Chinese netizens but drew criticism from legal analysts who argue that the killers' speedy executions will fail to prevent future crime. Fan Weiqiu, 62, drove his car into crowds of people around Zhuhai Stadium in Guangdong province, killing 35 and injuring 43. At his trial on December 27, Fan stated that he was motivated by his dissatisfaction with his divorce settlement. The court delivered his death sentence that same day, calling his motivations 'extremely vile, [and] the nature of the crime extremely egregious.' Messages of support for Fan's execution were posted on Weibo. One user, named Dentist Wu Bin, commented that the criminal's death was 'satisfying to everyone.' Another user from Hong Kong, called A Girl's Runaway Dream, wrote: 'I support the verdict! Don't let these bad people remain to ring in the [lunar] new year. I hope the dead rest in peace, justice will never be late!' Fat Brother Yang Li from Jiangsu echoed his fellow commenters, posting: 'This is to be done quickly, seriously and severely. Close the case while it is still fresh in people's minds. To both give an explanation to the people, and also to effectively deter criminals.' Still, a small number of netizens expressed skepticism of the death penalty. Weibo user Shumu Yangshenwo in Hainan province posted: 'When will it be possible for China to abolish the death penalty as a form of torture?' Xu Jiajin, the other criminal executed on Monday, was convicted for the deaths of eight people and the injuries of 17 others at his alma mater, a technical school in Wuxi. The 21-year-old returned to get revenge after failing his final exams and not receiving his graduation certificate. Online communities circulated his suicide note in which Xu wrote, 'I hope my death will push labor laws forward. Don't mistake me as a doormat, but some scores must always be settled.' Xu's execution followed a mere 66 days after his crime and sentencing. The turnaround of under three months from crime to punishment in the two cases has led some legal analysts to question the legitimacy of China's judicial system. Ignatius Lee, a political and legal blogger with more than 79,000 followers on X, told VOA that the executions represent a 'serious regression of the judicial system' in China. Even with conclusive evidence, the speed at which the trial and execution were conducted reveals the lack of error-correction procedures within the judiciary. 'Outside of satisfying the public's desire for revenge, this has no judicial merit,' Lee said. All public knowledge of the criminals and their motivations comes from police reports, which in a way 'puts a gag on their mouths.' The lack of transparency surrounding the trials and their verdicts, Lee said, makes it hard for the public to learn anything from the cases and to take measures to prevent their recurrence. To Lee, the most common causes of such revenge crimes are legal injustice and failed petitions to government offices. The petition system, which allows ordinary Chinese citizens to express grievances to county governments, has a very low success rate and has led to instability, as long wait times force petitioners to go to extremes to express their dissatisfaction. Wu Shaoping, a former Beijing human rights lawyer now living in New York, views these two murder cases as representative of the Chinese judiciary's failure to address root problems and prevent violence. 'In these two cases, the CCP is acting typically in that it has not disclosed [the motives] to the outside world, nor has it allowed the public to discuss them. It still wants to cover it up so that, because there is no way for people to explore this issue in depth, the root causes of the social problems cannot be found, and to find a cure [to prevent such crime],' Wu said. China was considering reforms to the death penalty prior to President Xi Jinping's administration. Such reforms, which have not been readdressed under Xi's tenure, included transferring review power of death penalty verdicts to China's highest court to ensure that verdicts are fair, Wu said. Wu argues that the motives of these two murderers and others before them stem from social or economic grievances. Discussing and addressing social issues, however, is a 'off-limits zone to the Chinese Communist Party,' he says, as party officials fear that addressing larger issues might undermine their rule. Kevin Slaten, who manages Freedom House's China Dissent Monitor, said that the two murder cases underscored the legal system's political utility to China. 'From the CCP's perspective, these cases needed to progress quickly for two reasons. Slaten told VOA. 'First, to make the public believe that the government is promptly handling public security issues. Second, by closing these cases as earlier as possible, it seeks to more quickly end public discussion of the context behind their motives, which involves social problems in China, including the economic slowdown.' China's legal system is marked by two extremes, Slaten added. On one end, detained human rights activists have to wait for months and sometimes years before being brought to trial. On the other hand, Fan and Xu were taken into court immediately, with executions following not even three months after their crimes, he said. VOA's Katherine Michaelson contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-executes-2-mass-murderers-/7945900.html	2025-01-22T04:37:31-08:00	
Israel says it will control Rafah crossing during ceasefire’s first stage	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said Wednesday that Israel will remain in control of the Rafah crossing between the Gaza Strip and Egypt throughout the first phase of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hamas. A statement from the office denied reports that the Palestinian Authority, which governs part of the West Bank, would control the Rafah crossing. European Union monitors will supervise the crossing, with Israeli troops surrounding the area and Israel in charge of approving the passage of people and goods through the crossing. Israel has been in control of the area since May of 2024 as part of its offensive seeking to dismantle the Hamas militant group in Gaza. Israeli official resigns Israel's army chief, Herzi Halevi, said Tuesday he would resign on March 6, accepting responsibility for the massive security failure on October 7, 2023, when Hamas militants from Gaza carried out a cross-border terror attack on Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing 250 hostages. Halevi, in a letter to Israel's defense minister, said he would complete the Israel Defense Forces' inquiries into the shock strike that led to 15 months of fighting and help strengthen the IDF's readiness for future security challenges. 'I will transfer command of the IDF in a high-quality and thorough manner to my successor,' wrote Halevi, who is chief of the General Staff of Israel's armed forces. A six-week truce is now in effect, but Halevi said, 'The objectives of the war have not all been achieved. The army will continue to fight to further dismantle Hamas and its governing capabilities, ensure the return of the hostages' and enable Israelis displaced by militant attacks to return home. Ever since the attack, Netanyahu has refused to answer questions about assigning blame for the attack, saying that such an inquiry could wait for the war to end. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, with most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza, although Israel, without evidence, says it has killed 17,000 militants. Hamas, a U.S. designated terror group, said it will release another round of hostages on Saturday, as the ceasefire with Israel held into a third day and U.N. humanitarian agencies moved aid into Gaza to help Palestinian civilians. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday that the next group of hostages would be four Israeli women, who would be set free in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Fifteen months of war has devastated the Gaza Strip, destroying many of the homes that Palestinians who fled in search of safety hoped to return to with the halt in fighting. The ceasefire has so far included the return of three hostages who had been held in Gaza and the release 90 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said nearly 900 aid trucks entered Gaza on Tuesday. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-will-control-rafah-crossing-during-ceasefire-s-first-stage-/7945897.html	2025-01-22T04:21:45-08:00	
Aid group urges halt to expulsion of Afghan refugees over dire conditions	Islamabad — A global humanitarian agency warned Afghanistan's neighbors Wednesday against expelling millions of refugees in the coming months, citing the country’s unpreparedness due to decades of conflict, economic devastation, and climate-related challenges. The Norwegian Refugee Council, or NRC, reported that Iran plans to expel up to 2 million Afghan refugees by March, while at least 800,000 have already been deported from Pakistan since October 2023. 'The many vulnerable Afghans already returning from Iran, whom I met at the border this week, feel they live in an enduring limbo,' stated Jan Egeland, the NRC secretary-general. 'They left Afghanistan in search of a better and safer life and are now returning to an uncertain future in Afghanistan, where they face the same unemployment, hunger, and human rights violations that made them leave their homeland in the first place,' he said. The NRC noted that most of the returnees are forced to remain in urban Afghan areas, struggling to find work or housing. While some have family connections, many lack ties after years in exile and have nowhere to go. International aid is essential in alleviating immense humanitarian needs in Afghanistan, but it is now dwindling, lamented Egeland, adding that women and girls were bearing the brunt of the shortfall in financial support for nongovernmental groups and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. The NRC chief warned that 'the world has turned its back' to the needs of Afghans trapped in one of the worst humanitarian crises globally since the Taliban regained control of the country in August 2021. 'Poor and displaced Afghan families are paying a heavy price for a lack of real, durable solutions to assist displaced people and refugees caught in an escalating humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and host countries,' Egeland said. The United Nations and nongovernmental humanitarian groups have persistently urged the international community to continue supporting the country. Aid workers have expressed concerns that the Taliban’s restrictions on women's access to workplaces and public life are significantly impacting humanitarian efforts in Afghanistan. They complain that the curbs make it challenging to deliver essential public services, such as healthcare, nutrition, and immunization, particularly in provinces where Taliban authorities have banned male doctors from treating female patients. The de facto hardline Afghan rulers have also prohibited girls from attending schools beyond the sixth grade and recently ordered medical training institutes nationwide not to accept female students. Egeland said he raised 'the severe restrictions on the fundamental rights' faced by Afghan women and girls in meetings with Taliban authorities. 'The ongoing ban on secondary education for girls means that 1.5 million teenage girls are out of school. Additionally, a new incomprehensible ban has shut down training for midwives and nurses, which will not only destroy livelihoods but will also directly threaten women's health and lives,' he cautioned. Egeland, who regularly visits Afghanistan, emphasized the need for the international community to engage with the Taliban to secure the restoration of human rights for women and girls. He called for an increase in global support to fund crucial humanitarian assistance while urging the Taliban 'to create an enabling environment. 'Many countries' continued disengagement with authorities in Afghanistan is only enabling more restrictions and suffering for the women, girls, and families here – many of whom see no option but to risk their lives on perilous journeys,' the NRC chief stated. Pakistan has commended Egeland for drawing global attention to the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and defended its policy of sending Afghan refugees to their native country. 'For forty years, Pakistan has generously hosted over four million Afghan refugees. Those sent back were residing illegally without any documentation or proof of residence,' the Foreign Ministry said in a statement in Islamabad earlier this week. The Taliban takeover led to nearly 700,000 Afghans seeking refuge in Pakistan. This includes individuals who fear retaliation for their association with the U.S-led Western allied troops, who were present in Afghanistan for nearly two decades until their withdrawal in August 2021. 'Progress on the cases of thousands of Afghan nationals who were promised resettlement in Western countries remains painfully slow. U.N. Humanitarian aid to Afghanistan remains critically underfunded, with only 37.5% of the required funds secured last year,' the Pakistani foreign ministry stated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aid-group-urges-halt-to-expulsion-of-afghan-refugees-over-dire-conditions-/7945867.html	2025-01-22T03:10:37-08:00	
China families appeal to free relatives held by scam gangs in Myanmar	BEIJING/BANGKOK — The abduction and cross-border rescue had all the makings of the kind of action script struggling Chinese actor Wang Xing had hoped to land – only not as a reality star. Wang, 22, flew to Bangkok earlier this month after getting an unsolicited offer to join a film that was shooting in Thailand. There was no movie. Instead, like hundreds of other Chinese men, Wang had been duped by a job offer that he later acknowledged appeared too good to be true, as part of a trap set by a criminal syndicate. Like others desperate for work, he was kidnapped and put to work in one of the online scam centers that operate just across the Thai border in Myanmar, according to his account and statements by police in China and Thailand. But unlike most trafficked Chinese whose families wait in quiet anguish, Wang had a powerful advocate back home. His girlfriend, who goes by the nickname Jiajia, broadcast details of Wang's abduction and started a social media campaign documenting her battle to get him back to China, picking up millions of followers and the support of Chinese celebrities. When Wang was freed on Jan. 7 by Thai police, who said he had been found in Myanmar but gave few details about his release, frustrated families of other Chinese people still detained in the Myanmar scam centers began to post details of their own cases in an attempt to capitalize on the attention. Within days, the rare grassroots effort had collected the names of nearly 1,800 Chinese nationals that family members said had been trafficked into Myanmar from border areas of China and Thailand. Scam compounds, where workers are often treated brutally, have proliferated in Myanmar amid the chaos and widening civil war since the military seized power in a 2021 coup. The UN says hundreds of thousands of people have been trafficked to scam centers in Southeast Asia since the COVID-19 pandemic in an industry that defrauds people across the globe and generates billions of dollars per year for organized crime groups, many of Chinese origin. The tally, which organizers said had been handed over to Chinese authorities, quickly became the most detailed census of Chinese victims of the syndicates that trap people into working online scams from towns like Myawaddy, on Myanmar’s border with Thailand. In an unusual statement issued on Friday, China's Ministry of Public Security said it was 'making every effort' to crack down on the scam compounds and 'rescue trafficked people.' On Tuesday, China's state broadcaster said Beijing had reached a consensus with Thailand and Myanmar to arrest the syndicates' leaders and eradicate the scam centers. After a surge in crimes targeting Chinese citizens, Beijing initially moved in 2023 to combat the Myanmar fraud compounds, resulting in the arrest of tens of thousands of Chinese nationals suspected of involvement in the illicit business. That reflected China's approach to treat those trafficked primarily as suspects rather than victims, according to groups that fight human trafficking. 'It’s difficult to get a confirmed number of Chinese people trafficked to scam compounds,' said Mina Chiang, founder of the Humanity Research Consultancy, an anti human trafficking group. Unable to file police reports Reuters spoke to family members of four people listed as disappeared in Myanmar and identified in the database, which drew its name from Wang’s first name, Xing, or star. None would agree to be identified by full name for fear of angering authorities and slowing efforts to release the victims. Of the nearly 1,800 victims identified in the 'Star Homecoming' campaign, about 93% are men. The average age is 27, with the vast majority between the ages of 15 and 45. Most of them told stories of economic hardship -- indebtedness, the struggle to make ends meet as gig economy workers, job loss in the construction industry amid a nationwide downturn -- that made them jump when the scam centers came calling. Chinese law does not consider men as potential victims of human trafficking, and about half the families said they had been unable to file a missing person report with local police, according to a Reuters analysis of the crowd-sourced spreadsheet. 'At first I wanted to file a police report, but they said missing persons reports were only for women and children,' said one woman, whose 30-year-old husband disappeared after accepting what turned out to be a scam job offer because he needed to pay back debts. Another woman, the wife of a 22-year-old electrician who went missing, said Chinese police had told her they could not accept a report on his disappearance since he had been traveling with his passport. Several family members who posted details of men who had disappeared said they hoped the attention on the cases would force China’s government to shift focus and bring trafficking victims home. Last week, when organizers shut down the spreadsheet from taking new names, China’s foreign ministry called on other Southeast Asian nations to do more to crack down on fraud rings. Back home, actor Wang publicly thanked China for working successfully to free him. Separately, in a now-deleted article in media outlet Renwu, he said he noticed a hair band his girlfriend Jiajia left in his luggage and worried he could never see her again. 'She asked me to try to refuse the work offer halfway, but in the end, I still went,' Wang said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-families-appeal-to-free-relatives-held-by-scam-gangs-in-myanmar/7945844.html	2025-01-22T02:26:09-08:00	
Sri Lanka agrees with China's Sinopec to fast-track $3.7 billion refinery	COLOMBO, Sri Lanka — Sri Lanka's foreign minister said on Wednesday that the South Asian island nation had signed an agreement with Chinese state energy giant Sinopec to fast-track a proposed $3.7 billion oil refinery in its southern port city of Hambantota. Sinopec and Sri Lanka will jointly decide the share of refined fuel that will be exported from the facility, Foreign Minister Vijitha Herath told reporters. 'This is one of the largest foreign investment projects Sri Lanka has received and we feel it will be important for us,' Herath said. 'This refinery has been discussed between the two countries for many years and we are committed to taking it forward. We hope to break ground as soon as possible.' He declined to provide details on the planned capacity of the refinery. A Sinopec representative in China did not respond immediately to a request for comment and its Sri Lanka office did not answer phone calls. Sri Lanka is currently completely dependent on imported oil, which costs the cash-strapped country billions of dollars every year, though it does have some smaller refineries. The country is looking to attract foreign investment to stabilize its economy which crumpled under a severe foreign exchange crisis in 2022. Sri Lanka posted a faster-than-expected rally after securing a $2.9 billion International Monetary Fund (IMF) program in 2023. Sinopec and Sri Lanka will work to resolve land, tax and water issues within a month, Herath said, adding that Colombo expects the refinery to assist the Chinese-built Hambantota Port to function as a hub via bunkering services. Last week, China and Sri Lanka signed 15 cooperation documents, including agreements on economic and technological development, when recently-elected Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake met China's President Xi Jinping in Beijing. Dissanayake's visit to debt-ridden Sri Lanka's largest bilateral lender came after he first traveled to Beijing's regional rival India. Specifics of the deals signed between Sri Lanka and China were not disclosed at the signing ceremony. Sinopec's effort to build a refinery in the Indian Ocean island puts it in direct competition with India's interests in expanding its role as an energy supplier to Sri Lanka. Herath said Sri Lanka is continuing discussions with India on a proposed fuel pipeline between the two countries and is open to refinery proposals from India.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-agrees-with-china-s-sinopec-to-fast-track-3-7-billion-refinery/7945834.html	2025-01-22T02:08:14-08:00	
Trump expresses possibility of more sanctions against Russia for Ukraine war	U.S. President Donald Trump signaled the possibility of placing additional sanctions on Russia for its war in Ukraine. Asked about the prospect while speaking to reporters Tuesday, Trump responded, 'Sounds likely.' Trump said his administration has been in talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and would be speaking with Russian President Vladimir Putin 'very soon.' He said the European Union should be 'paying a lot more than they’re paying' to aid Ukraine, while falsely stating the U.S. has contributed $200 billion more than the EU. Since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the United States has committed about $175 billion in aid for Ukraine. The European Union says the bloc and its member states have made about $145 billion in aid available. Trump says Europe should be paying more because its proximity means the war has a greater effect on the EU than the United States. 'I mean, what are we, stupid? I guess the answer is yes, because they must think so,' Trump said. He has previously complained that NATO allies are not allocating enough of their spending to defense and called for increased defense budget targets. EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said during a speech Wednesday at an EU Defence Agency conference that, in terms of general defense spending, Trump is 'right to say that we don’t spend enough,' and that the EU needs to invest more. She called for the EU to provide 'more, faster and stronger' support to Ukraine, saying that Ukrainians 'are fighting for their freedom and ours.' 'There is absolutely no doubt that we can do more to help Ukraine,' Kallas said. 'With our help, they can also win the war.' Aerial attacks Ukrainian officials said Wednesday the country’s air defenses shot down dozens of drones overnight, including in Mykolaiv where Governor Vitaliy Kim said falling debris damaged an apartment building and injured two people. Officials in the Khmelnytskyi and Sumy regions also reported drones being shot down in their areas. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed six Ukrainian drones over the Rostov region, while also knocking down a drone over Kursk and another over Voronezh. Rostov Governor Yury Slyusar said drone fragments fell in the courtyard of a house, but that no one was injured. Ceasefire provisions Zelenskyy said Tuesday that if a ceasefire deal were enacted with Russia, 'at least 200,000 European peacekeepers' would need to be on the ground in Ukraine to defend the Eastern European country against a possible attack by Russia. Zelenskyy said Europe must 'take care of itself.' He said 200,000 peacekeepers from European countries would be the minimum number of peacekeepers required, 'Otherwise, it's nothing.' 'Let's not forget, there is no ocean separating European countries from Russia,' Zelenskyy said in his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Ukraine's president said Russia's demand that Ukraine reduce its army to one-fifth of its current size of 800,000 is not an option. Ukraine's best defense during a ceasefire deal, Zelenskyy said, would be its membership into NATO. Alliance members have declared the Ukraine is on an 'irreversible' path to membership, but the United States, Germany and others oppose allowing Ukraine to join while the war is ongoing for fear of sparking a wider conflict..

Gabon dispatches government ministers to encourage voter registrations	Yaoundé, Cameroon — Civilians in Gabon are being encouraged this month to register to vote in presidential elections scheduled for August 2025, as ordered by transitional President General Brica Clotaire Oligui Nguema. The planned elections are envisioned to end a two-year transition to civilian rule. Voter registration began Jan. 2 and is due to conclude at the end of the month. Gabon's political opposition says voter registration has not been as robust as expected because civilians believe the transitional president wants to confiscate power, assertions that Nguema denies. The elections are part of a plan for a return to constitutional order after an Aug. 30, 2023 coup that ousted longtime President Ali Bongo Ondimba. Gabon officials say at least 300,000 new voters, who have either reached the legal voting age of 18 or who are not yet registered, are expected to be added to the 860,000 or so civilians that registered as part of Gabon's November 16, 2024 constitutional referendum, and whose names are already in the elections database. This week, officials of the central African nation said senior state functionaries were deployed to encourage civilians to register before the January 31 deadline. Ministers dispatched to towns and villages this week are expected to work with voter enrollment teams and make sure civilians are formally registered as voters so they can participate in the August elections and cast ballots. But Gabon's opposition and civil society groups say civilians are not heeding calls by government officials to register because they are not sure Nguema is ready to hand power to civilian rule. Cyrille Bissiengou is the deputy coordinator of Yes Volunteers, a group created in 2024 to encourage civilians to take part in Gabon’s electoral process. Bissiengou said he is not sure that 300,000 new voters will register before the Jan. 31 deadline, as Gabon's government expects. Many young people told Yes Volunteers they weren't sure about Nguemas' willingness to hand power to civilians. Bissiengou spoke on Gabon's state TV on Tuesday. Jean Remy Yama, leader of Unitary Dynamics, one of Gabon's leading worker trade unions and member of Gabon's senate, also expressed skepticism. Yama said if Nguema truly wanted to hand power to civilian rule, he should have allowed Gabon's parliament and senate to set up an independent elections management body to ensure free, fair and transparent elections. He said by asking a minister appointed by transitional rulers to register voters and organize elections, Nguema is indicating that he wants to hold power. Gabon's constitution, voted in a Nov. 16 referendum to lay the groundwork for elections, bars transitional government members from running in the 2025 presidential polls but permits Nguema to run for president. Nguema has not said whether he will be a candidate and the transitional government refutes claims the military leader is planning to maintain power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gabon-dispatches-government-ministers-to-encourage-voter-registrations-/7945820.html	2025-01-22T01:36:45-08:00	
Trump’s WHO, climate orders bring challenges and opportunities for Africa, China	Johannesburg — On inauguration day, U.S. President Donald Trump signed executive orders that set in motion the country’s withdrawal from the Paris Climate Treaty as well as from the World Health Organization. While it may be some time before the broader impact of those moves will be clear, Cobus Van Staden, a China-Africa expert with the South African Institute for International Affairs, says one unintended consequence could be a shift in the global balance of power in these international institutions. 'The U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization, from the Paris Accord weakens the voice that the U.S. had in those organizations,' Van Staden said. 'The net effect of many of these orders is to just further make China more central in the relationship with many Global South countries, particularly also in Africa.' While China may be the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter, it’s also the biggest manufacturer of green technology products globally, notes Christian-Geraud Neema, from the think tank called China Global South Project. 'When the U.S. withdraws from the Paris Accords, China can rightfully put forward its narrative of being the green technology champion,' Neema said. During a news conference on Tuesday, Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Guo Jiakun voiced concern about Trump’s decision on the Paris Climate Agreement. 'Climate change is a common challenge facing mankind. No country can stay out of it. No country can be immune to it. China's determination and actions to actively respond to climate change will be consistent,' Guo said. Jean Kaseya, Africa CDC Director-General told Newzroom Afrika on Tuesday that the withdrawl could curtail services for people in Africa. 'My interest is the health of African people, and the U.S. is the main partner that we have in Africa and the U.S. is providing a large spectrum of services to African people,' Kaseya said. 'And I think it’s time for us to understand the decision that is made and to see how we can overcome this challenge for African people.' At the same time, Kaseya says he sees opportunities with the new administration to create as he puts it 'a win-win for all of us.' Neema of the China-Global South Project said the U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization – which will take a year – could help position China as a leader in global health. 'When it comes to health cooperation, we can also see how much China’s expanding its own influence in Africa, with different medical cooperation it has with different countries,' Neema said. China has a long record of building hospitals in Africa and sending medical aid ships and doctors to the continent, but Washington’s withdraw could see even more demand for funding and support from Beijing. Trump has accused the WHO of mishandling the COVID-19 pandemic. He also has said he resents the fact that the U.S. – the WHO’s largest contributor – gives much more money to the organization than China contributes. 'Pretty sad though, think of it,' Trump said. 'China pays $39 million and we pay %500 million, and China's a bigger country.' In further remarks on Tuesday, the Chinese foreign ministry spokesman said China would 'continue to support the WHO in fulfilling its responsibilities, deepen international public health cooperation,' and 'strengthen global health governance.' Bob Wekesa, director at the African Center for the Study of the United States, at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, said ultimately, Trump’s orders meant Africa would have to turn elsewhere for help. 'African countries will now eventually have to figure out how to raise their own internal resources for matters to do with help, and if not, kind of rely on Europeans and the Chinese and Indians,' Wekesa said. Last month, the U.S. announced more than $1 billion in humanitarian assistance to African countries. But Wekesa said with the U.S. pulling out of the WHO, relying less on the U.S. is a lesson that African countries already learned during Trump’s first term in office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-who-climate-orders-bring-challenges-and-opportunities-for-africa-china/7945804.html	2025-01-22T00:49:32-08:00	
Turkey detains nine people over ski resort hotel fire that killed 76	ANKARA, TURKEY — Turkey has detained nine people, including the owner of the hotel, in connection with a deadly fire that claimed the lives of 76 people and injured dozens at a ski resort in western Turkey, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said early Wednesday. Yerlikaya also reported that the bodies of 45 victims had been handed over to their families, while DNA tests were being conducted to identify the remaining bodies at the forensic institute. The fire occurred at the Grand Kartal Hotel in the Kartalkaya ski resort in the Bolu mountains. The hotel, where the fire broke out, expressed deep sorrow in a statement on Wednesday and pledged full cooperation with the investigation. 'We are cooperating with authorities to shed light on all aspects of this incident,' the statement said. 'We are deeply saddened by the losses and want you to know that we share this pain with all our hearts.' The 12-story hotel, which had 238 registered guests, was consumed by flames after the fire started on the restaurant floor around 3:30 a.m. local time or 0030 GMT. Survivors described scenes of panic as they fled through smoke-filled corridors and jumped from windows to escape. Authorities are facing growing criticism over the hotel’s safety measures, as survivors reported that no fire alarms went off during the incident. Guests said they had to navigate the smoke-filled corridors in complete darkness. President Tayyip Erdogan declared Wednesday a day of national mourning following the tragedy, which occurred during the peak of the winter tourism season, with many families from Istanbul and Ankara traveling to the Bolu mountains for skiing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-detains-nine-people-over-ski-resort-hotel-fire-that-killed-76/7945747.html	2025-01-21T23:19:37-08:00

Weather Service issues red flag warnings for fire-ravaged California	The National Weather Service issued a Red Flag Warning for most of California’s Los Angeles and Ventura counties on Tuesday for the area’s 'extremely low relative humidity and periods of gusty offshore winds.' The weather service said its 'Particularly Dangerous Situation Red Flag warning has ended, but dangerous fire weather conditions persist through Thursday or Friday.' Northeast winds will remain 'gusty' in the hills and mountains, the service said in a statement. Low humidities are set to continue. Some areas will experience a lull in the winds Tuesday night into Wednesday, but extremely dry conditions will continue and winds will strengthen again late Wednesday, according to the weather service. The Red Flag Warning covers most of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties through 8 p.m. Thursday. Earlier Tuesday, the weather service said there was an extreme risk of fire weather over parts of Southern California. The service said winds of 32 to 64 kilometers per hour, combined with 'stronger winds in the terrain, low relative humidity, and dry fuels, have contributed to the dangerous conditions.' Strong winds sparked some scattered fires Tuesday in Los Angeles, but alert firefighters quickly brought the fires under control. At least 27 people have died in a series of wildfires across the Los Angeles area during the past two weeks as Santa Ana winds mixed with dry conditions on the ground to quickly spread blazes. Los Angeles County Supervisor Kathryn Barger has called for an outside investigation into the evacuation notification process for residents of western Altadena, near the Eaton Fire, one of several that erupted across Los Angeles. A report in the Los Angeles Times says evacuation orders for western Altadena were delayed for hours. 'From what I have been told, it was a night of pure chaos for both fire and first responders,' Barger told The Times. The county supervisor said she has 'deep concerns' about what happened. Residents told the Times that by the time they received evacuation orders, many of the homes in the area already were on fire. Seventeen people are reported to have died in the Eaton fire. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said an executive order she signed Tuesday is designed to curb the flow of toxic debris from the region’s fires and protect the area’s beaches and oceans. 'This is to prevent additional damage to areas already ravaged by fire and also to protect our watershed, beaches and ocean from toxic runoff,' the mayor said. City workers will remove toxic materials and set up barriers to direct the flow of debris into the sewer system. Meteorologists say rain forecast for the region will begin late Friday and last until early Saturday. National Weather Service meteorologist Bryan Lewis said 'In terms of ending the fire season, it’s probably not going to be enough for that. But it’ll certainly help a little bit.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/weather-service-issues-red-flag-warnings-for-fire-ravaged-california/7945706.html	2025-01-21T20:07:12-08:00

Trump says he would sanction Russia if Putin does not negotiate on Ukraine	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Donald Trump said on Tuesday he would likely impose sanctions on Russia if its president, Vladimir Putin, refuses to negotiate about ending the war in Ukraine. Trump gave no details on possible additional sanctions. The United States has already sanctioned Russia heavily for its invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Trump said his administration was also looking at the issue of sending weapons to Ukraine, adding his view that the European Union should be doing more to support Ukraine. 'We're talking to [Ukrainian President Volodymyr] Zelenskyy; we're going to be talking with President Putin very soon,' Trump said. 'We're going to look at it.' Trump said he had pressed Chinese President Xi Jinping in a call to intervene to stop the Ukraine war. 'He's not done very much on that. He's got a lot of ... power, like we have a lot of power. I said, 'You ought to get it settled.' We did discuss it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7945674.html	2025-01-21T18:39:29-08:00	
Trump says EU 'in for tariffs', warns of 10% rate on China	U.S. President Donald Trump pledged Tuesday to hit the European Union with tariffs, adding that a 10% duty on Chinese imports could also come as soon as February 1. Trump, who was speaking to reporters at the White House a day after being sworn in, cited the need to rectify the EU's trade imbalances with the United States while taking aim once again at Beijing over fentanyl trafficking. 'They treat us very, very badly. So they're going to be in for tariffs,' Trump said of the EU. 'You can't get fairness unless you do that.' A day earlier, Trump accused the bloc of not importing enough American products, saying he would 'straighten that out' by imposing duties or by urging for more oil and gas purchases. Regarding China, Trump on Tuesday reiterated his threat to impose a 10% tariff, saying it was 'based on the fact that they're sending fentanyl to Mexico and Canada.' When asked how soon these tariffs could be enacted, he added: 'Probably February 1st is the date we're looking at.' This was the same date he earlier said he could impose 25% tariffs on Canada and Mexico, accusing them of failing to stop illegal immigration and fentanyl trafficking into the United States. Mexico, Canada and China are leading sources for goods imported by the United States, according to official trade data. The EU's economy commissioner vowed this week that the bloc stands ready to defend its interests. Speaking at an annual meeting of global elites in Davos, Switzerland, EU chief Ursula von der Leyen declared that Europe was ready to negotiate with Trump, while maintaining that Washington remains an important partner. The EU's 'first priority will be to engage early, discuss common interests, and be ready to negotiate' with Trump, she said. 'We will be pragmatic, but we will always stand by our principles, to protect our interests and uphold our values,' she said. On Monday, Trump vowed an immediate overhaul of the U.S. trade system, promising to 'tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.' He signed an order directing agencies to study a range of trade issues including deficits, unfair practices and currency manipulation. The investigations could pave the way for further duties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7945671.html	2025-01-21T18:21:32-08:00	
Rare snowstorm blankets Houston and New Orleans	HOUSTON — A rare winter storm churned across the U.S. Gulf Coast on Tuesday, breaking snowfall records more than a century old in a southern region where flurries are unusual, as much of the United States remained in a dangerous deep freeze. A snowstorm warning was in effect for 31 million people - from southern Texas east through Georgia and north to the Carolinas and into Virginia - until Wednesday morning, the National Weather Service said. With the storm moving east, crews near Houston plowed highways on Tuesday while downtown streets, covered in white, were virtually deserted. Schools were closed Tuesday and Wednesday as the city, the fourth-biggest in the U.S., expected about 10 cm of snow to fall. 'I've been in Texas my entire life and I have never seen this depth of snow,' said Ishan Bhaidani, 29, who owns a fintech consulting company in Houston. 'It typically gets more icy, but this type of fine snow, this is a first.' Authorities in Houston investigated two deaths that may be weather-related, including that of a homeless man who was found near an apartment complex, the Harris County Sheriff said on X. Snow was also falling in New Orleans, where nearly 25 cm had accumulated by late afternoon, according to the National Weather Service. Richard Bann, an NWS meteorologist, said that the service was trying to confirm whether Tuesday's snowfall broke a New Orleans record set in 1895. The last time New Orleans received any measurable snowfall was 2009, according to the NWS. 'Stay home and stay off the roads,' said a bundled-up New Orleans Mayor LaToya Cantrell, as winds whipped snow in her face, in a video message to residents on X. Breaking a 144-year-old record, more than 15 cm of snow fell in Mobile, Alabama, by late afternoon, according to the NWS. The storm is expected to crawl through Mississippi, Georgia and Florida early this week. The storm snarled air travel with flights delayed or canceled on Tuesday. More than 1,000 flights departing or bound for Houston's George Bush Intercontinental Airport were canceled, according to Flightaware.com. Temperatures dipped into single digits Fahrenheit, well below freezing, across the region. Forecasters and local leaders urged residents to protect themselves from frostbite and to take steps to keep their water pipes from rupturing. Across the South, the snow, combined with an inch of ice accumulation and wind gusts of up to 64 kph, could make road and air travel difficult for several days, while threatening to topple power lines and trees, forecasters said. About 30,000 homes and businesses in southeastern Texas were without power at one point on Tuesday, but by late afternoon that number fell to fewer than 8,000, according to Poweroutage.us. Atlanta, Georgia, and Montgomery, Alabama, opened warming centers and closed government offices in anticipation of the storm. Numerous school districts canceled classes, according to local news. To the north, most of the eastern two-thirds of the United States experienced brutally cold temperatures as an Arctic front was expected to linger through at least Tuesday. Grand Lake, Colorado, was the coldest spot in the U.S. on Tuesday morning at -39 C.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rare-snowstorm-blankets-houston-and-new-orleans-/7945667.html	2025-01-21T18:02:33-08:00	
Trump highlights partnership investing $500B in AI	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Tuesday talked up a joint venture investing up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank. The new entity, Stargate, will start building data centers and the electricity generation needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House. The initial investment is expected to be $100 billion and could reach five times that sum. 'It's big money and high quality people,' said Trump, adding that it's 'a resounding declaration of confidence in America's potential' under his new administration. Joining Trump fresh off his inauguration at the White House were Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle. All three credited Trump for helping to make the project possible, even though building has started and the project goes back to 2024. 'This will be the most important project of this era,' said Altman, CEO of OpenAI. Ellison noted that the data centers are already under construction with 10 being built so far. The chairman of Oracle suggested that the project was also tied to digital health records and would make it easier to treat diseases such as cancer by possibly developing a customized vaccine. 'This is the beginning of golden age,' said Son, referencing Trump's statement that the U.S. would be in a 'golden age' with him back in the White House. Son, a billionaire based in Japan, committed in December to invest $100 billion in U.S. projects over the next four years. He previously committed to $50 billion in new investments ahead of Trump's first term, which included a large stake in the troubled office-sharing company WeWork. While Trump has seized on similar announcements to show that his presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the development of AI, which holds the promise of increasing productivity by automating work but also the risk of displacing jobs if poorly implemented. The initial plans for Stargate go back to the Biden administration. Tech news outlet The Information first reported on the project in March 2024. OpenAI has long relied on Microsoft data centers to build its AI systems, but it has increasingly signaled an interest in building its own data centers. OpenAI wrote in a letter to the Biden administration's Commerce Department last fall that planning and permitting for such projects 'can be lengthy and complex, particularly for energy infrastructure.' The push to build data centers also predates Trump's presidency. Last October, the financial company Blackstone estimated that the U.S. would see $1 trillion invested in data centers over five years, with another $1 trillion being committed internationally. Those estimates for investments suggest that much of the new capital will go through Stargate as OpenAI has established itself as a sector leader with the 2022 launch of its ChaptGPT, a chatbot that captivated the public imagination with its ability to answer complex questions and perform basic business tasks. The White House has put an emphasis on making it easier to build out new electricity generation in anticipation of AI's expansion, knowing that the United States is in a competitive race against China to develop a technology increasingly being adopted by businesses. Still, the regulatory outlook for AI remains somewhat uncertain as Trump on Monday overturned the 2023 order signed by then-President Joe Biden to create safety standards and watermarking of AI-generated content, among other goals, in hopes of putting guardrails on the technology's possible risks to national security and economic well-being. Trump supporter Elon Musk, worth more than $400 billion, was an early investor in OpenAI but has since challenged its move to for-profit status and has started his own AI company, xAI. Musk is also in charge of the 'Department of Government Efficiency' created formally on Monday by Trump with the goal of reducing government spending. Trump previously in January announced a $20 billion investment by DAMAC Properties in the United Arab Emirates to build data centers tied to AI.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-highlights-partnership-investing-500b-in-ai-/7945647.html	2025-01-21T17:47:06-08:00	
Namibia doctors fight cervical cancer	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — The cervical cancer rate in Namibia is 37.5 for every 100,000 women, about three times higher than the rate worldwide. Cervical cancer is one of the most preventable cancers and doctors in Namibia are advocating greater access to healthcare and the HPV vaccine to reduce the prevalence of the disease. November 2009 was a turning point in the life of Barbara Kamba-Nyathi. At the tender age of 29, she was diagnosed with stage three cervical cancer. Her doctors recommended radiation therapy as opposed to chemotherapy, because at that time she had not yet had children and radiation therapy would help her avoid premature menopause. But that was not her only struggle. Kamba-Nyathi, who lived in Windhoek at the time, said she faced stigma for cervical cancer's association with HIV and the human papilloma virus. 'One of the challenges that come with having a diagnosis like cervical cancer is that our African society its usually taboo to talk about things of our reproductive organs, you know, our reproductive system is taboo,' said Kamba-Nyathi. 'We don't talk about such things and in the end, we tend to normalize pain and even things that don't feel right in our bodies we tend to normalize them and they become part of our identity.' Rolf Hansen, the chief executive officer of the Cancer Association of Namibia, said a lack of education and a lack of access to healthcare prevent many women from getting tested or being treated for cervical cancer or HPV, which is the second-leading cause of cancer among sub-Saharan women. 'Like I said, HIV and HPV work hand in hand to fuel the cervical cancer pandemic,' said Hansen. 'Now, in our country as well we see that in our low-income setting as well as our rural setting, we have high HPV prevalence, high cervical cancer so a lot of work needs to be done at a grassroots level so that we can actually combat this disease.' Doctors Simon and David Emvula provide health services to underprivileged communities, together with the Be Free/Break Free program — an initiative of former first lady Monica Geingos — in Namibia's largest township of Katutura. They are advocating for the rollout of the HPV vaccine for girls between the ages of 9 and 14, before they become sexually active. Emvula said that during one screening in Windhoek on Saturday, they treated more than 100 patients, screening girls and women for HPV, cervical cancer, fibroids and other sexually transmitted infections and sexually transmitted diseases. Emvula spoke to VOA at his practice in Windhoek. 'The turnout was actually beyond what we expected and once again it was an eye-opener ... that there is definitely a need for that,' said Emvula. Emvula said HPV vaccination is among the most effective ways to prevent cervical cancer but the government of Namibia is lagging. HPV vaccines have been introduced in 129 countries worldwide and the Namibian government has endorsed the rollout of the vaccines for girls ages 9 to 14. Despite promises made as reported by VOA last year, the vaccines have not yet been made available. Namibia's executive director of health, Ben Nangombe, could not be reached for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-doctors-fight-cervical-cancer/7945602.html	2025-01-21T17:01:44-08:00	
Lavrov echoes debunked Kremlin narratives to justify war, undermine NATO	Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's mid-January press conference 'on the performance of Russian diplomacy in 2024' was filled with false and misleading claims, many previously debunked, highlighting the Kremlin's broader disinformation tactics. Russia's disinformation aims to legitimize its war, undermine NATO and erode Western support for Ukraine. By targeting domestic and international audiences — especially skeptics of U.S. policy — it seeks to shape perceptions, distort historical facts and create false equivalencies. The goal is to justify aggression while portraying Ukraine as illegitimate and extremist. NATO expansion Lavrov falsely claims that NATO promised not to expand eastward. 'We have long lost hope that Western countries will fulfill their promises and obligations, including NATO's non-expansion to the east, refraining from luring Ukraine into NATO,' he said. In reality, NATO has always maintained an 'open door policy,' allowing any state to join if it meets membership requirements. No treaty ever restricted NATO expansion. In 2014, former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev confirmed the West never promised the Soviet Union otherwise. In 1997, U.S. President Bill Clinton rejected a 'gentlemen's agreement' with Russian President Boris Yeltsin to bar former Soviet republics from joining NATO. These facts disprove Lavrov's claims that NATO broke any commitments to Russia, exposing the Kremlin's use of disinformation to justify its foreign policy and aggression against Ukraine. Claim that invasion was defensive Lavrov on Jan. 14 also falsely claimed that Russia's war against Ukraine is defensive and aimed at protecting Russian-speaking populations. 'Despite the Minsk agreements, [Ukraine] bombed these people [in Donbas], who should have been granted a special status in accordance with the U.N. Security Council's resolutions,' he said. 'After years of explaining this … we ultimately launched the special military operation to protect our security interests and the interests of the Russian people in Ukraine.' This false narrative has been challenged consistently. The international community, including the United Nations, has condemned Russia's invasion of Ukraine as an act of aggression violating international law. Investigations have found no credible evidence supporting claims of systemic oppression of Russian-speaking populations in Ukraine that would justify such military intervention. United Nations data shows civilian casualties in Donbas steadily declined before Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion, contradicting claims of a 'humanitarian' mission. Experts have repeatedly demonstrated the war is not about protection but constitutes genocide against Ukrainians, exposing the Kremlin's disinformation to justify aggression. Zelenskyy's legitimacy Lavrov falsely called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's presidency the product of a coup, though he won a democratic election, which even Russia initially recognized. '[T]he current Ukrainian regime, which came to power through an illegal anti-constitutional coup,' he said during the Jan. 14 press conference. Zelenskyy's democratic election — like that of his predecessor, Petro Poroshenko — was recognized globally, including by Russia. Before Poroshenko, Viktor Yanukovych fled Ukraine during the Revolution of Dignity in 2014, not due to a coup, but amid mass protests. Despite Russian claims of U.S. involvement, no credible evidence links the protests to foreign orchestration. 'Self-determination' of Crimea, Donbas Lavrov falsely claimed that Crimea and Donbas left Ukraine legally. 'The right to self-determination underpins the decisions made by residents of Crimea in 2014 and by residents of Novorossiya and Donbass in 2022,' he said. Russia's annexations violate international law, as the referendums were conducted under military occupation without legal legitimacy. Crimea, Donbas and other territories temporarily occupied by Russia are internationally recognized as part of Ukraine. The right to self-determination does not grant any group the automatic right to secede, particularly through force or foreign intervention. Russia's own constitution denies the right to secession, reinforcing that self-determination is subordinate to state sovereignty. This was affirmed in two decisions by the Russian Constitutional Court, prioritizing territorial integrity over international self-determination principles. Moreover, in Putin's Russia, advocating for national self-determination can lead to criminal penalties. The 2022 invasion revealed Moscow's imperial ambitions, denying Ukraine's existence and history. Russia forcibly deported Ukrainian children, leading the OSCE to label Russia a colonial empire rejecting rights to indigenous peoples. Ukraine leadership called 'Nazi regime' Lavrov falsely called the current political regime of Ukraine a Nazi organization. '[T]he issue of [Ukraine's accession to] NATO must be taken off the table, and the Russian speakers' language, religious and other rights, which Zelensky's Nazi regime has outlawed, must be restored.' The Kremlin falsely claims Ukraine is a Nazi state, ignoring the fact that ultranationalist groups in Ukraine, like Svoboda, have limited popular support and political power. Svoboda's influence has diminished, receiving only 2.15% of the vote in 2019. In contrast, ultranationalists in Russia have significant influence on state and military policies, affecting domestic and foreign agendas. Alleged ban on Russian language Lavrov also repeated the fallacious allegation that the Russian language is barred in Ukraine. 'They [Ukraine] enacted a law banning the Russian language long before the special military operation started. … The Russian language has been totally outlawed.' No law banned Russian in Ukraine, rather, policies promoted the Ukrainian language while still allowing Russian usage. In July 2012, Ukraine's Verkhovna Rada passed a law granting Russian 'regional language' status in areas where Russian speakers exceeded 10%. While opposition members argued it diminished Ukrainian, some regions, including Donbas, recognized Russian as the official language. After Yanukovych fled in February 2014, the law was repealed, but acting President Oleksandr Turchynov declined to approve the repeal. It stayed in effect until 2018, when Ukraine's Constitutional Court struck it down. This was part of Ukraine's effort to strengthen its national identity and limit Russia's post-Soviet influence. Accusations of TurkStream sabotage Lavrov also falsely accused the United States and Ukraine of targeting the TurkStream gas pipeline, claiming Washington is encouraging Ukraine to sabotage the pipeline. '[T]he U.S. has given the green light to terrorist attacks designed to undermine EU's wellbeing in terms of energy supplies,' he said. 'Now, they are encouraging their Ukrainian clients to put the TurkStream out of operation, just as they did with the Nord Stream pipelines.' No concrete evidence has been provided to substantiate these allegations, making such claims speculative and misleading.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lavrov-echoes-debunked-kremlin-narratives-to-justify-war-undermine-nato/7945306.html	2025-01-21T16:58:16-08:00

Democratic-led states sue to block Trump's birthright citizenship order	Twenty-two Democratic-led U.S. states sued Tuesday to try to block President Donald Trump from ending birthright U.S. citizenship for the children of undocumented migrants living in the country. The suit by the states, joined by the city governments in Washington, D.C., and San Francisco, are among the first filed by those opposing Trump's executive orders, which he signed in the immediate hours after his inauguration Monday. The U.S. Constitution guarantees citizenship to those born in the country, and court rulings have made only small exceptions, such as rejecting citizenship for the offspring of foreign diplomats born in the U.S. Presidents cannot unilaterally change the Constitution, which instead must be accomplished through large majorities of lawmakers in Congress or wide state legislative action. But Trump, as part of his crackdown on 11 million or more undocumented migrants living in the U.S., signed one executive order directing U.S. agencies to stop handing citizenship documents to the offspring of undocumented migrants. The Republican president's order directed federal officials, starting Feb. 19, to not recognize U.S. citizenship for children born in the United States to mothers who are in the country illegally or are in the U.S. only temporarily, such as visa holders, and whose fathers are not citizens or lawful permanent residents. Trump's nascent administration is moving quickly to deport such migrants back to their home countries, even if they have lived in the U.S. for years, paid taxes and assimilated into American life. Trump's immigration agents are first targeting undocumented migrants who have been convicted of crimes. New Jersey Attorney General Matthew Platkin said in a statement, 'State attorneys general have been preparing for illegal actions like [Trump's no-citizenship edict], and today's immediate lawsuit sends a clear message to the Trump administration that we will stand up for our residents and their basic constitutional rights.' The White House did not immediately comment on the suits, three of which were filed in Boston, Massachusetts, and Concord, New Hampshire. Four states filed a separate lawsuit in Washington. Democratic-led states and advocacy groups have immediately challenged two other Trump executive orders, one creating the Department of Government Efficiency — a nongovernmental advisory panel overseen by billionaire Trump supporter Elon Musk — and another weakening job protections for government civil servants to make it easier for the Trump administration to fire them and replace them with Trump loyalists. Massachusetts Attorney General Andrea Joy Campbell said that if Trump's no-citizenship order is allowed to stand, it would mean more than 150,000 children born annually in the United States would be denied the right to citizenship. 'President Trump does not have the authority to take away constitutional rights,' she said in a statement. One of the plaintiffs challenging the order is a woman living in Massachusetts identified only as 'O. Doe.' She is in the country through temporary protected status and is due to give birth in March. The temporary protected status immigration designation is available to people whose home countries have experienced natural disasters, armed conflicts or other extraordinary events and currently covers more than 1 million people from 17 nations. U.S. birthright citizenship was enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution in the aftermath of the Civil War in the early 1860s and ratified in 1868. It says: 'All persons born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.' Platkin, the New Jersey attorney general, said Tuesday that presidents might have broad authority, but they are not kings. 'The president cannot, with a stroke of a pen, write the 14th Amendment out of existence, period,' he said. Connecticut Attorney General William Tong, a U.S. citizen by birthright and the nation's first Chinese American elected attorney general, said the lawsuit was personal for him. 'The 14th Amendment says what it means, and it means what it says — if you are born on American soil, you are an American. Period. Full stop,' he said. 'There is no legitimate legal debate on this question. But the fact that Trump is dead wrong will not prevent him from inflicting serious harm right now on American families like my own.' Chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts along with other immigrant rights advocates have also filed suit to block Trump's action. Their suit asked a court to rule that Trump's order is unconstitutional. It cites the case of a woman identified as 'Carmen,' who is pregnant but is not a U.S. citizen. The lawsuit says she has lived in the United States for more than 15 years and has a pending visa application that could lead to permanent resident status. She has no other immigration status, and the father of her expected child has no immigration status either, the suit says. 'Stripping children of the 'priceless treasure' of citizenship is a grave injury,' the suit said. 'It denies them the full membership in U.S. society to which they are entitled.' Some material in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democratic-led-states-sue-to-block-trump-s-birthright-citizenship-order/7945334.html	2025-01-21T15:03:31-08:00	
Trump's UN nominee touts peace through strength on world stage	UNITED NATIONS — President Donald Trump's nominee for U.S. ambassador to the United Nations told senators at her confirmation hearing Tuesday that she will promote his doctrine of 'peace through strength' on the world stage if she is confirmed. 'It is imperative to ensure strong American leadership at the United Nations,' Elise Stefanik told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 'I share President Trump's vision of a U.N. reformed by strong America First peace through strength and return to this founding mission of promoting peace and security around the world.' Stefanik, 40, from a rural New York district, has been in Congress for a decade and has served on national security related committees. As chair of the Republican Conference since 2021, she is the fourth-ranking House Republican but will have to step down if she is approved. She appeared to have bipartisan support, with Democratic legislators largely posing standard foreign policy questions and avoiding partisan attacks. China's influence China's growing influence within the United Nations was at the top of lawmakers' concerns. 'China has used its malign influence to block attempts to discuss the Chinese government-sponsored genocide against the Uyghurs, and they have blocked our ally Taiwan from fully participating in the U.N.,' committee chair Jim Risch of Idaho said. He also criticized Beijing for pushing its nationals into U.N. system jobs to serve its national interests. Stefanik agreed that Beijing has made 'significant inroads' at the world body and said Washington needs to push back on it with a 'long-term strategy.' 'Working closely with our allies and our partners, both at the most junior levels and at the more senior levels within the U.N., we need to make sure that we are running candidates – either American or allied nations – in the election process for key leadership posts within the U.N. system,' she said. Stefanik said efforts should focus on technical organizations such as the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) – both organizations that until recently had been under the leadership of international civil servants from China. And she warned that the United States must be vigilant in protecting its ethical standards related to the use of artificial intelligence. The United States is the single largest financial contributor to the United Nations, and several senators questioned whether U.S. taxpayers are still getting their money's worth from the organization. The nominee said she would seek to do an agency-by-agency audit of what U.S. funds are spent on and press for reforms including more transparency and accountability. She also had praise for agencies led by U.S. appointees, including the World Food Program and the U.N. children's agency, UNICEF. 'Stefanik's remarks signaled that the U.S. is going to be tough on the U.N., but not walk away from the organization altogether,' said Richard Gowan, U.N. director for the International Crisis Group. 'I actually think that quite a lot of her lines about the need to ensure the U.N. offers value for money will play well with other big donors to the organization, who are keen to control costs.' One of Trump's first executive orders on Monday was to notify the World Health Organization of his intention to withdraw the United States from the body – and with it the hundreds of millions of dollars it contributes to WHO's budget. Stefanik said she supported the move. 'WHO failed on a global stage in the COVID pandemic for all the world to see,' she said. Stefanik was most passionate about 'our most precious ally' Israel and defending it from what she called 'antisemitic rot' and bias at the United Nations. 'We need to be a voice of moral clarity on the U.N. Security Council and at the United Nations at large, for the world to hear the importance of standing with Israel, and I intend to do that,' she said. Asked by Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen about her vision for 'the day after' in Gaza, she said Trump is 'uniquely positioned' to bring peace to the region, to eradicate Hamas and Lebanese Hezbollah, and protect Israel's national security. Van Hollen pressed further, asking if she supports the view of far-right Israeli legislators who say Israel has a biblical right to the entire West Bank. Stefanik replied 'yes.' Crisis Group's Gowan said that last comment might fuel 'nervousness' among U.N. members that Trump could endorse an Israeli effort to annex parts of the Palestinian territories. But overall, he thinks international diplomats will have found her testimony reassuring. 'Especially after the whiplash effect of Trump disowning the Paris [climate] deal and World Health Organization during his first afternoon in office,' he said. No vote has been scheduled yet in the committee on her nomination. If Stefanik passes that hurdle, and she is widely expected to, then her nomination would go to the full Senate for a final vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-un-nominee-touts-peace-through-strength-on-world-stage-/7945332.html	2025-01-21T15:01:33-08:00	
Zelenskyy: Ukraine would need at least 200,000 peacekeepers for ceasefire	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Tuesday that if a ceasefire deal were enacted with Russia, 'at least 200,000 European peacekeepers' would need to be on the ground in Ukraine to defend the Eastern European country against a possible attack by Russia. Zelenskyy, speaking a day after Donald Trump's return to the U.S. presidency, said Europe must 'take care of itself.' He said 200,000 peacekeepers from European countries would be the minimum number of peacekeepers required, 'Otherwise, it's nothing.' 'Let's not forget, there is no ocean separating European countries from Russia,' Zelenskyy said in his address at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Ukraine's president said Russia's demand that Ukraine reduce its army to one-fifth of its current size of 800,000 is not an option. Ukraine's best defense during a ceasefire deal, Zelenskyy said, would be its membership into NATO. While most European countries support Ukraine's entry into the alliance, Germany and the U.S. oppose it. Hungary and Slovakia, which are pro-Russia governments, also oppose Ukraine's entry into NATO. Zelenskyy also called on European nations to consider Trump's recent call for NATO members to increase their defense spending to 5% of GDP. 'If it takes 5% of GDP to cover defense, then so be it, 5% it is.' Zelenskyy said Europe needs to create a united security and defense policy. Meanwhile, Ukraine is seeking a meeting with Trump, who had promised before the U.S. election that he would bring a swift end to the war between Russia and Ukraine if he won the American presidency. It has never been clear, though, how he would accomplish that. Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that Russian drone attacks damaged residential buildings in several parts of central and southern Ukraine. The attacks were part of an assault that Ukraine's military said involved 131 Russian drones and four ballistic missiles. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 72 of the drones, the air force said. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysask said on Telegram that Russian attacks damaged houses and a warehouse, injuring one person. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets reported Tuesday that falling drone fragments damaged four residential buildings, a school, a shop and a power line. Poltava Governor Filip Pronin said on Telegram that a drone fell on a house in his region, sparking a fire, while pieces of destroyed drones damaged six residential buildings. Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed 55 Ukrainian aerial drones, mostly in regions along the Russia-Ukraine border. Russian air defenses knocked down 22 of the drones over Bryansk, 12 drones over Rostov and 10 over the Smolensk region, the ministry said. Other intercepts took place over Voronezh, Saratov and Kursk. Smolensk Governor Vasily Anokhin said on Telegram that drone debris damaged several residential buildings, while Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a drone attack on a car injured two people.

Syrian Kurds look for continued US support under Trump	WASHINGTON — Kurdish groups in Syria are expressing hope for continued support from the United States as President Donald Trump begins his second term in office. Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces have been a key U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State terror group, also known as IS or ISIS. Supported by a U.S.-led global coalition, the SDF runs a large territory once controlled by IS in northeastern Syria. Mazloum Abdi, general commander of the SDF, congratulated Trump on Monday after he was sworn in. 'We look forward to continuing cooperation in achieving stability, defeating terrorism, and supporting peace in Northeast Syria,' Abdi said in a post on the social media platform X. Following the fall of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad last month, U.S.-backed Kurdish forces have been under mounting pressure by both the new authorities in Damascus and the Turkish government to disarm. Turkish-backed Syrian armed groups also have been in daily clashes with the SDF in parts of northern Syria. Ankara views the SDF as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, considered to be a terrorist group by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. The U.S. has about 2,000 troops in Syria as part of the anti-IS mission, according to the Pentagon. Asked during a Jan. 7 press conference whether he would keep the same troop capacity in Syria, Trump said he wouldn't comment on a military strategy. With regards to tensions between the government of Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Syrian Kurds, Trump said he is friends with Erdogan. 'He's a guy I like and respect. I think he respects me also,' Trump said during the same press conference. 'He's the one that didn't go after certain people after I requested that he not, you know what I'm talking about, the Kurds. I don't know how long that's going to [hold] because they're natural enemies. They hate each other, but he didn't do that yet, and he didn't do it in the past also. He started, and I said please don't do that, and he didn't do it,' Trump added. Trump was referring to discussions he had with the Turkish president in 2019 during the former's first term in office. Following a partial U.S. troop withdrawal from northeast Syria in October 2019, the Turkish military and their Syrian proxies carried out a major ground offensive against Syrian Kurdish forces. Turkey ended its campaign after several ceasefire agreements brokered separately by the U.S. and Russia. Newly appointed Secretary of State Marco Rubio said during his Senate confirmation hearing last week that it was important to continue supporting Syrian Kurdish forces. 'We need to recognize that there are implications to abandoning partners who have a great sacrifice and threat, actually jailed the ISIS fighters,' Rubio said, referring to the thousands of IS foreign fighters who are held in Kurdish-run prisons and camps in northeast Syria. 'One of the reasons why we were able to dismantle ISIS, because they [Syrian Kurds] were willing to host them in jails, a great personal threat to them, and obviously that situation is very tenuous,' he said. Rubio noted that it was in the U.S. national interest 'to have a Syria that is no longer a playground for ISIS, that respects religious minorities, ranging from Alawites all the way to Christians, that protects the Kurds, and at the same time it is not a vehicle through which Iran can spread its terrorism to Hezbollah and destabilize Lebanon.' The new authorities in Syria are led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group that is a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. Some experts, like Brussels-based Kurdish affairs analyst Hosheng Ossi, argue that the U.S. and its regional partners, such as Israel and Saudi Arabia, should view the SDF and Syrian Kurds as a strategic safeguard to prevent Syria from being entirely controlled by a radical group like the HTS. 'Washington has invested in the SDF for more than a decade, and it would be a strategic blunder to let the SDF in the eastern Euphrates area face an enemy that is even more dangerous than Daesh,' Ossi told VOA, using an Arabic acronym for IS. He said for the Trump administration to have a successful approach toward the Kurdish situation in Syria, it 'could seriously and firmly seek to separate the SDF from the PKK.' Suleyman Ozeren, a professorial lecturer at American University in Washington, said the U.S. remains the only viable mediator between Turkey and the SDF. 'If President Trump intends to fully withdraw from Syria, he may need to apply pressure on both Turkey and the SDF to find a resolution,' he told VOA. 'However, the SDF will likely face significant pressure to make concessions, while Ankara may achieve favorable compromises.' 'Any agreement would also need to involve HTS, which presents both an opportunity and a challenge for Ankara, as HTS itself seeks improved relations with the United States,' he said.

Trump's executive orders on gender draw mixed reaction across Africa	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Conservatives across Africa applauded U.S. President Donald Trump’s executive orders Monday regarding gender and diversity, while gay rights activists and the LGBTQ community on the continent are expressing deep concern. On his first day as the 47th U.S. president, Donald Trump signed a flurry of executive orders, including some that reversed policies of his predecessor, Joe Biden. These included orders revoking some protections for transgender people and defining the sexes strictly as male and female. Trump's actions sparked a mix of reactions throughout Africa. Some, like Bishop John Praise Daniel, vice president of the Pentecostal Fellowship of Nigeria, welcomed Trump’s moves. 'I'm very excited,' he said 'I think Donald Trump has just done what is right, because how can some young persons wake up and say, ‘I don't feel like being a girl, I want to be a boy,’ and their sexes will be changed. We don't need that confusion. Bringing back righteousness, order and sanity to society.' But while many in Africa’s conservative societies are in support, LGBTQ activists strongly opposed the decision, calling it a setback after years of progress and advocacy. Frank Ejiogu, founder of Creme de la Creme, a Nigerian LGBTQ advocacy group, warned of serious consequences. 'We know this will have ripple effects that might catalyze violence against LGBTQ community members in the Global South, which will boil down to discrimination, assault, and a lot of [restrictive] policies that governments will start enacting,' he said. Ejiogu said LGBTQ activists already are planning how to resist such measures. 'We’re strategizing on how to stand firm on what we believe in and for the community,' he said. '[Trump] can only be there for four years. The only thing we promise ourselves all over the globe and in the Global South is to making sure that we fight back against the policies against LGBTQ communities all around the world.' Members of the LGBTQ community already face harsh penalties in many African countries. In Nigeria, same-sex relationships are punishable by up to 14 years in prison. Uganda’s constitutional court upheld a life sentence for homosexuality offenders last year, while Mali’s junta criminalized homosexuality with imprisonment in December.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-executive-orders-on-gender-draw-mixed-reaction-across-africa/7945171.html	2025-01-21T12:43:53-08:00	
US withdrawals from WHO, Paris Agreement met with regret, calls for reversal	Geneva — United Nations agencies say the imminent U.S. withdrawal from the World Health Organization and Paris climate agreement will have serious consequences for global health and efforts to slow down climate change. 'The World Health Organization regrets the announcement that the United States of America intends to withdraw from the organization,' the WHO said Tuesday in response to U.S. President Donald Trump’s declaration Monday that he intends to quit the U.N. health agency. 'WHO plays a crucial role in protecting the health and security of the world’s people, including Americans, by addressing the root causes of disease, building stronger health systems, and detecting, preventing and responding to health emergencies, including disease outbreaks, often in dangerous places where others cannot go,' it stated. In explaining his decision, Trump accused the agency of being subject to 'inappropriate political influence' from other member states. 'World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It’s not going to happen anymore,' he said in signing an executive order Monday, hours after his inauguration. In responding to the allegations, WHO spokesperson Tarik Jasarevic told journalists at a briefing in Geneva Tuesday that the United States, which was one of the founding members of WHO in 1948, had over seven decades together with the WHO, 'saved countless lives and protected Americans and all people from health threats.' 'Together, we ended smallpox, and together we have brought polio to the brink of eradication,' he said. The United States is the WHO’s single largest donor. It contributed $1.284 billion or 18 percent of the agency’s 2022-2023 budget. Jasaravic said the U.S. decision was not unexpected and the WHO was now analyzing the exact details of Trump’s executive order 'to see how this will play out and to see what will be the consequences.' He noted that the United States can formally leave the WHO and stop financing the organization one year after the United Nations receives official written notice of U.S. withdrawal. He said the WHO hopes the United States will reconsider its decision and maintain the U.S.-WHO partnership 'for the benefit of the health and well-being of millions of people around the globe.' 'At the same time, we will continue to work in the world’s most difficult places,' including countries in conflict, 'so we can protect the most vulnerable and be where people need us the most,' he said. 'The world lives longer, healthier, perhaps a little bit happier because of WHO, which goes to places where others cannot go, including Gaza, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Sudan,' Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, OCHA, said in support of the beleaguered agency. In the meantime, U.N. officials have called the U.S. decision to withdraw from the 2015 Paris Agreement 'a major disappointment,' noting that the world’s nations had adopted the accord because they recognized 'the immense harm that climate change is already causing and the enormous opportunity that climate action presents.' Antonio Guterres, the U.N. secretary-general, said that it was 'crucial that the United States remains a leader on environmental issues' in this critical decade for climate action. The World Meteorological Organization has warned that 'climate change is playing out, on an almost daily basis, through more extreme weather.' A recent WMO report finds the last 10 years have been the hottest in recorded history, and that 2024 was the hottest year on record, with temperatures at about 1.55 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial era. 'Every fraction of a degree of global warming has an impact on our economies and our lives,' Clare Nullis, WMO spokesperson said, adding that 'The U.S. accounts for the lion’s share of global economic losses from weather, climate and water-related hazards.' According to the non-profit USAFacts, 'nearly 40 percent of the billion-dollar climate events that have hit the U.S. since 1980 happened between 2017 and the present day.' The data-gathering organization says that '2023 had the most billion-dollar natural disaster events of any year to date.' Nullis pointed out Tuesday that the ongoing Los Angeles wildfires are 'estimated to be the most costly U.S. disaster on record.' 'Not all of these weather-related disasters, you know, have a connection with climate change. We are not saying that…but climate change is an aggravating factor. It is making our weather much more, much more extreme,' she said. 'So, you know, the need for the Paris Agreement is pretty obvious.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-withdrawals-from-who-paris-agreement-met-with-regret-calls-for-reversal/7945156.html	2025-01-21T12:16:07-08:00

Aid trucks enter Gaza, as officials hope ceasefire holds	CAIRO — Aid trucks entered the Gaza Strip from Egypt at a cautious pace, as Egyptian officials tried to assess the pulse of a Gaza cease-fire agreement, amid hopes it would hold and be reinforced in the coming days, despite concerns that developments on the West Bank might cause it to fray. An unnamed U.N. official on the Egyptian side of the Rafah crossing expressed cautious optimism to journalists that aid shipments into Gaza would continue and pick up speed if the current cease-fire holds. 'There's a readiness to manifest to send more trucks [into Gaza] in order to make sure that the [need] is met,' the official said. 'And the initial filling of the gap on the other side is really important.' Saudi-owned al-Arabiya TV's correspondent in Rafah indicated that 600 aid trucks went into Gaza from Egypt Tuesday. He added that on a normal day before the conflict broke out on Oct. 7, 2023, an average of 500 trucks went into Gaza from Egypt. As Gazans told Arab media they were pleased a ceasefire appeared to be holding, some observers expressed worries that so much damage has been done to Gaza that it might not be possible to restore any semblance of normalcy for years to come. Paul Sullivan, a Washington-based Middle East analyst and former professor at the American University of Cairo, told VOA he was not optimistic that a ceasefire deal, even if it holds, will do much to restore calm to Gaza. 'This will be a source of terrorism for decades to come,' Sullivan said. 'The ticking human pain of the starving youth will haunt the world for decades to come.' In the meantime, ordinary Egyptians, the overwhelming majority of whom supported Gaza during the months of the conflict against Israel, appeared pleased to see some hope that the fighting was finally winding down.	https://www.voanews.com/a/aid-trucks-enter-gaza-as-officials-hope-ceasefire-holds/7945116.html	2025-01-21T12:03:04-08:00	
M23 rebels in eastern DR Congo seize town on key supply route	GOMA, CONGO — M23 rebels seized the town of Minova in the eastern part of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, a key supply route for the provincial capital, Goma, authorities said Tuesday. The move led to an exodus of people in the face of a new offensive by the rebel group, which has taken several strategic towns in recent weeks. The provincial governor of South Kivu, Jean-Jacques Purusi, confirmed the capture of Minova, adding that the rebels have also taken the mining towns of Lumbishi, Numbi and Shanje in the same province and the town of Bweremana in neighboring North Kivu province. Congo's military said in a statement Tuesday that the rebels made 'breakthroughs' in Minova and Bweremana. It did not confirm whether M23 captured the towns. M23, or the March 23 Movement, is a militant group composed of ethnic Tutsis who broke away from the Congolese army just over a decade ago. The group rose to prominence in 2012 when its fighters seized Goma, the capital of North Kivu province and eastern Congo's largest city, on the border with Rwanda. M23 is one of about 100 armed groups that have been vying for a foothold in mineral-rich eastern Congo, in a decadeslong conflict that has created one of the world's largest humanitarian crises. More than 7 million people have been displaced. Congo, the United States and United Nations experts accuse neighboring Rwanda of backing M23. Rwanda denies the claim. M23 has been making significant advances in eastern Congo in recent weeks. The rebels captured the key mining town of Masisi in North Kivu earlier this month, another key supply route for Goma. Minova is a strategically important port on the shores of Lake Kivu and a transit point for many agricultural goods heading to Goma, about 45 kilometers away. More than 237,000 people have been displaced by the fighting in eastern Congo since the beginning of this year, the U.N. refugee agency said in a report Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-rebels-in-eastern-dr-congo-seize-town-on-key-supply-route/7945120.html	2025-01-21T11:56:48-08:00	
Trump’s 2nd term: Hopes for economic prosperity amid new challenges	Many American voters are hopeful that President Donald Trump’s second term, which began on Jan. 20, will usher in a period of economic prosperity — much like they felt during his first term. However, the economy he is inheriting this time around is markedly different from the one he inherited eight years ago, pre-pandemic. And he faces new challenges. While former President Joe Biden has defended his handling of the country’s economic recovery — pointing to strong job growth and falling inflation — high prices persist. A large national debt, climate change and some of Trump’s own policy proposals may further complicate efforts to boost the economy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-2nd-term-hopes-for-economic-prosperity-amid-new-challenges/7945076.html	2025-01-21T11:51:04-08:00	
Trump repeat of need to take control of Greenland raises concerns, stirs debate	NUUK, GREENLAND — U.S. President Donald Trump reiterated his assertion Monday that the United States needs to take control of Greenland from Denmark in the interests of 'international security.' His repeated calls in recent weeks are raising concerns and stirring debate among the Arctic island’s 57,000-strong population as well as alarm among the United States’ European allies. 'Greenland is a wonderful place. We need it for international security. And I'm sure that Denmark will come along,' the president said. 'The people of Greenland are not happy with Denmark, as you know. I think they are happy with us. … My son and representatives went up there two weeks ago, and they like us. So, we’ll see what happens,' Trump told reporters in the Oval Office on Monday, hours after his inauguration as the 47th president of the United States. Donald Trump Jr. visited Greenland’s capital, Nuuk, on Jan. 7, where he handed out 'Make America Great Again' baseball caps and had lunch with a group of locals before returning to the U.S. a few hours later. At a press conference in Florida the same day, President-elect Trump said he refused to rule out using economic or military force to take control of Greenland. ‘Not for sale’ Denmark and its European allies have offered a cautious response, emphasising the need to respect international sovereignty while trying not to offend Trump. Greenland already has a high degree of independence, although Denmark retains responsibility for the island’s security affairs. Naaja Nathanielsen, a senior minister in Greenland’s autonomous government, gave a simple response to Trump’s comments. 'We are not a commodity. And we are not for sale,' she told VOA. Nevertheless, Nathanielsen sees common ground with Washington. 'If you cut through the rhetoric, I hear two messages from the U.S.,' she said. 'One is we need to look at the national security aspect, and we quite agree with the U.S. message in that point. We've been trying to advocate for that as well for some years. And the other perspective is, and the other message I hear is, we want to engage more in the Greenlandic mineral sector. And that is really, you know, kicking in an open door.' Political change Greenland is due to hold a general election by April at the latest. The government wants a simultaneous referendum on full independence from Denmark. 'Greenlanders themselves must decide what our future looks like,' Greenlandic Premier Mute Egede said during a live televised debate on Sunday with political leaders from Denmark and Greenland. 'We have said very precisely that Greenland — and us in this country — do not want to be Americans. We don't want to be Danes either. We are Greenlanders,' he said. After centuries of Danish control, the political winds of change in Greenland are getting stronger, according to Arnaq Nielsen, opinion editor at Greenland’s weekly Sermitsiaq newspaper. 'Everything is about the visit of Trump Junior, and when you meet people, it’s all we talk about,' Nielsen told VOA in an interview at the Sermitsiaq newsroom in Nuuk. 'This situation is evolving so quickly. Now it’s about a lot more than the complicated relationship between Denmark and Greenland. Suddenly Trump Junior is here, and it all explodes. It’s hard to figure out what is going on.' 'It’s a small number of people here who are really happy that Trump Junior came to Greenland. And a small number of people really resent him coming here. But the large majority are not that loud because only the two extremes are being heard,' Nielsen said. Social media Those extremes are being amplified by social media. YouTube influencers have followed Trump Junior’s visit to Greenland, handing out American dollar bills to passers-by, along with baseball caps emblazoned with the slogan 'Make Greenland Great Again.' The influencers are not associated with the Trump administration. Several Greenlanders welcomed the unfamiliar visitors. Others have engaged in angry exchanges. A video posted online last week showed an unidentified local resident tearing up a U.S. currency note and stamping on a red Make Greenland Great Again baseball cap. 'Do you think you can buy us?' the man said. Residents of Nuuk who spoke to VOA were divided over the global attention. 'I think we are in a terrible situation,' Nuuk resident Per Chemnitz said. 'Our politicians are handling this totally wrong. They have been seduced by something so much bigger than they are able to handle. So, I don’t know where this will end. The worst thing that can happen is that we lose our relationship to Denmark.' Aka Gronvold, who also lives in the Greenlandic capital, welcomed the Trumps’ intervention. 'Right now, Greenland has the attention of the whole world. That is really good, and it’s about time that Greenland gets some more attention.' Gronvold told VOA. ‘Make Greenland Great Again’ That attention looks set to continue. Republican lawmakers last week introduced a bill titled the Make Greenland Great Again Act, allowing President Trump to start talks with Denmark over purchasing Greenland. It’s not yet clear whether the bill will receive enough support from Congress. Denmark has echoed Greenland’s assertion that the island is not for sale but said it would welcome greater cooperation with Trump in security and mineral extraction. Controlling Greenland comes with a cost, noted analyst Jon Rahbek-Clemmensen of the Royal Danish Defense College. 'If the U.S. went in and were to acquire Greenland, they would suddenly also have to pay the bill for running Greenlandic society — a bill that's being covered by the Danish government right now and which runs along the lines of U.S. $750 million to U.S. $1 billion a year,' Rahbek-Clemmensen said. '[The U.S.] gets all its interests, and it doesn't have to pay the bill. And so, geopolitically speaking, it doesn't really make that much sense to change that situation. So, if I were to explain why Trump has an interest in Greenland… I would say that it probably has to do with the whole ideology of Make America Great Again,' he told VOA. 'In this situation. acquiring Greenland would literally make the U.S. greater — or at least bigger,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-repeat-of-need-to-take-control-of-greenland-raises-concerns-stirs-debate/7944672.html	2025-01-21T11:40:35-08:00

Mexico defends sovereignty as US seeks to label cartels as terrorists	MEXICO CITY — Mexico President Claudia Sheinbaum said Tuesday that President Donald Trump's executive order moving toward designating drug cartels as foreign terrorist organizations would only impact Mexico if there's close coordination between the two governments. She said that Mexico would defend its sovereignty and independence while seeking coordination with the U.S. in the wake of the order signed Monday. 'We all want to fight the drug cartels,' Sheinbaum said at her daily press briefing. The U.S. 'in their territory, us in our territory.' Trump's order highlighted Mexican drug cartels and other Latin American criminal groups like Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua and Salvadoran gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13). The order says they 'threaten the safety of the American people, the security of the United States, and the stability of the international order in the Western Hemisphere.' The order did not list any Mexican cartels by name but said Cabinet secretaries would recommend groups for designation as terrorist organizations in the next 14 days. It was among a slew of executive orders Trump signed Monday to kick off his administration, several of which focus on securing the southern border. 'The Cartels have engaged in a campaign of violence and terror throughout the Western Hemisphere that has not only destabilized countries with significant importance for our national interests but also flooded the United States with deadly drugs, violent criminals, and vicious gangs,' the order reads. It was unclear what the impact could be for fighting the cartels, but there was concern it could be another way to make it more difficult for people from the countries where those groups operate to access the U.S. It came in addition to measures including the declaration of an emergency on the U.S. southern border, a promise to slap 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada on Feb. 1 and ending the use of the CBP One app, which allowed migrants to apply for asylum appointments before reaching the border. Trump has also promised to carry out mass deportations and threatened military intervention in Mexico to fight cartels, something sharply rejected by Sheinbaum. Many have voiced concern the terrorist designation could provide the U.S. justification to take military action against cartels. Vanda Felbab-Brown, an organized crime expert at the Brookings Institution, said the order could have 'huge implications from trade to migrants.' As cartels have gained a firm grip on control of the lucrative migrant smuggling trade in recent years, it's virtually impossible for migrants and asylum seekers to pass through Mexico and other Latin American countries without paying some sort of fee to cartels. The moment they do, Felbab-Brown said, it could disqualify them from seeking asylum. 'Trump can essentially prevent the vast majority of undocumented migrants trying to cross the U.S. border from getting asylum,' she said. Mike Vigil, a former head of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration's foreign operations, said he expected any terrorism designation to have very little impact on day-to-day operations against cartels because many of the same anti-terrorism powers American authorities would be granted are already employ in counter-narcotics efforts. 'It's already been done. This is nothing new,' Vigil said. 'It's all political theater and tossing a piece of stale salami to [Trump's] base.' He said logistically the order would likely allow the U.S. to seize assets of groups in the U.S., sanction U.S. citizens that do business with terrorist organizations and block members of those groups from entering the U.S. 'It's not going to allow the U.S. to send troops into Mexico like so many people think simply because people forget that Mexico is a sovereign country and it would be an act of war,' he said. The move comes as cartel violence has intensified in northern Mexican states after the kidnapping and detention of kingpin Ismael 'El Mayo' Zambada sparked an all-out war between rival factions of the Sinaloa cartel. Gunmen continue to leave mutilated bodies scattered across the state and kidnap people even from hospitals. It's part of a larger shifting dynamic in cartel warfare in the Latin American nation. Years ago, a handful of criminal organizations headed by a few key capos controlled large parts of Mexico. Now, many more factions have violently fought for power, as they've become more agile and harder to pin down. They've used more sophisticated tools like bomb-dropping drones, improvised explosive devices and rigged armored vehicles, and have expanded into migrant trafficking and the avocado trade. Meanwhile, thousands of Mexican citizens have gotten caught in the crossfire, having been slain or gone missing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-defends-sovereignty-as-us-seeks-to-label-cartels-as-terrorists-/7944948.html	2025-01-21T10:17:58-08:00	
Trump's first full day back in White House includes firings, infrastructure announcement	Washington — President Donald Trump is spending his first full day back in the White House meeting with congressional leaders, making an infrastructure announcement and demonstrating one of his favored expressions of power: firing people. The new president posted on his Truth social media platform early Tuesday that he would fire more than 1,000 presidential appointees 'who are not aligned with our vision,' including some high-profile names. Trump fired chef and humanitarian Jose Andres from the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition, retired Gen. Mark Milley from the National Infrastructure Advisory Council, former State Department official Brian Hook from the board of the Wilson Center and former Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms from the President's Export Council. 'YOU'RE FIRED!' Trump said in his post — his catchphrase from his reality TV show, 'The Apprentice.' Former President Joe Biden also removed many Trump appointees in his first days in office, including former press secretary Sean Spicer from the board overseeing the U.S. Naval Academy. Trump planned to continue to build on his barrage of Inauguration Day announcements, with the White House promising a 'massive announcement' on infrastructure. Trump press secretary Karoline Leavitt declined to detail the announcement in advance, but she said in an interview on Fox News that it would send a message to the world. 'You won't want to miss it,' she said. 'Infrastructure week' became a punchline during Trump's first administration as White House officials promised repeatedly — over years — to train a focus on major public works projects, only to have Trump himself quickly shift emphasis elsewhere while major legislation on infrastructure never materialized. It was enough of a pattern that Biden joked about how his predecessor couldn't pull off even a week of focus on infrastructure while his administration oversaw passage of billions of dollars for bridges, tunnels, roads and other projects for the coming 10 years. 'He didn't build a damn thing,' Biden said frequently of Trump, adding that his own administration delivered 'infrastructure decade.' Trump wants to ban Chinese companies from owning vital U.S. infrastructure in sectors such as energy, technology and agriculture, and he says he will force Chinese owners to sell any holdings 'that jeopardize America's national security.' Trump also attended a national prayer service Tuesday morning at Washington National Cathedral, a customary visit for new presidents and one that will wrap up his four days of inauguration-related events. Later in the day, the president was expected to meet with House Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune and other GOP (Republican) legislators. It's the first formal sit-down for the GOP leadership teams including Majority Leader Steve Scalise and Senate GOP Whip John Barrasso and the new president as they chart priorities for using Republican power in Washington. Despite an ambitious 100-day agenda, the Republican-led Congress is not on the same page on some ideas and strategies as they rush to deliver tax cuts for the wealthy, mass deportations and other goals for Trump. Trump used the first hours of his presidency on Monday to sign a series of executive orders and memorandums, moving quickly to show that his new hold on the U.S. government would be a stark change from his predecessor. He pardoned hundreds of people for their roles in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate accords and the World Health Organization, began his immigration crackdown by declaring a national emergency at the U.S.-Mexico border and sought to end automatic citizenship for anyone born in America, which is expected to run into constitutional challenges. He also signed an order that intends to pause a ban on TikTok for 75 days to give its China-based parent company more time to find an approved buyer.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-first-full-day-back-in-white-house-includes-firings-infrastructure-announcement/7944947.html	2025-01-21T10:15:12-08:00	
Trump fires first woman to head a US military service	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump's administration has removed Admiral Linda Fagan — the first woman to lead a U.S. military service — as the head of the Coast Guard. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS), which oversees the Coast Guard, did not immediately respond to a request on Tuesday for comment on Fagan's dismissal. Fox News cited a senior official saying reasons included her failure to address border security threats, excessive focus on diversity, equity and inclusion, and an 'erosion of trust' over the Coast Guard's investigation into sexual assault cases. Trump and other Republicans have long railed against government programs aimed at fostering diversity, and border security is a key priority for the president, who declared a national emergency at the U.S. frontier with Mexico on Monday, the first day of his new term. 'She served a long and illustrious career, and I thank her for her service to our nation,' acting DHS secretary Benjamine Huffman said in a message to the Coast Guard, which is one of the five U.S. military branches. Fagan had led the Coast Guard since 2022, and previously held posts including vice commandant of the service. She 'served on all seven continents, from the snows of Ross Island, Antarctica to the heart of Africa, from Tokyo to Geneva, and in many ports along the way,' according to an archived version of her biography, which is no longer available on the Coast Guard website.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-fires-first-woman-to-head-a-us-military-service-/7944898.html	2025-01-21T09:22:18-08:00	
Over 20 killed in clash between security forces, Islamic State fighters in Somalia	WASHINGTON — Over 20 people were killed and more than 10 others wounded during two days of fighting between Islamic State fighters and security forces from Somalia’s Puntland region, officials said Tuesday. In an interview with VOA’s Somali Service, a spokesperson for Puntland security operations, Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed, said that 15 Islamic State militants and seven Puntland soldiers were killed in the clashes Sunday and Monday. Ahmed said IS fighters used improvised explosive devices to protect their hideouts near the Ufeyn area. As soldiers were clearing landmines, one of the devices exploded, killing six soldiers and wounding three, he said. The spokesperson said that during the operation, soldiers killed eight Islamic State militants. Ahmed said the latest military operation, which centered around the Cal Miskat mountains in the Bari region, continued through Monday. 'On Monday, our soldiers encountered the terrorist fighters around Laba-Afle area, killing seven of them. One of our soldiers was also killed and four others injured,' he said. Residents, who requested anonymity fearing for their lives, told VOA they saw the bodies of militants strewn along the roads leading into the Cal Miskat mountains. Puntland began a military offensive last month against extremist groups in the region following months of preparations. The region’s leader, Said Abdullahi Deni, appealed to the public to support the operation, which he said is aimed at dislodging the Islamic State militants from their hideouts in mountainous areas. Puntland has endured terrorist attacks perpetrated by al-Shabab and Islamic State militants, but the ongoing military operation appears to be focused on IS. The group has a relatively small presence in Somalia compared to the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab, but experts have warned of growing activity. U.S. military officials and Somali security experts reported that IS increased its membership numbers in Somalia last year. The group was previously estimated to have between 100 and 400 fighters, but Somali security and intelligence experts estimate their current numbers to be 500 to 600 militants. Most of the newcomers are said to be from the Middle East and eastern and northern Africa. IS in Somalia was formed in October 2015 by a group of former al-Shabab fighters led by the cleric Sheikh Abdulkadir Mumin, who reportedly pledged allegiance to the late IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Mumin appears to have survived a U.S. airstrike on May 31, 2024. A United Nations counterterrorism official last year warned of increased attacks by Islamic State affiliates in Somalia, Mozambique and the Democratic Republic of Congo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-20-killed-in-clash-between-security-forces-islamic-state-fighters-in-somalia/7944791.html	2025-01-21T08:56:54-08:00

Indonesia seeks to counter global rivalries as full BRICS member, pushes for UN reform	JAKARTA — Indonesia’s admission this month to the BRICS developing-country bloc, started by Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa, marks an expansion of the group to Southeast Asia. Jakarta’s admission, which follows last year’s addition of Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates, was announced January 6 by Brazil, the group’s presiding member. In October, Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam became partner countries – meaning they are interested in becoming BRICS members but have not yet been accepted for full membership. Indonesia is the only Southeast Asian country that has been accepted as a full member. Teuku Rezasyah, a professor of diplomacy and foreign policy at Indonesia’s Universitas Padjajaran, said membership will allow Indonesia to work with other influential countries with substantial populations to reform multilateral organizations such as the United Nations. 'Currently, Russia and China are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. However, BRICS has become a strong foundation for Indonesia to generate support from countries like India, Brazil and South Africa in order to push through reforms of the U.N. Security Council,' he told VOA January 15. Rezasyah said there have not been significant structural changes in the United Nations for 80 years. The Security Council’s five permanent members – China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States – have veto power and they are 'mostly Greco-Roman and Judeo-Christian civilizations,' he said. 'The world’s first and fourth largest country by population which is India and Indonesia, who represent large Hindu and Muslim populations, are not always represented well in the Security Council,' he said. Indonesian Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesman Roy Soemirat pointed to areas in which Jakarta would like to see changes at the U.N. 'Indonesia continues to push for revitalizing the United Nations General Assembly and the Security Council. There need to be changes in the working methods, limited use of veto power, and improve the issue of representation at the Security Council. The Security Council was last expanded from 11 to 15 countries in the 1970s. As more countries join the United Nations, the composition of the Security Council needs to change,' he told VOA January 18. He added that Indonesia has been active in U.N. working groups on U.N. reforms, particularly as a nonpermanent Security Council member from 2019 to 2020. The United Nations unanimously agreed to push for improving regulations on using veto power in 2015. Along with France and Mexico, Indonesia has urged Security Council countries to be more transparent and voluntarily explain their reasons for a veto, Roy added. Aspirations to reform the United Nations Indonesian Foreign Affairs Minister Sugiono, in his annual address January 10, cited a lack of respect for international law and the U.N. Charter, saying the global economic architecture does not meet the modern challenges and needs most countries face. Indonesia was one of the first countries to call for U.N. reforms, in a 1960 speech to the General Assembly by then-President Sukarno. Mohammad Faisal, executive director of the Center of Reform on Economics, a Jakarta research group, said it will 'still be a long way to truly reform the United Nations,' but that 'the growing power of the emerging countries, including those under BRICS, will at least, make it more balanced.' 'So, the voices of the emerging and developing countries can be heard more optimally in the global arena,' he said. Lalu Muhammad Iqbal, a foreign Spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry, was quoted by Antara wire service that he believes that the U.N. Security Council reform is essential because can make decisions that all member states must follow. However, there is no agreement among U.N. member states on a system for change. Some member states propose changing the veto right, while others propose permanent or semipermanent member status. Dinna Prapto Raharja, senior policy advisor at Synergy Policies - a public policy consulting firm - and a tenured Associate Professor in international relations noted developing countries’ various positions on U.N. reform. 'Everybody has their own champion of who should be the new permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, for instance. How the U.N. Security Council veto can be ended and who should get veto power. That’s why I think Indonesia has to come up with an idea for U.N. reform that is really feasible to achieve,' she said. The foreign affairs ministry emphasized the importance of BRICS as a platform for voices of the Global South. 'BRICS is an important platform for Indonesia to strengthen South-South cooperation, ensuring that the voices and aspirations of Global South countries are heard and represented in the global decision-making process. We are fully dedicated to working together with all BRICS members, or with other parties, to create a just, peaceful, and prosperous world.' the ministry said in a January 7 press statement. There are also concerns among members of the House of Representatives, Indonesia’s unicameral national legislature, and international relations analysts, that by joining BRICS, Indonesia is drawing closer to Russia and China while distancing itself from Western powers such as the United States and the European Union. Vinsensio Dugis, head of the ASEAN Studies Research Center at Universitas Airlangga in Indonesia, said he is concerned that Western countries consider BRICS to be a forum led by China and Russia to oppose Western political and economic interests, which could cause Western countries to withhold future investment in Indonesia. Combined, BRICS has a population of 3.5 billion people or 45% of the global population. Not including Indonesia, the economies of BRICS countries account for around 28% of the global economy. It is often perceived as challenging the political and economic dominance of rich and powerful countries in North America and western Europe. Apart from reforming the United Nations, Indonesia said it is ready to send more peacekeeping forces to Gaza. Soemirat, speaking before a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas took effect Sunday, called the prolonged conflict in Gaza 'an example of the U.N. Security Council’s failure to quickly fulfil its mandate to maintain international peace and security based on the U.N. Charter.' Sugiono, in a January 16 posting on X, expressed hope that the ceasefire agreement that had been reached could be 'a momentum to push for peace in Palestine.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-seeks-to-counter-global-rivalries-as-full-brics-member-pushes-for-un-reform/7944625.html	2025-01-21T06:28:25-08:00	
China seeks more cooperation with US as Trump takes office	Taipei, Taiwan — China has urged the United States to focus on managing bilateral relationships through cooperation instead of confrontation as U.S. President Donald Trump kicks off his second term in office. 'China is willing to work with the new U.S. government to maintain communication, strengthen cooperation, properly manage differences, and push China-U.S. relations to make greater progress from a new starting point,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during the regular press conference on Tuesday in Beijing. Analysts say Beijing hopes to reduce misunderstandings between both sides through engagement and exchanges in the early stage of the second Trump presidency. 'The Chinese government hopes China and the U.S. could understand each other’s needs through communication,' said Shen Dingli, a Shanghai-based international relations scholar. 'Beijing believes China and the U.S. can still reach a consensus and avoid many misunderstandings that have arisen during the first Trump presidency' if both sides prioritize efforts to stabilize bilateral relations, he told VOA by phone. Ahead of Trump’s inauguration on Monday, China and Trump’s team conducted several top-level exchanges, including a call between the new U.S. president and Chinese President Xi Jinping last Friday. Trump said he and Xi would 'solve many problems together' while the Chinese president said the key to handling bilateral relations was to 'respect each other's core interests and major concerns and to find a proper solution to the problem.' On Sunday, China’s Vice President Han Zheng, who was in Washington, D.C., to attend Trump’s inauguration ceremony, met with his American counterpart JD Vance, and a group of American business leaders, including Tesla founder Elon Musk. He said China and the U.S. could 'contribute to each other's progress, bring benefits to the two countries, and make important contributions to world peace and development' as long as they 'uphold the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation.' Additionally, Han urged U.S. businesses to 'play an active role as a bridge and make greater contribution to the development of China-U.S. relations' by continuing to 'invest and take root in China.' Experts say Beijing wants to seize the opportunity to improve bilateral relations with Washington through these initial engagements with the Trump administration. Beijing 'would not only prefer to avoid increased sanctions but also the potential for greater limitations on tech exports to China,' said Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western Kentucky University. While the Chinese government has expressed willingness to cooperate with the Trump administration, the U.S. president has also held off the imposition of tariffs on imported goods from China, Mexico, and Canada. Instead, he released a broad trade memo that urged the United States Trade Representative to assess China’s compliance with the 'Phase 1' trade deal that his administration signed with Beijing in 2020, which required Beijing to increase purchases of U.S. exports by $200 billion over two years. Additionally, Trump signed an executive order that would delay the ban on the popular social media app TikTok for 75 days but threatened to impose tariffs on Chinese products if Beijing didn’t approve a potential deal with TikTok. 'And if we said, well, ‘You’re not going to approve it’, then that’s a certain hostility, and we’ll put tariffs of 25, 30,40, 50%, even 100%,' Trump said on Monday, after signing the executive order for TikTok. Rich said Trump’s decision to delay imposing tariffs on Chinese products shows the U.S. president’s desire to 'pressure China to make some concessions' that he can declare as a victory. 'I suspect the talk of sticking it to China will return in the absence of some face-saving concession or if other policies start to falter, as a perceived tough-on-China stance taps into the broader concern among many Americans,' he told VOA in a written response. Some Chinese merchants said Trump’s decision to delay the imposition of tariffs on Chinese products allows them to be better prepared for similar scenarios in the future. 'I am finding other ways to export products to my American customers by shifting operations to Southeast Asia,' a Chinese apparel exporter surnamed Yuan in Shanghai, who asked to be identified only by his last name due to security concerns, told VOA in a written response. While Trump’s incoming cabinet includes several politicians known for their hawkish stance on China, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, analysts say it’s unclear how the Trump administration’s China policies will shape up. 'The ultimate decision-maker is Trump, and if China gives Trump what he thinks he needs, those hawkish people and their beliefs will quickly be sidelined and they may not have influence on U.S.-China policy,' Dexter Roberts, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council's Global China Hub, told VOA by phone. Despite the lack of clarity on the Trump administration’s China policies, Shen in Shanghai said official comments from Beijing and Washington suggest their initial exchanges have been 'quite positive.' 'This might mean there would be less misunderstandings and I think both sides won’t waste this new opportunity to engage with each other,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-seeks-more-cooperation-with-us-as-trump-takes-office/7944615.html	2025-01-21T06:12:10-08:00

Quad foreign ministers meet in Washington in signal of Trump's China focus	Washington — U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio will hit the ground running on Tuesday, hosting a meeting in Washington of his counterparts from Australia, India and Japan one day after President Donald Trump started his second term in office. The meeting of the so-called 'Quad,' four countries sharing concerns about China's growing power, will happen at the State Department and is designed to signal that countering Beijing is a top priority for the new president. It could also set the stage for the leaders of the Quad countries to hold a summit relatively early in the Trump presidency, a person involved in the planning meetings said. Trump officials were working on scheduling another gathering of the foreign ministers at the White House as well, a person involved in planning meetings said. Australian Foreign Minister Penny Wong, who met her Indian and Japanese counterparts in Washington over the weekend, said the invitation for Quad foreign ministers to attend Trump's inauguration showed a dedication to close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region. 'It's a demonstration of the collective commitment of all countries to the Quad, an iron-clad commitment in this time where close cooperation in the Indo-Pacific is so important,' Wong said on Sunday of the foreign ministers' invitation to Washington. Aside from the meeting itself, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, who was confirmed on Monday as Trump's top diplomat, is expected to meet separately with the three foreign ministers on Tuesday. The Quad grouping met many times during the administration of former President Joe Biden, with a focus on Beijing's military and economic activities in the Indo-Pacific, particularly in the South China Sea where U.S. allies have pushed back against Beijing's territorial claims. The grouping has also pledged to advance cooperation in cybersecurity to protect supply chains and critical infrastructure, including undersea cables. For Australia, it will be important to secure an assurance from Washington about the massive AUKUS defense project, designed to allow Australia to acquire nuclear-powered attack submarines and other advanced weapons such as hypersonic missiles. China has denounced the Quad as a Cold War construct and says the AUKUS alliance would intensify a regional arms race.	https://www.voanews.com/a/quad-foreign-ministers-meet-in-washington-in-signal-of-trump-s-china-focus-/7944516.html	2025-01-21T04:51:16-08:00	
Russia's Putin discusses 'multipolar global order' with China's Xi hours after Trump inauguration	Moscow — Russian President Vladimir Putin had a call Tuesday with Chinese President Xi Jinping, emphasizing the two countries' close ties, a day after Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th U.S. president. The two leaders have developed strong personal links that helped bring relations between Moscow and Beijing, growing even closer after Putin sent troops into Ukraine in 2022. China has become a major customer of Russian oil and gas and a source of key technologies amid sweeping Western sanctions on Moscow. In Tuesday's call with Xi, Putin emphasized that Russia-China relations are based on shared interests, equality and mutual benefits, noting that they 'don't depend on internal political factors and the current international environment.' 'We jointly support the development of a more just multipolar global order and work to ensure indivisible security in Eurasia and the world as a whole,' Putin told Xi in remarks carried by the Russian state TV. 'Joint efforts by Russia and China play an important stabilizing role in global affairs.' Xi similarly praised close cooperation between Moscow and Beijing, saying it helps 'bring positive energy to reforming and developing the global system.' While neither leader directly mentioned Trump in the televised fragment of their call, the timing of the conversation may signal that Putin and Xi want to coordinate their action in dialogue with the new U.S. administration. The Chinese president had a call with Trump on Friday and expressed hope for positive ties with the U.S. Trump had threatened to impose tariffs and other measures against China in his second term, while also hinting at ways in which the two rival powers could cooperate on issues such as regional conflicts and curbing the export of substances used in the production of fentanyl. Putin, who is yet to talk to Trump, congratulated him on taking office in televised remarks during a video call with officials and welcomed his intention to open a dialogue with Moscow. Trump told reporters Monday after taking office that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy had told him he wanted to make a peace deal and voiced hope that Putin would follow suit. He added that Putin would be destroying Russia by failing to make a deal, pointing out Russia's economic troubles, including high inflation. Putin hailed Trump's openness to dialogue as he spoke to Russia's Security Council members shortly before the U.S. president's inauguration. 'We hear the statements from Trump and members of his team about their desire to restore direct contact with Russia, which were halted through no fault of ours by the outgoing administration,' Putin said on Monday. 'We also hear his statements about the need to do everything to prevent World War III. We certainly welcome such an approach and congratulate the U.S. president-elect on taking office.' The Russian leader also stressed that dialogue between the two nations should be based on 'equal basis and mutual respect, taking into account the important role our countries play on some key issues on the global agenda, including the strengthening of global stability and security.' Putin also noted that Moscow is open to dialogue with the Trump administration on the conflict in Ukraine, emphasizing the need to respect Russia's interests and adding that 'the most important thing is to remove the root causes of the crisis.' 'As for the settlement of the situation, I would like to underline that its goal should not be a short truce, not some kind of respite for regrouping forces and rearmament with the aim of subsequently continuing the conflict, but a long-term peace based on respect for the legitimate interests of all people, all nations living in this region,' Putin said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-putin-discusses-multipolar-global-order-with-china-s-xi-hours-after-trump-inauguration-/7944498.html	2025-01-21T04:36:25-08:00	
Next release of Gaza hostages set for Saturday, Hamas says	Hamas says it will release another round of hostages on Saturday, as a ceasefire with Israel held into a third day and U.N. humanitarian agencies moved aid into Gaza to help Palestinian civilians. A Hamas official told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday that the next group of hostages would be four Israeli women, who would be set free in exchange for a number of Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. With the ceasefire holding Tuesday, but more than five weeks remaining before a second phase would begin, questions remained about how quickly and successfully Israel and Hamas will negotiate the terms of the next phase. U.S. President Donald Trump, who took office Monday after officials from his team and former president Joe Biden’s administration pushed to achieve a ceasefire before the change in power, expressed some doubts about the truce. 'I’m not confident,' Trump told reporters Monday. 'That’s not our war. It’s their war.' Trump said his administration 'might' help with reconstruction efforts in Gaza and compared the territory to a 'massive demolition site.' Fifteen months of war has devastated the Gaza Strip, destroying many of the homes that Palestinians who fled in search of safety hoped to return to with the halt in fighting. The ceasefire has so far included the return of three hostages who had been held in Gaza as well as 90 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 915 aid trucks entered Gaza on Monday. The current conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas, a U.S.-designated terror group, attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostage. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 47,000, with most of them women and children, according to the health ministry in Gaza. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/next-release-of-gaza-hostages-set-for-saturday-hamas-says-/7944490.html	2025-01-21T04:13:54-08:00	
Taliban free 2 Americans in prisoner swap with US	Islamabad — Taliban authorities in Afghanistan announced Tuesday the release of two American nationals as part of a prisoner exchange for one of their members, who was held in the United States on narcotics-terrorism charges. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kabul identified the freed Afghan as Khan Mohammad and described him as a 'mujahid,' a term the Taliban use for their fighters. The statement said that the man was arrested nearly two decades ago in the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar and subsequently extradited to the U.S., where a federal court convicted him, resulting in his imprisonment for life in California. The de facto Afghan government did not name the two freed American citizens or specify how many had been freed, but relatives and U.S. media reports identified them as Ryan Corbett, 42, and William Wallace McKenty, 69. 'Today, our hearts are filled with overwhelming gratitude and praise to God for sustaining Ryan’s life and bringing him back home after what has been the most challenging and uncertain 894 days of our lives,' his family stated Tuesday. Limited public information is available about McKenty as his family reportedly requested U.S. authorities to maintain his anonymity. The prisoner exchange was in the making for many months and reportedly occurred during Democratic President Joe Biden’s final hours in office before Republican President Donald Trump was inaugurated on Monday. Corbett's family statement praised both the Trump and Biden administrations for their efforts to facilitate the prisoner exchange. The Taliban said Tuesday that Qatar played an 'effective role' in facilitating their prisoner swap agreement with the United States. U.S. officials and relatives have reported that two other American captives, George Glezmann, a former airline mechanic, and Mahmood Habibi, a naturalized American, remain in Taliban custody in Afghanistan. Habibi and Glezmann were apprehended shortly after a U.S. drone strike in July 2022 killed fugitive al-Qaida leader Ayman al-Zawahri in his hideout in an affluent Afghan capital neighborhood. Glezmann, 65, was lawfully visiting Kabul as a tourist when he was seized by the Taliban’s intelligence services without charge, his relatives said. Habibi’s family says he was arrested by the Taliban, along with 30 other employees of the company he worked at, following the U.S. drone strike. While his co-workers were released, Habibi’s whereabouts remain unknown, and Taliban officials have refuted claims that he is in their custody. 'It was our hope that Ryan, George, and Mahmoud would be returned to their families together, and we cannot imagine the pain that our good fortune will bring them,' Corbett’s family stated Tuesday. Habibi's relatives welcomed the reunion of Corbett and McKenty with their families, confident the Trump administration will intensify efforts to secure his freedom from his 'wrongful' detention. 'We have reason to be confident Mahmood is alive and in Taliban custody, despite their hollow denials of holding him,' his brother Ahmad Habibi stated, Global Reach, a nonprofit working with the family of Mahmood Habibi since his arrest, shared the family statement with VOA via email. 'While we are happy for Ryan and William, we are disappointed that Mahmood was not included in the deal,' said the organization's CEO Mickey Bergman.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-free-2-americans-in-prisoner-swap-with-us-/7944480.html	2025-01-21T03:58:19-08:00	
Biden leaves office and Washington after 50 years but says 'we're not leaving the fight'	WASHINGTON — Joe Biden on Monday wrapped up a more than 50-year political career, but promised that 'we're not leaving the fight,' as he bid farewell to the presidency and flew to California to unwind with his family and ease back into private life. Biden spoke not long after watching his successor, Republican President Donald Trump, pledge during his inaugural address to 'completely and totally reverse' everything that his Democratic predecessor did. In the final hours before the noontime transfer of executive power, Biden extended courtesies to the man he had turned out of the Oval Office four years ago. Trump denied losing the 2020 election and refused to offer similar niceties to Biden upon his inauguration in 2021. The bitter cold day opened with Biden and his wife, Jill, receiving Trump, and his wife, Melania, for a traditional Inauguration Day meet-and-greet over tea at the White House. 'Welcome home,' Biden told Trump. Afterward, the rivals, who share a history of political animosity, rode in a limousine to the Capitol where Trump was sworn in as the 47th president. 'Our recent election is a mandate to completely and totally reverse a horrible betrayal,' Trump said about the work of the Biden administration. Biden sat expressionless in the front row. As Trump gave his address, the residence staff at the White House got to work clearing out the remainder of Biden's belongings so they could move Trump and his family back in. The work of turning over the White House includes redecorating the Oval Office. Walls in the press offices that were bare in the morning after most of the staff had ended their government service were decorated by midafternoon with fresh photographs of Trump. After Trump's address, the new president and his wife walked the Bidens outside to a Marine helicopter that had been waiting on the Capitol grounds to fly them to Joint Base Andrews for a farewell event with his staff. 'We couldn't have done anything we did without you,' Biden told those who worked for his administration in the White House. 'No president gets to choose the moment they enter history, but they get to choose the team they enter history with, and we chose the best damn team in the world.' Even though they may feel 'knocked down' by the turn of events, he said what was important was how quickly they get back up. 'We're leaving office. We're not leaving the fight,' Biden said, urging them to stay engaged. And he appeared to joke about Trump's speech, chuckling as he said, 'we heard the inaugural address today. We got a lot more to do.' Biden then made the sign of the cross and everyone laughed. He and the first lady then walked across the tarmac to the familiar blue-and-white Air Force plane he flew on as president for the flight to Santa Ynez, California.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-leaves-office-and-washington-after-50-years-but-says-we-re-not-leaving-the-fight-/7944438.html	2025-01-21T02:37:02-08:00	
China's population falls for a third straight year, posing challenges	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China's population fell last year for the third straight year, its government said Friday, pointing to further demographic challenges for the world's second most populous nation, which is now facing both an aging population and an emerging shortage of working age people. China's population stood at 1.408 billion at the end of 2024, a decline of 1.39 million from the previous year. The figures announced by the government in Beijing follow trends worldwide, but especially in East Asia, where Japan, South Korea and other nations have seen their birth rates plummet. China three years ago joined Japan and most of Eastern Europe among other nations whose population is falling. The reasons are in many cases similar: Rising costs of living are causing young people to put off or rule out marriage and childbirth while pursuing higher education and careers. While people are living longer, that's not enough to keep up with rate of new births. Countries such as China that allow very little immigration are especially at risk. China has long been among the world’s most populous nations, enduring invasions, floods and other natural disasters to sustain a population that thrived on rice in the south and wheat in the north. Following the end of World War II and the Communist Party’s rise to power in 1949, large families reemerged and the population doubled in just three decades, even after tens of millions died in the Great Leap Forward that sought to revolutionize agriculture and industry and the Cultural Revolution that followed a few years later. After the end of the Cultural Revolution and leader Mao Zedong's death, Communist bureaucrats began to worry the country’s population was outstripping its ability to feed itself and began implementing a draconian 'one child policy.' Though it was never law, women had to apply for permission to have a child and violators could face forced late-term abortions and birth control procedures, massive fines and the prospect of their child being deprived an identification number, effectively making them non-citizens. Rural China, where the preference for male offspring was especially strong and two children were still ostensibly allowed, became the focus of government efforts, with women forced to present evidence they were menstruating and buildings emblazoned with slogans such as 'have fewer children, have better children.' The government sought to stamp out selective abortion of female children, but with abortions legal and readily available, those operating illicit sonogram machines enjoyed a thriving business. That has been the biggest factor in China’s lopsided sex ratio, with as many as millions more boys born, raising the possibility of social instability among China’s army of bachelors. Friday’s report gave the sex imbalance as 104.34 men to every 100 women, though independent groups give the imbalance as considerably higher. More disturbing for the government was the drastically falling birthrate, with China’s total population dropping for the first time in decades in 2022 and China being narrowly overtaken by India as the world’s most populous nation the following year. A rapidly aging population, declining workforce, lack of consumer markets and migration abroad are putting the system under severe pressure. While spending on the military and flashy infrastructure projects continues to rise, China’s already frail social security system is teetering, with increasing numbers of Chinese refusing to pay into the underfunded pension system. Already, more than one-fifth of the population is aged 60 or over, with the official figure given as 310.3 million or 22% of the total population. By 2035, this number is forecast to exceed 30%, sparking discussion of changes to the official retirement age, which is one of the lowest in the world. With fewer students, some vacant schools and kindergartens are meanwhile being transformed into care facilities for older people. Such developments are giving some credence to the aphorism that China, now the world’s second largest economy but facing major headwinds, will 'grow old before it grows rich.' Government inducements, including cash payouts for having up to three children and financial help with housing costs, have had only temporary effects. Meanwhile, China continued its transition to an urban society, with 10 million more people moving to cities for an urbanization rate of 67%, up almost a percentage point from the previous year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-population-falls-for-a-third-straight-year-posing-challenges/7944431.html	2025-01-21T02:16:49-08:00	
Firefighters brace for ‘dangerous’ windy, dry conditions in southern California	Fire authorities in southern California positioned crews and equipment ready to respond Tuesday to new wildfires as forecasters warned of dangerous fire conditions featuring dry air and strong winds. The National Weather Service said the particular window of concern was through late morning Tuesday, with the possibility of wind gusts reaching 160 kilometers per hour in areas to the north and northwest of downtown Los Angeles. 'Everyone needs to be on high alert,' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Monday. California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) spokesperson Brice Bennett said in a statement Monday that his agency — with help from federal, local and tribal firefighting agencies — have more than 2,500 people and has prepositioned equipment for quick deployment to combat any new outbreaks. At least 27 people have died in a series of wildfires across the Los Angeles area during the past two weeks as Santa Ana winds mixed with dry conditions on the ground to quickly spread blazes. The two largest fires are still burning, including the Palisades Fire near the coast on the western side of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in the foothills to the north of the city. The Palisades Fire was 61% contained and has burned about 96 square kilometers, according to Cal Fire. The Eaton Fire was 87% contained after burning 57 square kilometers. Together, the fires have destroyed 14,000 structures since Jan. 7. California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Monday designed to protect Southern California residents from landslides and flooding. The order suspends some rules and regulations and speeds up the removal of debris that, if not removed promptly, could result in landslides, mudslides and flash floods. 'This order helps keep our emergency response focused on protecting communities, not permits and paperwork,' Newsom said.

Fire at ski resort in Turkey leaves 10 dead, 32 hurt	ANKARA, Turkey — A fire at a ski resort hotel overnight killed at least 10 people and injured 32 others in northwestern Turkey, authorities said on Tuesday, as TV footage showed crews fighting flames and smoke that engulfed the 11-story building. The blaze began on the restaurant floor of the hotel at Bolu's Kartalkaya ski resort at around 3:30 a.m. local time, Bolu Governor Abdulaziz Aydin told state broadcaster TRT. He said there were 234 guests at the Grand Kartal Hotel, which has a broad wooden exterior. The fire comes at the beginning of a nationwide two-week school holiday, a time when skiers from nearby Istanbul and Ankara usually head to the Bolu mountains. TV footage showed several fire engines surrounding the charred hotel at the base of the ski slopes, with white bed sheets tied together and dangling from one upper-floor window. The death toll had risen to 10, with 32 injured, from an earlier lower count, Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said on X, adding more than 250 first responders attended to the incident. Investigators were looking into what caused the blaze, authorities said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fire-at-ski-resort-in-turkey-leaves-10-dead-32-hurt/7944410.html	2025-01-21T01:10:14-08:00	
Ukrainian officials say Russian drones damaged residential buildings	Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that Russian drone attacks damaged residential buildings in several parts of central and southern Ukraine. The attacks were part of an assault that Ukraine’s military said involved 131 Russian drones and four ballistic missiles. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 72 of the drones, the air force said. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysask said on Telegram that Russian attacks damaged houses and a warehouse, injuring one person. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets reported Tuesday that falling drone fragments damaged four residential buildings, a school, a shop and a power line. Poltava Governor Filip Pronin said on Telegram that a drone fell on a house in his region, sparking a fire, while pieces of destroyed drones damaged six residential buildings. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it destroyed 55 Ukrainian aerial drones, mostly in regions along the Russia-Ukraine border. Russian air defenses knocked down 22 of the drones over Bryansk, 12 drones over Rostov and 10 over the Smolensk region, the ministry said. Other intercepts took place over Voronezh, Saratov and Kursk. Smolensk Govenror Vasily Anokhin said on Telegram that drone debris damaged several residential buildings, while Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a drone attack on a car injured two people.

Tens of thousands defy frigid weather for Trump’s inauguration	It’s been a long day in Washington, filled with tradition and some out-of-the-ordinary events as the United States swears in its 47th president. VOA’s Senior Washington Correspondent Carolyn Presutti brings us the sights and sounds from Inauguration Day 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-defy-frigid-weather-for-trump-s-inauguration-/7944389.html	2025-01-21T00:26:45-08:00	
Trump orders include withdrawing from WHO, halting US foreign aid	U.S. President Donald Trump issued a series of executive actions after taking office Monday, including moving to withdrawal from international health and climate bodies and directing a suspension of U.S. foreign aid. A set of orders focused on immigration, such as declaring an emergency on the U.S.-Mexico border, ending asylum and halting birthright citizenship for some children born in the United States. Trump also ordered vetting and screening 'to the maximum degree possible' all those who want to enter the United States, and for the government to identify countries that may have screening procedures deficient enough to warrant blocking their nationals from entering the United States. In his first term in office, Trump pursued an 'America First' form of foreign policy, and an order he signed Monday directs new Secretary of State Marco Rubio to focus State Department efforts on that mission. 'From this day forward, the foreign policy of the United States shall champion core American interests and always put America and American citizens first,' the order said. Trump ordered the United States to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate accord, a repeat of a move he also made in his first term. Trump said the U.S. has a successful record of 'advancing both economic and environmental objectives' that should be a model to other countries. Nearly 200 countries signed the agreement aimed at limiting global warming with each country providing its own plan for limiting greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. In another repeat from his first time in office, Trump ordered the United States to withdraw from the World Health Organization due to complaints that the agency mismanaged the COVID-19 pandemic and gets too much funding from the U.S. Calling U.S. foreign aid 'not aligned with American interests,' Trump issued an order to pause foreign development assistance for 90 days and for the programs to undergo reviews. Funding for many programs has already been appropriated by Congress, so it was not clear how much aid would be initially affected by the order. Trump also reversed an order signed by former President Joe Biden last week that had removed Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terror. Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel responded to Trump’s move Monday by calling it 'an act of arrogance and disregard for the truth.' On trade, Trump issued an order calling for a review of a number of trade agreements, including one with China and the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement. He also specifically called for an assessment of 'unlawful migration and fentanyl flows' from Canada, Mexico and China. Ahead of taking office, Trump said those countries would need to act on those areas in order to avoid tariffs on goods sent to the United States. In response to a law passed during Biden’s term that would have blocked TikTok in the United States in connection with national security concerns, Trump signed an order telling the Justice Department not to enforce that ban until his administration can 'determine the appropriate course forward.' The law directed a TikTok ban unless its China-based parent company sold it to an approved buyer. U.S. officials promoting the ban expressed concerns that the Chinese government could obtain Americans’ digital data. Trump himself tried to carry out a similar ban during his first term, but in recent weeks has championed keeping TikTok available to U.S. users, including the potential for the U.S. government to acquire a stake in the company.

Trump supporters celebrate pardon of Jan. 6 rioters	WASHINGTON — The atmosphere was celebratory outside the Central Detention Facility prison in Washington late Monday night. Just hours after taking the oath of office, U.S. President Donald Trump pardoned about 1,500 people who participated in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, during which Trump supporters tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Many of them were held in the Central Detention Facility in southeast Washington. Despite the frigid cold, their supporters gathered outside the building, looking forward to what they told VOA they hoped would be their speedy release. As of publication, that release had not happened yet. The police presence outside the prison was substantial throughout the night. So, too, was the media presence. And even though supporters at one point briefly rushed the prison entrance, only to be blocked by police, they still told VOA that the gathering was joyous and patriotic. While brandishing an American flag, Ben Pollock told VOA that two of his children — Olivia and Jonathan — were jailed for taking part in the attack. He said he himself was present that day, too, but that he didn’t enter the Capitol Building. Pollock, from Florida, said he was 'ecstatic, praising God' that his children would be released soon. 'It’s been such a spiritual journey.' Former fugitives Olivia and Jonathan Pollock are charged with assaulting, resisting or impeding certain officers, as well as theft of government property, according to media reports. The latter is accused of grabbing an officer by the waist and pulling the officer down a set of stairs, and punching another officer in the face. Their father cried as he talked about Jan. 6 — not because he regretted that day, which he didn’t, but because he said he felt so deeply that those who were jailed for participating in the attack had been unfairly prosecuted. 'It’s broken my heart for four years. I’ve cried and cried and cried over these families,' Pollock said. 'Today is their day of freedom.' Pollock and others who spoke with VOA said they felt like Trump’s executive order meant that they were finally getting vindication for Jan. 6. For them, Trump’s pardon confirmed their belief that the 2020 election was rigged, they told VOA. It also represented the fulfillment of a promise that Trump had made during his campaign to absolve those who took part in the attack, they said. Numerous reports and investigations have shown that the 2020 election was not stolen. Election officials have confirmed the election was secure, and Trump and his allies have failed to produce any evidence to substantiate the allegations of fraud. Despite the evidence that the election was not stolen, several people outside the prison told VOA that Trump’s pardon reinforced their belief that it actually had been. 'The election was stolen. We all see it. The whole world saw it,' Stephanie Liu, from New York told VOA. Liu, who was present at the Capitol on Jan. 6, said she has come to the prison every month for the past two-and-a-half years to visit the imprisoned Jan. 6 rioters. 'Political prisoners should not exist in this country,' said Liu, who is originally from China. Helena Gibson, from the U.S. capital, made a similar point: 'This has been four long years of these Jan. 6 political hostages.' That language echoes Trump, who calls those who stormed the Capitol 'hostages' and 'unbelievable patriots.' One day after the attack, Trump said that 'those who broke the law' during the riot would 'pay.' But defending them ended up becoming a significant component of his 2024 presidential campaign. Tom Jeffries, from Virginia, said he was 'somewhat disappointed' that Trump didn’t mention the Jan. 6 defendants during his inaugural address. 'But knowing him, I knew that he hadn’t forgotten about it. He was waiting for the right time to do it,' Jeffries told VOA. 'That was my hope, and God granted my wish.' Trump’s decision to pardon those who took part in the attack was met with swift condemnation from Democrat lawmakers like Senator Chris Murphy. By pardoning the rioters, 'Trump has transformed American democracy,' Murphy said in a post on X. 'Political violence is now mainstream.' Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer also said those who invaded the Capitol should not have been pardoned. 'Trump is ushering in a Golden Age for people that break the law and attempt to overthrow the government,' Schumer said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-supporters-celebrate-pardon-of-jan-6-rioters-/7944388.html	2025-01-20T23:41:56-08:00	
Starry Sundance fest moves ahead in wake of LA fires	Los Angeles — The U.S. film industry's first big gathering since fires devastated Los Angeles will begin Thursday at the Sundance festival, where highlights include a glitzy new Jennifer Lopez musical and a dark Benedict Cumberbatch drama. Hollywood's annual pilgrimage to the Rocky Mountains to premiere the coming year's most-anticipated indie films is taking place in somber circumstances, after the blazes that killed at least 27 people and brought the entertainment capital to a halt. Festival chiefs held lengthy talks with filmmakers, including those 'who lost homes or were displaced' by the blazes, before deciding to press ahead, said Sundance director Eugene Hernandez. Organizers heard 'harrowing stories of people running out of their homes, evacuating... with their hard drives under their arms' to ensure their films survived, he told AFP. 'Everybody to a person just wants to look forward and wants to look ahead... it'll be a nice moment of reunion and community.' Among the 88 features being screened in Utah's Park City is 'Rebuilding,' about a rancher who loses everything in a wildfire. 'It takes on an added poignance, for those who will watch it next week,' said Hernandez. Josh O'Connor, known for 'The Crown' and 'Challengers,' plays the lead role. 'It's an incredible film, and one that we felt was important to show, based on that spirit of resilience,' said Sundance programming director Kim Yutani. 'I think it will be a particularly moving one for people to see.' J-Lo, Cumberbatch A-lister Lopez brings her first film to Sundance, with 'Kiss of the Spider Woman.' From 'Dreamgirls' director Bill Condon, the film is based on the Broadway adaptation of Argentine author Manuel Puig's famous novel. Lopez plays Aurora, a silver-screen diva whose life and roles are discussed by two mismatched prisoners as they form an unlikely bond in their grim cell. While harking back to grand Golden Age Hollywood musicals with its fabulous costumes and Lopez's 'knockout musical performance,' the film is a more dramatic and independent take on the genre, said Hernandez. Cumberbatch stars in another literary adaptation, 'The Thing With Feathers,' based on Max Porter's experimental and poetic novel about a grieving husband and two young sons. 'It's one of these juicy roles that big actors relish taking a bite out of,' said Yutani. Family tragedy and fatherhood are also the themes of 'Omaha,' with John Magaro ('Past Lives') delivering 'an emotional gut punch of a role' that could spell awards, according to Yutani. Elsewhere, Olivia Colman plays a mother taking her non-binary teen to visit their gay grandfather (John Lithgow) in 'Jimpa.' Rapper A$AP Rocky and late-night host Conan O'Brien make up the eclectic cast of mystery 'If I Had Legs I'd Kick You.' And 'The Bear' star Ayo Edebiri teams up with John Malkovich for thriller 'Opus,' about a young writer investigating the mysterious disappearance of a legendary pop star. Music, politics Music is also a prominent theme of Sundance's documentary selection, which has launched several of the most recent Oscar-winning non-fiction films. A new 'must-see' Jeff Buckley documentary features never-before-seen footage from 'three very important women in his life, including his mother,' said Yutani. Elegance Bratton explores the Chicago roots of house music with 'Move Ya Body: The Birth of House,' while Oscar-winning director Questlove examines funk pioneer Sly Stone in 'Sly Lives! (aka The Burden of Black Genius).' Politics will again be prominent. Former New Zealand leader Jacinda Ardern is expected in town to promote behind-the-scenes documentary 'Prime Minister.' 'The Jinx' director Andrew Jarecki explores violence and corruption in the U.S. prison system with 'The Alabama Solution.' And, days after the Gaza ceasefire agreement took effect, Palestinian-American director Cherien Dabis will unveil her 'groundbreaking' new film 'All That's Left of You,' which has been given a highly prominent Saturday evening premiere at Sundance's biggest venue. 'That is not an accident. This is a really special one,' said Yutani. 'I have not seen a film about a Palestinian family told in quite this way.' The 2025 Sundance Film Festival runs from Jan. 23 through Feb. 2.	https://www.voanews.com/a/starry-sundance-fest-moves-ahead-in-wake-of-la-fires-/7944385.html	2025-01-20T23:28:54-08:00	
China, EU, Ukraine leaders take Davos stage under Trump shadow	Davos, Switzerland — With Donald Trump back as US president with his confrontational style, Chinese, European and Ukrainian leaders are expected to defend global cooperation on Tuesday at the annual gathering of the world's elites in Davos. There will no doubt be a Trump-sized elephant in the rooms at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in the Swiss Alpine resort. even if some leaders avoid saying his name -- although the man will speak himself by video link on Thursday. Trump returned to the White House on Monday, bringing with him a more protectionist administration and fears he will deliver on promises to slap heavy tariffs on China and U.S. allies including Canada and the European Union. In his inaugural address, he vowed Washington will 'tariff and tax foreign countries.' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen will kick the day off. She appeared, in a post on X as she arrived in Davos, to give a taste of what to expect, defending the 'need to work together to avoid a global race to the bottom' and wanting to 'forge new partnerships.' China, Ukraine China's Vice Premier Ding Xuexiang -- also a member of the Chinese Communist Party's apex of power that rules the country -- will speak immediately after von der Leyen. China is taking a cautious approach to Trump. After Chinese President Xi Jinping's conversation with Trump by phone on Friday, he said he hoped for a 'good start' to relations with the new administration. Although Trump said he would undertake sweeping trade penalties against China, he has also indicated he wants to improve ties -- and even stepped in to reverse a U.S. ban of Chinese-owned social media platform TikTok on national security grounds. Ukraine meanwhile is keeping a very close eye on what Trump's second mandate will involve. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected to call on world leaders and company executives to maintain -- and even ramp up -- their support for his country's fight against Russia. Zelenskyy on Monday said he is hopeful Trump will help achieve a 'just peace.' European 'struggle' Europeans are set to dominate the forum’s key speeches here on Tuesday. Embattled German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will address the forum, likely his last as leader ahead of elections next month. Also speaking on Tuesday will be conservative leader Friedrich Merz, the favorite to succeed him as German chancellor. Europeans are fretting the most about Trump's return while countries from Brazil to China and India to Turkey believe he will be good for their countries and global peace, according to a survey last week from the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR). The report accompanying the survey of over 28,500 people across 24 countries serves as a warning for European leaders to act cautiously. 'Europeans will struggle to find internal unity or global power in leading an outright resistance to the new administration,' the ECFR report's authors said. 'Better understand' Trump Middle East conflicts will also be high on the agenda as Israeli President Isaac Herzog and Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim al-Thani speak in separate sessions during the first full day of the forum. As a fragile ceasefire holds in the Israel-Hamas war, the forum will host a discussion on how to improve aid delivery to the Palestinian territory of Gaza and how to kickstart the reconstruction and recovery after heavy bombardment. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa will also deliver a special address on Tuesday, as the African continent's most industrialized country shows it is open for business. Despite suggestions Trump's return would overshadow the forum that began on the same day as his inauguration in Washington, WEF President Borge Brende said the president had brought fresh interest to the gathering. 'It has increased the interest in Davos because people feel they need to come together to better understand what's on its way,' Brende told AFP in an interview.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-eu-ukraine-leaders-take-davos-stage-under-trump-shadow/7944381.html	2025-01-20T23:16:20-08:00	
Malaysia seeks gag order on talk of jailed ex-PM's bid to reveal royal document	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia's attorney general's office is seeking a gag order to ban public discussion of former Prime Minister Najib Razak's judicial review claim that a document exists allowing him to serve his remaining prison sentence under house arrest, according to state news agency Bernama. Najib, jailed for his role in the multi-billion dollar 1MDB scandal, is pursuing a legal bid to compel authorities to confirm the existence of, and execute, an 'addendum order' that he said was issued last year as part of a pardon by then-King Al-Sultan Abdullah Ahmad Shah, entitling him to serve the remainder of his sentence at home. The issue has caused a huge stir in Malaysia, with disgraced political heavyweight Najib insisting the former king's addendum order was ignored by authorities when they announced the halving of his sentence last year. The former king's palace has issued a letter saying the document does exist. Yet Malaysia's law ministry said it has no record of it, its home minister has denied knowledge, and Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim has said 'we did not hide anything.' Bernama on Monday quoted Shamsul Bolhassan, deputy chief of the chambers' civil division, as saying the gag order request had been filed to a court. The official had previously said the case touched on sensitive issues, according to Bernama. Najib was found guilty in 2020 of criminal breach of trust and abuse of power for illegally receiving funds misappropriated from a unit of state investor 1Malaysia Development Berhad. He is on trial for corruption in several other 1MDB-linked cases and denies wrongdoing. Najib this month hailed as 'one step forward' the Court of Appeal's decision to overturn the dismissal of his attempt to access the document. The case will go back to court to be heard by another judge.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-seeks-gag-order-on-talk-of-jailed-ex-pm-s-bid-to-reveal-royal-document-/7944376.html	2025-01-20T22:57:55-08:00	
Trump issues sweeping pardon of 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants	WASHINGTON — President Donald Trump on Monday pardoned more than 1,500 of his supporters charged with crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including people who assaulted police, using his clemency powers on his first day in office to dismantle the largest investigation and prosecution in Justice Department history. Among those set to be released from prison are defendants captured on camera committing violent attacks on law enforcement as lawmakers met to certify President Joe Biden's 2020 election victory. Leaders of the Oath Keepers and Proud Boys extremist groups convicted of seditious conspiracy in the most serious cases brought by the Justice Department will also be freed from prison after having their sentences commuted. Trump is directing the attorney general to seek the dismissal of about 450 pending Jan. 6 cases. The pardons were expected after Trump's yearslong campaign to rewrite the history of the Jan. 6 attack that left more than 100 police officers injured and threatened the peaceful transfer of power. Yet the scope of the clemency still comes as a massive blow to the Justice Department's effort to hold participants accountable over what has been described as one of the darkest days in American history. Trump had suggested in the weeks leading up to his return to the White House that instead of blanket pardons he was going to look at the Jan. 6 defendants on a case-by-case basis. Vice President JD Vance had said just days ago that people responsible for the violence during the Capitol riot 'obviously' should not be pardoned. Casting the rioters as 'patriots' and 'hostages,' Trump has claimed they were unfairly treated by the Justice Department that also charged him with federal crimes in two cases he contends were politically motivated. Trump said the pardons end 'a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated upon the American people over the last four years and begins a process of national reconciliation.' An attorney for Enrique Tarrio, the former national chairman of the Proud Boys who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy, said he expects his client to be released from prison Monday night. Tarrio, who was convicted of orchestrating a failed plot to keep Donald Trump in power after the Republican lost the 2020 election, is serving the longest sentence of any of the Jan. 6 defendants. The pardons come weeks after Trump's own Jan. 6 case was dismissed because of the Justice Department's policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. Hundreds of Jan. 6 defendants who didn't engage in any of the violence and destruction were charged with misdemeanor trespassing offenses, and many of those served little to no time behind bars. But the violence that day has been documented extensively through videos, testimony and other evidence showing rioters — some armed with poles, bats and bear spray — swarming the Capitol, quickly overrunning overwhelmed police, shattering windows and sending lawmakers and aides running into hiding. Police were dragged into the crowd and beaten. One officer screamed in pain as he was crushed in a doorframe, and another suffered a heart attack after a rioter pressed a stun gun against his neck and repeatedly shocked him. Officers have described in testimony fearing for their lives as members of the mob hurled insults and obscenities at them. Of the more than 1,500 people charged, about 250 people have been convicted of crimes by a judge or a jury after a trial. At least 1,020 had pleaded guilty to crimes as of Jan. 1. Only two people were acquitted of all charges by judges after bench trials. No jury has fully acquitted a Capitol riot defendant. More than 1,000 rioters have already been sentenced, with over 700 receiving at least some time behind bars. The rest were given some combination of probation, community service, home detention or fines.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-issues-sweeping-pardon-of-1-500-jan-6-defendants/7944356.html	2025-01-20T21:38:13-08:00	
Trump lays out vision on first day of second term	President Donald Trump got right to work upon his return to the White House on Monday, announcing numerous executive actions on top-line issues like immigration and energy development and, in his inaugural address, promising to expand U.S territory – all the way, he said, to Mars. VOA’s Anita Powell reports from the White House	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lays-out-vision-on-first-day-of-second-term/7944343.html	2025-01-20T21:08:49-08:00	
In day steeped with tradition, Donald Trump is sworn in	WASHINGTON — Amid frigid temperatures in the nation’s capital, the peaceful transfer of power from one presidential administration to the next took place Monday. The inauguration events, starting with a church service and culminating in an oath and inaugural speech at the Capitol building, were attended by former presidents and their families, foreign dignitaries, and tech billionaires. Members of the 'press pool' — a group of reporters, photographers and video journalists — were on hand to capture the day’s events for the media outlets that make up the White House Correspondents' Association. Through the press pool, accredited journalists take turns covering the president’s daily activities to ensure 24-7 coverage of the American leader. VOA White House correspondent Misha Komadovsky was assigned to Monday morning’s inaugural events. 'Today, I’ll be your eyes and ears during the first steps of Donald Trump’s inauguration,' Komadovsky emailed at around 8 a.m. local time as part of his assignments. The pool report had noted that the inaugural events were to follow a traditional course: a morning church service and a meeting between the outgoing and incoming first families before traveling to the inauguration. The service at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Lafayette Park across from the White House has been a part of inauguration events since 1933, when Franklin D. Roosevelt attended a service before being sworn in as the 32nd president. Trump, as the 47th U.S. president, followed in his predecessors’ footsteps. He and first lady Melania Trump sat in the front row of the church, alongside his vice president, JD Vance, and second lady Usha Vance. Melania Trump wore a navy suit by New York-based designer Adam Lippes, paired with a wide-brimmed hat by American designer, Eric Javits. Dressing the first lady was an honor, Javits said, adding that his background in art has informed his ability to bring 'harmony and balance to the face' with his designs. In Melania Trump’s case, he told the AP, the designing was not difficult because the first lady is 'blessed with great bone structure, beauty and a wonderful sense of style.' Also attending Monday’s service — which took place the same day that the U.S. marks Martin Luther King Jr. Day — were members of the Trump family, including his children Donald Jr., Ivanka, Eric, Tiffany and Barron Trump. Individuals whom the president has nominated for key roles in his administration also filled the pews, including Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Pete Hegseth, Pam Bondi, Kash Patel and Marco Rubio. Foreign dignitaries were also present. Leaders seen by the press pool included President Javier Milei of Argentina, Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni of Italy, and Britain’s former Conservative Party prime minister Boris Johnson. Some of the world’s richest individuals were also there, including Elon Musk of Tesla, social media platform X, and SpaceX; Apple CEO Tim Cook; and media tycoon Rupert Murdoch. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew attended the service, as did media personality Tucker Carlson. TikTok had briefly gone offline Saturday evening following a U.S. Supreme Court ruling upholding a law ordering the Chinese social media platform to sell to an American owner. Trump indicated he planned a 'joint venture' to allow TikTok to operate. Service was restored on Sunday, with a message to users that said that 'as a result of President Trump’s efforts, TikTok is back in the U.S.' Trump’s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who earlier this month was held in contempt of court twice over a defamation case stemming from Trump’s failed 2020 election, was also spotted at the service. Giuliani last Thursday settled the $148 million defamation judgment granted to two election workers in the U.S. state of Georgia. During Monday’s 25-minute church service, the choir sang 'America the Beautiful.' After the service concluded, Trump walked down the aisle, greeting guests along the way. He was seen patting Milei of Argentina on the shoulder. Next, keeping with tradition, outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Dr. Jill Biden met with the incoming president and first lady at the White House. The First Families shared tea in the White House Blue Room before departing together for the U.S. Capitol. Because of extreme cold weather, the inauguration was held inside the Capitol rotunda, with music from the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Combined Choir and the U.S. Marine Band. Opera singer Christopher D. Macchio sang 'Oh, America!' and singer Carrie Underwood performed 'America the Beautiful' with the Armed Forces Chorus and U.S. Naval Academy Glee Club. Former Presidents George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were on hand for the inauguration, along with many members of the church service congregation and the Trump family, as faith leaders offered prayers. Tech billionaires including Musk, Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg and Google CEO Sundar Pichai were spotted at the inauguration, alongside the president’s supporters and U.S. lawmakers. Chief Justice John Roberts swore in the 47th president, on a Bible held by Melania Trump. The president was flanked by his children. Following the oath of office, a luncheon took place, followed by a military troop review and parade. As the ceremonial swearing in took place, new staffers at the White House were seen moving into their new offices and unpacking images of the president and first lady.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-day-steeped-with-tradition-donald-trump-is-sworn-in/7944323.html	2025-01-20T19:56:46-08:00	
Trump lays out vision on first day of second term	White House — On the historic first day of his second term in office, President Donald Trump laid out his vision for a bolder — and larger — United States. 'The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations, and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons,' he said in his inaugural address Monday. 'And we will pursue our manifest destiny into the stars, launching American astronauts to plant the Stars and Stripes on the planet Mars.' Then he got to work signing a stack of executive orders. He said they included a declaration of a national emergency at the southern border that would allow the deployment of troops, and a national energy emergency that would allow more domestic oil and gas extraction. He also declared that there are only two genders, male and female, and said he would order that the Gulf of Mexico be renamed the Gulf of America. Historians say that Trump made history on his second Day 1 by using what is historically a unifying speech to portray a future that many Americans may disagree with. 'Donald Trump did not do that. This was one of the most partisan presidential inaugural speeches — it was less an inaugural speech and more a State of the Union. He just listed a series of bullet points of projects he wanted to undertake, from deporting immigrants to seizing back the Panama Canal,' said Jeremi Suri, a history professor at the University of Texas at Austin. Shortly after his inaugural speech, Trump spoke to a smaller group of supporters at the Capitol and reiterated claims that the 2020 election was 'totally rigged' — a claim without proof. He also pardoned some of those convicted over the violent events of Jan. 6, 2021, when a mob of Trump supporters attempted to disrupt the certification of the election Trump lost. 'I think this was a better speech than the one I made upstairs, OK?' Trump said. Some of Trump's powerful supporters expressed their joy. Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk was among the billionaires who packed into the Capitol for the ceremony and hailed Trump's victory. After Trump was sworn in, Musk took to the stage of the rally at Capital One Arena to praise him. 'This was no ordinary victory,' he said. 'This was a fork in the road of human civilization.' Consumer advocacy groups are sounding alarms about some of the new president's quieter moves, ones they say seek to loosen regulations and benefit the extremely wealthy. 'When we think about why the incoming Trump administration wants to freeze regulations and halt public protections wholesale, it is at the behest of the wealthiest among us, corporate special interests,' said Lisa Gilbert, co-president of the nonprofit consumer advocacy organization Public Citizen. 'They are who benefits when we don't have guardrails on the books.' Trump did not, on Monday, directly address foreign policy concerns such as Ukraine and competition with China — but Suri said his expansionist rhetoric sent a message. 'It's hard for the United States to tell [Russian President] Vladimir Putin or [Chinese President] Xi Jinping that they should not seek expansion when our president is talking about expansion, but insofar as we don't follow through on that rhetoric, we still are on very strong ground to say that invading your neighbor, as Putin has in Ukraine, or as China might potentially do in Taiwan, that is verboten, that crosses the line, so long as it's just words from us,' he said. 'If we were to go to war to try to seize the Panama Canal, that would certainly give a kind of carte blanche to Putin and Xi Jinping, because they make the same arguments for Ukraine and Taiwan.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-lays-out-vision-on-first-day-of-second-term/7944313.html	2025-01-20T19:05:41-08:00	
Trump’s executive orders on immigration focus on border security, asylum restrictions, deportations	WASHINGTON — On the first day of his second term, President Donald Trump announced a series of executive actions addressing immigration and border security. Trump signed orders his officials called 'common-sense immigration policies.' These include declaring a national emergency at the U.S. southern border, deploying armed forces, border wall construction, ending asylum and ending birthright citizenship to some children born in the U.S., among others. During his inaugural address, Trump said, 'We have a government that has given unlimited funding to the defense of foreign borders, but refuses to defend American borders or more importantly, its own people.' In a call with reporters earlier in the day, Trump officials outlined the administration's plans to tackle what it describes as a 'national security and public safety crisis' at the U.S.-Mexico border. 'President Trump was elected by a resounding mandate to carry out the promises he made on the campaign trail, that includes his pledge to secure the southern border and carry out the largest deportation of migrant criminals in history,' an incoming White House official said, speaking on background, a method often used by U.S. officials to remain anonymous. Officials also emphasized the administration's commitment to implement what they call the largest deportation of migrant criminals in U.S. history. Here are some of the administration’s plans. National emergency at the border Trump said he will deploy the military to the U.S.-Mexico border, including the National Guard, to assist existing law enforcement officers. Officials emphasized that border security is national security, and the administration is committed to securing the border through use of the military. 'What this action does is it deploys armed forces [and] erects physical barriers by directing [Department of Defense] and [Department of Homeland Security] secretaries to finish the wall along the border. … We're going to reinstate the Remain in Mexico [policy],' the official said. Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, senior fellow at the American Immigration Council, wrote on X that without Mexico’s permission, the promise to bring back Remain in Mexico is 'just words on a paper.' The Remain in Mexico policy, created during the first Trump administration, requires some asylum-seekers at the southern border to wait in Mexico until their hearings in U.S. immigration court. Juan Ramon de la Fuente, Mexico's secretary of external relations, said in a news conference Monday morning that if 'they reinstate [Remain in Mexico], this is something we don’t agree with. We have a different focus. We want to adjust it. ... The desire is to keep the same policies as now.' When asked about the number of troops expected to be deployed to the border, Trump administration officials said that decision would ultimately be made by the secretary of defense. The administration is also rescinding the Biden administration border policies by giving U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement and U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents expanded enforcement authority and establishing federal task forces to work with state and local law enforcement in deportation efforts. Mass deportations Another announcement centers on undocumented immigrants across the country. The Republican president repeatedly promised during his campaign to carry out mass deportations, targeting at least 11 million undocumented individuals. In the press call with reporters, the Trump officials said the administration will provide immigration officers with the necessary 'authorities' to enforce existing laws. In his campaign, Trump vowed to eliminate President Joe Biden's deportation priorities, which targeted individuals with criminal records and those considered national security threats, and instead to expand enforcement to include all undocumented immigrants. Stephen Yale-Loehr, a retired professor of immigration law at Cornell Law School, wrote in an email to VOA that mass deportation efforts and raids may get the most attention, but deportations will not increase rapidly right away. 'If a person already has an outstanding order of deportation, they can be deported immediately. But that is a relatively small number. Most people picked up will be put into deportation proceedings in immigration courts. Those courts already have a backlog of over 3.8 million cases. Given that backlog, it will be years before many people will find out whether they will be deported or allowed to stay based on asylum or some other form of protection,' he wrote. Release of migrants The incoming administration also announced an end to the practice of releasing migrants into the U.S. while they await their immigration court hearings, commonly known as 'catch-and-release.' The Trump officials did not explain how they would handle an increase in immigrant detention. Refugee program Trump is also ending the refugee resettlement program. During his first administration, he progressively lowered the annual ceiling for refugee admissions to a historic low of 15,000 for fiscal 2021. Refugee advocates said at the time the reductions marked a departure from the United States’ long-standing role in global refugee resettlement. Erol Kekic, senior vice president of programs at Church World Service, wrote in an email to reporters that his group is urging President Trump to reconsider. Church World Service is one of the nine national refugee resettlement agencies authorized by the federal government to assist refugees in starting new lives. 'Even a brief pause in the program can have a devastating impact; on those displaced by violence and persecution, families separated by oceans and continents, and our communities who embrace the spirit of welcome inherent to our great nation,' he wrote. Ending asylum and CBP One app One of Trump’s orders calls for the immediate deportation of migrants who crossed the border illegally without a chance to plead their case to an asylum officer. Shortly after Trump's inauguration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection posted a notice on its website saying the agency was no longer using the CBP One app, which had facilitated the legal entry of nearly 1 million people into the United States with eligibility to work. The app allowed migrants to apply for an appointment to come to the border and apply for humanitarian parole or other forms of legal processing. The use of parole under the CBP One system was part of the Biden administration's broader efforts to manage migration flows and provide legal pathways to entry, rather than having individuals cross the border illegally. However, parole granted through CBP One did not guarantee permanent legal status; it typically allowed individuals to stay temporarily and, in some cases, apply for work authorization while their immigration status was being reviewed. The notice by the CBP One app also confirmed that all existing appointments had been canceled. Birthright citizenship Finally, Trump signed an order to eliminate birthright citizenship. Birthright citizenship grants automatic U.S. citizenship to anyone born on American soil, a right established by the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. The new administration's actions are expected to face significant legal and political challenges, with immigrant advocacy groups voicing concerns over the implications of these policies. The ACLU of Northern California, a nonprofit organization in the United States dedicated to defending individual rights and liberties guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution and laws, wrote in an email to the press they 'stand ready.' 'We are ready to do so again, from day one of the second Trump administration. … We will defend immigrants’ rights to due process in the face of mass deportations,' the email read.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-executive-orders-on-immigration-focus-on-border-security-asylum-restrictions-deportations/7944289.html	2025-01-20T18:15:22-08:00	
Senate confirms Rubio as secretary of state, Trump's first Cabinet member	WASHINGTON — The Senate quickly confirmed Marco Rubio as secretary of state on Monday, voting unanimously to give President Donald Trump the first member of his new Cabinet on Inauguration Day. Rubio, a Republican senator from Florida, is among the least controversial of Trump's nominees, and the vote was a decisive 99-0. Another pick, John Ratcliffe for CIA director, is also expected to have a swift vote. Action on others, including former combat veteran and Fox News host Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, is expected later in the week. 'Marco Rubio is a very intelligent man with a remarkable understanding of American foreign policy,' Senator Chuck Grassley, the senior-most Republican, said as the chamber opened. It's often tradition for the Senate to convene immediately after the ceremonial pomp of the inauguration to begin putting the new president's team in place, particularly the national security officials. During Trump's first term, the Senate swiftly confirmed his defense and homeland security secretaries on his first day in office. Former President Joe Biden's choice for director of national intelligence was confirmed on his own Inauguration Day. With Trump's return to the White House, and his Republican Party controlling majorities in Congress, his outsider Cabinet choices are more clearly falling into place, despite initial skepticism and opposition from both sides of the aisle. Senate Majority Leader John Thune moved quickly Monday, saying he expected voting to begin 'imminently' on Trump's nominees. Democrats have calculated it's better for them to be seen as more willing to work with Trump rather than simply mounting a blockade to his nominees. They're holding their opposition for some of his other picks who have less support, including Tulsi Gabbard for director of national intelligence and vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. for health secretary. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said his party would 'neither rubber-stamp nominees we feel are grossly unqualified, nor oppose nominees that deserve serious consideration.' Rubio, he said, is an example of 'a qualified nominee we think should be confirmed quickly.' Senate committees have been holding lengthy confirmation hearings on more than a dozen of the Cabinet nominees, with more to come this week. And several panels were expected to meet late Monday to begin voting to advance the nominees to the full Senate for confirmation. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee advanced Rubio's nomination late Monday. The Senate Armed Services Committee and Senate Intelligence Committee, respectively, advanced the nominations of Hegseth and Ratcliffe. Rubio, a well-liked senator and former Trump rival during the 2016 presidential race, has drawn closer to the president in recent years. He appeared last week to answer questions before the Foreign Relations Committee, where he has spent more than a decade as a member. As secretary of state, Rubio would be the nation's top diplomat and the first Latino to hold the position. Born in Miami to Cuban immigrants, he has long been involved in foreign affairs, particularly in South America, and has emerged as a hawk on China's rise. During his confirmation hearing last week, Rubio warned of the consequences of America's 'unbalanced relationship' with China. While he echoes Trump's anti-globalist rhetoric, Rubio is also seen as an internationalist who understands the power of U.S. involvement on the global stage. Rubio will take over for outgoing Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who has said he hopes the Trump administration continues Biden's policies in the Middle East to end the war in Gaza and to help Ukraine counter Russian nomination. The Senate is split 53-47, but the resignation of Vice President JD Vance drops the GOP majority to 52 until his successor arrives. Republicans need almost every party member in line to overcome Democratic opposition to nominees. Objection from any one senator, as is expected with Hegseth and several other choices, would force the Senate into procedural steps that would drag voting later into the week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-confirms-rubio-as-secretary-of-state-trump-s-first-cabinet-member-/7944227.html	2025-01-20T16:57:01-08:00	
Biden issues preemptive pardons before exiting White House	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden used his constitutional power Monday to preemptively pardon several individuals, including some of his relatives, just minutes before Donald Trump was sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. Without naming Trump or the incoming administration, Biden said in a statement that he believes in the rule of law but warned about the threat of partisan politics and pointed to possible retribution as the main concern behind his decision to grant the preemptive pardons. 'I am optimistic that the strength of our legal institutions will ultimately prevail over politics,' Biden’s statement read. 'But these are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing.' Among those granted pardons is Trump’s former Joint Chiefs of Staff, retired General Mark Milley. Political differences between Trump and Milley that both men vented in public during Trump’s first term in office led to Trump’s supporters branding Milley as disloyal. Milley has reportedly referred to Trump as a 'fascist.' Citing 'ongoing threats and intimidation for faithfully discharging their duties,' Biden extended pardons to members and staff of the Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol. That includes former Republican Representative Liz Cheney. Biden also preemptively pardoned the U.S. Capitol and Washington police officers who testified before the committee. 'The Select Committee fulfilled this mission with integrity and a commitment to discovering the truth,' Biden said. The statement continued, 'Rather than accept accountability, those who perpetrated the January 6th attack have taken every opportunity to undermine and intimidate those who participated in the Select Committee in an attempt to rewrite history, erase the stain of January 6th for partisan gain, and seek revenge, including by threatening criminal prosecutions.' Biden also preemptively pardoned his former chief medical adviser, Dr. Anthony Fauci, who retired in December 2023. Fauci and his family have received threats from those who opposed his approach to the COVID-19 pandemic, including the issuance of mask mandates. There’s a history of U.S. presidents pardoning family members for specific criminal convictions. Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden in December for gun and tax offenses as well as for any offenses he may have committed 'from January 1, 2014, through December 1, 2024.' But on Monday, Biden also pardoned other relatives who aren’t under investigation, including his brother, James Biden; James Biden’s wife, Sara Biden; his sister, Valerie Biden Owens; Valerie Owens’ husband, John Owens; and his brother, Francis Biden. 'My family has been subjected to unrelenting attacks and threats, motivated solely by a desire to hurt me — the worst kind of partisan politics. Unfortunately, I have no reason to believe these attacks will end,' Biden’s statement said. 'The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that they engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense.' Biden’s preemptive pardons contradict the stance he publicly shared on the matter on December 3, 2020, shortly before he took office. CNN anchor Jake Tapper asked Biden’s opinion on Trump's reported consideration of a wave of preemptive pardons before exiting the White House. 'Well, it concerns me in terms of what kind of precedent it sets and how the rest of the world looks at us as a nation of laws and justice,' Biden replied. He further underscored that his administration wouldn’t approach pardons in that way. Trump has himself promised to pardon many of his supporters who attacked the Capitol on January 6, 2021. He has characterized those arrested as 'patriots' who were wrongly prosecuted. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-issues-preemptive-pardons-before-exiting-white-house-/7944198.html	2025-01-20T16:52:13-08:00	
‘Dangerous fire weather conditions’ predicted in Southern California	The National Weather Service (NWS) is predicting even more 'dangerous fire weather conditions' in Southern California, citing the area’s 'low humidity and the return of very strong winds' from Monday into Tuesday. 'Take action now to prepare your home and loved ones for another round of EXTREME WIND and FIRE WEATHER, starting tomorrow afternoon: Worst winds Mon afternoon – Tue morning,' NWS Los Angeles posted on social media platform X. 'Everyone needs to be on high alert,' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said Monday. Brice Bennett, spokesperson for the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire), said in a statement Monday that his agency — with help from federal, local and tribal firefighting agencies — had more than 2,500 people and had prepositioned equipment for quick deployment for any new outbreaks, following the NWS warning. At least 27 people have died in the fires that have erupted across Los Angeles, as battle-weary firefighters have struggled to bring the blazes under control. The death toll is expected to rise. The Palisades and Eaton fires together have destroyed 14,000 structures since they exploded January 7, during the fierce Santa Ana winds. As of Monday, the Palisades fire was 59% contained and the Eaton fire was 87% contained. A critical-risk-of-fire-weather warning has been issued by the Storm Prediction Center for Southern California with gusts expected to reach up to 96 kph for lower elevations and 120 kph or more in higher locations. The weather service said there is an extremely critical risk in place for the ongoing fire locations in the San Gabriel and Santa Monica mountains. California Governor Gavin Newsom issued an executive order Monday designed to protect Southern California residents from landslides and flooding. The order suspends some rules and regulations and speeds up the removal of debris that, if not removed promptly, could result in landslides, mudslides and flash floods. 'This order helps keep our emergency response focused on protecting communities, not permits and paperwork,' Newsom said. Residents whose homes have somehow survived the fires are finding they are not home free. According to The New York Times, people are finding their homes still standing but filled with a slurry of smoke, ash, chemicals and other contaminants. 'It smelled worse inside our house than outside,' resident Marcos Barron, 53, told the Times. Another resident, Arlynn Page, said she wanted to stay to rebuild in Altadena because she loves the community. 'But breathing this air? I don’t know,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dangerous-fire-weather-conditions-predicted-in-southern-california/7943961.html	2025-01-20T16:04:02-08:00

World leaders congratulate Trump on inauguration	World leaders on Monday are congratulating President Donald Trump on his inauguration as the 47th president of the United States. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy was among those who congratulated Trump. 'President Trump is always decisive, and the peace through strength policy he announced provides an opportunity to strengthen American leadership and achieve a long-term and just peace, which is a top priority,' Zelenskyy said. The third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war is approaching at the end of February. Trump previously promised to end the Russia-Ukraine war in one day after becoming president, or even before his inauguration. More recently, Trump advisers have said resolving the conflict will now take months or even longer. Trump has voiced skepticism of continued U.S. military support for Kyiv. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also congratulated President Trump. 'I believe that working together again will raise the U.S.-Israeli alliance to even greater heights,' Netanyahu said. A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas began Sunday, just one day before Trump assumed the presidency. 'I look forward to working with you to return the remaining hostages, to destroy Hamas’ military capabilities and end its political rule in Gaza, and to ensure that Gaza never again poses a threat to Israel,' Netanyahu added. Congratulations also rolled in from NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, as well as U.S. allies like Germany, Italy and Britain. 'The U.S. is our closest ally, and the aim of our policy is always a good transatlantic relationship,' German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer pointed to the longtime relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom. 'For centuries, the relationship between our two nations has been one of collaboration, cooperation and enduring partnership,' Starmer said. 'With President Trump’s longstanding affection and historical ties to the United Kingdom, I know that depth of friendship will continue.' And Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, who attended the inauguration at the Capitol Rotunda in Washington, said she is 'certain that the friendship between our nations and the values that unite us will continue to strengthen the cooperation between Italy and the USA.' But not all of the messages were congratulatory. Panama’s President Jose Raul Mulino rejected a portion of Trump’s inaugural address, in which Trump reaffirmed his desire to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal. The United States fully ceded control of the strategically important canal to Panama in 1999. 'On behalf of the Republic of Panama and its people, I must fully reject the words outlined by President Donald Trump regarding Panama and its canal in his inaugural speech,' Mulino said in a statement. Some information in this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-leaders-congratulate-trump-on-inauguration-/7943816.html	2025-01-20T13:40:56-08:00	
Melania Trump brings steely fashion game back to Washington	WASHINGTON — Where in the world is Melania Trump? Back in Washington in a sharply tailored outfit that exudes international woman of mystery as her husband once again becomes president of the United States. Wearing a long navy coat and matching wide-brimmed hat — which shielded her eyes in most photos and hindered her commander-in-chief husband's attempts to give her a peck before his swearing-in — Melania's fit drew snark on social media and a flurry of comparisons to a 1980s video game character. 'Where in the world is Carmen Sandiego?' quipped the internet, referring to the franchise that spun off into a popular 1990s geography game show for kids, and featured a criminal mastermind dressed in a long, carmine trench coat and eye-obscuring fedora. Melania Trump's coat and skirt were silk wool Adam Lippes, an independent American designer based in New York, an ensemble paired with an ivory blouse tightly wrapped at the Slovenian-born former model's neck. 'The tradition of the presidential inauguration embodies the beauty of American democracy, and today we had the honor to dress our first lady, Mrs. Melania Trump,' said Lippes in a statement that emphasized American manufacturing over political ideology. 'Mrs. Trump's outfit was created by some of America's finest craftsmen, and I take great pride in showing such work to the world.' The hat was by New York milliner Eric Javits. 'She cut the figure of a mafia widow or high-ranking member of an obscure religious order, and a bit of 'My Fair Lady,'' wrote Rachel Tashjian, style critic for The Washington Post. American first ladies don't get much of a voice — but their sartorial choices are broadcast to the world and scrutinized for subtext and statements. The late Rosalynn Carter, for example, drew strong reactions by wearing a dress she had already worn — gasp! — when her husband, Jimmy, was inaugurated in 1977. The point was to show empathy for the economic struggles of Americans — but sometimes what the people really want is aspirational glamour. In recent years, first ladies have routinely turned to independent designers for inaugural events: in 2021, Jill Biden wore a sparkling blue coat-and-dress combo by Markarian, a small brand in New York. Michelle Obama made waves in 2009 in a lemon-colored outfit by Isabel Toledo, wearing Thom Browne at her husband's second swearing-in. She wore gowns by Jason Wu to both series of inaugural balls. Melania Trump, for her part, channeled Jackie Kennedy to kick off her first turn in the White House, wearing Ralph Lauren — a heritage-brand favorite on both sides of the political aisle — to the daytime events in 2017. She swapped her powder-blue cashmere dress and matching asymmetrical bolero jacket with opera gloves for a silk crepe gown by Herve Pierre that year, both looks that signaled a sense of buoyancy as she began her new role as a political wife. Her shadowy-chic 2025 look marks a sharp departure as she enters tenure two. 'For her second round as first lady, the fashion game — the tool she brandishes most often and most forcefully, even if the public sometimes struggles to divine her sartorial messages — is likely to be one of steely, precise armor, of clothes with brash and exacting tailoring,' wrote the Post's Tashjian.

East Congo hospital sees 'influx' of wounded as conflict escalates	GOMA, CONGO — A hospital in Goma has taken in more than 200 wounded since early January as fighting intensifies in eastern Congo, the Red Cross and local sources told AFP Monday. In recent weeks, the Congo's restive east has seen escalating clashes between the Congolese army and the M23 Movement — an armed group backed by Rwanda. With the M23 closing in on Goma, the provincial capital's hospital has had to tend to more and more people hit by the fighting, according to the Red Cross. 'We have seen an influx of wounded people since the start of January,' Myriam Favier, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross in North Kivu province, told AFP. 'Between the 1 and 21 of December we saw 100 patients (and) between the 1 and 20 January we had 211 patients,' Favier added. On Monday the fighting reached the hills of Sake, a town approximately 20 kilometers west of Goma. Explosions could be heard from Goma in the morning, according to AFP journalists. Since its resurgence in late 2021, the M23 — which claims to defend ethnic Tutsis — has seized vast swathes of the Congo's mineral-rich east. In early January the M23 seized control of Masisi, the administrative capital of Masisi territory located 80 kilometers from Goma. 'Most alarming' The Congolese army has since been attempting to retake the city in a counteroffensive that has provoked a fresh wave of displacements. More than 230,000 people have fled violence in eastern Congo since the start of the year, the United Nations said Friday, labeling it one of the world's 'most alarming' humanitarian crises. Humanitarian charity Doctors Without Borders on Monday said in a statement it was 'reiterating' its call for 'respect for health and humanitarian facilities.' The statement came after two of its workers were 'slightly injured when a rocket hit the MSF garage next to the Masisi General Referral hospital [and] ... on the same day, another rocket hit a latrine near the hospital.' Several security sources told AFP the intensity of the fighting is currently at a level not seen for months, with a high number of deaths and the use of heavy artillery. An expert’s report commissioned by the U.N. Security Council said in July that 3,000 to 4,000 Rwandan soldiers had been fighting alongside the M23 rebels and that Kigali had 'de facto control' of the group's operations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/east-congo-hospital-sees-influx-of-wounded-as-conflict-escalates-/7943766.html	2025-01-20T12:54:58-08:00	
At least 80 people killed in northeast Colombia as peace talks fail, official says	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — More than 80 people were killed in the country's northeast over the weekend following the government's failed attempts to hold peace talks with the National Liberation Army, a Colombian official said. Twenty others were injured in the violence that has forced thousands to flee as Colombia's army scrambled to evacuate people on Sunday, according to William Villamizar, governor of North Santander, where many of the killings took place. Among the victims were community leader Carmelo Guerrero and seven people who sought to sign a peace deal, according to a report that a government ombudsman agency released late Saturday. Officials said the attacks happened in several towns located in the Catatumbo region near the border with Venezuela, with at least three people who were part of the peace talks being kidnapped. Thousands of people are fleeing the area, with some hiding in the nearby lush mountains or seeking help at government shelters. 'We were caught in the crossfire,' said Juan Gutierrez, who fled with his family to a temporary shelter in Tibu after they were forced to leave behind their animals and belongings. 'We had no time to grab our things. ... I hope the government remembers us. ... We are helpless here.' Colombia's army rescued dozens of people on Sunday, including a family and their pet dog, whose owner held a pack of cold water against the animal's chest to keep it cool as they evacuated by helicopter. Defense Minister Ivan Velasquez traveled to the northeast town of Cucuta on Sunday where he held several security meetings and urged armed groups to demobilize. 'The priority is to save lives and guarantee the security of communities,' he said. 'We have deployed our troops throughout the entire region.' Officials also prepared to send 10 tons of food and hygiene kits for approximately 5,000 people in the communities of Ocaña and Tibu, the majority of them having fled the violence. 'Catatumbo needs help,' Villamizar said in a public address on Saturday. 'Boys, girls, young people, teenagers; entire families are showing up with nothing, riding trucks, dump trucks, motorcycles, whatever they can, on foot, to avoid being victims of this confrontation.' The attack comes after Colombia suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army, or ELN, on Friday, the second time it has done so in less than a year. Colombia's government has demanded that the ELN cease all attacks and allow authorities to enter the region and provide humanitarian aid. 'Displacement is killing us here in the region,' said José Trinidad, a municipal official for the town of Convención, located in the North Santander region. 'We're afraid the crisis will worsen.' Trinidad called on insurgent groups to sit down and hammer out a new agreement so 'us civilians don't have to suffer the consequences that we're suffering right now.' The ELN has been clashing in Catatumbo with former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a guerrilla group that disbanded after signing a peace deal in 2016 with Colombia's government. The two are fighting over control of a strategic border region that has coca leaf plantations. In a statement Saturday, the ELN said it had warned former FARC members that if they 'continued attacking the population ... there was no other way out than armed confrontation.' The ELN has accused ex-FARC rebels of several killings in the area, including the Jan. 15 slaying of a couple and their 9-month-old baby. Army commander General Luis Emilio Cardozo Santamaría said Saturday that authorities were reinforcing a humanitarian corridor between Tibú and Cúcuta for the safe passage of those forced to flee their homes. He said special urban troops also were deployed to municipal capitals 'where there are risks and a lot of fear.' The ELN has tried to negotiate a peace deal with the administration of President Gustavo Petro five times, with talks failing after bouts of violence. ELN demands include that it be recognized as a political rebel organization, which critics have said is risky.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-80-people-killed-in-northeast-colombia-as-peace-talks-fail-official-says/7943754.html	2025-01-20T12:53:25-08:00	
No day-one tariffs coming from Trump, but trade overhaul planned, official says	President Donald Trump will issue a broad trade memo on Monday that stops short of imposing new tariffs on his first day in office but directs federal agencies to evaluate U.S. trade relationships with China, Canada and Mexico, a Trump administration official said. After weeks of intense global speculation over which duties Trump would impose immediately after being sworn in as U.S. president, news that Trump would take more time on tariffs drove a relief rally in global stocks and a dive in the dollar against major currencies. Trump mentioned no specific tariff plans in his inaugural address but repeated his intention to create the External Revenue Service, a new agency to collect 'massive amounts' of tariffs, duties and other revenues from foreign sources. 'I will immediately begin the overhaul of our trade system to protect American workers and families,' Trump said. 'Instead of taxing our citizens to enrich other countries, we will tariff and tax foreign countries to enrich our citizens.' Trump added that his policies would make America 'a manufacturing nation once again.' During his election campaign, Trump vowed to impose steep tariffs of 10% to 20% on global imports into the U.S. and 60% on goods from China to help reduce a trade deficit that now tops $1 trillion annually. He said after his November election that he would sign 'all necessary documents' upon taking office to impose an immediate 25% import surcharge on imports from Canada and Mexico if they failed to clamp down on the flow of illicit drugs and migrants entering the U.S. illegally. Such duties would tear up long-standing trade agreements, upend supply chains and raise costs, according to trade experts. The official, confirming a Wall Street Journal report that cited a summary of Trump's memo, said the new president will instead direct agencies to investigate and remedy persistent trade deficits and address unfair trade and currency policies by other nations. The memo will single out China, Canada and Mexico for scrutiny but will not announce new tariffs, the official said. It will direct agencies to assess Beijing's compliance with its 2020 trade deal with the U.S., as well as the status of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, the official said. Relief rally The U.S. dollar slumped broadly on the news against a basket of major trading partners' currencies, with particularly large upswings in the euro, Canadian dollar, Mexican peso and Chinese yuan. MSCI's measure of global stock markets rose. U.S. financial markets are closed for the Martin Luther King Jr. Day holiday. Some industry groups and trade lawyers in Washington had speculated that Trump would invoke the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a law with sweeping powers to control imports in times of national emergency, to impose immediate tariffs. But the forthcoming trade memo signals a more methodical approach that would likely involve trade investigations under other legal authorities such as the Section 232 national security trade law and the Section 301 unfair trade practices statute. Trump invoked these laws during his first term, and probes on steel and aluminum and Chinese imports took months to complete. 'It sounds like maybe he's been listening to the people telling him that immediate tariffs would really hurt the financial markets,' said William Reinsch, a trade expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But Reinsch and other trade analysts say they still expect Trump to press ahead with a global tariff early in his administration. 'The universal tariff was a core part of the economic plan he ran on, and I think he’s going to do what he said he would,' said Kelly Ann Shaw, a former White House trade adviser during Trump's first term. 'This is an idea he's supported for a long time,' Shaw, now with the Hogan Lovells law firm, said in an interview last week. Past trade playbook In his 2017-2021 first term, Trump's administration used investigations to impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports and launch duties on some $370 billion worth of Chinese imports, igniting a tit-for-tat tariff war between the world's two largest economies. The U.S. and China ended the conflict in 2020 with a deal for Beijing to boost its purchases of U.S. exports from farm goods to aircraft by $200 billion annually but never followed through as the pandemic hit. The forthcoming memo indicates that Trump's administration will try to push China to keep those commitments. Trump also had threatened to quit the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, blaming it for draining U.S. manufacturing jobs to Mexico and prompting a renegotiation of the trade pact with tighter rules of origin for autos and stronger labor and environmental standards. Trump won a sunset provision in USMCA that will allow him to renegotiate it again in 2026, and the tariff threats against Mexico and Canada are seen by some trade analysts as a gambit to open those talks early.	https://www.voanews.com/a/no-day-one-tariffs-coming-from-trump-but-trade-overhaul-planned-official-says/7943735.html	2025-01-20T12:33:14-08:00

Linda Gradstein reports for VOA from Tel Aviv, Israel.

Trump supporters disappointed they couldn't watch inauguration in person	WASHINGTON — The National Mall in Washington was lined with hundreds of portable toilets Monday, but it’s unlikely many of the portable restrooms got much use. They had been set up for the hundreds of thousands of people who were expected to watch as Donald Trump took the oath of office to become the 47th president of the United States. But Monday’s cold temperatures, which hovered around minus 6.6 degrees Celsius, meant Trump’s swearing-in ceremony was moved indoors. The last-minute change left many Trump supporters feeling disappointed because they had traveled to Washington to see Trump’s inauguration in person, they told VOA. Unable to watch the inauguration like they had planned, some gathered on the National Mall on Monday morning, as close to the U.S. Capitol Building as the fences allowed. Melanie Voll, from Ohio, had received tickets from her representative, Bob Latta, to watch the inauguration. 'With this beautiful sunshine, and no wind, it’s extra disappointing,' Voll said. She and her son both wore 'Make America Great Again' hats as they walked down the National Mall. 'We’re from the Midwest, so we’re used to the cold,' she added. Those with tickets for the Presidential Platform and members of Congress were still able to attend the ceremony in person. But moving the inauguration indoors meant the vast majority of ticketed guests, like Voll, were unable to watch the inauguration in person. Friends Emma and Paige, from Kentucky and South Carolina, agreed they were disappointed that the inauguration was moved indoors. 'Absolutely we were disappointed,' Paige said. 'The whole reason was to come and be able to stand outside and watch it happen, but we’re still enjoying the day. It’s a nice day outside.' They declined to share their last names because 'we’ve got jobs,' Paige said. Carmen and Jeff Mayo, from Yakima, Washington, told VOA they were also disappointed that they couldn’t watch the inauguration in person, but added they were happy that Trump would be president again. 'The main thing is that it happens and that he is sworn into office and the changes begin to occur,' Carmen Mayo said. Unable to watch the inauguration outside, some Trump supporters planned to watch from Capital One Arena in Washington. A 76-year-old Falun Dafa member named Angela, who declined to provide her last name, told VOA that’s where she was headed after stopping at the National Mall. Falun Dafa, also known as Falun Gong, is a religious movement banned by Beijing. Angela said she voted for Trump because 'I think the most important thing is that people are kind to each other.' While speaking with VOA, she emphasized that she was speaking in her personal capacity, not for the religious organization. Others, like Jeff Wood from Texas, said he wasn’t able to buy a ticket to the Capital One event before it sold out. But since he had already planned to come to Washington, he decided to still come. 'Might as well come see what’s happening,' he said. Not everyone on the National Mall was a Trump supporter. One man staged a small protest in defense of transgender rights. Civil rights groups say they view Trump’s agenda as a threat to transgender rights. Trump on Monday plans to sign an executive order declaring that the U.S. government will recognize only two sexes, male and female, as well as orders rolling back protections for transgender people and diversity, equality and inclusion programs within the federal government, according to an official in his new administration. A trio of Norwegian tourists said it was a coincidence that they were in Washington on Inauguration Day. 'It’s very interesting,' Lise Johnsen said. And many vendors on the streets of Washington sold Trump merchandise. One of them, Jordan Steckler, said he didn’t support Trump, but that he was selling the merchandise to make money. Other vendors, like Cecelia Garcia, were major Trump supporters. Originally from Mexico but now based in California, Garcia said she drove across the country to sell merchandise on Inauguration Day. Garcia also said she was present during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack at the Capitol, during which Trump supporters tried to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Garcia said she didn’t enter the building but was selling her merchandise outside. 'It was beautiful,' she said. On Monday, with just hours left in his presidency, President Joe Biden pardoned members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack to shield them from potential politically motivated retribution by the new Trump administration. Trump has said repeatedly that he will pardon people who participated in the attack. Some material in this report is from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-supporters-disappointed-they-couldn-t-watch-inauguration-in-person/7943695.html	2025-01-20T12:08:03-08:00	
Death toll rises to 86 from gasoline tanker blast in central Nigeria	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigeria's emergency agency said the death toll from a weekend gasoline tanker explosion in north central Niger state has risen to 86. Explosions that kill dozens who converge on crashed tanker trucks to scoop up spilled fuel have been common for years in Nigeria, and the problem is only becoming worse. The National Emergency Management Agency, or NEMA, said about 50 people sustained burns in Saturday’s tanker explosion in central Nigeria, in addition to those killed. The victims are currently receiving treatment at local hospitals. The 60,000-liter fuel tanker crashed in central Niger State, near Abuja, spilling its contents. Officials said locals rushed to the scene with generators to siphon fuel from the tanker, triggering the explosion. 'A mass burial has been conducted where the people that died at the scene of the incident have been put to rest,' said Manzo Ezekiel, NEMA spokesperson, adding that the injured were taking to various primary and secondary medical facilities. At least three times in recent months, tanker explosions in Nigeria have caused dozens of deaths. A similar incident to Saturday’s killed 170 people in northern Jigawa State in October. In September, another 48 people died trying to scoop up fuel after a tanker collided with a truck full of cattle in Niger state. The problem starts with frequent road accidents involving the tankers. According to Nigeria's Road Safety Corps, there were about 1,500 tanker accidents in 2020. The Petrol Tanker Drivers Association blames the frequency of these crashes on poor road conditions and a lack of enforcement of road safety measures, including speed and load limits. When the tankers crash, locals quickly move in, hoping to take away some fuel before police arrive. 'I'm a tanker driver, I know how it is. The roads are bad,' said Augustine Egbon, chairman of the Petrol Tanker Drivers Association. 'Secondly, my advice to everybody is that as soon as tanker has an accident nobody should go there because sometimes when tanker falls it will take almost two or three hours, it's when people start going there that's where the fire will start.' Nigeria has an aging 5,000-kilometer-long oil pipeline but most of the 50 million liters of gasoline consumed here daily are transported by roads to pumps. Authorities have pledged to address the issue and enforce stricter regulations. The recent surge in gasoline prices — rising fivefold since President Bola Tinubu scrapped fuel subsidies in May 2023 — has driven many to risk their lives to retrieve fuel during accidents. The locals often use or sell the fuel they collect from crash sites.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-rises-to-86-from-gasoline-tanker-blast-in-central-nigeria-/7943640.html	2025-01-20T11:07:08-08:00

Biden commutes sentence for Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier, convicted in killing of FBI agents	WASHINGTON — With just moments left before he leaves office, President Joe Biden commuted the life sentence of Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier, who was convicted in the 1975 killings of two FBI agents. Peltier was denied parole as recently as July and wasn't eligible for parole again until 2026. He was serving life in prison for the deaths of the agents during a standoff on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. He will transition to home confinement, Biden said in a statement. The fight for Peltier's freedom is entangled with the Indigenous rights movements. Nearly half a century later, his name remains a rallying cry. An enrolled member of the Turtle Mountain Band of Chippewa in North Dakota, Peltier was active in the American Indian Movement, which began in the 1960s as a local organization in Minneapolis that grappled with issues of police brutality and discrimination against Native Americans. It quickly became a national force. The movement grabbed headlines in 1973 when it took over the village of Wounded Knee on the Pine Ridge reservation, leading to a 71-day standoff with federal agents. Tensions between the movement and the government remained high for years. On June 26, 1975, agents came to Pine Ridge to serve arrest warrants amid battles over Native treaty rights and self-determination. After being injured in a shootout, agents Jack Coler and Ronald Williams were shot in the head at close range, FBI has said. Also killed in the shootout was American Indian Movement member Joseph Stuntz. Two other movement members, Robert Robideau and Dino Butler, were acquitted of killing Coler and Williams. After fleeing to Canada and being extradited to the United States, Peltier was convicted of two counts of first-degree murder and sentenced in 1977 to life in prison, despite defense claims that evidence against him had been falsified.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-commutes-sentence-for-indigenous-activist-leonard-peltier-convicted-in-killing-of-fbi-agents/7943477.html	2025-01-20T09:14:57-08:00	
Indian court sentences police volunteer to life in prison in rape, killing of trainee doctor	NEW DELHI — An Indian court on Monday sentenced a police volunteer to life in prison after finding him guilty in the rape and killing of a trainee doctor last year, a crime that sparked nationwide protests over inadequate safety for women and led to a speedy trial in the country's slow-moving justice system. Sanjay Roy, 33, who has consistently maintained his innocence, can appeal the judgment in a higher court. The killing of the 31-year-old physician while she was on duty at a hospital in the eastern city of Kolkata highlighted the chronic issue of violence against women in the country. Police discovered the woman's bloodied body at the R.G. Kar Medical College and Hospital's seminar hall last Aug. 9. An autopsy found she had been strangled and sexually assaulted. Federal police, who investigated the case, said the crime deserved the death penalty. Parents of the victim had also sought the death penalty for Roy and said they suspected more people were involved in the crime. The case was initially investigated by Kolkata police but later the court handed over the probe to federal investigators after state government officers were accused of mishandling the investigation. After the assault, doctors and medical students across India held protests and rallies demanding better security. Thousands of women also protested in the streets demanding swift justice for the victim. Roy was arrested a day after the crime, and arguments in the case began in November. The assault prompted India's Supreme Court to set up a national task force to suggest ways to enhance safety in government hospitals. Many crimes against women go unreported in India due to the stigma surrounding sexual violence, as well as a lack of faith in the police. Women's rights activists say the problem is particularly acute in rural areas, where communities sometimes shame victims of sexual assault and families worry about their social standing. In 2012, the gang rape and killing of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus galvanized massive protests across India. It inspired lawmakers to order harsher penalties for such crimes, as well as the creation of fast-track courts dedicated to rape cases. The government also introduced the death penalty for repeat offenders. Four men sentenced to death for the 2012 crime were hanged in 2020. The rape law amended in 2013 also criminalized stalking and voyeurism and lowered the age at which a person can be tried as an adult from 18 to 16. Activists say new sentencing requirements haven't deterred rapes and the number of recorded rape cases has increased. In 2022, police recorded 31,516 reports of rape — a 20% jump from 2021, according to the National Crime Records Bureau.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-court-sentences-police-volunteer-to-life-in-prison-in-rape-killing-of-trainee-doctor/7943385.html	2025-01-20T08:38:45-08:00	
Trump seeks return of US military equipment from Afghan Taliban	Ayaz Gul — President-elect Donald Trump says that future financial assistance to Afghanistan will be contingent upon the return of U.S. military equipment by the Taliban leaders currently in power. Trump’s remarks at a Sunday rally in Washington on the eve of his January 20 inauguration have heightened uncertainty regarding his administration’s stance on the crisis-hit South Asian nation. 'They [Biden administration] gave billions of billions of dollars to the Taliban. They gave our military equipment, a big chunk of it, to the enemy,' Trump said. He referred to the tumultuous and hasty withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan in August 2021, ordered by President Joe Biden. 'If we’re going to pay billions of dollars a year, tell them we’re not going to give them the money unless they give back our military equipment. ... So, we will give them a couple of bucks; we want the military equipment back,' Trump stated without elaborating. A report issued by the U.S. Department of Defense in 2022 revealed that approximately $7 billion worth of military equipment was left behind in Afghanistan following the completion of the military withdrawal. The equipment in question, which included aircraft, air-to-ground munitions, military vehicles, weapons, communications equipment, and other materials, was subsequently seized by the Taliban. The de facto Afghan rulers have since repeatedly displayed the U.S. military gear in their so-called victory day celebrations over the past three years. The foreign troop exit stemmed from the February 2020 Doha Agreement that the first Trump administration negotiated with the then-insurgent Taliban. Biden completed and defended the military withdrawal, saying the choice he had was either to follow through on that agreement or be prepared to go back to fighting the Taliban. Following the withdrawal, the Biden administration largely isolated the Taliban and imposed new sanctions on the group. Washington, however, has continued to be the largest donor to Afghanistan, a country that the United Nations says is suffering through one of the severest humanitarian crises in the world. U.S. officials have also engaged in diplomatic efforts with the Taliban to negotiate the release of certain U.S. detainees and assisted in relocating Afghan allies who had helped American forces. US gives cash for humanitarian aid The billions of dollars that Trump repeatedly has referred to are likely the cash shipments being channeled through the U.N. and non-governmental organizations to support humanitarian programs in Afghanistan. Washington remains the primary donor and has spent approximately $3 billion in humanitarian aid since the U.S. withdrawal. Thomas Ruttig from the independent Afghanistan Analysts Network warned of challenges for the Taliban under the Trump administration. He noted that some members of Congress and incoming administration officials took part in the 20-year U.S. mission in Afghanistan and have been highly critical of the Taliban. Despite this, he stated that countering regional terrorism is a significant concern in Washington, and it could potentially encourage the Trump administration to seek cooperation with the Taliban to combat terrorist organizations, including the Afghanistan-based affiliate of the Islamic State terrorist organization known as IS-Khorasan. Ruttig said that Tim Burchett, Republican vice chair of the U.S. Congress’s Foreign Affairs Committee, recently introduced a bill, the 'No Tax Dollars for Terrorists Act,' to ensure that U.S. tax money does not end up in the hands of the Taliban. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan denies that cash shipments for humanitarian programs are financing the Taliban. The mission says the current setup – in which cash is physically brought to Afghanistan and placed in designated U.N. accounts in a private bank – is in place because of a ban on international banking transfers and ongoing liquidity issues. 'All these funds are then distributed directly to the United Nations entities, as well as to a small number of approved and vetted humanitarian partners in Afghanistan,' according to the mission. Taliban leaders have rejected Trump’s assertions that their government received U.S. financial aid, stating that they do not expect or seek any assistance from Washington. 'Instead, it (U.S.) has confiscated and frozen billions of dollars that rightfully belong to the people of Afghanistan,' said a Taliban statement in response to Trump’s remarks earlier this month. Ruttig warns that punitive measures and sanctions to pressure the Taliban into submission might also provoke them to stop cooperation with international stakeholders. 'Today, the US-Taliban Doha Agreement is still considered valid and obliges the Taliban to restrict ISKP and other groups from using their shelter in Afghanistan to commit terrorist acts in the West. This could be jeopardized by new quasi-sanctions on them,' he said in written comments. Taliban hopes for better relations Masuda Sultan, an Afghan American advocate for women’s rights, is doubtful the new Trump administration will substantially change its stance on the Taliban. Instead, she expects the U.S. will cut aid contributions to U.N.-funded programs like the World Food Program that have supported the country’s most vulnerable. At the same time, Taliban leaders appear publicly optimistic about a favorable shift in U.S. policy under the Trump presidency, attributing this to their Doha pact with his previous Trump administration. Kabul promptly welcomed Trump’s election victory just one day after he was declared the winner of the United States presidential vote. The Taliban foreign ministry issued a formal statement expressing its hope that 'the incoming U.S. administration will adopt a pragmatic approach to ensure tangible advancement in bilateral relations, allowing both nations to open a new chapter of relations grounded in mutual engagement.' Earlier this month, Taliban Deputy Foreign Minister Sher Mohammad Abbas Stanikzai commended Trump as a 'decisive' and 'courageous' leader. Stanikzai suggested that Trump reconsider Biden’s policy and adopt a new approach. 'We want to build good relations with the international community and the Western countries,' Stanikzai said in televised remarks in local language. 'An enemy doesn’t remain an enemy forever, and a friend doesn’t remain a friend forever either,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-seeks-return-of-us-military-equipment-from-afghan-taliban-/7943249.html	2025-01-20T06:40:59-08:00	
Biden pardons Fauci and Milley in effort to guard against potential 'revenge' by Trump	Washington — President Joe Biden has pardoned Dr. Anthony Fauci, retired Gen. Mark Milley and members of the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, using the extraordinary powers of his office in his final hours to guard against potential 'revenge' by the incoming Trump administration. The decision by Biden comes after Donald Trump warned of an enemies list filled with those who have crossed him politically or sought to hold him accountable for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss and his role in the storming of the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Trump has selected Cabinet nominees who backed his election lies and who have pledged to punish those involved in efforts to investigate him. 'The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,' Biden said in a statement. 'Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.' It's customary for a president to grant clemency at the end of his term, but those acts of mercy are usually offered to everyday Americans who have been convicted of crimes. But Biden has used the power in the broadest and most untested way possible: to pardon those who have not even been investigated yet. And with the acceptance comes a tacit admission of guilt or wrongdoing, even though those who have been pardoned have not been formally accused of any crimes. 'These are exceptional circumstances, and I cannot in good conscience do nothing,' Biden said, adding that 'Even when individuals have done nothing wrong — and in fact have done the right thing — and will ultimately be exonerated, the mere fact of being investigated or prosecuted can irreparably damage reputations and finances.' Fauci was director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health for nearly 40 years and was Biden's chief medical adviser until his retirement in 2022. He helped coordinate the nation's response to the COVID-19 pandemic and raised the ire of Trump during that time. He has become a target of intense hatred and vitriol from people on the right, who blame him for mask mandates and other policies they believe infringed on their rights, even as tens of thousands of Americans were dying. Mark Milley is the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and called Trump a fascist and detailed Trump's conduct around the deadly Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. Biden is also extending pardons to members and staff of the Jan. 6 committee, including former Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, both Republicans, as well as the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the committee. Biden, an institutionalist, has promised a smooth transition to the next administration, inviting Trump to the White House and saying that the nation will be OK, even as he warned during his farewell address of a growing oligarchy. He has spent years warning that Trump's ascension to the presidency again would be a threat to democracy. His decision to break with political norms with the preemptive pardons was brought on by those concerns. Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued; he announced on Friday he would commuting the sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. He previously announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment just weeks before Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment, takes office. In his first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented spate of executions, 13, in a protracted timeline during the coronavirus pandemic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-pardons-fauci-and-milley-in-an-effort-to-guard-against-potential-revenge-by-trump/7943096.html	2025-01-20T04:48:39-08:00	
Israel-Hamas ceasefire in place with first group of hostages, prisoners freed	A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was holding Monday, with the two sides in the early stages of a six-week pause in fighting that could lead to an end to the war that began in October 2023. So far three of the 99 hostages held by Hamas militants in Gaza have been released, with 30 others set to be freed in the first stage of the agreement. Israel also has set free 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, all of them women and teenagers, according to Hamas, with hundreds more to follow. The United Nations has surged badly needed food aid to Gaza and says it plans to bring in 150 trucks of food every day to help Palestinian civilians who have seen their lives upended by the fighting. More than 1.8 million people are in need of emergency shelter in Gaza, according to the U.N., which also estimated in a report last year that it could take until 2040 to rebuild the territory’s destroyed housing. The ceasefire began around midday Sunday, and hours later a Red Cross convoy brought hostages Romi Gonen, Emily Damari and Doron Steinbrecher safely back to Israel. Early Monday, Israel freed the 90 Palestinian prisoners and detainees, with large buses taking them from Israel’s Ofer prison just outside the West Bank city of Ramallah. Palestinians crowded the buses, chanting and cheering, as celebratory fireworks burst overhead. The ceasefire came after months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar. The talks intensified during the past few weeks, with teams from both the outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump pushing for a deal before Trump’s Monday inauguration. The Palestinian death toll from Israel’s counteroffensive after the October 2023 attack has reached more than 46,900, with most of them women and children, although the Israeli military contends, without providing evidence, that it has killed 17,000 militants. In addition to the people being released and aid going into Gaza, the agreement also calls for Israeli troops to pull back into a buffer zone inside of Gaza and for many displaced Palestinians to be able to return home. Top Israeli officials support the ceasefire, but not all of them. Israel's hard-line national security minister said his Jewish Power faction was quitting the government in protest over the ceasefire agreement. Itamar Ben-Gvir's departure weakens Netanyahu's coalition but will not affect the truce. Negotiations on the far more difficult second phase of this ceasefire should begin in just over two weeks. Major questions remain, including whether the war will resume after the first phase and how the rest of the hostages in Gaza will be freed. VOA U.N. correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-hamas-ceasefire-in-place-with-first-group-of-hostages-prisoners-freed/7943036.html	2025-01-20T02:55:30-08:00	
Australian government pledges $1.24 billion in green aluminum push	SYDNEY — Australia's Labor government on Monday pledged $1.24 billion in production credits to help support the country's four aluminum smelters switch to renewable power before 2036. Aluminum is one of the most polluting nonferrous metals to make, as its current production is mostly powered by coal. Green aluminum usually refers to metal produced using solar, wind or hydropower. The country's four aluminum smelters are run by Rio Tinto and Alcoa. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, in his latest election pitch, said the smelters would receive government support for each metric ton of low-carbon aluminum they produce. His center-left government has made renewable energy a major theme ahead of a national election, which must be called by May. The Australian government is targeting 82% of power supply to come from renewables by 2030, but remains well short of the target, at 40% now, even after pledging to underwrite new wind, solar and battery projects with more than $24.5 billion. 'We want Australian workers to make more things here,' Albanese said in a statement. 'We've got all the ingredients right here for a world-leading metals industry - from the best solar and wind resources, to the critical minerals and facilities, as well as a highly skilled workforce.' The Australian Aluminum Council said it had been seeking production credits for the aluminum sector, the sixth-largest producer of the metal in the world, to attract private capital and ensure the industry remains globally competitive amid rising costs and longer regulatory processes. 'These new aluminum production credits should provide some of the transitional support needed as Australia's energy infrastructure and systems develop, and energy pricing returns to competitive levels,' Council CEO Marghanita Johnson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-government-pledges-1-24-billion-in-green-aluminum-push/7943007.html	2025-01-20T02:06:15-08:00	
South African police launch manhunt for gang leader of illegal mine	JOHANNESBURG — South African police have launched a manhunt for a Lesotho gang member believed to have controlled operations at an illegal gold mine where 78 bodies were recovered last week during a police siege, from which he escaped. The alleged kingpin, known as 'Tiger,' surfaced from the mine in Stilfontein while it was under police surveillance and escaped from custody with the help of officials, a statement on Monday from the South African Police Service said. 'Extensive investigations and tracing operations are underway to find those officials who aided his escape between shaft 11 and the Stilfontein police holding cells,' the statement said. Police were widely condemned for the months-long operation in which they cut off food and water supplies to the miners in an attempt to force them out of the mine to face arrest. The stand-off culminated in a state-sponsored rescue operation last week in which 246 survivors were retrieved from the deep mine, many of whom were emaciated and weak from hunger. But police claim the gang leaders were to blame for the deaths, citing reports from some miners who said there was food underground but the kingpins kept it for themselves. Thousands of people are believed to be involved in illegal gold mining in abandoned industrial mines in South Africa in search of leftover gold. Some of the workers spend months at a time underground. The lucrative industry is known to be run by Lesotho-based gangs, and police say some of the workers are illegal immigrants recruited from neighboring countries without knowledge of what they have come to do. Tiger was named in statements by miners as a ring leader who ran operations, the police statement said. 'He is also being accused by some illegal miners... (as) being allegedly responsible for some deaths, assault and torture that is alleged to have taken place according to videos in police possession. He is also alleged to have hoarded and kept food away from other illegal miners,' it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-african-police-launch-manhunt-for-gang-leader-of-illegal-mine/7943004.html	2025-01-20T01:49:17-08:00	
China unveils plan to build 'strong education nation' by 2035	BEIJING — China issued its first national action plan to build a 'strong education nation' by 2035, which it said would help coordinate its education development, improve efficiencies in innovation and build a 'strong country.' The plan, issued Sunday by the Communist Party's central committee and the State Council, aims to establish a 'high quality education system' with accessibility and quality 'among the best in the world.' The announcement was made after data on Friday showed China's population fell for a third consecutive year in 2024, with the number of deaths outpacing a slight increase in births, and experts cautioning that the downturn will worsen in the coming years. High childcare and education costs have been a key factor for many young Chinese opting out of having children, at a time when many face uncertainty over their job prospects amid sluggish economic growth. 'By 2035, an education power will be built,' the official Xinhua news agency said, adding that China would explore gradually expanding the scope of free education, increase 'high-quality' undergraduate enrolment, expand postgraduate education, and raise the proportion of doctoral students. The plan aims to promote 'healthy growth and all-round development of students,' making sure primary and secondary school students have at least two hours of physical activity daily, to effectively control the myopia, or nearsightedness, and obesity rates. 'Popularizing' mental health education and establishing a national student mental health monitoring and early warning system would also be implemented, it said. It also aims to narrow the gap between urban and rural areas to improve the operating conditions of small-scale rural schools and improve the care system for children with disabilities and those belonging to agricultural migrant populations. The plan also aims to steadily increase the supply of kindergarten places and the accessibility of preschool education.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-unveils-plan-to-build-strong-education-nation-by-2035/7942986.html	2025-01-20T00:28:43-08:00	
India's 'digital arrest' scammers stealing savings of citizens	Bengaluru, India — Within five hours, while sitting at home in India, retired professor Kamta Prasad Singh handed over his hard-earned savings to online fraudsters impersonating police. The cybercrime known as 'digital arrest' — where fraudsters pose online as law enforcement officials and order people to transfer huge amounts of money — has become so rampant that Prime Minister Narendra Modi has issued warnings. Singh told AFP that money was his life savings. 'Over the years, I have skipped having tea outside, walked to avoid spending on public transport,' the 62-year-old said, his voice breaking. 'Only I know, how I saved my money.' Police say scammers have exploited the vast gap between the breakneck speed of India's data digitalization, from personal details to online banking, and the lagging awareness of many of basic internet safety. Fraudsters are using technology for data breaches, targeting information their victims believe is only available to government authorities, and making otherwise unlikely demands appear credible. Indians have emptied their bank accounts 'out of sheer fear,' Modi said in an October radio broadcast, adding fraudsters 'create so much psychological pressure on the victim.' 'Ruined' Mobile phones, and especially video calling, have allowed fraudsters to reach straight into people's homes. India runs the world's largest biometric digital identity program — called 'Aadhaar,' or foundation in Hindi — a unique card issued to India's more than one billion people, and increasingly required for financial transactions. Scammers often claim they are police investigating questionable payments, quoting their target's Aadhaar number to appear genuine. They then request their victim make a 'temporary' bank transfer to validate their accounts, before stealing the cash. Singh, from India's eastern state of Bihar, said the web of lies began when he received a call in December, seemingly from the telecom regulatory authority. 'They said... police were on their way to arrest me,' Singh said. The fraudsters told Singh that his Aadhaar ID was being misused for illegal payments. Terrified, Singh agreed to prove he had control of his bank account, and after spiraling threats, transferred over $16,100. 'I have lost sleep; don't feel like eating,' he said. 'I have been ruined.' 'Rot in proverbial hell' The surge of online scams is worrying because of 'how valid they make it look and sound,' said police officer Sushil Kumar, who handled cybercrimes for half a decade. The perpetrators range from school dropouts to highly educated individuals. 'They know what to search for on the internet to find out basic details of how government agencies work,' Kumar added. India registered 17,470 cybercrimes in 2022, including 6,491 cases of online bank fraud, according to the latest government data. Tricks vary. Kaveri, 71, told AFP her story, on condition her name was changed. She said fraudsters posed as officials from the U.S. courier FedEx, claiming she had sent a package containing drugs, passports and credit cards. They offered her full name and Aadhaar ID details as 'proof,' followed by well-forged letters from the Central Bank of India and Central Bureau of Investigation, the country's top investigative agency. 'They wanted me to send money, which would be returned in 30 minutes,' she said, adding she was convinced when they sent a 'properly signed letter.' She transferred savings from a house sale, totaling around $120,000, in four instalments over six days, before the fraudsters vanished. Kaveri says those days felt 'like a tunnel.' Meeta, 35, a private health professional from Bengaluru, who also did not want to be identified, was conned by fake police via a video call. 'It seemed like a proper police station, with walkie-talkie noises,' she said. The scammers told her to prove she controlled her bank account by taking out a loan of 200,000 rupees, or $2,300, via her bank's phone app, before demanding she make a 'temporary' transfer. Despite making it clear to the bank that she had been scammed, Meeta continues to be asked to pay back the loan. 'My trust in banks has mostly gone,' she said, before cursing the thieves. 'I hope they rot in proverbial hell.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-digital-arrest-scammers-stealing-savings-of-citizens/7942984.html	2025-01-20T00:21:03-08:00	
Civil rights leaders, King family issue call to action as inauguration falls on MLK Day	WASHINGTON — When President-elect Donald Trump is sworn in as president of the United States inside the Capitol's rotunda, he will do so facing a bust of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. on the federal holiday commemorating King's legacy. It's a disquieting contrast for some civil rights advocates who wish to fulfill the late reverend's dream of non-violent social revolution. Events honoring King and advocating for his vision of a just society will occur across the nation as many in the U.S. observe the peaceful transfer of power in the capital. The concurrent events have been met with mixed feelings by civil rights leaders, who broadly reviled Trump's rhetoric and stances on race and civil rights during his third presidential campaign. But many leaders, including King's own family, see the juxtaposition as a poignant contrast and a chance to refocus the work of advancing civil rights in a new political era. 'I'm glad it occurred on that day because it gives the United States of America and the world the contrast in pictures. Is this the way you want to go — or is this the way you want to go?' said the Rev. Bernice King, the late King's youngest daughter and CEO of the King Center. 'It's not a day that he can be the star, which he loves to be,' King's daughter said of Trump. 'He has to contend with that legacy on that day, regardless of how he manages it and handles it in his presentation. I hope those around him are advising him well to honor the day appropriately in his speech.' This is the third time in the nearly 40 years since the federal King holiday became law that it coincides with a presidential inauguration. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama also were sworn in for their second terms on the holiday. Both praised King in their remarks; it is yet to be seen if and how Trump — who falsely claimed his first inauguration had larger crowds than King's March on Washington — will acknowledge the day. 'Will he sound a message of unity and a presidency for all, or will he continue to focus on his base and some of the divisive policies he's championed, like an anti-DEI stance, rounding up immigrants and cutting important parts of the social safety net through this DOGE (Department of Government Efficiency) process?' asked Marc Morial, president of the National Urban League civil rights group. Morial added that Trump's inauguration landing on MLK Day represented 'a contradiction of values.' Many civil rights leaders will spend the day commemorating King's legacy after a week of public and private organizing, giving speeches and strategizing how to respond to the incoming administration's agenda. 'It's the best of times and the worst of times,' said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, an organization whose members mentored, collaborated and clashed with King throughout the Civil Rights Movement. 'Our mission doesn't change. Our job is to make democracy work for all, to make sure that equal protection is ensured under the law,' Johnson said. He added that the group 'doesn't want to assume' the Trump administration can't be a partner on advancing civil rights or racial justice. On Wednesday, Johnson and other civil rights leaders met with Congressional Black Caucus members on Capitol Hill to discuss how to work with and to oppose the Trump administration. That same day, the National Action Network, a civil rights group founded by the Rev. Al Sharpton, hosted a breakfast at which Vice President Kamala Harris urged attendees to stay motivated. 'Ours is a journey,' she said. 'Whatever the outcome of any particular moment, we can never be defeated. Our spirit can never be defeated, because when that happens, we won't win.' Martin Luther King III, the late King's eldest son, prayed with Harris on stage. King had campaigned for Harris in the fall and called her an advocate who 'speaks to our better angels' and 'embodies Dr. King's legacy.' Many racial justice advocates are set to organize demonstrations, vigils and community service events to mark the holiday and prepare for what they consider an adversarial administration. Some groups are reflecting on parallels and differences with how King organized in the face of explicitly white supremacist state and local governments and geopolitical tumult. 'The hostility is similar, particularly in that there is a mobilized, active and aggressive extremist-right hell bent on unraveling rights and any sense of shared purpose, shared problems or shared solutions,' said Maya Wiley, CEO of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. What differs, Wiley said, is the understanding 'there has to be opportunity for everyone.' King himself worried the legal protections he dedicated his life to realizing would not be followed by greater anti-discrimination efforts or social programs. He proposed it would take white Americans embracing a deeper kinship with Black Americans and engaging in economic and social solidarity to see change. A year before his 1968 assassination, King wrote in his final book that giving a Black person their 'due' often required 'special treatment.' 'I am aware of the fact that this has been a troublesome concept for many liberals, since it conflicts with their traditional ideal of equal opportunity and equal treatment of people according to their individual merits,' King wrote in the 1967 book, 'Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community.' 'But this is a day which demands new thinking and the reevaluation of old concepts.' King's advocacy for 'new concepts' found an heir in the enactment of affirmative action policies in workplaces and schools. Many advocates of diversity, equity and inclusion policies see such programs as realizing his vision, though that argument has come under withering scrutiny from conservative activists. Trump's views on race have been criticized for decades. The federal government sued Trump for allegedly discriminating against Black apartment seekers in the 1970s. He was instrumental in promoting the 'birther' conspiracy theory that Obama was not born in the U.S. And his campaign rhetoric about immigrants and urban communities since 2015 up to November's election has been derided as prejudiced. As president, Trump enacted some criminal justice reform laws that civil rights advocates praised but then proposed harsh crackdowns on 2020 racial reckoning protests. In April, Trump did not dispute the notion that 'anti-white racism' now represents a greater problem in the U.S. than systemic racism against Black Americans. 'I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country and that can't be allowed either,' Trump said during an interview with Time magazine. Janiyah Thomas, a spokesperson for the Trump transition, said Trump's inauguration would be 'monumental, turning a new leaf and ushering in the golden age of America' and said Americans should remember 'wise words' from King: 'We must learn to live together as brothers or perish together as fools.' At the end of his life, King reflected on the early backlash to civil rights, especially with integrated housing developments, interracial marriage and necessary economic and social programs. He expressed frustration with then-President Lyndon B. Johnson for prolonging the Vietnam War rather than making a greater investment in anti-poverty efforts. 'This is where the civil rights movement stands today. We will err and falter as we climb the unfamiliar slopes of steep mountains, but there is no alternative, well-trod, level path,' King wrote. 'There will be agonizing setbacks along with creative advances. Our consolation is that no one can know the true taste of victory if he has never swallowed defeat.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/civil-rights-leaders-king-family-issue-call-to-action-as-inauguration-falls-on-mlk-day-/7942973.html	2025-01-19T23:50:22-08:00	
Ukraine reports downing 93 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 93 of the 141 drones that Russian forces launched overnight in attacks targeting regions across the country. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy and Vinnytsia regions, Ukraine’s air force said. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that Russian attacks, which also included artillery and missiles, damaged four high-rise buildings. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it destroyed more than 30 Ukrainian aerial drones late Sunday and early Monday. Kaluga Governor Vladislav Shapsha said on Telegram that falling debris from a destroyed drone sparked a fire at a business that was quickly extinguished. In Belgorod, Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said a drone attack hit a car, injuring a woman. The Ukrainian assault also damaged six houses, Gladkov said. Russian air defense also shot down drones over the Bryansk, Kursk, Ryazan, Oryol and Tatarstan regions. Some information for this report was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-reports-downing-93-russian-drones/7942969.html	2025-01-19T23:37:16-08:00	
Donald Trump set to assume US presidency again	Donald Trump returns to the U.S. presidency Monday with an inauguration ceremony in Washington that will make him the first president to serve non-consecutive terms since the 1890s. Millions of Americans are expected to watch on television as the 78-year-old Trump takes the oath of office for a new four-year term in the White House while President Joe Biden, 82, leaves the presidency after a single term. The inauguration ceremony will be a scaled-down event due to frigid weather, with about 600 people witnessing the change of power inside the Capitol instead of the typical outdoor event where 250,000 people had secured tickets. The traditional inaugural parade along Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House has also been canceled because of the weather, with bands, marching units, drill teams and the like now parading past Trump, his wife, Melania Trump and other officials in his new administration at the nearby 20,000-seat Capital One Arena. Lavish black-tie balls are still planned for Monday evening. Trump pledged late Sunday to 'act with historic speed and strength and fix every single crisis facing our country,' as he spoke to supporters in Washington. 'Tomorrow at noon, the curtain closes on four long years of American decline, and we begin a brand new day of American strength and prosperity,' Trump said. He has pledged to sign a flurry of executive orders upon entering office, including those undoing Biden administration policies. Prominent among his pledges during the election campaign was carrying out mass deportations of people who are in the country illegally. Trump has also vowed to quickly impose heightened tariffs on key trading partners, including Canada, China and Mexico. The incoming president says he plans to pardon many of the 1,500 supporters of his who stormed the Capitol building on Jan. 6, 2021, to try to block Congress from certifying that Biden won the 2020 election. Trump has called those arrested and convicted 'patriots' and 'hostages' wrongly prosecuted. Charges that Trump, a Republican, tried to illegally overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden were dropped when he defeated his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election because of a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. Trump will become the first felon to serve as U.S. president, after his conviction last year on 34 criminal charges linked to falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to porn film star Stormy Daniels, although a judge declined to penalize him in any way. Trump vowed for months to end Russia’s war on Ukraine before he takes office, but in recent days his aides have said the goal now is to try to reach a truce in the fighting in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be around the end of April. He also wants more oil drilling in the U.S. even though in 2023, U.S. energy production exceeded consumption by a record amount, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Two transgender issues have also drawn Trump’s attention. Trump has repeatedly referred to transgender women as men, telling his supporters that he will ensure transgender women cannot compete in women’s sports. 'I will keep men out of women’s sports, 100%, immediately, first day,' Trump told one political rally during the campaign. He also frequently has assailed gender-affirming care, which can include hormone therapy. 'On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on so-called ‘gender affirming care.’' Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse	https://www.voanews.com/a/donald-trump-set-to-assume-us-presidency-again/7942954.html	2025-01-19T22:28:13-08:00	
Taiwan's premier says opposition's budget cuts would cripple key government functions	TEIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan's premier said on Monday the government faced a crisis in day-to-day operations, including national security, because of large cuts to this year's budget proposed by opposition parties, who have cited a need to cut waste. Although Lai Ching-te won the presidential election last year, his Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) lost its majority in parliament, giving the opposition the most seats and legislative control that includes spending proposals. The main opposition party, the Kuomintang (KMT), together with the small Taiwan People's Party, has proposed a record $6.55 billion in cuts to the budget, about 7% of the total, saying they are targeting waste. The opposition has also proposed freezing another $8.25 billion in spending, a number the cabinet said was 20 times higher than the past average, urging calm and rationality. Speaking to reporters ahead of voting on the budget in parliament on Monday and Tuesday, Premier Cho Jung-tai called it an unprecedented 'budget storm' that would hurt government functions from national security to health care. 'Please withdraw all proposals that would paralyze the government and impact national security,' Cho said. 'It will lead to administrative departments finding it hard to operate, and even basic tasks will be hard to carry out.' 'Hostile China will be very pleased,' Cho added, pointing to cuts to security units, including the digital ministry, which tackles an average of 2.4 million cyber attacks a day, most of which Taiwan says are launched by Chinese cyber forces. Over the weekend, the defense ministry urged the opposition to rethink a 15% cut to its overseas travel budget, which it said will deal a 'very bad impact' to the military's engagements with allies. The opposition has proposed cutting the budgets of some departments, including the China-policy making Mainland Affairs Council, to less than $1. On Saturday, the KMT said that the DPP was trying to protect a 'fat cat budget' filled with waste and that the cuts remained in the proposal stage, accusing the ruling party of rumor mongering and trying to spread fear. 'The budget cut proposals we have seen so far are all in the state of not yet being finalized, but the DPP is so nervous that they are shouting harder than anyone else to protect the green fat cat budget,' it said, referring to the DPP's party color.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-premier-says-opposition-s-budget-cuts-would-cripple-key-government-functions/7942946.html	2025-01-19T21:44:50-08:00	
South Korea braces for Trump's policies with biggest-ever export finance support	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea pledged on Monday a record amount of financing support for exporters to mitigate any negative impact from changes in U.S. trade policies as Donald Trump was poised to be sworn in for his second presidency. The government plans to provide 360 trillion won, or $247.74 billion, worth of policy financing to exporting companies through state-run banks and institutions this year, according to a statement released by the finance ministry. 'There are concerns that external uncertainty will be heightened under the incoming U.S. administration and adversely affect exports,' the ministry said. The ministry said it would also boost insurance support to guard against foreign exchange volatility to $966 million this year, from $827 million last year, and spending on government projects, such as trade fairs and delegations, to $2 billion from $1.45 billion. Sectors particularly under threat of new U.S. policies are semiconductors and rechargeable batteries, the ministry said, whereas defense, nuclear energy and shipbuilding sectors are seen as more promising because of room for cooperation with the United States. U.S. President-elect Trump, who takes office later on Monday, has pledged to impose stiff tariffs on major trading partners, such as Mexico, Canada and China, which are also expected to affect South Korean companies running factories in those countries. Economists say there are worries that the Trump administration will introduce trade policies against South Korea too, after Asia's fourth-largest economy earned a record-high surplus of $55.7 billion in trade with the U.S. in 2024, up 25.4% from 2023. The Korea International Trade Association, South Korea's biggest group of exporting companies, projects export growth to slow to 1.8% this year. Last year, South Korea's exports rose 8.1% to a record high of $683.7 billion, as sales to the U.S. rose 10.4%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-braces-for-trump-s-policies-with-biggest-ever-export-finance-support/7942944.html	2025-01-19T21:17:15-08:00	
The state of the economy: What is Donald Trump inheriting?	Voters prioritized the economy in the 2024 election, sending Donald Trump back to the White House. But what economic legacy is Joe Biden passing on to the new administration? 'It's the economy, stupid.' Coined by political strategist James Carville, these famous words have become synonymous with U.S. election success since 1992. Despite the growing influence of issues like immigration, climate change and foreign policy, many voters still prioritize economic factors when casting their ballots. President-elect Donald Trump claimed he made 'the greatest economy in U.S. history' during his first term and vows to do so again in 2025. But a lot depends on what a president inherits from his predecessors. Low unemployment rates and a soaring stock market built under former President Barack Obama’s administration following the 2008 financial crisis gave Trump a strong foundation the first time around. So, what economic legacy will Trump inherit from Biden? Simply put, high employment rates, strong GDP growth and low inflation often characterize a healthy economy. The country was still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic when Biden was sworn in, but the last four years have proven resilient. Biden’s administration created almost 16 million new jobs in America — a key sign of positive economic growth. That good news was overshadowed for many Americans by inflation, which reached a 40-year high in 2022, with prices increasing by 9.1%. That impacted people’s purchasing power and made everyday items feel expensive. Annual inflation has now eased to around 3% but is still higher than the Federal Reserve’s 2% target, and prices for many items remain significantly higher than at the end of Trump’s first term. While real wages have since increased in America, workers may still feel the strain of stubbornly high grocery prices. This was a global issue linked to supply chain challenges and Russia’s war with Ukraine, and ordinary people paid the price. But massive deficit spending under Biden to head off the threat of a major recession also contributed. Biden has preferred to emphasize the promising picture of the jobs market he’s passing on, noting that the United States recorded its lowest unemployment rate in more than half a century during his term. About 2.7 million jobs were lost during Trump’s first term, partially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. So, he’ll face pressure to turn that legacy around. But Trump has already suggested mass layoffs across federal departments during his second term, which could increase unemployment rates if implemented. Another broad signal of a healthy economy is the increased value of goods and services, or GDP, which shows whether an economy is growing. The United States has long had the largest GDP in the world, surpassing nations such as India and China. GDP rose 7.6% during Trump’s first administration and increased by 11.8% under Biden, suggesting a strong post-pandemic recovery. Generally speaking, Biden's economic legacy is one of high employment, recovering GDP and declining inflation. But no president ever inherits a clean slate. The federal debt stands at $36.1 trillion, and public opinion about the economy is, at best, lukewarm. Some financial experts predict inflation may continue declining in 2025, but a broader context of geopolitical tensions, trade wars and climate change may also shape America’s financial future. Trump's task will be to sustain economic momentum while navigating the complexities of a rapidly evolving world.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-state-of-the-economy-what-is-donald-trump-inheriting-/7942933.html	2025-01-19T20:12:45-08:00	
How TikTok grew from a fun app for teens into a potential national security threat	SAN FRANCISCO — If it feels like TikTok has been around forever, that's probably because it has, at least if you're measuring via internet time. What's now in question is whether it will be around much longer and, if so, in what form? Starting in 2017, when the Chinese social video app merged with its competitor Musical.ly, TikTok has grown from a niche teen app into a global trendsetter. While, of course, also emerging as a potential national security threat, according to U.S. officials. On April 24, President Joe Biden signed legislation requiring TikTok parent ByteDance to sell to a U.S. owner within a year or to shut down. TikTok and its China-based parent company, ByteDance, filed a lawsuit against the U.S., claiming the security concerns were overblown and the law should be struck down because it violates the First Amendment. The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok, and the popular short form video service went dark in the U.S. — just hours before the ban was set to begin. Here's how TikTok came to this juncture: March 2012 ByteDance is founded in China by entrepreneur Zhang Yimin. Its first hit product is Toutiao, a personalized news aggregator for Chinese users. July 2014 Startup Musical.ly, later known for an eponymous app used to post short lipsyncing music videos, is founded in China by entrepreneur Alex Zhu. July 2015 Musical.ly hits #1 in the Apple App Store, following a design change that made the company's logo visible when users shared their videos. 2016 ByteDance launches Douyin, a video sharing app for Chinese users. Its popularity inspires the company to spin off a version for foreign audiences called TikTok. November 2017 ByteDance acquires Musical.ly for $1 billion. Nine months later, ByteDance merges it with TikTok. Powered by an algorithm that encourages binge-watching, users begin to share a wide variety of video on the app, including dance moves, kitchen food preparation and various 'challenges' to perform, record and post acts that range from serious to satirical. February 2019 Rapper Lil Nas X releases the country-trap song 'Old Town Road' on TikTok, where it goes viral and pushes the song to a record 17 weeks in the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The phenomenon kicks off a wave of TikTok videos from musical artists who suddenly see TikTok as a critical way to reach fans. TikTok settles federal charges of violating U.S. child-privacy laws and agrees to pay a $5.7 million fine. September 2019 The Washington Post reports that while images of Hong Kong democracy protests and police crackdowns are common on most social media sites, they are strangely absent on TikTok. The same story notes that TikTok posts with the #trump2020 tag received more than 70 million views. The company insists that TikTok content moderation, conducted in the U.S., is not responsible and says the app is a place for entertainment, not politics. The Guardian reports on internal documents that reportedly detail how TikTok instructs its moderators to delete or limit the reach of videos touching on topics sensitive to China such as the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and subsequent massacre, Tibetan independence or the sanctioned religious group Falun Gong. October 2019 U.S. politicians begin to raise alarms about TikTok's influence, calling for a federal investigations of its Musical.ly acquisition and a national security probe into TikTok and other Chinese-owned apps. That investigation begins in November, according to news reports. December 2019 The Pentagon recommends that all U.S. military personnel delete TikTok from all phones, personal and government-issued. Some services ban the app on military-owned phones. In January, the Pentagon bans the app from all military phones. TikTok becomes the second-most downloaded app in the world, according to data from analytics firm SensorTower. May 2020 Privacy groups file a complaint alleging TikTok is still violating U.S. child-protection laws and flouting a 2019 settlement agreement. The company 'takes the issue of safely seriously' and continues to improve safeguards, it says. TikTok hires former Disney executive Kevin Mayer as its chief executive officer in an apparent attempt to improve its U.S. relations. Mayer resigns three months later. July 2020 India bans TikTok and dozens of other Chinese apps in response to a border clash with China. President Donald Trump says he is considering banning TikTok as retaliation for China's alleged mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. August 2020 Trump issues a sweeping but vague executive order banning American companies from any 'transaction' with ByteDance and its subsidiaries, including TikTok. Several days later, he issues a second order demanding that ByteDance divest itself of TikTok's U.S. operations within 90 days. Microsoft confirms it is exploring acquisition of TikTok. The deal never materializes; neither does a similar overture from Oracle and Walmart. TikTok, meanwhile, sues the Trump administration for alleged violation of due process in its executive orders. November 2020 Joe Biden is elected president. He doesn't offer new policy on TikTok and won't take office until January, but Trump's plans to force a sale of TikTok start to unravel anyway. The Trump administration extends the deadlines it had imposed on ByteDance and TikTok and eventually lets them slide altogether. February 2021 Newly sworn-in President Joe Biden postpones the legal cases involving Trump's plan to ban TikTok, effectively bringing them to a halt. September 2021 TikTok announces it has more than a billion monthly active users. December 2021 A Wall Street Journal report finds TikTok algorithms can flood teens with a torrent of harmful material such as videos recommending extreme dieting, a form of eating disorder. February 2022 TikTok announces new rules to deter the spread of harmful material such as viral hoaxes and promotion of eating disorders. April 2022 'The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical,' a project created by two fans of the Netflix show as a TikTok project, wins the Grammy for Best Musical Theater Album. TikTok becomes the most downloaded app in the world, beating out Instagram, according to SensorTower data. June 2022 BuzzFeed reports that China-based ByteDance employees have repeatedly accessed the nonpublic information of TikTok users, based on leaked recordings from more than 80 internal TikTok meetings. TikTok responds with a vague comment touting its commitment to security that doesn't directly address the BuzzFeed report. TikTok also announces it has migrated its user data to U.S. servers managed by the U.S. tech firm Oracle. But that doesn't prevent fresh alarm among U.S. officials about the risk of Chinese authorities accessing U.S. user data. December 2022 FBI Director Christopher Wray raises national security concerns about TikTok, warning that Chinese officials could manipulate the app's recommendation algorithm for influence operations. ByteDance also said it fired four employees who accessed data on journalists from Buzzfeed News and The Financial Times while attempting to track down leaks of confidential materials about the company. February 2023 The White House gives federal agencies 30 days to ensure TikTok is deleted from all government-issued mobile devices. Both the FBI and the Federal Communications Commission warn that ByteDance could share TikTok user data with China's authoritarian government. March 2023 Legislators grill TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew at a six-hour congressional hearing where Chew, a native of Singapore, attempts to push back on assertions that TikTok and ByteDance are tools of the Chinese government. January 2024 TikTok said it was restricting a tool some researchers use to analyze popular videos on the platform. March 2024 A bill to ban TikTok or force its sale to a U.S. company gathers steam in Congress. TikTok brings dozens of its creators to Washington to tell lawmakers to back off, while emphasizing changes the company has made to protect user data. TikTok also annoys legislators by sending notifications to users urging them to 'speak up now' or risk seeing TikTok banned; users then flood congressional offices with calls. The House of Representatives passes the TikTok ban-or-sell bill. April 2024 The Senate follows suit, sending the bill to President Biden, who signs it. May 2024 TikTok and its Chinese parent company ByteDance sue the U.S. federal government to challenge a law that would force the sale of ByteDance's stake or face a ban, saying that the law is unconstitutional. June 2024 Former President Donald Trump joins TikTok and begins posting campaign-related content. July 2024 Vice President Kamala Harris joins TikTok and also begins posting campaign-related material. Dec. 6, 2024 A federal appeals court panel unanimously upheld a law that could lead to a ban on TikTok, handing a resounding defeat to the popular social media platform as it fights for its survival in the U.S. The panel of judges rebuffed the company's challenge of the statute, which it argued had ran afoul of the First Amendment. Dec. 27, 2024 President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a 'political resolution' to the issue. Jan. 17, 2025 The Supreme Court unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok beginning unless it's sold by its China-based parent company, holding that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app. A ban is set to into effect on Jan. 19, 2025. Jan. 18, 2025 TikTok users in the United States were prevented from watching videos on the popular social media platform just hours before a federal ban was set to take effect. 'A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,' a message in the app said. 'Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now.' The company's app was also removed from prominent app stores, including the ones operated by Apple and Google, while its website told users that the short-form video platform was no longer available. Jan. 19, 2025 Shortly after the app went dark for U.S. users, Trump said he would issue an executive order upon taking office to grant TikTok an extension so that it could remain online. A few hours later, TikTok restored service to users in the United States, saying that Trump had provided 'the necessary clarity and assurance to our service providers that they will face no penalties providing TikTok to over 170 million Americans.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-tiktok-grew-from-a-fun-app-for-teens-into-a-potential-national-security-threat/7942904.html	2025-01-19T19:37:19-08:00	
Washington braces for Trump Inauguration	WASHINGTON — Metal fences, concrete barriers and security checkpoints still line many the walkways and cross streets of the National Mall – extending from the U.S. Capitol down past some of Washington’s most noted landmarks – as the nation prepares to swear in its 47th president. But while the 0.6-square-kilometer (146-acre) swath of land is often the highlight of many a tourist visit, it is no longer the focus of security efforts for when President-elect Donald Trump takes the oath of office for a second time. Frigid temperatures forecast for much of Monday led Trump to move the festivities inside – the inauguration to the U.S. Capitol Rotunda and the traditional inaugural parade to the nearby Capital One Arena. The changes, first announced Friday, presented a last-minute hitch for security and law enforcement officials, who had been planning for the inauguration for the past year. And it has left them, and the approximately 25,000 law enforcement and military personnel charged with security, with multiple challenges. 'We will shift those assets,' said the U.S. Secret Service’s Matt McCool, briefing reporters Sunday. 'We have not cut anything from what our original plan was,' he said. 'I’m very confident, with our partners here, we will be ready.' The numbers could make the situation especially trying. Organizers had expected about 250,000 ticketed guests to descend on the U.S. Capitol and the National Mall to watch the inauguration. Only a select few will be allowed into the Capitol Rotunda, which accommodates just 600 people. And the Capital One Area seats just 20,000. If even just a fraction of the 250,000 people who had planned on attending the inauguration try to get to the arena, there could be a crunch. Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said Sunday her force, bolstered by and about 4,000 police officers from across the U.S., will be ready. 'Nothing has really changed,' Smith told reporters. 'The police officers that were committed and dedicated to coming here, we’ll be flexible in how we’ll adjust [their] movement. … So, we will still have police officers in places and spaces around our city as we initially planned.' Some of those officers, Smith said, will still be assigned to the original parade route in anticipation that some people will try to get a glimpse of the presidential motorcade as it goes by. U.S. Capitol Police said they also anticipate having officers on the periphery of the West Front of the Capitol – now closed off with the inauguration moved indoors – ready to direct ticketed guests who will no longer be able to attend. In addition, the inaugural security contingent, which includes the U.S. Secret Service, the FBI, U.S. Capitol Police, Washington Metropolitan Police, and some 7,800 members of the U.S. Army and Air National Guard, will all be coordinated from a command center linked into an expanded network of cameras keeping watch on the city. And though security measures in some areas, including along parts of the National Mall, have been relaxed, officials said there will be plenty of reminders for anyone coming to Washington that this is no ordinary time. 'They will see tactical teams,' McCool said, during an earlier briefing with reporters last week. 'They'll see, officers and agents on rooftops, they’ll see checkpoints. They'll see road closures and barriers in concrete.' Even before the inauguration was moved inside, officials had been preparing for what they described as 'a higher threat environment,' cautioning the security plans for this inauguration were already more robust than in the past. 'The biggest threat, I think, for all of us remains the lone actor,' said Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger. 'That threat … remains the biggest justification for us being on this heightened stage state of alert.' Those concerns were heightened following the New Year’s Day terror attack and truck ramming in New Orleans and the Las Vegas Cybertruck explosion outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas, Nevada. Earlier this month Capitol Police arrested two men suspected of trying to disrupt the state funeral for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, one who tried to bring knives and a machete into the Capitol and another who set their car on fire. Research, including a recent survey by the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, adds to the concerns. 'Over 5% of the American public supports the use of force to prevent Donald Trump from becoming president,' Robert Pape, the project’s director, told VOA. 'That equates to 14,000,000 American adults,' he said. 'That's an unfortunately disturbing number.' Already, Trump was also the target of two attempted assassinations. There is also an ongoing threat from Iran. Despite repeated Iranian denials, U.S. security and law enforcement officials have accused Tehran of trying to kill Trump, unveiling one plot set to be carried out last year, in the days after the U.S. presidential election. For now, though, U.S. officials see no signs of impending trouble. 'The FBI is not currently tracking any credible or specific threats to the inaugural ceremony or the Capitol complex,' the bureau’s Washington Field Office told VOA. 'We will continue to work closely with our partners to share information and identify and disrupt any threats that may emerge.' Another source for concern is the tens of thousands of protesters, though so far, there have been no major incidents. Saturday’s People’s March, which was permitted to have as many as 50,000 protesters, sparked only brief tensions with Trump supporters. Another group, called We Fight Back, has permits for protests involving about 10,000 people in across several locations on Monday. 'Please note that [we] will ensure your right to peacefully protest and assemble,' said the Metropolitan Police Department’s Smith. 'However, I want to reiterate, as I always have, that violence, destruction and unlawful behavior will not be tolerated,' she said. 'Offenders will face swift and decisive consequences … anyone who thinks that they can come into this city to destroy property, we will be prepared to deal with them.'

American journalist Austin Tice's mother, in Damascus, hopes to find missing son	Damascus, Syria — The mother of American journalist Austin Tice, who was taken captive during a reporting trip to Syria in August 2012, arrived in Damascus to step up the search for her son and said she hopes she can take him home with her. Tice, who worked as a freelance reporter for The Washington Post and McClatchy, was one of the first U.S. journalists to make it into Syria after the outbreak of the civil war. His mother, Debra Tice, drove into the Syrian capital from Lebanon with Nizar Zakka, the head of Hostage Aid Worldwide, an organization which is searching for Austin and believes he is still in Syria. 'It'd be lovely to put my arms around Austin while I'm here. It'd be the best,' Debra Tice told Reuters in the Syrian capital Saturday, which she last visited in 2015 to meet with Syrian authorities about her son, before they stopped granting her visas. The overthrow of Bashar al-Assad's regime in December by Syrian rebels has allowed her to visit again from her home in Texas. 'I feel very strongly that Austin's here, and I think he knows I'm here... I'm here,' she said. Debra Tice and Zakka are hoping to meet with Syria's new authorities, including the head of its new administration Ahmed al-Sharaa, to push for information about Austin. They are also optimistic that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be inaugurated Monday, will take up the cause. 'I am hoping to get some answers. And of course, you know, we have [the] inauguration on Monday, and I think that should be a huge change,' she said. 'I know that President Trump is quite a negotiator, so I have a lot of confidence there. But now we have an unknown on this (Syrian) side. It's difficult to know, if those that are coming in even have the information about him,' she said. Her son, now 43, was taken captive in August 2012, while traveling through the Damascus suburb of Daraya. Reuters reported earlier that in 2013 Tice, a former Marine, managed to slip out of his cell and was seen moving between houses in the streets of Damascus' upscale Mazzeh neighborhood. The New York Times first reported that brief escape and recapture. He was recaptured soon after his escape, likely by forces who answered directly to Assad, current and former U.S. officials said. Debra Tice came to Syria in 2012 and 2015 to meet with Syrian authorities, who never confirmed that Tice was in their custody, both she and Zakka said. She criticized outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden's administration, saying they did not negotiate hard enough for her son's release, even in recent months. 'We certainly felt like President Biden was very well positioned to do everything possible to bring Austin home, right? I mean, this was the end of his career. This would be a wonderful thing for him to do. So, we had an expectation. He pardoned his own son, right? So, where's my son?' Debra Tice said her 'mind was just spinning' as she drove across the Lebanese border into Syria and teared up as she spoke about the tens of thousands whose loved ones were held in Assad's notorious prison system and whose fate remains unknown. 'I have a lot in common with a lot of Syrian mothers and families, and just thinking about how this is affecting them — do they have the same hope that I do, that they're going to open a door, that they're going to see their loved one?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-journalist-austin-tice-s-mother-in-damascus-hopes-to-find-missing-son/7942874.html	2025-01-19T16:50:13-08:00	
Indonesia's Mount Ibu erupts more than 1,000 times this month	Ternate, Indonesia — A volcano in eastern Indonesia has erupted at least a thousand times this month, according to an official report Sunday as efforts were underway to evacuate thousands of villagers living near the rumbling mountain. Mount Ibu, on the remote island of Halmahera in North Maluku province, sent a column of smoke up to four kilometers (2.5 miles) into the sky in an eruption Wednesday. Indonesian officials raised its alert status to the highest level and called for the evacuation of 3,000 people living in six nearby villages. It was one of 1,079 eruptions by the volcano recorded since Jan. 1 by Indonesia's Geological Agency, sending columns of ash reaching between 0.3 and 4 kilometers above its peak, according to the agency's data gathered by AFP. The latest big eruption occurred Sunday at 1:15 a.m. local time as it spewed a towering cloud of ash 1.5 kilometers into the air. 'The ash was grey, with moderate to thick intensity, drifting southwest. A loud rumbling sound was heard all the way to Mount Ibu Observation Post,' the agency said in a statement. It added that the volcano had erupted 17 times on Sunday alone. Despite deciding to evacuate affected villagers, local authorities had only managed to evacuate 517 residents as of Sunday, pledging to persuade those who remained to stay in safe shelters. Many have refused to evacuate, arguing that they were used to the situation and were in harvest season. 'There might be economic considerations, as many residents are in the middle of harvesting crops. However, we will continue to educate the community and encourage them to evacuate,' said Adietya Yuni Nurtono, Ternate district military commander in charge of a safe shelter. Mount Ibu, one of Indonesia's most active volcanos, has shown a significant increase in activity since last June. Residents living near Mount Ibu and tourists have been advised to avoid a five- to six-kilometer exclusion zone around the volcano's peak and to wear face masks in case of falling ash. As of 2022, around 700,000 people were living on Halmahera island, according to official data. Indonesia, a vast archipelago, experiences frequent seismic and volcanic activity as it lies along the Pacific Ring of Fire. Last November, Mount Lewotobi Laki-Laki, a 1,703-meter (5,587-foot) twin-peaked volcano on the tourist island of Flores erupted more than a dozen times in one week, killing nine people in its initial explosion. Mount Ruang in North Sulawesi province erupted more than half a dozen times last year, forcing thousands from nearby islands to evacuate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-s-mount-ibu-erupts-more-than-1-000-times-this-month-/7942866.html	2025-01-19T16:31:11-08:00	
Trump's inauguration will be first attended by foreign leaders	For the first time in U.S. history, a president-elect will welcome foreign leaders for one of the most American political traditions — the peaceful transfer of power. President-elect Donald Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and conservative world leaders such as Argentine President Javier Milei and Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni to the inauguration. Xi sent his vice president as his representative. No heads of state have previously made an official visit to the U.S. for the inauguration. Some of them, such as Milei and Paraguay's President Santiago Peña, were special guests Saturday night at the Hispanic Inaugural Ball, where several of Trump's nominees for key Cabinet positions made appearances. That included U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, chosen to lead the State Department, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., tapped to head the Health and Human Services Department. Here is a look at the foreign leaders who are coming to Washington for the 60th inauguration: China Chinese President Xi Jinping was the first foreign leader whose invitation to the inauguration became public in December. Xi will not attend but is sending Vice President Han Zheng. The announcement to dispatch Han was made Friday by the country's foreign ministry, and it comes as the rivalry between the U.S. and China may escalate under Trump. Several of Trump's Cabinet picks are known China hawks, including Rubio, who has called China 'the most potent, dangerous and near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.' Trump has vowed to impose tariffs and other measures on China. But the two leaders spoke on the phone Friday and discussed trade, fentanyl and TikTok. Trump said the call was a 'very good one.' Argentina Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after the Nov. 5 election, traveling from Buenos Aires to the president-elect's Mar-a-Lago club. Milei is scheduled to attend one of the official inaugural balls that Trump will attend on Inauguration Day, as well as the swearing-in ceremony. The self-described 'anarcho-capitalist,' who has carried out an audacious economic agenda in the South American nation, got a hug from Vivek Ramaswamy, a Trump insider, on stage at Hispanic ball before delivering remarks. Ramaswamy called him 'an inspiration.' Milei also receives praise frequently from billionaire Elon Musk for implementing a series of austerity measures that laid off tens of thousands of government workers, froze public infrastructure projects and imposed wage and pension freezes below inflation. Musk and Ramaswamy will lead a non-governmental effort to cut federal government spending, regulations and personnel. Milei hopes good relations with the U.S. could help Argentina reach a new deal with the International Monetary Fund. Italy Meloni is another leader who has recently visited Mar-a-Lago. Her weekly agenda says she will attend the swearing-in ceremony. Meloni kept unexpectedly good relations with Democratic President Joe Biden but is likely to form a more natural alliance with Trump. She is considered a key interlocutor between Europe and the U.S. Georgia Pro-Western former Georgia President Salome Zourabichvili will attend the ceremony as a guest of Republican U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson. Georgia has been wracked by protests following a parliamentary election that opposition groups alleged was rigged. She has maintained she is still the legitimate leader of the former Soviet republic after Mikheil Kavelashvili was inaugurated as president late last month from a party that critics have accused of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. Kavelashvili's ruling party has denied those accusations. Zourabichvili told Fox News that Georgia could be 'the big success for America or the big problem for America' in the region because 'Russia is always trying to dominate.' France French President Emmanuel Macron, who met with Trump last month in Paris during the Notre Dame Cathedral reopening, won't be at Trump's inauguration. But far-right figures from the country have said they are traveling for the inauguration. Eric Zemmour, a talk show pundit turned conservative politician, and his partner, Sarah Knafo, a member of the European Parliament, said they will attend. Zemmour was convicted multiple times of inciting racist or religious hatred. Prominent far-right politician Marion Maréchal said in a statement that she would go as well. She is a member of the European Parliament and niece of the leading conservative figure in France eyeing the 2027 presidential election. Who else? The offices of Ecuadorean President Daniel Noboa and Paraguayan President Santiago Pena have said they were invited to the inauguration and planned to attend. Pena, a conservative economist turned politician, praised Trump's agenda and said at the Hispanic ball that he hoped for deeper ties between U.S. and Latin America. Taiwan sent legislative speaker Han Kuo-yu and seven others to Washington for Trump's inauguration, but Taiwan's foreign ministry said its delegates would not attend the ceremony now that it has been moved indoors because of cold weather. Taiwan's official Central News Agency, citing Taiwan's foreign ministry, also reported that the delegates would meet American politicians and think tank scholars to cement Taiwan-U.S. relations. It's unclear if they will meet Trump. Trump has criticized Taiwan for pulling some of the semiconductor industry from the U.S., but U.S.-Taiwan relations also significantly improved during his first term. On a phone call Friday between Trump and Xi, the Chinese president urged the incoming U.S. leader to approach the Taiwan issue 'with prudence' because it is about China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Beijing claims the self-governed island as Chinese territory and vows to annex it by force if necessary.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-inauguration-will-be-first-attended-by-foreign-leaders/7942860.html	2025-01-19T16:22:06-08:00	
Trump promises 'brand new day,' harsh immigration limits at pre-inauguration victory rally	Washington — Donald Trump told thousands of roaring supporters he would impose severe limits on immigration on his first day in office, vowing to swiftly fulfill the central promise of his presidential campaign on Sunday at a rally inside a packed Washington arena a day before he returns to power. 'By the time the sun sets tomorrow, the invasion of our country will have come to a halt,' he said to cheers at a 'Make America Great Again Victory Rally' at the Capital One Arena. Trump repeated his campaign pledge to launch the largest deportation effort in U.S. history, which would remove millions of immigrants. An operation of that scale, however, would likely take years and be hugely costly. The rally resembled the free-wheeling campaign speeches that have been a Trump staple since his first White House run in 2016. 'This is the greatest political movement in American history, and 75 days ago, we achieved the most epic political victory our country has ever seen,' he said. 'Starting tomorrow, I will act with historic speed of strength and fix every single crisis facing our country.' The event marked his first major address in Washington since his speech on Jan. 6, 2021, that preceded the storming of the U.S. Capitol by an angry mob of his supporters. Trump has said he will pardon many of the more than 1,500 people convicted or charged in connection with the attack. Trump said he would 'get radical woke ideologies the hell out of our military' and order the military to construct a missile defense shield over the U.S., though he has yet to offer details on how to carry it out. He also promised to reverse the 'over-classification' of government documents, a seeming reference to his federal indictment for retaining classified papers after leaving office. That case, along with a separate federal indictment for plotting to overturn the 2020 election, was dropped by the Justice Department after Trump won in November. The indoor hockey and basketball venue will also host some of Monday's inauguration festivities after forecasts of bitter cold prompted officials to move the planned outdoor events inside. He also pledged to release classified documents relating to the assassinations of President John F. Kennedy, his brother Robert Kennedy and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Earlier on Sunday, Trump had breakfast with Republican U.S. senators at Blair House, the guest quarters across from the White House. John Cornyn, Susan Collins, Ted Cruz, Rick Scott and Tim Scott were among the attendees seen leaving the event. He later placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington National Cemetery outside Washington. Trump saluted the tomb as a military bugler played 'Taps.' Ahead of the event, Trump's fans, many dressed in the campaign's trademark red jackets and MAGA hats, waited in a cold, driving rain along several downtown Washington blocks, some chanting 'USA! USA!' Val Tordjman, 58, had traveled across the country from Denver with tickets to watch the inauguration. When he heard the ceremony was being moved inside, notably cutting the size of the in-person audience, he said, 'I felt like crying.' Tordjman said he planned to spend the night on the street next to the arena, despite temperatures forecast to plunge to around 19 degrees Fahrenheit (-7 degrees Celsius). He said he had yet to see Trump in person. 'This is a once in a lifetime opportunity,' he said. Large swaths of the streets around the U.S. Capitol and White House have been blocked off by steel fences since last week, and police were visible throughout the city. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew planned to attend the rally, hours after the company announced it was restoring its service thanks to Trump's promise to delay a U.S. ban that took effect on Sunday. Chew is also expected to join other tech executives at Trump's inauguration on Monday, including the world's richest man, Elon Musk, a close Trump confidant who made a brief appearance on stage with Trump. Trump took credit for bringing TikTok back online and said the U.S. would do a 'joint venture' to save the app alongside bidders to buy the company. The inauguration is scheduled for noon ET (1700 GMT) on Monday, when Trump will take the presidential oath of office inside the rotunda of the Capitol building, after the cold weather prompted organizers to move the ceremony indoors. Approximately 25,000 law enforcement personnel will be on hand to provide security.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-promises-brand-new-day-harsh-immigration-limits-at-pre-inauguration-victory-rally/7942852.html	2025-01-19T16:10:21-08:00	
WHO says needs full access to Gaza after Israel-Hamas truce	Geneva — The World Health Organization said Sunday it was ready to pour much-needed aid into Gaza after the Israel-Hamas truce takes effect but that it would need 'systematic access' across the territory to do so. Much of the Gaza Strip's health infrastructure has been demolished by the more than year-long war between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas before a truce took hold Sunday. While the United Nations' health body was 'ready to scale up the response' to address the territory's critical needs, the WHO said, 'it is critical that the security obstacles hindering operations are removed.' 'WHO will need conditions on the ground that allow systematic access to the population across Gaza, enabling the influx of aid via all possible borders and routes, and lifting restrictions on the entry of essential items,' the agency said in a statement. Until the truce, Israel had complete control over the volume and nature of aid allowed into Gaza. Warning that the 'health challenges ahead are immense,' the Geneva-based agency estimated the cost of rebuilding Gaza's battered health system in the years to come at 'billions in investment.' Last week the WHO put the figure at more than $10 billion. 'Only half of Gaza's 36 hospitals remain partially operational, nearly all hospitals are damaged or partly destroyed, and just 38% of primary health care centers are functional,' the WHO said. Basing its figures on those provided by the Hamas-run territory's health ministry, which the U.N. considers reliable, the WHO put the war's toll in Gaza at more than 46,600 people killed and over 110,000 injured. A quarter of those injured 'face life-changing injuries and will need ongoing rehabilitation,' the U.N. body estimated. Around another 12,000 people need to be evacuated for urgent treatment elsewhere, it added, while warning the destruction of health infrastructure had had knock-on effects. The WHO also expressed concern over the 'breakdown of public order, exacerbated by armed gangs' interfering with aid deliveries to Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-says-needs-full-access-to-gaza-after-israel-hamas-truce/7942614.html	2025-01-19T15:55:55-08:00	
Pope calls for Gaza ceasefire to be 'immediately respected'	Vatican City — Pope Francis called Sunday for a ceasefire in Gaza to be 'immediately respected,' as he thanked mediators and urged a boost in humanitarian aid as well as the return of hostages. 'I express gratitude to all the mediators,' the Argentine pontiff said shortly after the start of a truce between Israel and Hamas began. 'Thanks to all the parties involved in this important outcome. I hope that, as agreed, it will be immediately respected by the parties and that all the hostages will finally be able to go home to hug their loved ones again,' he said. 'I pray so much for them, and their families. I also hope that humanitarian aid will even more quickly reach... the people of Gaza, who have so many urgent needs,' Francis said. 'Both Israelis and Palestinians need clear signs of hope. I hope that the political authorities of both, with the help of the international community, can reach the right two-state solution. 'May everyone say yes to dialogue, yes to reconciliation, yes to peace,' he added. A total of 33 hostages taken by militants during Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel are scheduled to be returned from Gaza during an initial 42-day truce. Under the deal, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners are to be released from Israeli jails. The truce is intended to pave the way for an end to more than 15 months of war sparked by Hamas' attack, the deadliest in Israeli history. It follows a deal struck by mediators Qatar, the United States and Egypt after months of negotiations, and takes effect on the eve of Donald Trump's inauguration as U.S. president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-calls-for-gaza-ceasefire-to-be-immediately-respected-/7942606.html	2025-01-19T15:19:26-08:00	
Cutting Afghanistan funds 'biggest threat to helping women,' aid chief warns	Funding cuts to Afghanistan are the biggest threat to helping the country’s women, the chief of a top aid agency warned Sunday. Jan Egeland, the secretary-general of the Norwegian Refugee Council, said women and girls were bearing the brunt of dwindling financial support for nongovernmental groups and humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. The NRC helped 772,484 Afghans in 2022. That number fell to 491,435 in 2023. Last year, the aid agency helped 216,501 people. Half of its beneficiaries are women. Egeland, who has made several visits to Afghanistan since 2021, said: 'We see one after the other peer organization cutting programming and staff in the last two years. The biggest threat to programs helping Afghan women is funding cuts. The biggest threat to the future well-being of Afghan women is [the lack of] education.' The Taliban takeover in August 2021 drove millions into poverty and hunger after foreign aid stopped almost overnight. Sanctions against the country’s new rulers, a halt on bank transfers and frozen billions in Afghanistan’s currency reserves have cut off access to global institutions and the outside money that supported the aid-dependent economy before the withdrawal of U.S. and NATO forces. The U.N. and others have urged the international community to continue supporting the beleaguered country. Organizations like the Norwegian Refugee Council have helped keep public services afloat through education and health care programs, including nutrition and immunization. But women and girls face more obstacles in accessing health care and education because of restrictions imposed by authorities and an ongoing shortage of female medical professionals, also exacerbated by Taliban decrees. Egeland said Afghan women and girls had not forgotten world leaders telling them their 'number one priority' was education and human rights. 'Now we can’t even fund livelihood programming for widows and single mothers,' he told The Associated Press by telephone from the western province of Herat. The international community provided humanitarian assistance in many countries where they disagreed with local policies. But opposition to Taliban policies, together with a 'general starving' of aid funding in many countries, was worsening the shortfall in Afghanistan, he said. Egeland said most of his discussions with Taliban officials on his trip were about the need to resume classes for women and girls. 'They still argue that it will happen, but the conditions are not right,' he said. 'They say they need to agree on what the conditions are.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cutting-afghanistan-funds-biggest-threat-to-helping-women-aid-chief-warns/7942601.html	2025-01-19T15:08:01-08:00

California marine sanctuary protects waters from oil drilling	After President Joe Biden announced a ban on oil and gas drilling off most of the U.S. coastline in early January, President-elect Donald Trump quickly vowed to reverse it after he takes office on January 20. But there is one section of the California coast that has gained more permanent protection from drilling - a new national marine sanctuary.

Weary Los Angeles firefighters brace for 'last' dangerous winds	Los Angeles — Exhausted Los Angeles firefighters braced Sunday for the return of yet more dangerously strong gusts, as California's governor slammed 'hurricane-force winds of misinformation' surrounding blazes that have killed 27 people. The two largest fires, which have obliterated almost 16,000 hectares (40,000 acres) and razed entire neighborhoods of the second biggest U.S. city, were for the first time both more than half contained, officials announced. But the National Weather Service warned that powerful winds and low humidity would again bring 'dangerous high-end red flag fire weather conditions' from Monday, with gusts up to 130 kilometers (80 miles) per hour potentially returning. 'This is the last... we hope, of the extreme' wind events, said Governor Gavin Newsom. It will be 'the fourth major wind event just in the last three months — we only had two in the prior four years,' he told MSNBC's 'Inside with Jen Psaki' show. Officials were accused of being unprepared for the outbreak of fires this month. Now, 135 fire engines and their crews are prepositioned to tackle new outbreaks, along with helicopters and bulldozers, said Newsom. Firefighters, who since Jan. 7 have been battling flames, digging trenches and uprooting vegetation to create perimeters around fires non-stop, said the largest conflagration, the Palisades Fire, was 52% contained. That fire has killed at least 10 people. Evacuation orders were lifted this weekend for dozens of neighborhoods in upscale western Los Angeles. Farther east, the Eaton Fire, which killed at least 17 in the Altadena suburbs, is 81% contained. More residents were able to return to their homes there too. Others reunited with missing pets they had feared were dead. Serena Null told AFP of her joy at finding her cat, Domino, after having to leave him behind as flames devoured her family home in Altadena. The pair were reunited at NGO Pasadena Humane, where Domino — suffering singed paws, a burnt nose and a high level of stress — was taken after being rescued. 'I just was so relieved and just so happy that he was here,' a tearful Null told AFP. No 'magical spigot' As Los Angeles learns the true scale of the devastation, political bickering has intensified. Donald Trump, set to be sworn in Monday as U.S. president, has sharply criticized California officials. He falsely claimed that Newsom had blocked the diversion of 'excess rain and snow melt from the North.' Los Angeles's water supplies are mainly fed via aqueducts and canals originating from entirely separate river basins farther east. 'What's not helpful or beneficial... is these wild-eyed fantasies... that somehow there's a magical spigot in northern California that just can be turned on, all of a sudden there will be rain or water flowing everywhere,' said Newsom. Citing conversations with firefighters on the ground during 100 mile-per-hour windstorms that first sparked the fires, Newsom added: 'There's not a municipal system in the world that's designed to address a fire of that acuity.' The governor blamed Elon Musk — the Tesla and SpaceX owner poised to play a key role advising the incoming administration — 'and others' for 'hurricane-force winds of mis- and dis-information that can divide a country on a myriad of issues.' President-elect Trump said he hopes to visit the region soon, 'probably at the end of the week.' Emergency officials Sunday continued to survey the damage, going house-to-house with dogs in search of human remains, and ramping up the daunting task of clearing endless tons of debris. The region has experienced its driest start of the year since 1850, according to Newsom. Well into its typical rainy season, Los Angeles has had almost no rain since May. Although rain is still not expected imminently, Newsom warned of the need to prepare 'for potential flooding in the next week or two,' as rain, when it comes, pours down hillsides denuded by the fires. 'I prepositioned 2,500 National Guard. We're going to start some sandbagging operations,' he said. 'We're dealing with extremes that we have never dealt with in the past' due to the changing climate, said the governor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/weary-los-angeles-firefighters-brace-for-last-dangerous-winds/7942562.html	2025-01-19T13:35:44-08:00	
Keke Palmer’s ‘One of Them Days,’ ‘Mufasa’ race for No. 1	WASHINGTON — The Keke Palmer buddy comedy 'One of Them Days' opened in first place on the North American box office charts on a particularly slow Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. The R-rated Sony release earned $11.6 million from 2,675 theaters, according to studio estimates Sunday, beating Disney’s 'Mufasa: The Lion King' by a hair. By the end of Monday's holiday, 'Mufasa' will have the edge, however. 'One of Them Days' cost only $14 million to produce, which it is expected to earn by Monday. The very well-reviewed buddy comedy stars Palmer and SZA as friends and roommates scrambling to get money for rent before their landlord evicts them. Notably it’s the first Black female-led theatrical comedy since 'Girls Trip' came out in 2017 and it currently carries a stellar 96% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. But the marketplace was also quite weak overall. The total box office for Friday, Saturday and Sunday will add up to less than $80 million, according to data from Comscore, making it one of the worst Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekends since 1997. 'For an individual film like ‘One of Them Days’ this was a great weekend,' said Paul Dergarabedian, the senior media analyst for Comscore. 'You can still find success stories within what is overall a low grossing weekend for movie theaters.' The Walt Disney Co.’s 'Mufasa' was close by in second place with $11.5 million from the weekend, its fifth playing in theaters. Globally, the Barry Jenkins-directed prequel has made $588 million. It even beat a brand-new offering, the Blumhouse horror 'Wolf Man,' which debuted in third place with $10.6 million from 3,354 North American theaters. Writer-director Leigh Whannell’s monster tale starring Christopher Abbott and Julia Garner did not enter theaters with great reviews. It currently carries a 53% on Rotten Tomatoes. Reviews don’t generally affect the success of horror movies in their first weekend, but audiences also gave it a lackluster C- CinemaScore in exit polls. The Blumhouse production and Universal Pictures release cost a reported $25 million to make and is expected to reach $12 million by the close of Monday’s holiday. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' was in fourth place with $8.6 million and 'Den of Thieves 2' rounded out the top five with $6.6 million. In specialty releases, Brady Corbert's 215-minute post-war epic 'The Brutalist' expanded to 388 screens where it made nearly $2 million over the weekend. A24 reported that it sold out various 70mm and IMAX showings. The studio also re-released its Colman Domingo drama 'Sing Sing' in theaters and prisons, where over 1 million incarcerated people in 46 states were able to view the film. The Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend has seen major successes in the past. Dergarabedian noted 'Bad Boys for Life,' which had a three-day opening of $62.5 million in 2020, and 'American Sniper,' which earned $89.3 in its first weekend in wide release in 2016. 'This is a year that’s going to get a big boost starting with ‘Captain America: Brave New World’ and ‘Paddington in Peru’ in February,' Dergarabedian said. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. 1. 'One of Them Days,' $11.6 million. 2. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $11.5 million. 3. 'Wolf Man,' $10.6 million. 4. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $8.6 million. 5. 'Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,' $6.6 million. 6. 'Moana 2,' $6.1 million. 7. 'Nosferatu,' $4.3 million. 8. 'A Complete Unknown,' $3.8 million. 9. 'Wicked,' $3.6 million. 10. 'Babygirl,' $2 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/keke-palmer-s-one-of-them-days-mufasa-race-for-no-1-/7942568.html	2025-01-19T13:32:48-08:00	
Donald Trump set to assume US presidency again	A hallmark of the nearly 250-year American democracy is the quadrennial peaceful transfer of presidential power, and it is set to unfold again on Monday, with Donald Trump, the 45th president until he lost his 2020 reelection bid, set to be inaugurated as the country’s 47th leader after winning last November’s election. Millions of Americans are expected to watch on television as the 78-year-old Trump takes the oath of office for a new four-year term in the White House while President Joe Biden, 82, leaves the presidency after a single term. But only about 600 people will see Trump sworn in live, with the ceremony moved into the U.S. Capitol Rotunda at Trump’s behest. An arrival Sunday night of an Arctic blast of frigid air into Washington could push the temperature to -6 Celsius at noon on Monday, when the traditional outdoor swearing-in ceremony would normally be held on the steps of the Capitol overlooking the National Mall. It is expected to be the coldest Inauguration Day in Washington in 40 years, when Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration was also moved inside in 1985. About 250,000 tickets to Trump’s planned outdoor ceremony on the Capitol steps had been handed out to his supporters and dignitaries but inaugural officials said they now can simply keep the ducats as commemorative souvenirs. The traditional inaugural parade along Pennsylvania Avenue from the Capitol to the White House has also been canceled because of the weather, with bands, marching units, drill teams and the like now parading past Trump, his wife, Melania Trump and other officials in his new administration at the nearby 20,000-seat Capital One Arena, with thousands of other celebrants literally left out in the cold. Lavish black-tie balls are still planned for Monday evening. Trump’s ascendancy to power again comes with some historical footnotes: He will become the first felon to serve as U.S. president, after his conviction last year on 34 criminal charges linked to falsifying business records to hide a $130,000 hush money payment to porn film star Stormy Daniels, although a judge declined to penalize him in any way. Charges that Trump, a Republican, tried to illegally overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden were dropped when he defeated his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, in the 2024 election because of a long-standing Justice Department policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. Trump will also become the second U.S. president to serve a second nonconsecutive term, after Grover Cleveland in the 1890s. Beyond the pomp and circumstances of U.S. inaugurals, both Trump’s supportive Republican colleagues and opposition Democrats will be closely watching to see what policy changes he quickly announces with executive orders to undo Biden edicts or simply to push forward with planks from his winning campaign against Harris. Trump’s Day 1 promises are wide-ranging, but whether he signs orders affecting all of them or spreads out some of them to the coming days is not certain. Perhaps his most persistent claim from the campaign trail is that he plans to deport more than 11 million undocumented migrants living in the United States, starting with migrants who have been convicted of crimes and then others who have been ordered to return to their home countries after losing asylum bids to stay in the U.S. But an apparent Trump plan to begin the immigration crackdown on Tuesday in Chicago leaked to U.S. media outlets, leaving Trump’s handpicked 'border czar,' Tom Homan, to say that that the timing of the deportation plan is now being reconsidered. 'We’re looking at this leak and will make a decision based on this leak,' Homan told The Washington Post. 'It’s unfortunate because anyone leaking law enforcement operations puts officers at greater risk.' Nonetheless, Homan said the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency 'will start arresting public safety threats and national security threats on day one. We’ll be arresting people across the country, uninhibited by any prior (Biden) administration guidelines. Why Chicago was mentioned specifically, I don’t know.' 'This is nationwide thing,' he said. 'We’re not sweeping neighborhoods. We have a targeted enforcement plan.' Trump has also vowed to close the southwestern U.S. border with Mexico and force would-asylum seekers to remain in Mexico while their claims to stay in the U.S. are adjudicated. All of his get-tough-on-migrant plans are sure to draw legal challenges from advocates supporting those seeking a new life in the U.S., possibly leaving Trump’s actions in limbo for extended periods, weeks, maybe months. Related to immigration, Trump says he wants to end birthright citizenship for anyone born in the United States, although it is part of the U.S. Constitution, so it is not clear how he plans to try to do that unilaterally. Trump has also vowed to quickly impose heightened tariffs on key trading partners, including Canada, China and Mexico. The incoming president says he plans to pardon many of the 1,500 supporters of his who stormed the Capitol building on January 6, 2021, to try to block Congress from certifying that Biden won the 2020 election. Trump has called those arrested and convicted 'patriots' and 'hostages' wrongly prosecuted. It is not clear whether Trump will pardon only those convicted of relatively minor offenses or include those convicted of attacking the 140 law enforcement officials who were injured in the mayhem four years ago. Trump vowed for months to end Russia’s war on Ukraine before he takes office, but in recent days his aides have said the goal now is to try to reach a truce in the fighting in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be around the end of April. Trump also wants more oil drilling in the U.S. even though in 2023, U.S. energy production exceeded consumption by a record amount, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Two transgender issues have also drawn Trump’s attention. Trump has repeatedly referred to transgender women as men, telling his supporters that he will ensure transgender women cannot compete in women’s sports. 'I will keep men out of women’s sports, 100%, immediately, first day,' Trump told one political rally during the campaign. He also frequently has assailed gender-affirming care, which can include hormone therapy. 'On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden’s cruel policies on so-called ‘gender affirming care.’'	https://www.voanews.com/a/donald-trump-set-to-assume-us-presidency-again/7942546.html	2025-01-19T12:41:08-08:00

Biden urges Americans to 'keep the faith' as he spends final full day as president in South Carolina	NORTH CHARLESTON, S.C. — Joe Biden spent his final full day as president Sunday in South Carolina, urging Americans to 'keep the faith in a better day to come' and reflecting on the impact of the civil rights movement in pushing him into politics. On the eve of Monday's inauguration of Republican President-elect Donald Trump, Biden delivered a final farewell from a state that holds special meaning after his commanding win in its 2020 Democratic primary set him up to achieve his life's goal of being elected president of the United States. Biden spoke to the congregation of Royal Missionary Baptist Church about why he entered public service — Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. were political heroes, he said — and he thanked South Carolina for its support: 'I owe you big.' Monday is the federal holiday honoring King, the slain civil rights leader. 'We know the struggle to redeeming the soul of this nation is difficult and ongoing,' Biden said. 'We must hold on to hope. We must stay engaged. We must always keep the faith in the better day to come.' He added: 'I'm not going anywhere' — and the congregation applauded. Before the service, as hostages started to be released under a Middle East ceasefire that the U.S. helped broker, Biden said 'the guns in Gaza have gone silent.' The agreement to halt the fighting between Israel and Hamas was one he had outlined in May. 'Now it falls on the next administration to help implement this deal. I was pleased to have our team speak as one voice in the final days,' Biden said. He noted that the three hostages released Sunday 'appear to be in good health' and he offered some advice to Trump on maintaining the hard-won deal. 'Success is going to require persistence, and continuing support for our friends in the region and the belief in diplomacy backed by deterrence,' Biden said. After Biden spoke on the ceasefire, he and first lady Jill Biden took their seats in the front pew at the church. At least several hundred congregants sang gospel songs, rising to their feet and swaying and clapping. A choir led the musical selections from behind the pulpit before the program later shifted to focus on King. Biden was introduced by Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., a key ally who referred to the president as his 'longtime friend.' Clyburn cited a number of presidents who were underappreciated during their time in office but are now looked on more fondly with the passage of time. He added Biden to that list. 'So I want to say to you, good friend, very little appreciation has been shown recently but faint not. History will be very proud of you,' Clyburn said. The Bidens also will tour the International African American Museum in South Carolina. It was built on a waterfront site where tens of thousands of enslaved Africans were brought to the U.S. from the late 1760s through 1808, according to the museum's website. Back in 2020, Biden saw his campaign flounder after he lost the opening contests in New Hampshire, Iowa and Nevada. But at the fourth stop, South Carolina — where Black voters make up a majority of the Democratic electorate — he was lifted to victory after Clyburn's endorsement. 'I know Joe. We know Joe. But most importantly, Joe knows us,' Clyburn said at the time. After winning election and taking office, Biden pushed for South Carolina to move to the head of the line and be the state that opened the Democratic Party's nominating process for 2024, instead of New Hampshire. He easily won the state's primary that year. 'In 2020, it was the voters of South Carolina who proved the pundits wrong, breathed new life into our campaign, and set us on the path to winning the presidency,' Biden said in a statement after winning the primary for the second time. 'Now in 2024, the people of South Carolina have spoken again and I have no doubt that you have set us on the path to winning the Presidency again — and making Donald Trump a loser — again.' It didn't turn out that way. After faltering in a debate against Trump, Biden dropped out of the race under pressure from many Democrats, though Clyburn notably was not among them. Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, who replaced him as the Democrats' nominee. She lost to Trump. Clyburn said Biden told him he wanted to visit the African American history museum, which Clyburn helped start. They were planning to spend some time together there. 'This is his way of saying 'thank you,'' Clyburn said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-urges-americans-to-keep-the-faith-as-he-spends-final-full-day-as-president-in-south-carolina/7942529.html	2025-01-19T11:59:20-08:00

4 Moroccan truck drivers disappear on Burkina-Niger border	Rabat, Morocco — Four Moroccan truck drivers went missing Saturday as they crossed the restive border area between Burkina Faso and Niger, according to a source from the Moroccan Embassy in Burkina Faso and a Moroccan transport union. Three trucks, one carrying a spare driver, disappeared as they drove without an escort from Dori in Burkina Faso to Tera in Niger, an area known for jihadi threats, the diplomatic source said. Junta-led Burkina Faso and Niger are battling Islamist militant groups linked to al-Qaida and Islamic State, whose insurgencies have destabilized Sahel states in West Africa over the past decade. The Moroccan diplomatic source said the embassy was working together with Burkina Faso authorities to find the drivers. Authorities in Burkina Faso have been organizing security convoys to escort trucks in the border area to protect against militant attacks, the source said. The trucks set off after waiting for a week without getting an escort, Echarki El Hachmi, secretary general of Morocco's transporters' union, told Reuters. The trucks, loaded with infrastructure equipment, departed weeks ago from Casablanca heading to Niger, he said. El Hachmi urged more protection in areas of high risk as the number of Moroccan trucks crossing the Sahel continues to rise. Earlier this month, a convoy of Moroccan trucks was attacked on the Malian border with Mauritania, although there were no casualties, El Hachmi said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moroccan-truck-drivers-disappear-on-burkina-niger-border/7942513.html	2025-01-19T11:27:13-08:00	
Heavy snow, frigid Arctic blast put 70 million across US under winter storm warnings	Boston — Tens of millions of residents along the East Coast are bracing for several centimeters of snow Sunday followed by dangerously cold temperatures that will take hold in much of the country from the Northern Plains to the tip of Maine. Winter storm warnings issued by the National Weather Service have already gone into effect for parts of the Mid-Atlantic through Monday morning, with the forecast projecting up to 15 centimeters of snow. Warnings will begin in New England on Sunday afternoon, with parts of Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Maine and Connecticut seeing as much as 25 centimeters of snow. Marc Chenard, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland, projected that as many as 70 million residents will be under some kind of winter storm hazards warning in the coming days including in New England and the Mid-Atlantic. Large cities like Philadelphia, New York and Boston could see several centimeters of snow this evening with the highest totals being outside of major cities. 'There will certainly be some more hazardous road conditions anywhere from D.C. up the whole I-95 corridor and then inland from there later today and tonight,' Chenard said. 'Then it gets quite cold behind that. By Monday morning, any roads that haven’t been treated or cleared will still likely be some hazardous travel conditions.' Return of the Arctic blast But the snow is just the start of a chaotic week of weather. Much of the eastern half of the United States will be enduring some of the coldest temperatures this winter, if not for several years. An area from the Rockies into the Northern Plains will see colder than normal temperatures starting Sunday into the coming week, with temperatures dropping to minus 34 degrees C to minus 48 C on Sunday and Monday. Wind chills of minus 40 C were already being clocked in parts of North Dakota and Minnesota. Sub-zero wind chills are forecast to reach as far south as Oklahoma and the Tennessee Valley. The cold weather forecast for Monday for Washington, D.C., prompted President-elect Donald Trump’s inaugural ceremony to be moved inside the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. 'It’s going to be a cold day in Washington, D.C. on Monday. That's for sure,' Chenard said, noting temperatures will be in the 20s with wind gust upwards of 48 kph. As happened earlier this month, this latest cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. The cold air will moderate as it moves southward and eastward, but the central and eastern U.S. will still be cold with highs in the teens and 20s on Monday into Tuesday, Chenard said. The Mid-Atlantic and Northeast also will have highs in the teens and 20s, lows in the single digits and below minus 18 C and wind chills below zero. Unusual wintry mix The colder temperatures will reach down into the South early this week, where as many as 30 million people starting Monday could see a wintry mix of snow, sleet and freezing rain. The unusual conditions are expected to stretch from Texas into northern Florida and the Carolinas. Impacts are expected to start in Texas on Monday night and spread across the Gulf Coast and Southeast on Tuesday into Wednesday. A combination of frigid air with a low pressure system over the Gulf is behind the storm, which could bring heavy snow just south of the Interstate 20 corridor across northern Louisiana and into Mississippi and a mix of snow, sleet, and freezing rain near the Interstate 10 corridor from Houston to Mobile, Alabama. Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry on Saturday issued a state of emergency in advance of the wintry weather. He encouraged Louisianans to be prepared and to monitor the weather forecast.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-snow-frigid-arctic-blast-put-70-million-across-u-s-under-winter-storm-warnings-/7942472.html	2025-01-19T10:18:39-08:00	
What does does the future hold for Africa’s Generation Beta?	London — Demographers say the first members of Generation Beta are being born this month, following on the heels of Millennials, Gen Z and Gen Alpha. VOA spoke with African futurists on what they think will define the lives of the continent's Gen B'ers, from AI to better life expectancy and economic growth. Labels like Baby Boomers, Millennials or Generation Alpha are increasingly used globally to describe people born about the same time, often sharing similar experiences and challenges. VOA spoke with African futurists and scientists to understand how Gen B, who will be born between now and 2039, can expect Africa to have changed by the time they are adults. Halidou Tinto is a scientist from Burkina Faso, who is conducting cutting edge research with the recently developed malaria vaccine. He says futurists believe that people born in Africa in 2024-2025 can reasonably expect that malaria will no longer be a major public health problem in the years to come, and especially when these babies become adults. More than 200 million people in Africa catch malaria each year, and a half-million people die of it, according to the World Health Organization. Malaria is particularly deadly for children. According to UNICEF, the U.N.’s children’s agency, improvements in public health like this will lead to a brighter future for children born in coming years. Paul Quarles Van Ufford, a social policy adviser for UNICEF, says 'Children born today, also, are less likely to die before their fifth birthday and one of the big progress stories in Africa, because of vaccination, management of diseases and that there is less poverty is that child mortality has reduced.' He says that life expectancy in Africa has increased 'exponentially' in the last 20 years. Data from the U.N. shows that if current trends continue, Africa’s life expectancy could reach 70 by 2050, compared to 61 years old now. Researchers in Kenya — who have recently developed an Artificial Intelligence, or AI, chat bot to educate young people about HIV and AIDS — say the role of AI is going to grow in Africa. Dr. Consolata Gakii, with the University of Embu, says 'The young people are coming up with, utilizing AI to solve societal or local problems, from image processing to precision of weather, there is so much that is happening within our country,' she said. Jakkie Cilliers, head of African Futures at the South Africa based Institute for Security Studies, says Gen B’s relationship with technologies like AI will only expand in coming years. 'It’s a future of more freedom and more self-dependence, a future of innovation, a future in which technology really leads to benefit the ordinary person and the relationship between technology and the individual, I think is, just every year, is going to expand,' he said. Cilliers adds that tech will allow greater access to the globally developing 'gig economy,' which means workers will become less reliant on the government. He also says that about the time Gen B members become adults, the continent will pass an important milestone. For the first time, there will be more people of working age on the continent than dependents, like children and older people. That could lead to an explosion in economic growth. Although there are many challenges facing Africa, Generation Beta has a lot to get excited about.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-does-oes-the-future-hold-for-africa-s-generation-beta-/7942399.html	2025-01-19T09:12:28-08:00	
Who are the Israelis released, recovered on 1st day of ceasefire?	JERUSALEM — Three hostages held by Hamas were released Sunday after 471 days in captivity as part of a ceasefire between Israel and the Palestinian militant group. A gradual release of dozens of captives over the next several weeks has been agreed on. The truce and release of hostages sparked hope and trepidation among Israelis. Many fear that the three-phase deal could collapse before all the hostages return, or that they will arrive in poor health. Others worry that the number of captives who have died is more than predicted. Some 250 people were kidnapped during Hamas’ Oct. 7, 2023, attack that triggered 15 months of war. Around 100 hostages still remain in Gaza, after the rest were released or their bodies recovered. Hours before the ceasefire Sunday, which many hope is the first step to end the war, Israel announced that it had retrieved the body of Oron Shaul, a soldier who was killed in the 2014 Israel-Hamas war and whose remains have been held by the militants since then. Here's a look at the three hostages released Sunday: Romi Gonen, 24 Romi Gonen was kidnapped from the Nova music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. That morning, Gonen's mother, Merav, and her eldest daughter spent nearly five hours speaking to Gonen as militants marauded through the festival grounds. Gonen told her family that roads clogged with abandoned cars made escape impossible and that she would seek shelter in some bushes. Then she said words that continue to echo in her mother’s head every day. 'Mommy I was shot, the car was shot, everybody was shot. ... I am wounded and bleeding. Mommy, I think I’m going to die,' she recounted Romi as saying, in a news conference a few weeks after the abduction. At a loss for what to do, Leshem Gonen tried to convince her daughter that she wasn’t going to die, to start breathing and treat her wounded friends. According to Merav, Gonen's last word during the call was a shriek of 'Mommy!' as approaching gunfire and the men’s shouts drowned out everything. Then the phone shut off. Israeli authorities identified her phone's location in Gaza. Over the past 15 months, Merav has been one of the most outspoken voices advocating for the return of the hostages, appearing nearly daily on Israeli news programs and traveling abroad on missions. 'We are doing everything we can so the world will not forget,' Merav told The Associated Press on the six-month anniversary of Hamas' attack. 'Every day we wake up and take a big breath, deep breath, and continue walking, continue doing the things that will bring her back.' Emily Damari, 28 Emily Damari is a British-Israeli citizen kidnapped from her apartment on Kibbutz Kfar Aza, a communal farming village hit hard by Hamas' assault. She lived in a small apartment in a neighborhood for young adults, the closest part of the kibbutz to Gaza. Militants broke through the border fence of the kibbutz and ransacked the neighborhood. Damari's mother, Mandy, said she loves music, traveling, soccer, good food, karaoke and hats. Kibbutz Kfar Aza said that Damari was often the 'glue that held her close-knit friend group together' and she was always organizing gatherings of friends around the best barbecue corner in the entire kibbutz. 'I hold on to that sliver of hope that I still keep in my heart that she is surviving, in spite of her suffering,' Mandy Damari said in front of Damari's burned apartment last January. 'I am desperate, angry, and terrified for her life.' Doron Steinbrecher, 31 Doron Steinbrecher is a veterinary nurse who loves animals, and a neighbor to Damari in Kibbutz Kfar Aza. At 10:20 on Oct. 7, 2023, Steinbrecher called her mother. 'Mom, I’m scared. I’m hiding under the bed, and I hear them trying to enter my apartment,' her brother, Dor, recalled. She was able to send a voice message to her friends. 'They’ve got me! They’ve got me! They’ve got me!' in the moments of her abduction. That message was key in helping her family understand that Doron had been kidnapped. Steinbrecher was featured in a video released by Hamas on Jan. 26, 2024, along with two other female Israeli soldiers. Her brother said the video gave them hope that she was alive but sparked concern because she looked tired, weak, and gaunt. In total, militants killed 64 people and 22 soldiers, and kidnapped 19 people from Kibbutz Kfar Aza on Oct 7. With the return of Steinbrecher and Damari, there are still three members of the kibbutz held in Gaza: American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65, and twins Gali and Ziv Berman, 27. Remains of Oron Shaul, 20 Oron Shaul was a soldier killed on July 20, 2014, during fighting between Israel and Hamas. His body and that of another soldier, Hadar Goldin, had been held by militants since then despite a public campaign to return them by their families. The Hostages Families Forum, which represents relatives of the captives, called the Shaul family an 'inseparable part' of the group. Militants still hold the bodies of Goldin as well as two Israelis who crossed into Gaza in 2014 and 2015 on their own.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-are-the-israelis-released-recovered-on-1st-day-of-ceasefire/7942373.html	2025-01-19T08:16:24-08:00

80 killed in northeast Colombia as peace talks fail, official says	BOGOTÁ — More than 80 people have been killed in the country’s northeast region following failed attempts to hold peace talks with the National Liberation Army, a Colombian official said. Twenty others have been injured, according to William Villamizar, governor of North Santander, where many of the killings occurred. Among the victims are community leader Carmelo Guerrero and seven people who sought to sign a peace deal, according to a report that a government ombudsman agency released late Saturday. Officials said the attacks occurred in several towns located in the Catatumbo region near the border with Venezuela, with at least three people who were part of the peace talks being kidnapped. Thousands of people are fleeing the area, with some hiding in the nearby lush mountains or seeking help at government shelters. 'Catatumbo needs help,' Villamizar said in a public address Saturday. 'Boys, girls, young people, teenagers, entire families are showing up with nothing, riding trucks, dump trucks, motorcycles, whatever they can, on foot, to avoid being victims of this confrontation.' The attack comes after Colombia suspended peace talks with the National Liberation Army (ELN) on Friday, the second time it has done so in less than a year. Colombia’s government has demanded that the ELN cease all attacks and allow authorities to enter the region and provide humanitarian aid. The ELN has been clashing in Catatumbo with former members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, a guerrilla group that disbanded after signing a peace deal in 2016 with Colombia's government. The two are fighting over control of a strategic border region that has coca leaf plantations. The ELN said in a statement Saturday that it had warned former FARC members that if they 'continued attacking the population...there was no other way out than armed confrontation.' The ELN has accused ex-FARC rebels of several killings in the area, including the Jan. 15 slaying of a couple and their 9-month-old baby. Colombia's army said Sunday that it rescued a local community leader and a relative that the ELN was persecuting, but dozens more awaited rescue. Defense Minister Iván Velásquez was scheduled to travel to the northeast town of Cúcuta while officials prepared to send 10 tons of food and hygiene kits for approximately 5,000 people in the communities of Ocaña and Tibú, most of them having fled the violence. The ELN has tried to negotiate a peace deal with the administration of President Gustavo Petro five times, with talks failing after bouts of violence. ELN demands include that it be recognized as a political rebel organization, which critics have said is risky.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-in-northeast-colombia-as-peace-talks-fail-official-says-/7942361.html	2025-01-19T08:10:25-08:00	
Biden posthumously pardons Black nationalist Marcus Garvey	Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday posthumously pardoned Black nationalist Marcus Garvey, who influenced Malcolm X and other civil rights leaders and was convicted of mail fraud in the 1920s. Also receiving pardons were a top Virginia lawmaker and advocates for immigrant rights, criminal justice reform and gun violence prevention. Congressional leaders had pushed for Biden to pardon Garvey, with supporters arguing that Garvey's conviction was politically motivated and an effort to silence the increasingly popular leader who spoke of racial pride. After Garvey was convicted, he was deported to Jamaica, where he was born. He died in 1940. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. said of Garvey: 'He was the first man, on a mass scale and level' to give millions of Black people 'a sense of dignity and destiny.' It's not clear whether Biden, who leaves office Monday, will pardon people who have been criticized or threatened by President-elect Donald Trump. Issuing preemptive pardons — for actual or imagined offenses by Trump's critics that could be investigated or prosecuted by the incoming administration — would stretch the powers of the presidency in untested ways. Biden has set the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued. He announced on Friday that he was commuting the sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses. He also gave a broad pardon for his son Hunter, who was prosecuted for gun and tax crimes. The president has announced he was commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment just as Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment, takes office. In his first term, Trump presided over an unprecedented number of executions, 13, in a protracted timeline during the coronavirus pandemic. A pardon relieves a person of guilt and punishment. A commutation reduces or eliminates the punishment but doesn't exonerate the wrongdoing. Among those pardoned on Sunday were: — Don Scott, who is the speaker of the Virginia House of Delegates in a chamber narrowly controlled by Democrats. He was convicted of a drug offense in 1994 and served eight years in prison. He was elected to the Virginia legislature in 2019, and later became the first Black speaker. 'I am deeply humbled to share that I have received a Presidential Pardon from President Joe Biden for a mistake I made in 1994 — one that changed the course of my life and taught me the true power of redemption,' Scott said in a statement. —Immigrant rights activist Ravi Ragbir, who was convicted of a nonviolent offence in 2001 and was sentenced to two years in prison and was facing deportation to Trinidad and Tobago. —Kemba Smith Pradia, who was convicted of a drug offense in 1994 and sentenced to 24 years behind bars. She has since become a prison reform activist. President Bill Clinton commuted her sentence in 2000. —Darryl Chambers of Wilmington, Delaware, a gun violence prevention advocate who was convicted of a drug offense and sentenced to 17 years in prison. He studies and writes about gun violence prevention. Biden commuted the sentences of two people: —Michelle West, who was serving life in prison for her role in a drug conspiracy case in the early 1990s. West has a daughter who has written publicly about the struggle of growing up with a mother behind bars. —Robin Peoples, who was convicted of robbing banks in northwest Indiana in the late 1990s and was sentenced to 111 years in prison. The White House said in a statement that Peoples would have faced significantly lower sentences today under current laws.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-posthumously-pardons-black-nationalist-marcus-garvey-/7942340.html	2025-01-19T07:44:57-08:00	
In photos: Israel - Hamas ceasefire	A ceasefire in Gaza tales effect Sunday after Israel’s Cabinet approved a deal, with 24 ministers voting in favor and eight ministers rejecting the agreement. The deal to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas was achieved after more than a year of negotiations, with mediation from the United States, Qatar and Egypt. U.S. President Joe Biden first endorsed the deal in May. The Hamas-led October 7, 2023 attack on southern Israel killed some 1,200 people and left some 250 others captive. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, The Associated Press reported. Israel responded with an offensive that has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials, who do not distinguish between civilians and militants but say women and children make up more than half the dead, The Associated Press said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-photos-israel---hamas-ceasefire/7942338.html	2025-01-19T07:39:05-08:00	
Trump says he will issue an executive order Monday to get TikTok back up	Washington — President-elect Donald Trump said Sunday that he plans to issue an executive order that would give TikTok's China-based parent company more time to find an approved buyer before the popular video-sharing platform is subject to a permanent U.S. ban. Trump announced the decision in a post on his Truth Social account as millions of TikTok users in the U.S. awoke to discover they could no longer access the TikTok app or platform. Google and Apple removed the app from their digital stores to comply with a federal law that required them to do so if TikTok parent company ByteDance didn't sell its U.S. operation to an approved buyer by Sunday. He said his order would 'extend the period of time before the law's prohibitions take effect' and 'confirm that there will be no liability for any company that helped keep TikTok from going dark before my order. 'Americans deserve to see our exciting Inauguration on Monday, as well as other events and conversations,' Trump wrote. The law gives the sitting president authority to grant a 90-day extension if a viable sale is underway. Although investors made a few offers, ByteDance previously said it would not sell. In his post on Sunday, Trump said he 'would like the United States to have a 50% ownership position in a joint venture,' but it was not immediately clear if he was referring to the government of an American company. 'By doing this, we save TikTok, keep it in good hands and allow it to say up,' Trump wrote. 'Without U.S. approval, there is no Tik Tok. With our approval, it is worth hundreds of billions of dollars - maybe trillions.' The federal law required ByteDance to cut ties with the platform's U.S. operations by Sunday due to national security concerns posed by the app's Chinese roots. The law passed with wide bipartisan support in April, and U.S. President Joe Biden quickly signed it. TikTok and ByteDance sued on First Amendment grounds, and the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the statute on Friday. Millions of TikTok users in the U.S. were no longer able to watch or post videos on the platform as of Saturday night. 'A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,' a pop-up message informed users who opened the TikTok app and tried to scroll through videos. 'Unfortunately that means you can't use TikTok for now.' 'A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S.,' a pop-up message informed users who opened the TikTok app and tried to scroll through videos. 'Unfortunately that means you can't use TikTok for now.' The service interruption TikTok instituted hours early caught most users by surprise. Experts had said the law as written did not require TikTok to take down its platform, only for app stores to remove it. Current users were expected to continue to have access to videos until the app stopped working due to a lack of updates. The company's app also was removed from prominent app stores, including the ones operated by Apple and Google. Apple told customers with its devices that it also took down other apps developed by TikTok's China-based parent company, including one that some social media influencers had promoted as an alternative. The Biden administration stressed in recent days that it did not intend to implement or enforce the nationwide ban before Trump takes office on Monday. Trump, who once favored a TikTok ban, said in an NBC News interview on Saturday that he was thinking about granting ByteDance a 90-day extension to find an approved buyer for the app's U.S. operations. 'We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned,' read the pop-up message the app's users now see under the headline, 'Sorry, TikTok isn't available right now.' The only option the message gives to U.S. users is to close the app or click another option leading them to the platform's website. There, users are shown the same message and given the option to download their data, an action that TikTok previously said may take days to process.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-security-adviser-doesn-t-rule-out-continued-chinese-ownership-of-tiktok-/7942332.html	2025-01-19T07:24:40-08:00	
Money laundering fears hang over Thailand’s online gambling plans	BANGKOK — Thailand’s plans to legalize online gambling are raising fears that criminal gangs will use the industry to move and launder their illicit proceeds as they have done with gambling operators in neighboring countries. Prasert Jantararuangtong, Thailand’s minister of digital economy and society, said last week that a bill could be ready within a month. Former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, widely seen as a major force behind the current government, led by his daughter Paetongtarn Shinawatra, avidly endorsed the idea as well last week. The averred impetus for the push has been both economic and legal. Thaksin claimed a regulated online gambling industry could net the government nearly $3 billion in annual revenue. By bringing an industry already operating in the shadows into the light, Prasert said the move could also drive out the criminals currently behind many of the betting sites. 'The goal is to regulate underground gambling operations, bringing them into the legal framework and ensuring proper taxation,' Prasert told reporters. The push for online gambling is moving ahead as the government is preparing to legalize physical casinos inside integrated resorts featuring hotels, shopping malls and other entertainment. A related bill is due for debate in the National Assembly soon, after winning approval from the prime minister’s Cabinet on Monday. Gambling in Thailand is currently restricted to betting on state-run horse races and an official lottery. Many have been warning that expanding the scope of legal gambling in Thailand, especially online, is rife with risk. Bringing underground gambling operations under government regulation can do some good, Benedikt Hofmann, deputy representative for Southeast Asia and the Pacific for the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, told VOA. 'But it also opens the door for ostensibly legitimate investments and use of the system by criminal actors for their illicit purposes, especially in a region rife with such actors. As we have seen in the Philippines, creating legal licensing and regulatory frameworks for gambling operators, like the POGO scheme, did not prevent the system from being taken over by highly problematic actors,' he said. The Philippines launched POGO, the Philippines Offshore Gaming Operator, in 2016 to license online gambling operators, but shut down the program last year. In a state of the nation address in July, President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said the industry had morphed into a hotbed of cyberscamming, money laundering and human trafficking. Hofmann said online gambling sites often spring up from physical casinos and can turbocharge their criminal activities. 'Taking advantage of the online space, these operations function around the clock and are theoretically accessible from anywhere in the world, so the reach and volume of both licit and illicit funds processed are much larger. They also offer easier ways to integrate crypto transactions and reduce customer touchpoints, making them highly attractive for money laundering,' he said. In a 2023 report, the UNODC said Southeast Asia’s transnational crime syndicates had effectively turned the region’s casinos and online betting sites into their own shadow banking network, using them to move and launder tens, if not hundreds, of billions of dollars a year in earnings from illegal gambling, drug trafficking, cyberscams and other organized crime. Besides the Philippines, many of those casinos and betting sites operate just across the border from Thailand in Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. Amanda Gore, director of the Center for Global Advancement and a forensic accountant who has investigated financial crime around the world, said Thailand’s neighborhood puts the country at high risk of having its own online gambling industry exploited. 'Because they’ve got the same sort of geographical issues … the drug trafficking, the organized crime; it’s all in that area. So, they’re going to have to be extremely strict, and if they’re not then it’s probably going to end up going the same way as the Philippines,' she told VOA. Gore said the operators behind these online gambling sites often move from jurisdiction to jurisdiction in search of the most permissive conditions, and warned that some of those recently shut out of the Philippines could look to Thailand next unless it passes strong laws and backs them up with strict enforcement. 'The key is going to be whether they have a strong enforcement presence behind those regulations and laws as well, because if they don’t, I think it’s going to be very, very vulnerable to the criminal groups in the region, particularly from the money laundering perspective,' she said. Government officials have said they are aware of the risks and insisted they would only roll out the casinos and online gambling licenses with the necessary guardrails, but they have yet to provide any details. Spokespersons for the prime minister’s office and the ministries of interior and digital economy and society did not reply to VOA’s requests for elaboration. Rangsiman Rome, an opposition lawmaker in Thailand’s House of Representatives who chairs the committee on national security, told VOA that he supports the legalization of casinos and a limited online gambling industry in principle but believes the government is not yet up to the task of managing either safely. 'The current law, including law enforcement, is not enough to protect Thai society from the gray capital, the mafia or … money laundering,' he said. 'Because now the money laundering already happens, it happens every day, and it looks like the Thai authorities don’t know how to stop this.' Rangsiman said the government should give itself, lawmakers and the public more time to study and debate the pros and cons before pressing ahead, and that it should focus on rooting out the corruption in the agencies that would be tasked with enforcing any new laws on casinos and gambling first. Thailand has arrested dozens of police officers for running or protecting underground gambling operations in recent years. 'We see a lot of corruption that happens in Thailand, so we have to fix this before we allow the casinos,' Rangsiman said. Gore suggested Thailand study well-established gambling commissions such as the United Kingdom’s, which she said could offer useful lessons on how to sanction operators that fail to follow the rules. The UNODC’s Hofmann said Thailand should also focus on making sure its regulators carefully vet casino investors and players, and consider foregoing online gambling and cryptocurrency payments altogether. 'Even then, risks will remain,' he said, 'as we have seen with organized crime infiltrating casino sectors around the world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/money-laundering-fears-hang-over-thailand-s-online-gambling-plans-/7942266.html	2025-01-19T05:36:50-08:00	
Taliban minister urges leadership to lift Afghan female education ban	Islamabad — A senior Taliban leader has publicly criticized his government’s policy of prohibiting female education in Afghanistan, calling it a 'personal choice' rather than an interpretation of Islamic law, or Sharia. The rare public rebuke from Sher Abbas Stanikzai, the Taliban deputy foreign minister, comes amid persistent international calls for Afghanistan’s rulers to permit girls’ education in secondary schools and beyond, as well as to remove restrictions on women’s access to public life at large. The Taliban seized power in Afghanistan in 2021, and their reclusive leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, has introduced his strict interpretation of Sharia to govern the conflict-ravaged country through dozens of edicts, primarily curbing girls’ access to education beyond the sixth grade and prohibiting most women in workplaces and public life at large. 'We call on the leadership of the Islamic Emirate [Taliban] to make education accessible to everyone,' Stanikzai told a religious seminary graduation ceremony in the Afghan border province of Khost. 'There is no justification for denying this, just as there was no justification for it in the past, and there shouldn't be one at all,' he asserted in a speech Afghan TOLO news aired Sunday, following the ceremony the day before. Stanikzai suggested that the world is critical of the Taliban’s curbs on women and 'this is precisely the problem' that they have with the Afghan government, which has not been officially recognized by any country, primarily over its treatment of the female population. 'Today, we are committing an injustice against 20 million people out of a total population of 40 million. We have stripped them of all their rights by closing the doors to schools and universities for them, giving them away as compensation in personal disputes, and preventing them from choosing their husbands,' Stanikzai said. 'Are we truly following Sharia? … The path we are currently following is guided by personal choice, not Sharia,' he said. Stanikzai has been publicly speaking out against bans on female education, but his latest relatively harsh remarks represent the first direct challenge to the edicts issued by Akhudzada from his base in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar that primarily targeted women. The Taliban regained power after years of launching insurgent attacks against U.S.-led international forces, which ultimately withdrew from Afghanistan in August 2021. This withdrawal was a result of a February 2020 agreement negotiated between then-President Donald Trump’s administration and the Taliban, with Stanikzai leading the insurgents in the discussions. In a speech earlier this month, Stanikzai described Trump, who is set to return to the U.S. presidency Monday, as a 'decisive' and 'courageous' U.S. leader, predicting a shift in Washington’s policies toward Afghanistan under the new Trump administration. 'We hope that he takes positive steps forward. We will also come forth, God willing. We want to build good relations with the international community and the Western countries,' Stanikzai said. The United Nations and global human rights defenders have persistently denounced Taliban restrictions on women. Last August, the Taliban announced a new law on the promotion of virtue and prevention of vice, which bars women from traveling or using public transportation without a male guardian. The law requires women and girls to cover their faces in public and prohibits them from singing in public or letting their voices be heard outside the house. Richard Bennett, the U.N. special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Afghanistan, has documented in his reports 'an institutionalized system of discrimination, segregation, disrespect for human dignity, and exclusion of women and girls.' The Taliban banned Bennett from visiting the country in September.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-minister-urges-leadership-to-lift-afghan-female-education-ban-/7942251.html	2025-01-19T04:47:10-08:00	
ASEAN tells Myanmar junta peace, not election, is priority	LANGKAWI, MALAYSIA — Southeast Asian nations told Myanmar's military government on Sunday its plan to hold an election amid an escalating civil war should not be its priority, urging the junta to start dialogue and end hostilities immediately. The Association of Southeast Asian Nations called on the warring sides in member nation Myanmar to stop the fighting and told the junta's representative to allow unhindered humanitarian access, said Malaysia's foreign minister as the country takes over chairing ASEAN this year. 'Malaysia wants to know what Myanmar has in mind,' Malaysian Foreign Minister Mohamad Hasan told a press conference after a ministerial retreat on the island of Langkawi. 'We told them the election is not a priority. The priority now is to cease fire.' Myanmar has been in turmoil since early 2021 when its military overthrew the elected civilian government of Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, triggering pro-democracy protests that morphed into a widening armed rebellion that has taken over swaths of the country. Despite being battered on multiple fronts, its economy in tatters and dozens of political parties banned, the junta plans this year to hold an election, which critics have widely derided as a sham to keep the generals in power through proxies. Malaysia announced the appointment of former diplomat Othman Hashim as special envoy on the crisis in Myanmar, where the United Nations says humanitarian needs are at 'alarming levels,' with nearly 20 million people -- more than a third of the population -- needing help. Mohamad said Othman would visit Myanmar 'soon.' South China Sea a concern Othman is tasked with convincing all sides in Myanmar to implement ASEAN's five-point peace plan, which has made no progress since it was unveiled months after the coup. ASEAN has barred the ruling generals from attending its meetings over their failure to comply. Myanmar is represented by a senior diplomat. 'We want Myanmar to adhere to the Five-Point Consensus, to stop hostilities and have dialogue, it's very simple,' Mohamad said. 'What we want is unhindered humanitarian aid that can reach all in Myanmar.' Malaysia takes the chair of the 10-member bloc as it contends not only with the conflict in Myanmar but with Beijing's assertiveness in the South China Sea, the site of heated confrontations between ASEAN member the Philippines and China, a major source of the region's trade and investment. Vietnam and Malaysia have also protested over the conduct of Chinese vessels in their exclusive economic zones, which Beijing says are operating lawfully in its waters. China claims sovereignty over most of the South China Sea, a conduit for about $3 trillion of annual shipborne trade. China and ASEAN have committed to drafting a code of conduct for the South China Sea, but talks have moved at a snail's pace. Mohamad said ministers welcomed progress so far but 'highlighted the need to continue the momentum to expedite the code of conduct.' The foreign minister of U.S. ally the Philippines told Reuters on Saturday it was time to start negotiating thorny 'milestone issues' for the code, including its scope, whether it can be legally binding and its impact on third-party states.	https://www.voanews.com/a/asean-tells-myanmar-junta-peace-not-election-is-priority/7942175.html	2025-01-19T00:39:04-08:00	
US Treasury Department imposes sanctions on Chinese company over Salt Typhoon hack	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Treasury Department on Friday imposed sanctions on alleged hacker Yin Kecheng and cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., accusing both of being involved in a series of hacks against American telecom companies. The intrusions, known under the name Salt Typhoon, have allegedly exposed a huge swath of Americans' call logs to Chinese spies and rattled the U.S. intelligence community. In some cases, hackers are alleged to have intercepted conversations, including between prominent U.S. politicians and government officials. Some lawmakers have described them as the worst telecom hacks in U.S. history. In a statement, the Treasury described Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co. as a hacking company with strong ties to China's Ministry of State Security, an intelligence agency. It said that Yin Kecheng was based in Shanghai, had worked as a hacker for more than a decade, and also had ties to the MSS. It further alleged he was tied to the recent breach at the U.S. Treasury. Reuters was not immediately able to reach Yin Kecheng or Sichuan Juxinhe. China's embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Beijing routinely denies responsibility for cyberespionage campaigns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-department-imposes-sanctions-on-chinese-company-over-salt-typhoon-hack/7942173.html	2025-01-19T00:21:32-08:00	
Papua's noken bag symbolizes knotted legacy of resilience, identity	JAYAPURA, Indonesia — The woman carries bananas, yams and vegetables in a knotted bag on her head as she wanders through a market in a suburban area of Jayapura in eastern Indonesia. Even in the Papua capital and bigger cities of the province, a noken bag where people carry their daily essentials is a common sight. The distinctive bag, handcrafted from natural fibers like tree bark or leaves, is woven and knotted with threads of Papuan heritage. The U.N. cultural agency UNESCO recognized the traditional bag as needing urgent safeguarding in 2012 because there are fewer crafters making noken and more competition from factory-made bags. Crafter Mariana Pekei sells her handmade bags daily in Youtefa market in Jayapura, along with other women from her village. 'It is difficult to craft from the tree bark,' Pekei said. They collect the raw materials from melinjo trees or orchids, facing dangers like mosquitoes in the forest. They then process the material into thread fibers, including by spinning the fibers together in their palms and on their thighs, which can cause wounds and scar their skin. 'If it's made of yarn, we can craft, knot it directly with our hands,' Pekei said. The price of noken depends on the material as well as the craftsmanship. A small bag can be made in a day, but the bigger ones require more creativity from the maker and more precision and patience. Sometimes, the noken is colored by using natural dyes, mostly light brown or cream with some yellowish brown. 'Those are the color of Papuan people and the Papuan land,' Pekei said. With its seemingly simple yet intricate winding technique and the symbolism it holds, the noken has become a valuable item passed down from generation to generation. For people from outside Papua, noken are much desired and can be found easily at markets or souvenir stores. Despite the high transportation costs, crafters often journey from their remote villages to Jayapura, determined to sell their noken and share their craft with the city. But more than just a practical tool for carrying goods or souvenir, Pekei said that a noken serves as a powerful cultural symbol, representing the resilience, unity and creativity of the Papuan people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/papua-s-noken-bag-symbolizes-knotted-legacy-of-resilience-identity-/7941443.html	2025-01-18T23:36:15-08:00	
New documentary questions who took famous napalm attack photo	It is one of the 20th century's most memorable images: a naked girl, screaming, running from a napalm bombing during the Vietnam War. More than a half-century later, a new documentary is calling into question who took it — and the retired Associated Press photographer long credited for the photo insists it was his, while his longtime employer says it has no evidence of anyone else being behind the camera. The film about the Pulitzer Prize-winning picture, 'The Stringer,' is scheduled to debut next week at the Sundance Film Festival. Both photographer Nick Ut and his longtime employer are contesting it vigorously, and Ut's lawyer is seeking to block the premiere, threatening a defamation lawsuit. The AP, which conducted its own investigation over six months, concluded it has 'no reason to believe anyone other than Ut took the photo.' The picture of Kim Phuc running down a road in the village of Trang Bang, crying and naked because she had taken off clothes burning from napalm, instantly became symbolic of the horrors of the Vietnam War. Taken on June 8, 1972, the photo is credited to Ut, then a 21-year-old staffer in AP's Saigon bureau. He was awarded the Pulitzer a year later. Now 73, he moved to California after the war and worked for the AP for 40 years until retiring in 2017. The film's allegations open an unexpected new chapter for an image that, within hours of it being taken, was beamed around the planet and became one of the most indelible photographs of both the Vietnam War and the turbulent century that produced it. Whatever the truth, the film's investigations apparently relate only to the identity of the photographer and not the image's overall authenticity. The dispute puts the filmmakers, who call the episode 'a scandal behind the making of one of the most-recognized photographs of the 20th century,' at odds with Ut, whose work that day defined his career. It also puts them at cross purposes with the AP, a global news organization for whom accuracy is a foundational part of the business model. How did the questioning of the photo begin? It's difficult, so many years later, to overestimate the wallop that this particular image packed. Ron Burnett, an expert on images and former president of the Emily Carr University of Art and Design, called it 'earth-shattering.' 'It changed the way photos have always been thought about and broke the rules for how much violence you can show to the public,' Burnett said. The photo sat unchallenged for much of its 53-year existence. All these years later, a counter-narrative has emerged that it was instead taken by another person, someone who worked for NBC News at the time and also lives now in California. The person allegedly had delivered his film to the AP's office as a 'stringer,' a non-staff member who provides material to a news organization. The husband-and-wife team of Gary Knight, founder of the VII Foundation, and producer Fiona Turner are behind the film. On his website, Knight described 'The Stringer' as 'a story that many in our profession did not want told, and some of them continue to go to great lengths to make sure isn't told.' 'The film grapples with questions of authorship, racial injustice and journalistic ethics while shining a light on the fundamental yet often unrecognized contributions of local freelancers who provide the information we need to understand how events worldwide impact us all,' Knight wrote. Knight did not return a message seeking comment from the AP on Thursday. A representative from Sundance also did not return a message about a cease-and-desist letter from Ut's lawyer, James Hornstein, trying to stop the film's airing. Hornstein would not make Ut available for an interview, saying he anticipated future litigation. Knight and Turner met with AP in London last June about the allegations. According to the AP, filmmakers requested the news organization sign a non-disclosure agreement before they provided their evidence. AP declined. That hampered the AP's own investigation, along with the passage of time. Horst Faas, chief of photos for AP in Saigon in 1972, and Yuichi 'Jackson' Ishizaki, who developed Ut's film, are both dead. Many of the Saigon bureau's records were lost when communists took over the city, including any dealings with 'the stringer.' Negatives of photos used back then are preserved in AP's corporate archives in New York, but they provided no insight for the investigation. Still, the AP decided to release its own findings before seeing 'The Stringer' and the details of the claim that it is making. 'AP stands prepared to review any evidence and take whatever remedial action might be needed if their thesis is proved true,' the news organization said. Some who were there are sure about what happened The AP said it spoke to seven surviving people who were in Trang Bang or AP's Saigon bureau that day, and all maintain they have no reason to doubt their own conclusions that Ut had taken the photo. One was Fox Butterfield, a renowned longtime New York Times reporter, who also said that he was contacted by Turner for the documentary. 'I told them what my memory was and they didn't like it, but they just went ahead anyway,' Butterfield told AP. Another was photographer David Burnett, who said he witnessed Ut and Alexander Shimkin, a freelance photographer working primarily for Newsweek, taking photos as Kim Phuc and other children emerged from smoke following an attack. Shimkin was killed in Vietnam a month later, according to the investigation. A key source for the story in 'The Stringer' is Carl Robinson, then a photo editor for the AP in Saigon, who was initially overruled in his judgment not to use the picture. AP reached out to Robinson as part of its probe, but he said he had signed an NDA with Knight and the VII Foundation. Knight followed up, saying Robinson would only speak off the record, which the AP concluded would have prevented the news organization from setting the record straight. Robinson did not immediately reply to an email seeking comment on Thursday. On duty that day in Saigon, Robinson had concluded that Ut's picture could not be used because it would have violated standards prohibiting nudity. But Faas overruled him, and senior AP editors in New York decided to run the picture for what it conveyed about war. The AP questioned Robinson's long silence in contradicting Ut's photo credit, and showed a photo from its archives of Robinson with champagne toasting Ut's Pulitzer Prize. In a 2005 interview with corporate archives, Robinson said he thought AP 'created a monster' when it distributed the photo because much of the world's sympathies were focused on one victim, instead of war victims more broadly. Former AP correspondent Peter Arnett, who believes Ut made the image, said Robinson wrote to him after Faas' death in 2012 to make the allegation that Ut had not taken it; he said he did not want to do it while Faas was still alive. According to the AP investigation, Arnett said Robinson told him that Ut had 'gone all Hollywood' and he didn't like it. Hornstein characterized Robinson, who was dismissed by AP in 1978, as 'a guy with a 50-year vendetta against the AP.' He also questioned the long silence by the man supposedly identified in the documentary as the person who really took the photo. The lawyer also produced a statement from Kim Phuc, who said that while she has no memory of that day, her uncle has repeatedly told her that Ut took the picture and that she had no reason to doubt him. Ut also took her to the nearest hospital after the photo was taken, she wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-documentary-questions-who-took-famous-napalm-attack-photo-/7940043.html	2025-01-18T23:35:40-08:00	
Banning cellphones in schools gains popularity in US	little rock, arkansas — Arkansas' Republican Governor Sarah Huckabee Sanders and California's Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom have little in common ideologically, but the two have both been vocal supporters of an idea that's been rapidly gaining bipartisan ground in the states: Students' use of cellphones needs to be banned during the school day. At least eight states have enacted such bans over the past two years, and proposals are being considered in several more states this year. Here is a look at the push by states for such bans. Why are states banning cellphones at schools? The push for cellphone bans has been driven by concerns about the impact screen time has on children's mental health and complaints from teachers that cellphones have become a constant distraction in the classroom. Surgeon General Dr. Vivek Murthy, who has called on Congress to require warning labels on social media platforms about their effects on young people's lives, has said schools need to provide phone-free times. Nationally, 77% of U.S. schools say they prohibit cellphones at school for non-academic use, according to the National Center for Education Statistics. But that number is misleading. It does not mean students are following those bans or all those schools are enforcing them. Kim Whitman, co-founder of the Phone Free Schools Movement, said the issue is catching on because parents and teachers in both red and blue states are struggling with the consequences of kids on mobile devices. 'It doesn't matter if you live in a big city or a rural town, urban or suburban, all children are struggling and need that seven-hour break from the pressures of phones and social media during the school day,' she said. What states are enacting bans? At least eight states — California, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Minnesota, Ohio, South Carolina and Virginia — have enacted measures banning or restricting students' use of cellphones in schools. The policies range widely. Florida was the first state to crack down on phones in school, passing a 2023 law that requires all public schools to ban cellphone use during class time and block access to social media on district Wi-Fi. A 2024 California law requires the state's nearly 1,000 school districts to create their own cellphone policies by July 2026. Several other states haven't banned phones, but have encouraged school districts to enact such restrictions or have provided funding to store phones during the day. Sanders announced a pilot program last year providing grants to schools that adopt phone-free policies, and more than 100 school districts signed on. Sanders said she now wants to require all districts to ban cellphones during the school day, but the proposal will leave it to the districts on how to craft the policy. 'Teachers know [cellphones are] a huge distraction, but much bigger than that is that it is impacting the mental health of so many of our students,' Sanders told reporters on Thursday. Other governors recently calling for bans include Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire, who was sworn in this month, Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds and Nebraska Governor Jim Pillen. New York Governor Kathy Hochul has suggested she'll seek a statewide policy, but has not offered specifics. What is the opposition to the bans? The cellphone bans have faced opposition from some parents who say they need to be able to contact their children directly in case of emergency. Some parents have pointed to recent school shootings where having access to cellphones was the only way some students were able to communicate with loved ones for what they thought might be the last time. But supporters of the bans have noted that students' phones could pose additional dangers during an emergency by distracting students or by revealing their location during an active-shooter situation. Parents opposed to the ban have also said they want their children to have access to their phones for other needs, such as coordinating transportation. Keri Rodrigues, president of the National Parents Union, said she agrees about the dangers of social media for children but that the bans sought by states are too broad. Banning the devices during the school day is not going to solve underlying issues like bullying or the dangers of social media, she said. 'We have not done our job as grown-ups to try to teach our kids the skills they need to actually navigate this technology,' she said. 'We've just kicked the can down the road and thrown them into the deep end of the pool when they're by themselves after school.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/banning-cellphones-in-schools-gains-popularity-in-us/7940051.html	2025-01-18T23:19:48-08:00	
Chili paste heats up dishes and warms hearts at northeastern Tunisia's harissa festival	NABEUL, Tunisia — For years, Tunisians have been picking bright red peppers, combining them with garlic, vinegar and spices and turning them into a saucy spread called harissa. The condiment is a national staple, found in homes, restaurants and food stalls throughout the coastal North African nation. Brick-red, spicy and tangy, it can be scooped up on bread drizzled with olive oil or dabbed onto plates of eggs, fish, stews or sandwiches. Harissa can be sprinkled atop merguez sausages, smeared on savory pastries called brik or sandwiches called fricassées. In Nabeul, the largest city in Tunisia's harissa-producing Cap Bon region, local chef and harissa specialist Chahida Boufayed called it 'essential to Tunisian cuisine.' 'Harissa is a love story,' she said at a festival held in honor of the chili paste sauce in the northeastern Tunisian city of Nabeul earlier this month. 'I don't make it for the money.' Aficionados from across Tunisia and the world converged on the 43-year-old mother's stand to try her recipe. Surrounded by strings of drying baklouti red peppers, she described how she grows her vegetables and blends them with spices to make harissa. The region's annual harissa festival has grown in the two-plus years since the United Nations cultural organization, UNESCO, recognized the sauce on a list of items of intangible cultural heritage, said Zouheir Belamin, the president of the association behind the event. He said its growing prominence worldwide was attracting new tourists to Tunisia, specifically to Nabeul. UNESCO in 2022 called harissa 'an integral part of domestic provisions and the daily culinary and food traditions of Tunisian society, adding it to a list of traditions and practices that mark intangible cultural heritage including Ukrainian borscht and Cuban rum. Already popular across North Africa as well as in France, the condiment is gaining popularity throughout the world from the United States to China. Seen as sriracha's North African cousin, harissa is typically prepared by women who sun-dry harvested red peppers and then deseed, wash and ground them. Its name comes from 'haras' – the Arabic verb for 'to crush' – because of the next stage in the process. The finished peppers are combined with a mixture of garlic cloves, vinegar, salt, olive oil and spices in a mortar and pestle to make a fragrant blend. Variants on display at Nabeul's Jan. 3-5 festival used cumin, coriander and different spice blends or types of peppers, including smoked ones, to create pastes ranging in color from burgundy to crimson. 'Making harissa is an art. If you master it, you can create wonders,' Boufayed said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chili-paste-heats-up-dishes-and-warms-hearts-at-northeastern-tunisia-s-harissa-festival/7938697.html	2025-01-18T23:17:14-08:00	
Netanyahu says ceasefire will not begin unless Hamas provides list of hostages	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Sunday the Israel-Hamas ceasefire set to go into effect at 8:30 a.m., local time, would not start as scheduled unless Hamas provided a list of hostages set for release Sunday. 'The prime minister instructed the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] that the ceasefire, which is supposed to go into effect at 8:30 a.m., will not begin until Israel has the list of released abductees that Hamas has pledged to provide,' Netanyahu’s office said Sunday. Hamas blamed the delay in sharing the names on 'technical' reasons, adding in a statement that it was 'affirming its commitment' to the ceasefire deal that was announced last week. 'The delay in providing the names of those to be released in the first batch is due to technical reasons,' the group said in a statement. A ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war is set to begin Sunday morning at 8:30 a.m., local time, mediator Qatar said Saturday after Israel’s Cabinet voted to approve the truce and hostage release agreement. Following a meeting that lasted more than six hours into the early morning on Saturday, the Israeli government ratified the agreement that could lead to a permanent end to the 15-month war with Hamas in the besieged Gaza enclave. 'The government has approved the framework for the return of the hostages. The framework for the hostages’ release will come into effect on Sunday,' Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. Netanyahu’s office said the deal 'supports achieving the objectives of the war.' But later on Saturday, Netanyahu said Israel will not proceed with the ceasefire until it gets the list of the 33 hostages who will be released by Hamas in the first phase of the deal, according to media reports. 'Israel will not tolerate violations of the agreement. The sole responsibility lies with Hamas,' Netanyahu said in a statement on social media platform X. Also on Saturday, Israel’s ultra-nationalist National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir quit Netanyahu’s Cabinet in protest over the ceasefire deal, according to media reports. He previously said the deal was 'reckless' and that it would 'erase the achievements of the war.' In a Saturday statement, Hamas — designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain and other Western countries — contended that Israel had 'failed to achieve its aggressive goals' and 'only succeeded in committing war crimes that disgrace the dignity of humanity.' The war in Gaza began when Hamas launched a terror attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages. Of those hostages, just under 100 are thought to remain in Hamas custody, but about one-third are believed to be dead. Gaza authorities say nearly 47,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in subsequent Israeli military operations. Without providing evidence, Israel says the death toll includes thousands of militants it has killed. The U.S. and Qatar and Egypt, which have been mediating negotiations between Israel and Hamas for months, announced the ceasefire on Wednesday. The ceasefire will begin with a three-week pause in fighting, and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Thirty-three of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages, including women, children, men over 50 and ill and wounded captives, are expected to be released in this phase. In return, Israel will release almost 2,000 Palestinians from its jails. The White House said it expects three female hostages to be released to Israel in the afternoon through the Red Cross. Israel’s Justice Ministry published their details early on Saturday, plus the cease-fire agreement, which said 30 Palestinian prisoners would be released for each female hostage on Sunday. After Sunday, lead U.S. negotiator Brett McGurk said the agreement calls for four more female hostages to be released after seven days, followed by the release of three further hostages every seven days. In this first phase of the three-stage deal, Israeli troops also will pull back to the edges of Gaza, and many Palestinians will be able to return to what remains of their homes as increased aid flows into the enclave, which has been decimated in the war. Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said Saturday the deal provides for the entry of 600 trucks per day into Gaza, including 50 trucks of fuel. Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued since the cease-fire was announced, including on Saturday. Israeli tanks shelled the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City, while airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza, according to residents. Medics in Gaza said five people were killed in an airstrike that hit a tent in the Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The Israeli army said it conducted strikes on 50 'terror targets' across the territory on Friday alone, the army said in a statement on Saturday. At least 123 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks since the ceasefire was announced a few days ago, according to the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-says-ceasefire-will-not-begin-unless-hamas-provides-list-of-hostages-/7942164.html	2025-01-18T23:06:46-08:00	
TikTok goes dark for US users; company pins hope on Trump	WASHINGTON — TikTok stopped working in the United States late on Saturday and disappeared from Apple and Google app stores ahead of a law that takes effect Sunday requiring the shutdown of the app used by 170 million Americans. President-elect Donald Trump said earlier in the day he would 'most likely' give TikTok a 90-day reprieve from the ban after he takes office on Monday, a promise TikTok cited in a notice posted to users on the app. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, told users attempting to use the app around 10:45 p.m. ET (0345 GMT): 'A law banning TikTok has been enacted in the U.S. Unfortunately, that means you can't use TikTok for now. We are fortunate that President Trump has indicated that he will work with us on a solution to reinstate TikTok once he takes office. Please stay tuned.' Other apps owned by ByteDance, including video editing app Capcut and lifestyle social app Lemon8, were also offline and unavailable in U.S. app stores as of late Saturday. 'The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it's appropriate,' Trump told NBC. 'If I decide to do that, I'll probably announce it on Monday.' It was not clear if any U.S. users could still access the app, but it was no longer working for many users and people seeking to access it through a web application were met with the same message that TikTok was no longer working. TikTok, which has captivated nearly half of all Americans, powered small businesses and shaped online culture, warned on Friday it would go dark in the U.S. on Sunday unless President Joe Biden's administration provides assurances to companies such as Apple and Google that they will not face enforcement actions when a ban takes effect. Under a law passed last year and upheld on Friday by a unanimous Supreme Court, the platform has until Sunday to cut ties with its China-based parent or shut down its U.S. operation to resolve concerns it poses a threat to national security. The White House reiterated on Saturday that it was up to the incoming administration to take action. 'We see no reason for TikTok or other companies to take actions in the next few days before the Trump administration takes office on Monday,' press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. TikTok did not respond to a request for comment on the new White House statement. The Chinese Embassy in Washington on Friday accused the U.S. of using unfair state power to suppress TikTok. 'China will take all necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,' a spokesperson said. Users move to alternatives Uncertainty over the app's future had sent users -- mostly younger people -- scrambling to alternatives including China-based RedNote. Rivals Meta and Snap had also seen their share prices rise this month ahead of the ban, as investors bet on an influx of users and advertising dollars. 'This is my new home now,' wrote one user in a RedNote post, tagged with the words 'tiktokrefugee' and 'sad.' Minutes after TikTok's U.S. shutdown, other users took to X, formerly called Twitter. 'I didn’t really think that they would cut off TikTok. Now I’m sad and I miss the friends I made there. Hoping it all comes back in just a few days,' wrote @RavenclawJedi. NordVPN, a popular virtual private network, or VPN, allowing users to access the internet from servers around the world, said it was 'experiencing temporary technical difficulties.' Web searches for 'VPN' spiked in the minutes after U.S. users lost access to TikTok, according to Google Trends. Users on Instagram fretted about whether they would still receive merchandise they had bought on TikTok Shop, the video platform's e-commerce arm. Marketing firms reliant on TikTok have rushed to prepare contingency plans this week in what one executive described as a 'hair on fire' moment after months of conventional wisdom saying that a solution would materialize to keep the app running. There have been signs TikTok could make a comeback under Trump, who has said he wants to pursue a 'political resolution' of the issue and last month urged the Supreme Court to pause implementation of the ban. TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew plans to attend the U.S. presidential inauguration and attend a rally with Trump on Sunday, a source told Reuters. Suitors including former Los Angeles Dodgers owner Frank McCourt have expressed interest in the fast-growing business that analysts estimate could be worth as much as $50 billion. Media reports say Beijing has also held talks about selling TikTok's U.S. operations to billionaire and Trump ally Elon Musk, though the company has denied that. U.S. search engine startup Perplexity AI submitted a bid on Saturday to ByteDance for Perplexity to merge with TikTok U.S., a source familiar with the company's plans told Reuters. Perplexity would merge with TikTok U.S. and create a new entity by combining the merged company with other partners, the person added. Privately held ByteDance is about 60% owned by institutional investors such as BlackRock and General Atlantic, while its founders and employees own 20% each. It has more than 7,000 employees in the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiktok-stops-working-for-us-users-disappears-from-apple-google-stores/7942155.html	2025-01-18T21:20:36-08:00	
As Trump returns to White House, his family circle looks different	When Donald Trump returns to the White House on Monday, his family circle will look a little different than it did when he first arrived eight years ago. His youngest son, Barron, was in fifth grade back then. He's now a college freshman who towers over his 1.8-meter-plus dad. Granddaughter Kai, who was 9 in 2017, is now an aspiring social media influencer and impressive golfer. Grandson Joseph, who posed in Trump's lap with a Lego model of the White House last time, is 11 now. After working in his first administration, the most prominent relatives in Trump's political sphere, daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared, are now in Florida. Family members can provide presidents with a ready source of moral and sounding-board support, companionship and even relief from the world's problems. The president-elect has five children — three of whom are married — from his marriages to Ivana Trump, Marla Maples and current wife Melania Trump. He has 10 grandchildren, with an 11th on the way. A look at Trump's family circle, then and now: Melania Trump, Trump's wife THEN: She spent the opening months of Trump's term at the family's Manhattan penthouse so that 11-year-old Barron wouldn't have to switch schools in the middle of the year. After moving to the White House, she traveled around the United States and to other countries, alone and with Trump, partly to promote her 'Be Best' children's initiative while fiercely guarding her privacy. NOW: She avoided active campaigning during Trump's 2024 run, limiting her public appearances to key moments, such as the campaign's launch, the Republican National Convention and election night. She released a self-titled memoir late last year and will be the subject of a documentary distributed by Amazon Prime Video that is expected to be released this year. While some doubt that Trump's 54-year-old wife will spend much time at the White House, she said on Fox News' Fox & Friends that she has already packed and picked out the furniture she wants to take to the executive mansion. Donald Trump Jr., Trump's eldest son THEN: Trump's eldest son, now 46, campaigned for his father in 2016 and 2020. NOW: Trump Jr.'s influence has grown to the point that he lobbied his father to choose close friend JD Vance for vice president. He also pushed for former Democratic Representative Tulsi Gabbard and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the president-elect's picks for director of national intelligence and health and human services, respectively. Trump Jr. helps run the family real estate business and is an honorary chairman of Trump's transition. He has a podcast and has said his role is to prevent 'bad actors' from getting into the administration. He recently flew on his father's airplane to Greenland; the president-elect has expressed a desire to take control of the mineral-rich Danish territory. Trump Jr. has five children — or 'smurfs,' as he sometimes refers to them — with his former wife, Vanessa Trump. They are Kai Madison, 17; Donald John III, 15; Tristan Milos, 13; Spencer Frederick, 12; and Chloe Sophia Trump, 10. Ivanka Trump, Trump's eldest daughter THEN: Ivanka, 43, campaigned for her father in 2016 and moved her family from New York City to Washington to work in his White House as a senior adviser. She was on the campaign trail in 2020, too, but she and her family moved to Florida and retreated from the spotlight after his loss. NOW: As Trump geared up for the 2024 run, Ivanka announced that she loved and supported him but was getting out of politics to focus on her husband and their three kids. She did, however, join her father and other family members on election night and when he rang the bell at the New York Stock Exchange in early December after Time magazine named him Person of the Year. Ivanka and her husband have three children: Arabella Rose, 13; Joseph Frederick, 11; and Theodore James Kushner, 8. Eric Trump, Trump's second son THEN: The 40-year-old helped run the family business and participated in his father's campaigns. NOW: Eric is also an honorary chair of the transition and a close adviser to his father. But he continues to focus more on running the family business. In September, he and his brother started a crypto platform called World Liberty Financial, and their father helped launch it in an interview on the X social media platform. Eric and his wife, Lara, have two children: Eric Luke, 7, and Carolina Dorothy Trump, 5. Tiffany Trump, Trump's youngest daughter THEN: Trump's daughter with second wife Marla Maples was 23 and a recent University of Pennsylvania graduate who kept a low profile when Trump was first elected. NOW: She was more present in the 2024 campaign but still largely avoids the spotlight. Tiffany, 31, and her husband, Michael Boulos, are expecting their first child this year. Boulos is a businessman who traveled with Trump in the final stretch of the campaign. His father is Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman who helped Trump with the influential Arab American community in the swing state of Michigan. Trump has named Massad Boulos to be a senior adviser on Arab and Middle Eastern affairs. Barron Trump, Trump's youngest son THEN: At the start of Trump's first term, Barron and his mother stayed at the family's Trump Tower penthouse in Manhattan so he could finish his school year. When they got to Washington, his soccer net appeared in what's known as the first lady's garden. NOW: Barron, 18, is a freshman New York University business student. His parents and Trump campaign officials credit him for recommending podcasts popular with young men that the president-elect appeared on during the campaign. Barron will have a bedroom in the White House, Melania Trump said on Fox & Friends. 'I'm very proud of him, about his knowledge, even about politics and giving an advice to his father,' his mother said on the program. 'He brought in so many young people. He knows his generation.' Lara Trump, Trump's daughter-in-law THEN: Trump's daughter-in-law, 42, campaigned for him during all his runs. After Trump lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020, she considered running for a U.S. Senate seat from her home state of North Carolina but ultimately decided against it. She became a Fox News commentator. NOW: As Trump revved up his 2024 campaign, he installed his daughter-in-law as co-chair of the Republican National Committee, where she was a TV-ready advocate overseeing fundraising, voter outreach and the party's 'election integrity' initiative. She stepped down from the RNC after the election and removed her name from consideration as a possible successor to Florida Senator Marco Rubio, Trump's choice for secretary of state. Lara Trump is passionate about fitness and has her own line of activewear. Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law THEN: Kushner, 44, was also a key figure in Trump's 2016 campaign. He joined his wife in the White House as a senior adviser, a role that included working on U.S. policy toward Israel and the broader Middle East. NOW: Kushner has stepped out of the political spotlight — but his father could soon step in. Trump announced after the election that he intends to nominate Charles Kushner, a real estate developer, to be U.S. ambassador to France. The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after he pleaded guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign contributions. Kai Trump, one of Trump's granddaughters THEN: Kai was in elementary school when her grandfather became president. NOW: Donald Trump Jr.'s 17-year-old granddaughter is an aspiring social media influencer. Her behind-the-scenes video from election night garnered 3.7 million views on YouTube. Other posts related to her grandfather have been watched millions more times on TikTok. Kai delivered her first public speech at the Republican convention and is an avid golfer who sometimes plays with her grandfather. Arabella Kushner, one of Trump's granddaughters THEN: Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner's daughter was 6 when her grandfather showed China's Xi Jinping a video of her, in a traditional Chinese dress, belting out Chinese-language songs. 'It's very good, right? She's very smart,' Trump said. Xi responded that Arabella was her grandfather's 'little angel' and a 'messenger of China-U.S. relations.' NOW: Arabella is 13 and enjoys singing, playing the piano, horseback riding and Brazilian jiu-jitsu, according to a social media post from her mother.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7942106.html	2025-01-18T18:38:19-08:00

Niger journalist held after channel suspended, association says	NIAMEY, NIGER — A major journalist in Niger was in custody Saturday, an association said, a day after the private TV channel he runs was suspended following a report critical of the military-led regime. Seyni Amadou, editor in chief of Canal 4 TV, has been arrested, said CAP-Medias-Niger, which represents media workers in the country. On Friday, Niger's communications ministry announced the channel had been taken off the air for a month. State television channel Tele Sahel said Canal 3 TV had been punished 'for violating the rules of ethics and deontology.' Canal 3 told AFP in a statement that the suspension was 'linked to a broadcast on the ranking of ministers' in the government of Prime Minister Ali Mahaman Lamine Zeine, a civilian appointed by the military regime. In the report's ranking, Zeine was placed first and several of his ministers were called the 'soft underbelly' of the government. CAP said in a statement Friday it regretted Amadou's arrest and detention and called for the rights of journalists to be respected. 'Never in the history of media regulation in Niger has the decision to suspend a media been taken by the executive, including in so-called exceptional periods,' it added. CAP called on Communications Minister Sidi Raliou Mohamed to reconsider his decision. Niger lies 80th out of 180 countries on the 2024 Press Freedom Index published by Paris-based media rights campaigners Reporters Without Borders (RSF). Already in November, another journalist at Canal 3, Serge Mathurin Adou, was detained and later convicted on allegations he attempted to destabilize fellow junta-led Sahel nation Burkina Faso. General Abdourahamane Tiani, the chief of Niger's powerful presidential guard, in 2023 ousted president Mohamed Bazoum, a key ally of the West in fighting jihadis in sub-Saharan Africa. Since the coup, Niger's military rulers have turned their back on former colonial power France and forged ties with fellow juntas in Burkina Faso and Mali, as well as with Russia. It has also blocked international channels including Radio France International (RFI), France 24 and the BBC.	https://www.voanews.com/a/niger-journalist-held-after-channel-suspended-association-/7942127.html	2025-01-18T17:35:22-08:00	
Rubio vows to oppose Thai Uyghur deportations as US secretary of state	WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, is pledging to press Thailand to prevent the deportation of 48 Uyghurs held there since 2014 after fleeing alleged persecution in Xinjiang, in northwest China. 'Thailand is a very strong U.S. partner, a strong historical ally,' Rubio said during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday. 'That is an area where I think diplomacy could really achieve results because of how important that relationship is and how close it is.' Describing the Uyghurs' plight in China as 'one of the most horrifying things that has ever happened,' he said, 'These are people who are basically being rounded up because of their ethnicity and religion, and they are being put into camps … stripped of their identity… and into forced labor — literally, slave labor.' Human rights advocates say returning the Uyghurs to China risks torture, long imprisonment, or disappearance. Rubio, a leading critic of Beijing, co-sponsored the 2021 Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act, which bans imports from Xinjiang unless free of forced labor. His stance for human rights in China has subjected him to Chinese sanctions since 2020. China refutes accusations of genocide Both the Biden and previous Trump administrations have classified China's actions in Xinjiang as genocide, while a 2022 United Nations report said Beijing's policies may constitute crimes against humanity. China rejects these accusations, framing its actions as anti-terrorism measures. The Chinese Embassy in Bangkok claimed on Wednesday that Uyghur detainees in Thailand had terrorist ties. 'A small number of individuals, enticed by external forces, fled abroad and even joined the 'East Turkestan Islamic Movement,' [ETIM] a terrorist organization recognized by the United Nations, becoming terrorists themselves,' the embassy stated. Although ETIM was listed as a terror group in 2002, the U.S. delisted it in 2020, citing no 'clear and convincing evidence of ETIM's existence,' according to Congressional Research Service. Julie Millsap, government relations manager at the Washington-based group No Business With Genocide, dismissed China's claims. There has been 'no evidence presented to link these men to terrorism,' Millsap told VOA. 'The PRC cannot claim concurrently that it has a population of happy, dancing Uyghurs while labeling asylum seekers as extremists.' Arslan Hidayat, team lead of the Save Uyghur campaign by U.S.-based Justice for All, said Uyghur detainees in Thailand recently faced a troubling development. 'Last week, I learned from the detainees that Thai immigration officers attempted to photograph 43 Uyghur detainees and have them sign documents similar to those used in 2015, when more than 100 Uyghurs were forcibly repatriated to China,' Hidayat told VOA Friday. 'Fearing a repeat of that mass deportation, the detainees refused and launched a hunger strike, which continues to this day,' he said. 'Degrading treatment or even torture' In addition to the 43 Uyghurs in Thailand's IDC, five are imprisoned after a failed escape attempt. A U.N. report cited 'degrading treatment or even torture' and five deaths, including two children, urging Thai authorities against deportation without due process and individual protection assessments. Human Rights Watch on Friday urged Thailand to release detained Uyghurs and grant them safe passage to a third country. 'Successive Thai governments have kept the Uyghurs in inhumane detention, while under pressure from the Chinese government to send them to China,' said Elaine Pearson, Asia director at Human Rights Watch, calling on Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra's government to end this cycle. VOA contacted the Thai Embassy in Washington and the Thai Foreign Affairs Ministry for comment on the Uyghurs' status and the reports of potential repatriation but received no response. Babar Baloch, global spokesperson for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, told VOA the agency is closely monitoring the situation and has sought assurances from Thai authorities. 'We continue to remind the authorities of their obligations on non-refoulement and to advocate for alternatives to detention,' he said Friday. Zumretay Arkin, vice president of the Munich-based World Uyghur Congress, cited ongoing discussions between China and Thailand about deportations in the context of the 50th anniversary of their diplomatic relations. 'We remain concerned about their fate and continue to increase public pressure,' Arkin told VOA, adding that her group had called on partner organizations to organize global protests outside Thai diplomatic missions. Family torn apart Rahile, a 32-year-old Uyghur mother of three living in Turkey, has been separated from her husband, detained in Bangkok for nearly a decade. She asked that his name not be used, fearing reprisal from Thai authorities. 'We had just built our home [in Xinjiang] and were living a normal life when everything turned into a nightmare 12 years ago,' she told VOA from Kayseri, Turkey, requesting her last name be withheld to protect relatives in southern Xinjiang. Their ordeal began in 2013 when a Uyghur working for the Chinese government warned her husband that his name was on a detention list as authorities targeted Uyghur men under vague suspicions of alleged separatism and extremism. 'My husband learned of an escape route and asked if I would follow or stay behind,' Rahile said. 'People around us were disappearing. He had no choice but to leave.' The couple fled without passports, relying on smugglers to cross into Southeast Asia. Intercepted in Thailand in 2014, Rahile and her two young sons spent 18 months in detention before Turkey resettled more than 170 women and children. Her husband remained with more than 150 Uyghur migrants in Thailand. Weeks later, over 100 Uyghurs were forcibly deported to China. 'They were never heard from again,' she said. 'I was relieved my husband was still in Thailand. I hoped we'd reunite soon.' A decade later, her youngest son, born in Thai detention, has never met his father. 'The space was so cramped my children could sleep, but I had to stand,' she said. 'Now, my husband has endured that pain for 11 years.' In Turkey, Rahile juggles jobs to support her family after initial aid from the local community. 'My children ask why their father isn't here,' she said. 'I have no answer for them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-vows-to-oppose-thai-uyghur-deportations-as-us-secretary-of-state/7942121.html	2025-01-18T17:27:22-08:00	
Macron praises World War II French Resistance activist, author	PARIS — France's President Emmanuel Macron has paid tribute to former French Resistance activist and author Genevieve Callerot, who has died at age 108. Callerot, who was among the last survivors of the groups that fought the country's World War II occupation by Nazi Germany, died Thursday in a care home in Saint-Aulaye-Puymangou, a town in the Dordogne region of southwestern France where she had lived since childhood, according to local media reports. A statement from the presidential Elysee Palace said Macron offered 'his heartfelt condolences to her loved ones, to all those who were illuminated by her solar presence, and finally to those whose lives she saved.' Callerot 'takes with her a little piece of France, a certain France that is tough on suffering and intimidation, tender toward the beauty of the world, as quick to raise its fist in the face of oppression as it is to extend its hand,' the statement said. Born in 1916, Callerot was 24 when France surrendered to Adolf Hitler's invasion forces in June 1940, an event 'which forever marked her life and revealed her to herself,' the statement said. It said she and her family joined a Resistance network that smuggled people across the demarcation line that separated Nazi-occupied areas that included Paris, northern France and the country's Atlantic seaboard and the so-called free zone governed by the French Vichy administration that collaborated with the Nazi occupiers. She participated in the escape of 200 men and women, including Jews and American and British war-wounded, 'whose lives she saved with anonymous heroism, and who often never knew what they owed' her, Macron's office said. It said German forces took her into custody three times — twice releasing her for lack of evidence and holding her in prison for several weeks the third time. She and her husband worked as farmers after the war. When she was 67, she published her first novel — Les cinq filles du Grand-Barrail, or The Five Girls of Grand-Barrail — about a family of sharecroppers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-praises-world-war-ii-french-resistance-activist-author/7942123.html	2025-01-18T17:18:43-08:00	
Trump arrives in Washington for inaugural celebrations	WASHINGTON — Donald Trump arrived in Washington on Saturday night ahead of his second inauguration as president. Trump flew in on a U.S. military C-32 aircraft from West Palm Beach, Florida, with his wife, Melania Trump, and their son, Barron, on a flight dubbed Special Air Mission 47 — a nod to Trump becoming the 47th president on Monday. It's a courtesy that's traditionally been extended by the outgoing administration to the incoming one. Trump did not make a government plane available to President Joe Biden ahead of his inauguration in 2021. Instead, the Democrat flew to Washington on a privately chartered aircraft. Trump's celebration of his return to power was set to get underway Saturday evening with a fireworks showcase at his Trump National Golf Club in Sterling, Virginia, about 30 miles outside Washington. With a blast of Arctic air expected to leave the nation's capital with frigid temperatures on Inauguration Day, organizers were also scrambling to move inside most of Monday's outdoor events, including the swearing-in ceremony. 'I think we made the right decision. We'll be very comfortable now,' Trump told NBC News in a phone interview Saturday. On Pennsylvania Avenue leading to the White House, crews were breaking down metal bleachers that would have been used for outdoor inauguration viewing stands. Timothy Wallis, 58, flew in for the inauguration from Pocatello, Idaho, with friends. The group had tickets to watch the ceremony outside but haven't been able to get tickets to any of the indoor events. 'We found out on the plane,' he said about the change of plans. Wallis said he was disappointed about the switch and a little bemused because he's used to cold weather at home. 'We left snow to come here,' he said. 'I brought my gloves!' Trump, a Republican who left office in 2021 after his refusal to accept his loss to Democrat Joe Biden, led a mob to overrun the Capitol. He then broke tradition by skipping Biden's inauguration. Biden will adhere to one of the most potent symbols of the democratic handover, welcoming Trump to the White House and joining him on the ride to the Capitol before Trump takes the oath of office. The first time Trump was sworn into office eight years ago, the former reality TV star billionaire came in as an outsider disrupting Washington's norms, delivering a dark inaugural address as his swearing-in drew large protests and some clashes in the street. On Saturday, the protests were far less noticeable, eclipsed by the ceremonies and celebrations around Trump's taking power. As one more marker of Trump's remarkable comeback, the events surrounding his inauguration will be more celebrity-studded than the last time, along with a noticeable turnout by a cadre of tech-world billionaires. While Trump holds court at his Virginia golf club Saturday evening, Vice President-elect JD Vance will attend a reception for Cabinet members and host a dinner in Washington. On Sunday, the eve of his inauguration, Trump is scheduled to participate in a wreath-laying ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery before heading to a rally at Capital One Arena in Washington. The rally will be followed by a private dinner. On Inauguration Day, Trump will start with the traditional prayer service at St. John's Episcopal Church before heading to the White House for a customary tea with the outgoing president and first lady. Trump then heads to the Capitol, where his ceremony has been moved indoors. It's not quite clear how the ceremony will be adapted to the Capitol Rotunda, which holds 600 people. More than 250,000 guests were ticketed to view the inauguration from around the Capitol grounds. After Trump takes the oath of office and delivers his inaugural address, there will be a ceremonial farewell to Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris. As the new Republican government takes power, Trump will head to a signing ceremony at the Capitol to approve some of his first official acts, followed by a congressional luncheon and review of U.S. troops. The planned traditional parade down Pennsylvania Avenue has morphed into an indoor event because of the cold, with Trump again planning to speak to his gathered supporters before he heads to the White House for a signing ceremony in the Oval Office. A trio of glitzy balls will follow in the evening, punctuated by musical performances.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-arrives-in-washington-for-inaugural-celebrations-/7942119.html	2025-01-18T16:56:45-08:00	
Journalists in Haiti demand justice, bury 2nd colleague killed by gangs	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — The young boy wore a suit and bow tie to his stepfather's funeral Saturday, where he demanded a handkerchief and wiped tears off his mother's face as they buried Marckendy Natoux, one of two journalists killed by gangs in Haiti. Natoux was fatally shot on Christmas Eve in one of the worst attacks on the press in the troubled Caribbean country, with gangs opening fire during what was supposed to be the reopening of Haiti's largest public hospital. The 42-year-old father of two spoke four languages and worked for several local and U.S. media outlets. He also taught English and Spanish and was known for his kindness. 'Natoux was a protector of journalists,' recalled Oriol Jacklin, a journalist with Radio Regard FM. 'He worked with everyone and respected everybody.' Natoux did marketing for Voice of America's Creole service and worked for the U.S. Agency for Global Media and the Boston Caribbean Network, among others. On December 24, he traveled to downtown Port-au-Prince with other journalists to cover the anticipated reopening of Haiti's General Hospital, which gangs had pillaged. Shortly after he arrived, gunmen opened fire. 'He was killed for bringing news to the world,' said Natoux's colleague, René Celias. Johnson 'Izo' Andre, considered Haiti's most powerful gang leader and part of the Viv Ansanm coalition of gangs that have taken control of 85% of Port-au-Prince, posted a video on social media claiming responsibility. He said he had not authorized the hospital's reopening. Natoux's colleague, Jacalin, also blamed the government for the attack, which led to the health minister being replaced. 'You shouldn't invite someone to cover a media event in an area you know is dangerous,' Jacalin said. 'The negligence of the government took the life of two journalists, one police officer and left five other journalists with bullet wounds and awaiting surgeries.' Also killed was Jimmy Jean, a 44-year-old father of six who worked for the online news outlet Moun Afe Bon. He was buried Thursday. Robest Dimanche, spokesperson for the Online Media Collective, a group that defends the rights of online journalists in Haiti, said Natoux was 'full of talent and integrity' as he condemned both killings. 'This was a very dark day,' he said. 'We are asking the authorities to not let this crime go unpunished.' But it's unlikely those responsible will be brought to justice. Last year, the Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) ranked Haiti as one of the top offenders worldwide in letting journalists' murders go unpunished. At least seven murders remain unsolved since 2019. Natoux and Jean were among the more than 5,600 people reported killed across Haiti last year despite the launch of a United Nations backed mission led by Kenyan police to help quell gang violence. On Saturday, an additional 217 Kenyan officers arrived to join 400 others who arrived last year as the U.S. and other countries seek a U.N. peacekeeping mission, warning that the current mission lacks funding and personnel. As friends and family mourned Natoux on Saturday, his small stepson used a handkerchief to wipe tears off his mother's face and then wiped his own as a family friend cradled the boy's head and whispered something in his ear. When the funeral ended, loved ones lifted Natoux's coffin high into the air. One colleague placed his hand on the Haitian flag draped over it as anguished wails filled the church.	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalists-in-haiti-demand-justice-bury-2nd-colleague-killed-by-gangs-/7941920.html	2025-01-18T15:36:28-08:00	
Kenya deploys more police officers to Haiti to tackle gang violence	NAIROBI, KENYA — Kenya's interior minister said the east African nation has deployed another 217 police officers to Haiti as part of a multinational force to curb gang violence. Kipchumba Murkomen said in a statement Saturday that the police officers left Kenya on Friday. 'The Kenya-led mission has made tremendous progress in reducing gang violence, earning praise across the globe,' said Mukomen, who shared a photo of himself with some of the officers aboard a plane. Kenya's 'commitment to this historic mission is unwavering,' he said. Kenya first sent troops to the Caribbean nation in June and the total deployment now exceeds 600. Kenya's President William Ruto has pledged to deploy 1,000 troops as part of the United Nations-backed force in Haiti. Gang violence has left more than 700,000 Haitians homeless in recent years, with many crowding into makeshift and unsanitary shelters after gunmen razed their homes. More than 5,600 people were reported killed across Haiti last year, according to the United Nations. The number of killings increased by more than 20% compared with all of 2023, according to the U.N. Human Rights Office. In addition, more than 2,200 people were reported injured and nearly 1,500 kidnapped, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-deploys-217-more-police-officers-to-haiti-to-tackle-gang-violence-/7941912.html	2025-01-18T15:09:09-08:00	
Iran unveils underground missile base amid tension with US, Israel	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran unveiled an underground naval missile base at an undisclosed Gulf location on Saturday, state TV said, two days before the start of Donald Trump's second term as president of the United States. It was unveiled at a time when tension with Washington is widely expected to rise. Iranian leaders are concerned that Trump might empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to strike Iran's nuclear sites, while tightening U.S. sanctions on its oil industry through his 'maximum pressure' policy. State television showed Revolutionary Guards chief General Hossein Salami visiting the secret base during war games. He said it was one of several built underground for vessels capable of launching long-range missiles and carrying out distant warfare. 'We assure the great nation of Iran that their young people are capable of coming out honorable and victorious from a battle on the seas against enemies big and small,' Salami said. State television said the base was built at a depth of 500 meters somewhere in the Gulf and it showed tunnels with long rows of what it said were a new version of Taregh-class radar-evading speedboats that can launch cruise missiles. Earlier this month, Iran started military exercises that are due to last two months and have already included war games in which the Revolutionary Guards defended nuclear installations in Natanz against mock attacks by missiles and drones. Iran, which says its ballistic missiles are an important deterrent and retaliatory force against the U.S. and Israel, has in the past unveiled several underground 'missiles cities.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-unveils-underground-missile-base-amid-tension-with-us-israel-/7941897.html	2025-01-18T14:32:19-08:00

Trump 'most likely' will give TikTok 90-day extension to avoid US ban	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday that he 'most likely' would give TikTok 90 more days to work out a deal that would allow the popular video-sharing platform to avoid a U.S. ban. Trump said in an NBC News interview that he had not decided what to do but was considering granting TikTok a reprieve after he is sworn into office Monday. A law that prohibits mobile app stores and internet hosting services from distributing TikTok to U.S. users takes effect Sunday. Under the law passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden last year, TikTok’s China-based parent company had nine months to sell the platform’s U.S. operation to an approved buyer. The law allows the sitting president to grant an extension if a sale is in progress. 'I think that would be, certainly, an option that we look at. 'The 90-day extension is something that will be most likely done, because it’s appropriate. You know, it’s appropriate,' Trump told 'Meet the Press' moderator Kristen Welker in a phone interview. 'We have to look at it carefully. It’s a very big situation. 'If I decide to do that, I’ll probably announce it on Monday,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7941823.html	2025-01-18T10:39:17-08:00	
When Trump takes office, it’s unclear who will lead Pentagon	WASHINGTON — It is unclear who will take over at the Pentagon and the military services when the top leaders all step down Monday as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. As of Friday, officials said they had not yet heard who will become the acting defense secretary. Officials said the military chiefs of the Army, Navy and Air Force were getting ready to step in as acting service secretaries — a rare move — because no civilians had been named or, in some cases, had turned down the opportunity. As is customary, all current political appointees will step down as of noon on Inauguration Day, leaving hundreds of key defense posts open, including dozens that require Senate confirmation. In addition to the top job and all three service secretaries, all of their deputies and senior policy staff will leave. The Senate Armed Services Committee is expected to vote Monday on Trump's choice to head the Defense Department, Pete Hegseth, but the full Senate vote may not happen until days later. As a result, someone from the Biden administration would have to take over temporarily. For the service secretaries, officials said that while things could still change before the inauguration, the Trump team is eyeing General Randy George, chief of staff of the Army, to be that service's temporary head. They said General David Allvin, chief of staff of the Air Force, and Admiral Lisa Franchetti, the Navy chief, are aware they may have to step in if no civilian is named as acting secretary, and they are preparing for that possibility. The officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were discussing internal deliberations, said many senior Biden administration leaders are reluctant to serve in the incoming Trump administration because they are concerned about policy changes they may be required to handle or enforce. Usually, only people appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate serve as a defense or service secretary, including in an acting capacity during a transition. Trump could pull a confirmed member of the Biden administration from another agency and put that person at the Pentagon. Civilian control of the military is a key tenet, but under the law the military chiefs of the services — who are all Senate confirmed — can take over on a temporary basis. It's rare, but it did happen more than 30 years ago. Arnold Punaro, a retired Marine Corps Reserve two-star general, said that in 1993, Admiral Frank Kelso, who was Navy chief, was asked to serve as acting Navy secretary when Bill Clinton became president because civilian leaders did not step up. 'It doesn’t happen very often,' said Punaro, who spent 14 years as a staff director on the Senate Armed Services Committee and has advised nominees through the confirmation process for decades. 'Normally you don’t want the active-duty military serving in the civilian control positions. The practical reality is they are wearing both hats.' The transition to a new secretary of defense has usually been an orderly process. Four years ago, the deputy secretary of defense under Trump, David Norquist, became acting secretary for the two-day gap between the inauguration of Democratic President Joe Biden and the Senate vote to confirm Lloyd Austin as Pentagon chief. President Barack Obama asked his Republican predecessor's defense secretary, Robert Gates, to stay on as his own Pentagon leader in 2009. In 2017, Jim Mattis, Trump's pick to be secretary during his first term, was confirmed on Inauguration Day. Various administrations have handled the handover differently. In many cases, people have been asked to stay on in a temporary role. In one recent instance, officials said, the comptrollers of the services stepped in as acting secretaries because a key job in the coming months is to put together the massive, complex budget and more often the money people are considered less political. This year's gap is further complicated by the fact that Trump and Hegseth have both pledged to rid the Defense Department of what they call 'woke' generals — or those who have supported diversity programs. That raises the possibility that even as the administration struggles to fill its political appointee slots, it may also be carving holes in the military leadership structure that will have to be filled. When Senator Elissa Slotkin, a Democrat from Michigan, asked Hegseth during his nomination hearing if he intended to fire the current Joint Chiefs chairman, General CQ Brown, he answered, 'Senator, every single senior officer will be reviewed based on meritocracy, standards, lethality and commitment to lawful orders they will be given.' Hegseth previously said that Brown should be fired. Conservative groups have compiled lists of generals they believe should be fired for supporting diversity programs. If Brown is fired, the vice chairman would take over until a new chairman is confirmed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/when-trump-takes-office-it-s-unclear-who-will-lead-pentagon/7941818.html	2025-01-18T10:28:44-08:00	
With Trump’s inauguration indoors, few guests will see ceremony in person	Moving the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump indoors due to expected freezing temperatures means most guests with tickets will not be able to attend the ceremony in person. 'Those with tickets for the Presidential Platform and members of Congress will be able to attend in person,' the Joint Inaugural Committee said. But the 'vast majority of ticketed guests will not be able to attend the ceremonies in person.' 'We strongly suggest people who are in Washington for the event attend other indoor events at indoor venues of their choice to watch the inauguration,' the committee said. On Inauguration Day, temperatures in the U.S. capital are expected to hit a low of 11 degrees Fahrenheit (-11 degrees Celsius) and a high of just 23 degrees Fahrenheit (-5 degrees Celsius), and it is expected to feel even colder with the wind chill. The frigid temperatures mean Trump's inauguration is expected to be the coldest in 40 years, according to meteorologists. 'I don’t want to see people hurt, or injured, in any way,' Trump said on Truth Social. President Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration in 1985 was the last time a swearing-in ceremony was moved indoors. Many of the more than 220,000 ticketed guests who had been set to watch from the U.S. Capitol grounds will be unable to watch in person as Trump takes the oath of office. The U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement that the ticketed outside areas on the West Front of the Capitol will be closed Monday. In an email to House of Representatives offices, the House Sergeant at Arms asked congressional offices to tell their constituents who had been given tickets that they were now 'commemorative' since most of them will not be able to watch in person as Trump becomes president. What’s more, 250,000 people without tickets were expected to stand on the National Mall for the outdoor ceremony, according to a permit issued to Trump’s inaugural committee by the National Park Service. Trump said supporters can watch the ceremony on screens inside the Capital One Arena, a professional sports and concert venue in downtown Washington. It holds 20,000 people. Capital One Arena also will be the site of a Sunday afternoon Trump victory rally. The American band the Village People will perform, among others. Moving Trump’s inauguration inside means it won’t be possible to compare crowd size to previous inauguration ceremonies. After his first inauguration in 2017, Trump expressed frustration with media reports indicating that the crowd on the National Mall was smaller than the one that witnessed the swearing-in of former President Barack Obama in 2009, according to reports. With Trump’s inauguration just days away, various civil rights, racial justice and reproductive health groups organized a demonstration called the People’s March in downtown Washington on Saturday. Tens of thousands of people were expected to take part in the protest against Trump. Rather than narrowly focusing on the president-elect, the demonstration is focusing on a broader set of goals around women’s and reproductive rights, LGBTQ rights, immigration, climate and democracy, organizers said. The People’s March is a rebrand of the Women’s March, when more than 1 million people filled the streets of Washington the day after Trump was sworn in for the first time in 2017, according to various media reports. Another protest is scheduled for Inauguration Day, but it’s unclear if that will be affected by the freezing temperatures. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/with-trump-s-inauguration-indoors-few-guests-will-see-ceremony-in-person/7941801.html	2025-01-18T10:00:15-08:00	
Swedish forces in Latvia make their largest NATO deployment to date	WARSAW, POLAND — Hundreds of Swedish troops arrived in Latvia on Saturday to join a Canadian-led multinational brigade along NATO's eastern flank, a mission Sweden is calling its most significant operation so far as a member of the Western defense alliance. A ship carrying parts of a mechanized infantry battalion arrived early Saturday in the port of Riga, the Latvian capital, escorted by the Swedish air force and units from the Swedish and Latvian navies, the Swedish armed forces said in a statement. Latvia borders Russia to its east and Russia ally Belarus to its southeast. Tensions are high across Central Europe due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Sweden's armed forces said that the mission of 550 troops will contribute to the alliance’s deterrence and defense efforts and ensure stability in the region, and that it 'marks Sweden’s largest commitment yet since joining NATO' last year. Commander Lieutenant Colonel Henrik Rosdahl of the 71st Battalion said he felt great pride in contributing to the alliance's collective defense. 'It’s a historic day, but at the same time, it’s our new normal,' he said. The Swedish troops join one of eight NATO brigades along the alliance’s eastern flank. The battalion is stationed outside the town of Adazi, near Riga. Sweden formally joined NATO in March as the 32nd member of the trans-Atlantic military alliance, ending decades of post-World War II neutrality and centuries of broader nonalignment with major powers as security concerns in Europe spiked following Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Finland also abandoned its longstanding military neutrality to join NATO in April 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swedish-forces-in-latvia-make-their-largest-nato-deployment-to-date/7941785.html	2025-01-18T09:36:42-08:00	
Firefighters make progress containing California fires	Firefighters are making some progress in containing the blazes that have leveled complete neighborhoods in the U.S. city of Los Angeles. As of Saturday morning, the Palisades Fire was 43% contained, up from 31% contained on Friday, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as Cal Fire. That fire has burned through nearly 10,000 hectares of land. Meanwhile, the Eaton Fire was 73% contained by Saturday morning, up from 65% contained on Friday, according to Cal Fire. The Eaton Fire has burned through more than 5,700 hectares of land. Those two fires have killed at least 27 people and destroyed more than 12,300 structures. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that 18 people are still missing after the fires. The cause of the Palisades Fire is still under investigation. The department has not yet filed an incident report. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power’s potential liability for the Palisades Fire will depend on whether the utility’s power lines or assets were involved in sparking the wildfire, according to a Friday report by the credit rating agency Moody’s. But Moody’s said the utility’s distribution lines and other infrastructure will likely not substantially impact its finances and credits because much of the department’s power infrastructure in the fire area was underground, shielding it from damage. Calmed winds mean some residents have been allowed back into neighborhoods affected by the Eaton and Palisades fires. Although winds have calmed down in the area over the past few days, the National Weather Service said dangerous conditions are expected to return next week. The strongest winds are predicted Tuesday night. In the wake of the fires that have destroyed so many homes, some residents are now struggling to find affordable places to live as rent surges and the status of insurance settlements remains uncertain. Some information in this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/firefighters-make-progress-containing-california-fires/7941777.html	2025-01-18T09:17:29-08:00	
Nigeria fuel tanker truck blast kills at least 60	MAIDUGURI, NIGERIA — At least 60 people were killed and more injured in northern Nigeria on Saturday when a fuel tanker truck overturned and spilled the cargo, which exploded, the Federal Road Safety Corps said. The accident in Niger state follows a similar blast in Jigawa state in October that killed 147 people, one of the worst such tragedies in Africa's most-populous nation. Kumar Tsukwam, FRSC sector commander for Niger state, said most of the victims were impoverished residents who had rushed to scoop up the spilled gasoline after the truck overturned. 'Large crowds of people gathered to scoop fuel despite concerted efforts to stop them,' Tsukwam said in a statement. 'Suddenly, the tanker burst into flames, engulfing another tanker. So far 60 corpses [have been] recovered from the scene.' Tsukwam said firefighters put out the blaze. Such accidents have become common in Africa's largest oil producer, killing dozens of people in the country grappling with its worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. The price of fuel in Nigeria has soared more than 400% since President Bola Tinubu scrapped a decades-old subsidy when he took office in May 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-fuel-tanker-truck-blast-kills-at-least-60/7941772.html	2025-01-18T09:09:21-08:00	
Far from home, exiled journalists say Russia is always on their minds	PRAGUE — 'Are you going to ask why I brought you here?' asked Alexey Levchenko as he arrived in Prague's Smichov neighborhood. It was a brisk October morning, and the editor of the Russian outlet The Insider had suggested the meeting place: a small park with a Baroque fountain featuring the Roman god Neptune held aloft by bears. The neighborhood's architecture, Levchenko said, reminds him of Russia's second-biggest city, St. Petersburg. 'It's difficult to know that I can't come back to St. Petersburg,' said Levchenko, who often visited the city from his home in Moscow. 'It's one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and one of my favorites.' Levchenko left Russia in 2021, a few months before the war began in Ukraine. He made his way to Prague, which has a history as a hub for dissident writers. Although the Czech capital was once subject to Soviet rule, it's different from Russia, Levchenko said. But for a fleeting moment, when he visits the Smichov neighborhood, the similarities can make him feel as if his life hasn't been upended. Watchdogs estimate about 1,500 journalists fled Russia after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine and escalated its repression of dissent and independent media. Some journalists went to Berlin, Riga and Tbilisi. Others, like Levchenko, found refuge in Prague. And while they enjoy a degree of safety to continue reporting, the journalists must also contend with the emotional turmoil that comes with being forced to leave your family and friends, your home and culture, for an unfamiliar place. The journalists also maintain a fractured relationship with their homeland, characterized by nostalgia and homesickness as well as hope and a commitment to the work that forced them into exile in the first place. Some, like Levchenko, look for comfort in their new surroundings. Others turn to the experiences of exiles who came before them. After Alesya Marokhovskaya left Moscow in 2022, she began reading the memoirs of other Russian exiles. The editor-in-chief of the investigative outlet IStories says she found some solace and camaraderie in their writing. She read the works of writers such as Boris Zaitsev, Vladimir Veidle and Marina Tsvetaeva, the latter of whom lived in exile during the 1920s and 1930s, including in Prague. Marokhovskaya hoped their experiences would offer some guidance or wisdom. But what struck her most was that their writing often centered around a deep longing to return to Russia. 'They just lived for this goal, and they forgot to live in real life,' Marokhovskaya said when we met outside a cafe in Prague. Unlike those exiles, Marokhovskaya decided she couldn't cling to what was likely a false hope. She accepts that she may never return home. 'I will try to create my life where I am,' she said. Moscow has long targeted independent journalists with lawsuits, arrests and killings, say watchdogs. But repression reached new heights after Russia invaded Ukraine in early 2022. A law that prohibits spreading what Moscow deems 'false information' about the war has made it all but impossible for Russian journalists to report accurately on the conflict. The penalty is 15 years in prison. The severe risks forced many journalists to make a difficult decision. Anna Ryzhkova, who works with the Russian outlet Verstka, left her family and friends for exile in Tbilisi and later Prague. But if she had stayed in Russia, she says, she would have needed to stop her work to stay safe. That would have been the ultimate sacrifice. 'If I stayed in Moscow, and I saw my colleagues working and me staying silent, I think that would be sacrificing,' Ryzhkova said. Like Marokhovskaya, Ryzhkova has resigned herself to the reality that returning home is a far-off prospect. 'I will need to build something new here,' she said. More than 1,500 kilometers now lie between her and Russia, but Ryzhkova and the other exiles I spoke with said their homeland consumes a large part of their daily lives. It's a jarring tension that leaves some feeling as if they left part of themselves behind in Russia. 'I'm working in Russia in my mind,' Marokhovskaya said. 'It's really not easy. Sometimes I'm falling asleep, and I'm still there, still in Russia, not here.' It's common for exiles to feel caught between different places and never truly at home, according to Lyndsey Stonebridge, a professor at the University of Birmingham who writes about exile. 'You're always existing in two places at once,' she said. Toward the end of World War II, the concept of 'inner emigration' emerged to describe people who stayed in Nazi Germany but whose minds moved elsewhere as a form of resistance. Exiled Russian journalists appear to have flipped that concept, Stonebridge said, because they physically left Russia, but their minds remain at home. Outside the cafe in Prague, as trams rumble past every few minutes, Marokhovskaya said she counts the city of Moscow among the things she misses the most. Gazing into her half-drunk cappuccino, she said, 'The main problem is I miss a Moscow that doesn't exist anymore because the city has changed.' Moscow is now filled with banners and advertisements for people to join the army. Pro-war 'Z' posters and symbols are everywhere. The mood is different, she said. Being in exile often brings mixed feelings, including homesickness and grief, Stonebridge said. 'You must be in mourning for the country you've left, but also the country that you think you could still live in,' she said. That longing can also reflect optimism for the future, Stonebridge said. 'It's not just nostalgia, but nostalgia's twin, which is hope,' she said. That phenomenon is underscored in the mindset of many of the journalists who say they are committed to reporting on Russia because they are committed to improving their country. 'It's really easy to hate the government and love the country,' Marokhovskaya said. 'I'm a patriot for my country, and the Russian government — they're not.' In his 1984 essay on exile in the literary magazine Granta, the Palestinian American academic Edward Said warned against romanticizing exile. 'Exile is strangely compelling to think about but terrible to experience. It is the unhealable rift forced between a human being and a native place,' wrote Said, who was exiled himself. For Ryzhkova, the homesickness is constant. 'It is something that I feel in the air at any time,' she said. 'It's not that it really hurts much, but it is still with you every moment.' The journalist speaks with her family every day, but she finds it upsetting to know that she can't help as much as if she had stayed. When her grandmother broke her leg recently, Ryzhkova said, all she could do was call to check on her. 'That is really painful for me,' she said. Ryzhkova, like the other journalists I spoke with, is grateful to the Czech government for providing a haven. But feeling out of place is inevitable. Still, brief moments offer a respite — like a concert by the Russian singer Zemfira, who has lived in exile herself since the start of the war. Everyone at the concert spoke Russian, Ryzhkova said. 'That's a nice feeling,' she said. Back in Smichov on the tour of what reminds Levchenko of home, he proclaimed that 'nostalgia is not only buildings.' It is found in other things, too, like a Russian supermarket that offers a taste of home. Across the Vltava River, the store is where Levchenko comes when he and his Russian friends have parties. Here, he can purchase Russian pickles and cabbage, caviar and vodka. The store also sells colognes that Levchenko said were popular during the Soviet years, and wool caps that are worn when visiting Russian saunas known as banya. Not all saunas are created equal, Levchenko said, but Czech saunas are an adequate replacement for the banya that Levchenko frequented in Moscow. His tour ended at Pelmenarna, a restaurant specializing in Russian dumplings called pelmeni and vareniky. Levchenko ordered the ones filled with beef and pork. 'Many people want to reconstruct their life' through the different elements of Russian culture found and created in exile, Levchenko said. Does Levchenko try to reconstruct his former life? 'Sometimes, yes,' Levchenko said. The journalist explained that nostalgia can also come from unexpected places — even Starbucks. One branch in Prague has a similar interior to one he used to frequent in Moscow. 'It's funny that Starbucks can remind you of home,' Levchenko said. He sipped his vodka and shrugged.	https://www.voanews.com/a/press_freedom_russia_exile_media_prague_homesick/7941756.html	2025-01-18T08:59:01-08:00	
Gaza ceasefire to begin Sunday morning as Israel continues strikes	A ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war is set to begin Sunday at 8:30 a.m., mediator Qatar said Saturday after Israel’s Cabinet voted to approve the truce and hostage release agreement. Following a meeting that lasted more than six hours into the early morning on Saturday, the Israeli government ratified the agreement, which could lead to a permanent end to the 15-month war with Hamas in the besieged Gaza Strip enclave. 'The government has approved the framework for the return of the hostages. The framework for the hostages’ release will come into effect on Sunday,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office said in a statement. Netanyahu’s office said the deal 'supports achieving the objectives of the war.' But in a statement Saturday, Hamas — designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain and other Western countries — contended that Israel had 'failed to achieve its aggressive goals' and 'only succeeded in committing war crimes that disgrace the dignity of humanity.' The war in Gaza began when Hamas launched a terror attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing about 1,200 people and abducting about 250 hostages. Just under 100 hostages are thought to remain in Hamas custody, but about one-third of those are believed to be dead. Gaza authorities say nearly 47,000 Palestinians, mostly women and children, have been killed in subsequent Israeli military operations. Without providing evidence, Israel says the death toll includes thousands of militants it has killed. The United States, Qatar and Egypt, which have been mediating negotiations between Israel and Hamas for months, announced the ceasefire on Wednesday. The ceasefire will begin with a three-week pause in fighting and the release of dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners. Thirty-three of the 98 remaining Israeli hostages, including women, children, men over 50 and ill and wounded captives, are expected to be released in this phase. In return, Israel will release almost 2,000 Palestinians from its jails. The White House said it expects three female hostages to be released to Israel in the afternoon through the Red Cross. Israel’s Justice Ministry published their details early on Saturday, plus the ceasefire agreement, which said 30 Palestinian prisoners would be released for each female hostage on Sunday. After Sunday, lead U.S. negotiator Brett McGurk said, the agreement calls for four more female hostages to be released after seven days, followed by the release of three further hostages every seven days. In this first phase of the three-stage deal, Israeli troops will pull back to the edges of Gaza, and many Palestinians will be able to return to what remains of their homes as increased aid flows into the enclave, which has been decimated in the war. Egypt’s foreign minister, Badr Abdelatty, said Saturday the deal provides for the entry of 600 trucks per day into Gaza, including 50 trucks of fuel. Israeli strikes on Gaza have continued since the ceasefire was announced, including on Saturday. Israeli tanks shelled the Zeitoun neighborhood of Gaza City, while airstrikes hit central and southern Gaza, according to residents. Medics in Gaza said five people were killed in an airstrike that hit a tent in the Mawasi area, west of Khan Younis in southern Gaza. The Israeli army said in a statement Saturday that it conducted strikes on 50 'terror targets' across the territory on Friday alone. At least 123 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli attacks since the ceasefire was announced a few days ago, according to the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service. Some information in this report was provided by Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-ceasefire-to-begin-sunday-morning-as-israel-continues-strikes/7941724.html	2025-01-18T08:06:50-08:00	
Colombian government suspends talks with left-wing rebels after clashes	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — Colombian President Gustavo Petro said Friday that he was suspending peace negotiations with National Liberation Army guerrillas after a day of violence between armed groups in the northeast that left at least 30 people dead. The violence took place in the Catatumbo region, on the border with Venezuela, where rival groups have for years been fighting for control of the cocaine trade. The latest fighting pitted rebels from the left-wing National Liberation Army, or ELN — the biggest of the armed groups still active in Colombia — against dissidents from the Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, which signed a peace deal with the state in 2016 after more than 50 years of war. Petro accused the ELN of committing 'war crimes,' and said on a social network, 'That is why we are suspending dialogue with this group, because the ELN shows no willingness to make peace.' Colombia's first left-wing president, Petro launched negotiations with the various armed groups that still control parts of Colombia after being elected in 2022 on a promise to pursue 'total peace.' The talks with the ELN broke down for several months last year after the group launched a deadly attack on a military base. William Villamizar, governor of North Santander department, told Blu Radio the latest clashes between the ELN and FARC dissidents erupted on Thursday. 'Data from the field indicates at least 30 people killed and more than 20 injured,' he said, blaming the clashes on a 'territorial dispute' linked to the cocaine trade. Colombian ombudsman Iris Marin told Blu Radio that ELN members were attacking civilians, going 'house to house' in the area around the town of Tibu in search of people it believed to be related to the FARC dissidents. She said preliminary reports indicated that 'dozens' of families had been displaced and more than 20 people were missing. On Thursday, the United Nations reported that five former FARC combatants had been killed. The deal with FARC aimed at ending the longest-running war in the Americas, involving leftist guerrillas, right-wing paramilitaries, drug gangs and the military. But holdout FARC splinter groups and the ELN refused to make peace. In November the government and ELN agreed at talks in Venezuela to resume the peace process, but the military and the rebels have continued to trade fire. Experts said the cocaine trade is at the heart of the unrest. Tibu, scene of this week's fighting, lies in one of the country's biggest areas for the production of coca — the main ingredient in cocaine, of which Colombia is the world's leading producer.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombian-government-suspends-talks-with-left-wing-rebels-after-clashes/7941564.html	2025-01-18T03:40:58-08:00	
Gaza ceasefire set to begin one day before Trump’s inauguration	WHITE HOUSE — Israel’s Cabinet approved a deal for a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release, with 24 ministers voting in favor and eight ministers rejecting the agreement. The deal is scheduled to be implemented beginning Sunday. The deal to end the fighting between Israel and Hamas was achieved after more than a year of negotiations, with mediation from the United States, Qatar and Egypt. President Joe Biden first endorsed the deal in May. The warring parties agreed to it on Wednesday, and it was subsequently approved by the Israeli Cabinet early Saturday in Israel. Starting midday on Monday when President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated, it will be up to his administration to see that the deal is enforced. The agreement has three phases, each of which will last six weeks. The terms of phases two and three are still being negotiated, but under phase one the cessation of hostilities is expected to continue if six weeks pass before the next phase is finalized. Phase one includes withdrawal of Israeli forces from densely populated areas and more aid for Gaza, as well as the release of some Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons and some hostages held by Hamas, including Americans. The U.S. and other Western countries have designated Hamas as a terrorist group. The release of American hostages is a 'fundamental component' of Trump's interest in ending the war swiftly, according to Ahmed Fouad Alkhatib, nonresident senior fellow with the Scowcroft Middle East Security Initiative at the Atlantic Council's Middle East Programs. Whether Trump will sustain pressure for the deal to proceed to phase two, when all of the hostages are set to be released, and to phase three, when reconstruction of Gaza will begin, remains to be seen, Alkhatib told VOA. Alkhatib expressed concern that after the first phase Trump will be 'so disinterested' in Gaza that the agreement will amount to 'little more than a freezing of the conflict.' This would be disastrous for Palestinians in Gaza and the goal of Palestinian statehood, he added. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said late Friday that he had received 'unequivocal guarantees' from both Biden and Trump that if negotiations on phase two fail, Israel 'will return to intense fighting with the backing of the United States.' Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the current war. Israel says Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Two-state solution The Biden administration’s goal has been Palestinian statehood under the two-state solution. This could pave the way to bringing Saudi Arabia into the Abraham Accords — the 2020 deal brokered under the first Trump administration that normalized diplomatic relations between Israel and its Arab neighbors, the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain. Biden had sought to expand the accords to include Saudi Arabia, which maintains it will not consider normalizing relations until Israel commits to a 'credible path' to a Palestinian state. Washington and Riyadh had been exploring the expansion through a package that would include, among other offers, American security guarantees for the Saudis. Those efforts stalled after the Oct. 7 Hamas onslaught. Now Trump appears to be aiming to use the momentum of the Gaza ceasefire to add Saudi Arabia into the accords. 'We will continue promoting PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH throughout the region, as we build upon the momentum of this ceasefire to further expand the Historic Abraham Accords,' Trump posted on social media Wednesday following the announcement that a ceasefire deal has been reached. Saudi Arabia has never formally recognized Israel since its creation in 1948. As a de facto leader of the Arab and Islamic world, Riyadh’s recognition would represent a breakthrough for the Jewish state. Trump’s main objective now is to ensure that whatever happens in Gaza does not prevent him from securing that deal, while Israel’s goal is to ensure whatever happens in Gaza doesn't prevent cooperation with the U.S. over Iran, said Jonathan Rynhold, head of the department of political studies at Bar Ilan University. 'So, I'm not sure that it makes sense to think beyond the first phase at this point,' Rynhold told VOA. Trump and Israel will 'work out their positions on Gaza precisely against the shadow of those two things,' he added. Trump’s role in securing the deal In the same social media post Wednesday, Trump took credit for his role in securing the ceasefire. 'This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,' Trump wrote. For months the Biden administration has progressively included Trump’s team in peace talks, beginning with an Oval Office meeting a week after Trump won the election. At that Nov. 13 meeting, Biden proposed that they work together to push the deal through. 'We’ve sent a signal to the incoming team that we’re prepared to work with them on this issue,' national security adviser Jake Sullivan told reporters that day. Shortly after, Sullivan and Biden’s top Middle East adviser, Brett McGurk, began coordinating with their successors on the Trump team, Mike Waltz and Steve Witkoff, said a senior administration official who spoke with reporters on background Wednesday. The Biden official said that in the final days leading up to the ceasefire, Witkoff worked in tandem with McGurk in an 'almost unprecedented,' cross-administration partnership that was 'highly constructive, very fruitful.' But he declined to elaborate on Witkoff’s and Trump’s role in securing the deal, other than saying that the presidential transition provided a 'natural' deadline for a diplomatic breakthrough. Pressure on Israel Critics have accused Biden of failing to use U.S. military support as leverage over Netanyahu to reach a deal or moderate Israel’s campaign that has taken tens of thousands of Palestinian lives. Publicly, Biden officials have largely echoed Israel in faulting Hamas for the failure of the talks. But some Israeli security officials and many observers also blame Netanyahu for blocking progress, including by repeatedly introducing fresh demands in negotiations. With Trump’s victory, Netanyahu’s calculations may have changed, said Laura Blumenfeld, senior fellow at the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies. 'Trump injected a kind of fear factor into this process that was missing before,' she told VOA. 'He can't triangulate anymore the way he would play Biden off of the Republican Congress. There's nowhere for Netanyahu to run, nowhere to hide, and so he took this deal he couldn't refuse.' Trump’s pressure may have also created space for Netanyahu to resist ultimatums from far-right allies who had threatened to leave his governing coalition if a ceasefire deal is made, which would mean an end to the prime minister’s term. Eight Israeli far-right politicians, including National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir and Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, rejected the deal but it is still unclear whether they will leave the coalition. 'Netanyahu finally called their bluff,' Blumenfeld said. 'Or maybe actually, Trump called Netanyahu’s bluff, because he was using these right-wing Cabinet members all along as an excuse not to make the concessions that he didn't want to make.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-ceasefire-set-to-begin-one-day-before-trump-s-inauguration-/7941448.html	2025-01-18T02:52:19-08:00

Australia declares disaster in areas of storm-hit east	SYDNEY — Authorities declared a natural disaster Saturday in parts of eastern Australia where gales have toppled trees and knocked out power to tens of thousands of homes. Heavy rain, lightning and winds as strong as 100 kph have swept across Sydney and other areas of New South Wales since Wednesday. With many power lines felled, about 30,000 properties remained without electricity Saturday -- down from a peak of more than 260,000, said the state's emergency services minister, Jihad Dib. 'This is an incident that is affecting the whole state,' he told reporters. Emergency services had responded to more than 7,000 incidents around New South Wales, he said. 'We know that it has not been an easy thing to go through.' Disasters had been declared so far in three local government areas, he said, unlocking support for people seeking emergency housing, essential items, repairs and clean-ups. Electricity network Ausgrid said 140,000 customers had lost power Wednesday and another 68,000 since Friday, with some areas experiencing winds of up to 100 kph. Police reported that an elderly man was killed in the storms when his car was hit by a tree on Wednesday in Cowra, about 230 kilometers west of Sydney.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-declares-disaster-in-areas-of-storm-hit-east/7941544.html	2025-01-18T02:25:46-08:00	
2 judges shot dead at Iran's supreme court: media	TEHRAN, IRAN — Two judges were killed in a shooting attack on Saturday at the Supreme Court building in Tehran, state media reported. 'Three judges of the Supreme Court were targeted. Two of them were martyred,' the Judiciary's Mizan Online website reported, adding that the 'assailant killed himself.' State news agency IRNA also reported that one other person was injured in the attack. Mizan identified the two slain judges as Ali Razini and Mohammad Moghisseh, adding that they worked on cases 'fighting crimes against national security, espionage and terrorism.' The motive behind their killing were not immediately clear, but Mizan said the assailant was not involved in any cases before the Supreme Court, without providing further details on the attacker's identity. Authorities said an investigation into the incident was launched, Mizan added. Veteran judge Moghisseh, 68, was sanctioned in 2019 by the United States for having 'overseen countless unfair trails, during which charges went unsubstantiated and evidence was disregarded,' according to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Razini, 71, held several important positions in Iran's judiciary and was previously targeted in a 1998 assassination attempt by assailants 'who planted a magnetic bomb in his vehicle,' according to Mizan. Though attacks targeting judges are rare, Iran has seen a number of shootings targeting high-profile figures over the past years. In October, a Shiite Muslim preacher was shot dead in the southern city of Kazeroun after leading Friday prayers. In April 2023, a powerful cleric identified as Abbas Ali Soleimani was also shot dead at a bank in the northern province of Mazandaran. And in August 2005, renowned Iranian judge Hassan Moghaddas was murdered by two gunmen who climbed into his car in the middle of a busy business district in Tehran. Two men convicted over his killing were publicly executed by hanging two years later.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judges-shot-dead-at-iran-s-supreme-court-media/7941542.html	2025-01-18T02:15:00-08:00	
South Korea's president in court as investigators seek to extend detention	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol was in court for the first time Saturday for a crucial hearing that will decide whether to extend his detention as investigators probe his failed martial law bid. Yoon's supporters rallied outside the court and scuffled with police as he arrived in a blue van, weeks after throwing the nation into chaos by attempting to suspend civilian rule. The president's Dec. 3 martial law bid lasted just six hours, with lawmakers voting it down despite him ordering soldiers to storm parliament to stop them. Yoon was subsequently impeached by parliament and resisted arrest for weeks, holed up in his guarded residence until he was finally detained Wednesday in a dawn raid. South Korea's first sitting president to be detained, Yoon refused to cooperate during the initial 48 hours detectives were allowed to hold him. But the disgraced president remains in custody after investigators requested a new warrant Friday to extend his detention. He decided to appear in court 'with the intention of restoring his honor,' the president's lawyer Yoon Kab-keun told AFP before the hearing. A spokesperson for Seoul Western District Court later confirmed to AFP that the hearing commenced with the president in attendance. After reviewing the request to extend Yoon's detention, a judge is expected to announce her decision Saturday night or early Sunday. Outside the court, AFP journalists saw crowds of Yoon's backers waving flags and holding 'release the president' placards. Police officers formed a chain to prevent them reaching the court entrance, which has been closed to the public since Friday evening over safety concerns. More legal woes If approved, as expected, the new warrant would likely extend Yoon's detention by 20 days. This would give prosecutors time to formalize an indictment for insurrection, a charge that could see him jailed for life or executed if found guilty. If indicted, the president would probably be detained for the duration of the trial. Once 'the warrant is issued this time, (Yoon) will likely be unable to return home for an extended period,' political commentator Park Sang-byung told AFP. Yoon said Wednesday he had agreed to leave his compound to avoid 'bloodshed,' but that he did not accept the legality of the investigation. He has refused to answer investigators' questions, with his legal team saying the president explained his position on the day he was arrested. The president has also been absent from a parallel probe at the Constitutional Court, which is mulling whether to uphold his impeachment. If the court rules against Yoon, he will lose the presidency and elections will be called within 60 days. He did not attend the first two hearings this week, but the trial, which could last months, will continue in his absence. Although Yoon won the presidential election in 2022, the opposition Democratic Party has a majority in parliament after winning legislative polls last year. The Democratic Party has celebrated the president's arrest, with a top official calling it 'the first step' to restoring constitutional and legal order.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-president-in-court-as-investigators-seek-to-extend-detention/7941537.html	2025-01-18T01:55:54-08:00	
Ukraine officials say 4 killed in Russian strike on Kyiv	Ukrainian officials say at least four people were killed early Saturday in a nighttime Russian attack in the capital, Kyiv. Timur Tkachenko, head of the Ukrainian capital’s military administration said on Telegram that the deaths occurred in the city’s Shevchenkivsky district. He said the Holosiivsky district on the west bank of the Dnipro River that runs through the city and the Desnyansky district on the opposite bank were hit with falling debris. Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko said air defenses were in operation around the city. On Friday, a Russian missile attack killed at least four people and injured at 14 others in the southern-central Ukrainian city of Kryvyi Rih, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his daily address. 'Such strikes, such losses, simply would not have happened if we had received all the necessary air defense systems that we have been talking about with our partners for such a long time and that are available in the world,' he said. Earlier Friday, Zelenskyy, who was born in Kryvyi Rih, condemned the attack on Telegram. 'Each such terrorist attack is another reminder of who we are dealing with. Russia will not stop on its own — it can only be stopped by joint pressure,' he said. The attack also damaged an educational facility and two five-story buildings, officials said. VOA was unable to independently verify the reports. Meanwhile, a Ukrainian drone attack late Friday ignited a fire at an industrial site in Russia’s Kaluga region, about 170 kilometers from the shared border. 'As a result of a drone attack in Lyudinovo, a fire broke out on the territory of an industrial enterprise,' regional Governor Vladislav Shapsha posted on Telegram. Agence France-Presse reported that unverified videos on unofficial Russia social media showed what they said was the attack targeting an oil depot. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has previously said he would be able to stop the war in Ukraine in one day, but he has not specified how he would do so. Trump aides recently said the new plan is to end the war within the first 100 days of the administration. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-officials-say-4-killed-in-russian-strike-on-kyiv/7941518.html	2025-01-18T00:22:55-08:00

Fires scorched campuses across Los Angeles. Now many schools seek places to hold classes	LOS ANGELES — Days after losing her home in the same fire that destroyed her Los Angeles elementary school, third-grader Gabriela Chevez-Munoz resumed classes this week at another campus temporarily hosting children from her school. She arrived wearing a T-shirt that read 'Pali' — the nickname for her Pacific Palisades neighborhood — as signs and balloons of dolphins, her school's mascot, welcomed hundreds of displaced students. 'It feels kind of like the first day of school,' Gabriela said. She said she had been scared by the fires but that she was excited to reunite with her best friend and give her hamburger-themed friendship bracelets. Gabriela is among thousands of students whose schooling was turned upside down by wildfires that ravaged the city, destroying several schools and leaving many others in off-limits evacuation zones. Educators across the city are scrambling to find new locations for their students, develop ways to keep up learning, and return a sense of normalcy as the city grieves at least 27 deaths and thousands of destroyed homes from blazes that scorched 63 square miles (163 square kilometers) of land. Gabriela and 400 other students from her school, Palisades Charter Elementary School, started classes temporarily Wednesday at Brentwood Science Magnet, about 5 miles (8 kilometers) away. Her school and another decimated Palisades elementary campus may take more than two years to rebuild, Los Angeles Unified School District Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said. 'There's a lot of grief' Students from seven other LAUSD campuses in evacuation zones are also temporarily relocating to other schools. As Layla Glassman dropped her daughter off at Brentwood, she said her priority after her family's home burned down was making sure her three children feel safe and secure. 'We have a roof over our heads. We have them back in school. So, you know, I am happy,' she said, her voice cracking. 'But of course, there's a lot of grief.' Many schools have held off on resuming instruction, saying their focus for now has been healing and trying to restore a sense of community. Some are organizing get-togethers and field trips to keep kids engaged in activities and with each other as they look for new space. The Pasadena Unified School District kept all schools closed this week for its 14,000 students. It offered self-directed online activities but said the work was optional. Between 1,200 and 2,000 students in Pasadena Unified School District are known to be displaced but the number could be as high as as 10,000 based on heat maps of where families lived, district Superintendent Elizabeth Blanco said Thursday. The district aims to reopen some schools by the end of next week and have all students back in classrooms by the end of the month. Schools that did not burn down were damaged by falling trees, debris, ash and smoke that requires extensive cleaning and environmental testing, she said. Hundreds of school staff members citywide lost their homes or had to relocate, compounding the challenges. Some schools are passing on online learning altogether. 'We all did COVID. We did online instruction. We saw the negative impacts,' said Bonnie Brimecombe, principal of Odyssey Charter School-South, which burned to the ground. Families have been dropping their children off at the local Boys and Girls Club so students can be with each other, she said. A total of 850 students attend her school and a sister school in Altadena, Odyssey Charter School-North, which emerged undamaged but is still expected to remain closed for months. At least 40% of the students lost their homes in the fire, she said, making it especially urgent for their well-being to find new space and resume school as soon as possible. 'At this point we are trying to reopen in-person the very first day that we can,' she said. Possible long-term effects Over the long term, disruptions can have profound effects on students' learning and emotional stability. Children who experience natural disasters are more prone to acute illness and symptoms of depression and anxiety, research shows. Keeping students together as the two LAUSD elementary schools are doing is the best approach, said Douglas Harris, a Tulane Univeristy professor who studied the effects of Hurricane Katrina on schools and academic outcomes. But given how many people are relocating because of the fires, he said it's unlikely all classes will look the same. 'I wonder how many kids are showing up to the new school buildings based on how dispersed they might be,' Harris said. 'It's going to be difficult and it's going to take a long time.' 'I feel so out of it' Among the schools seeking space for temporary classrooms is Palisades Charter High School, which has 3,000 students. Nestled between Sunset Boulevard and the Pacific Coast Highway, 'Pali High' is the kind of California school that Hollywood puts on the big screen and has been featured in productions including the 1976 horror movie 'Carrie' and the TV series 'Teen Wolf.' Most of the buildings are still standing, but about 40% of the campus was damaged, officials said. The school is looking into other campuses, nearby universities and commercial real estate spaces that would allow all its students to stay together until it's safe to return, said principal and executive director Pamela Magee. The school delayed the start of the second semester until Tuesday and will temporarily revert to online learning. Axel Forrest, 18, a junior on the lacrosse team, is planning to gather with friends for online school. His family home is gone and for now they are at a hotel near the Los Angeles airport. 'I feel so out of it, every day. Do I cry? Do I mourn the loss of my home and school? I am trying not to think about it,' he said. The longer school is out, the more idle time his mind has to wander. 'As time is passing I'm realizing this is going to be my reality for the next year or two. I am not going to have anywhere to live permanently for a while,' he said. 'And what am I going to do for school now? It's going to be online but for how long? Where will the temporary campus be? How far away is it?' At Oak Knoll Montessori, educators have been holding meetups for its 150 students at locations including museums, parks, and a library in an effort for students to find some joy. The fire destroyed the school and several dozen students lost their homes. The only thing that survived the fire was the school's chicken coop, and its five chickens. 'The chickens have been a nice beacon of hope,' said Allwyn Fitzpatrick, the head of school. 'All the buildings blew up. We have nothing. Not one chair.' Fitzpatrick has found a potential new location for the school and hopes to reopen before the end of the month. 'We have been trying to focus all our attention on the children and how we can temporarily help them normalize all this. Which is an insurmountable task,' Fitzpatrick said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fires-scorched-campuses-across-los-angeles-now-many-schools-seek-places-to-hold-classes-/7941436.html	2025-01-17T23:55:22-08:00	
Thai resort island Phuket grapples with growing garbage crisis	PHUKET, THAILAND — Plastic bottles and empty beer cans roll on the sea floor in the waters around Phuket in southern Thailand, while ever more garbage piles up on the island itself, a tourist hotspot better known for its pristine beaches and stunning sunsets. In one corner of the island, trucks and tractors trundle back and forth moving piles of trash around a sprawling landfill, the final destination for much of the more than 1,000 tonnes of waste collected on Phuket every day. In a matter of months, the landfill has grown so large it has replaced the previous serene mountain view from Vassana Toyou's home. 'There is no life outside the house, (we) just stay at home,' she said. 'The smell is very strong, you have to wear a mask.' To cope with the stench, Vassana said she keeps her air conditioner and air purifiers switched on all the time, doubling her electricity bill. Phuket, Thailand's largest island, has undergone rapid development due to its tourism sector, a major driver of the Thai economy as a whole. Of the country's 35.5 million foreign arrivals in 2024, about 13 million headed to the island. 'The growth of (Phuket) city has been much more rapid than it should be,' said Suppachoke Laongphet, deputy mayor of the island's main municipality, explaining how a tourism and construction boom has pushed trash volumes above pre-COVID levels. By the end of year, the island could be producing up to 1,400 tonnes of trash a day, overwhelming its sole landfill, he said. Authorities are pushing ahead with plans to cut waste generation by 15% in six months, expand the landfill and build a new incinerator, he said, as the island strives to become a more sustainable tourist destination. But increasing capacity and incinerators is only part of the solution, experts say. 'If you just keep expanding more waste incinerators, I don't think that would be just the solution,' said Panate Manomaivibool, an assistant professor in waste management at Burapha University. 'They need to focus on waste reduction and separation.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-resort-island-phuket-grapples-with-growing-garbage-crisis/7940047.html	2025-01-17T23:53:52-08:00	
The long struggle to establish Martin Luther King Jr. Day	The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. gave his iconic 'I Have a Dream' speech in 1963 on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. He chose that location in part to honor President Abraham Lincoln as 'a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today.' Now, millions of people honor King in the same way. On the third Monday of January — close to King's Jan. 15 birthday — federal, state and local governments, institutions and various industries recognize Martin Luther King Jr. Day. For some, the holiday is just that — time off from work or school. But, King's family and others carrying on his legacy of equality, justice and non-violent protest want Americans to remember that this holiday is really about helping others. While it is now a time-honored tradition, the establishment of the holiday had a prolonged, difficult path to acceptance. How the idea for MLK day began The idea to establish a national holiday for the civil rights icon arose as the nation was plunged into grief. U.S. Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan, one of the longest-serving members of Congress known for his liberal stance on civil rights, proposed legislation to recognize King four days after his assassination outside a motel in Memphis, Tennessee, on April 4, 1968. Supporters knew it would not be easy. King, who was 39 years old at the time, was a polarizing figure to half the country even before his death, said Lerone Martin, director of the Martin Luther King, Jr. Research and Education Institute at Stanford University. Polls conducted by the Washington Post and the New York Times indicated most Americans did not trust King or thought he was too radical because of his speeches on poverty, housing and against the Vietnam War. 'People say that King is moving too fast after 1965 and basically 'Hey, you got the Voting Rights bill done. That's enough,'' Martin said. The Congressional Black Caucus, founded by Conyers, tried to bring the legislation up for a vote for the next 15 years. Among the Republican rebuttals — public holidays don't apply to private citizens, King was a communist or King was a womanizer. In the meantime, his widow, Coretta Scott King, kept lobbying for it. Musician Stevie Wonder even released a song, 'Happy Birthday,' to rally support. So, what changed? By the 1980s, the social and cultural climate in the U.S. had shifted and the public was reflecting on racial progress, Martin said. Most Americans now were also regretting the Vietnam War. Supporters, meanwhile, were still calling for federal holiday status. In 1983, about 20 years after King's 'I Have a Dream' speech, legislation for a Martin Luther King Jr. Day on the third Monday of January cleared Congress and President Ronald Reagan signed it. States held back as activists stepped up Reagan's signing did not lead other Republicans to follow. It would be 17 more years until all 50 states observed it. Most of the foot-dragging came from the South — except for Arizona. Then in 1987, Gov. Evan Mecham rescinded his predecessor's executive order enacting a state holiday in Arizona. 'He said 'Black people don't need a holiday. Y'all need jobs,'' recalled Dr. Warren H. Stewart Sr., senior pastor at First Institutional Baptist Church in Phoenix. 'That started the war.' Stewart launched a group to lead 'people of all colors and all persuasions, faiths and parties' in protest marches. Entertainers including Wonder canceled Arizona events. Companies moved conventions. The tipping point was the loss of hosting the Super Bowl. In 1992, Arizona became the first state where voter initiative reinstated the King holiday. Supporters took a victory lap the next MLK Day with a packed arena concert attended by Wonder and other artists. Even Rosa Parks was there. Stewart remembers speaking to the crowd. 'What I said there — and it still applies today — we've won the holiday but the holiday is a symbol of liberty and justice for all and we must move from symbol to substance,' he said. South Carolina was the final holdout until 2000. But, it was without the backing of the civil rights groups because it also allowed for a Confederate Memorial Day. A 'day on, not a day off' Martin Luther King Jr. Day's reach has only grown in its 42 years. It's the only federal holiday where you take a 'day on, not a day off.' In 1994, President Bill Clinton signed into law Congressman John Lewis and Sen. Harris Wofford's legislation making it a National Day of Service. Just about every major city and suburb has some revelry the weekend before, including parades, street festivals and concerts. The various service projects run the gamut — community clean-up, packing food boxes, donating blood. AmeriCorps, the federal agency that deploys volunteers to serve communities around the nation, has distributed $1.5 million in grants to 200 nonprofits, faith-based groups and other organizations for projects. CEO Michael Smith estimates there have been hundreds of projects involving hundreds of thousands of people for MLK day in recent years. Engagement seems to be expanding. 'You know, any given day I see another project that has nothing to do with us,' said Smith, who has served in President Joe Biden's administration. 'What's so important about the King holiday is not only the service that's going to happen, but how it creates a spark for people to think about how maybe they're going to serve all year long.' That's something King's daughter, the Rev. Bernice King and CEO of the King Center in Atlanta, desires as well. She wishes people would do more than 'quote King, which we love to do.' They need to do good work and commit daily 'to embrace the spirit of nonviolence.' Martin also thinks it's important to learn about the man himself. He finds excitement in seeing people read or hear about the Nobel Peace Prize winner. But, nothing compares to taking in King's own writings such as his 1963 'Letter from the Birmingham Jail,' he added. 'We can arm ourselves with his ideals,' Martin said. 'We can continue to have a conversation with him — not just on one day but actually throughout the year.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-long-struggle-to-establish-martin-luther-king-jr-day/7938712.html	2025-01-17T23:53:02-08:00	
Kenyan startup city tries to tackle Africa's problem of urbanizing while poor	KIAMBU, KENYA — Turn into Tatu City on the outskirts of Kenya's capital, Nairobi, and it feels like entering a different world. Even the country's most reckless drivers are transformed, slowing to a crawl and not tossing trash out the window — thanks to surveillance cameras and rigorously enforced penalties for speeding and littering. For the 5,000 people who have moved into Tatu, a 'startup city' that welcomed its first residents four years ago, the ruthless upholding of such rules makes the place appealing. 'Tatu has more law and order than other places,' said Valerie Akoko, a digital content creator who moved in two years ago. 'I've never seen Tatu City dirty.' Situated on 2,023 hectares, Tatu City aspires to be what its name suggests: a city, privately owned, that its designers hope will eventually have a population of 250,000. It is already home to 88 businesses employing 15,000 people. They include CCI Global, which operates a 5,000-seat call center, and Zhende Medical, a Chinese medical supply manufacturer. There are similar projects around the world. But in sub-Saharan Africa, champions of the idea hope that new-city developments can address the continent's urbanization conundrum: While the growth of cities has rolled back poverty elsewhere, the region has largely been an exception. History suggests that as people move into cities, productivity increases, wages rise, exports grow and a country gets richer. But in Africa, urbanization has rarely unleashed such economic transformation. In theory, Africa should be prospering. The continent's urban population is set to grow by 900 million by 2050, according to the United Nations, more than the present urban population of Europe and North America combined. But sub-Saharan Africa is urbanizing while still poor. 'Towns and cities in Africa today simply lack the tax base needed to invest in the urban infrastructure needed to accommodate the tsunami of people being added to their ranks in a short period of time,' said Kurtis Lockhart, director of the Africa Urban Lab, a research center at the African School of Economics in Zanzibar. Weak property rights and political tensions can make the problem worse. Even Tatu City has battled Kenyan politicians and politically connected businessmen. In 2018, the London Court of International Arbitration ruled in favor of the development's multinational owner, Rendeavour, in a dispute with its Kenyan former partners, including a former governor of the central bank. The dispute delayed project development by several years. Last year, Tatu City's Kenya head, Preston Mendenhall, took the unusual step of accusing the governor of the county where the development is based of extortion, saying he had demanded land worth $33 million in exchange for approving its updated master plan. The governor denied it and is suing Tatu City and Mendenhall for defamation. No ruling has been made. Still, the case for building new cities, complete with new infrastructure, is compelling to some. The Charter Cities Institute, a Washington-based nonprofit, argues that, done properly, such projects could drive growth, create jobs and 'lift tens of millions of people out of poverty.' The institute sees Tatu City as a model. Yet building new cities is hard. Africa is littered with failed projects. A handful have shown promise. Angola's Quilamba city, whose construction began in 2002, is arguably the most successful, with a population of more than 130,000. It was built by CITIC, a state-owned Chinese company, but is owned by the Angolan government. Perhaps a dozen new city projects — from Zanzibar to Zambia — are underway in Africa that stand a chance of emulating Quilamba, experts reckon. Of these, Tatu is the farthest along, with 26,400 people already living, working or studying there. Experts agree that the private sector must play a role in African urbanization, saying African states are too fiscally constrained to fill the investment gap themselves. Rendeavour, a private company with a multibillion-dollar balance sheet, has deep enough pockets to make a difference. But leaving city-building to the private sector alone can cause problems, for instance by worsening inequality. The average price of a property at Eko Atlantic, a new-city development on the outskirts of Lagos, is $415,000, far beyond the means of most Nigerians. 'Startup cities can serve as hubs for innovation and alleviate pressure on overcrowded urban centers,' said Anacláudia Rossbach, executive director of the U.N.'s Human Settlements Program, or UN-Habitat. 'However, to be impactful, they must prioritize inclusivity, affordability and integration with existing urban areas, ensuring they serve all socioeconomic groups rather than becoming isolated enclaves for elites.' A one-bedroom apartment in Tatu City sells for $45,500, still beyond the means of most Kenyans, but within reach of some in the emerging middle class. Kenya's per capita GDP was $1,961 in 2023, according to the World Bank. The development collaborates with Kenya's government, which has designated Tatu City a special economic zone. That means companies setting up there are eligible for tax benefits and other incentives, making it a model of private-public partnership, experts say. Tatu City also appeals to businesses and residents with its transparent governance structure and services that are often lacking elsewhere in Kenya, including its own water supply and energy grid. It falls under national law but can set its own rules on matters like traffic and what kind of houses can be built, with all plans requiring approval from Tatu's management. 'If you look at the infrastructure, if you look at the utilities, if you look at the controls, if you look at the security, it is one of the best,' said Sylvester Njuguna, who lives and owns a restaurant there. Unlike many startup cities built far from urban centers, Tatu City is 19 kilometers north of Nairobi, close enough to plug into its labor markets. According to Lockhart with the Africa Urban Lab, new city projects usually succeed if they are close enough to a major urban center and house both a high-quality anchor tenant — CCI Global in Tatu City's case — and good schools. They should operate under effective management and respond to market demand. Tatu meets these criteria and, unlike many grandiosely conceived African city projects, it has grown organically like Rendeavour's other city projects in Ghana, Nigeria, Zambia and the Congo, according to Mendenhall. 'We are building what the market needs,' he said. 'We are not putting all the infrastructure on day one.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-startup-city-tries-to-tackle-africa-s-problem-of-urbanizing-while-poor/7938687.html	2025-01-17T23:52:39-08:00	
Belgium's pastoral pastime of pigeon racing faces high anxiety over crime wave	RANST, Belgium — Belgium's once pastoral pastime of pigeon racing has come to this: Drones swoop over lofts where valuable birds are housed to look for security weaknesses, laser sensors set off alarms at night and cameras linked live to mobile apps keep potential thieves at bay — 24/7. That's what happens when the fast-flying fowl — which in a bygone era were, at best, the toast of local bars — have turned into valuable commodities. The most expensive bird to come out of the top pigeon-racing nation in the world fetched 1.6 million euros ($1.65 million) a few years ago. No wonder the sport is grappling with an unprecedented wave of unsolved pigeon pilfering that has hit several of the best birds in the business. This winter season is 'extreme,' Pascal Bodengien, the head of the Belgian Pigeon Racing Federation, told The Associated Press. 'Not a week goes by without a theft somewhere.' In one loft, an estimated 100,000 euros ($102,900) worth of pigeons were stolen last week. Overall, no arrests have been made. Prices per bird, said Bodengien, 'can vary from 1,000 to 100,000 euros ... and that is what they are after.' Exact statistics on losses are often not available because the reporting and police investigations are not centralized. The emotional loss often weighs heaviest of all. The sport involves daily care, over decades, and the rustling of feathers combined with the tranquil cooing often gives breeders a haven of peace in their otherwise bustling lives along with a measure of pride if their birds are winners. Frans Bungeneers is a breeder of champions. He started at age 8 and is still going strong in his 60s. His life got one of its biggest jolts in November 2016 when thieves broke into his garden shed and took away just about all his top pigeons in a heist of some 60 overall. 'It was such an incredible blow for me. I can tell you honestly, I cried like a little boy because my life's work was completely destroyed,' Bungeneers said outside his loft where he had to restart his breeding and racing almost from scratch. 'I was — I was broken,' he said. 'If you have those successes and those birds are then taken away. You know that it takes years.' He never got his birds back, even though the thieves were caught in Romania and convicted in Belgium. He never saw the 400,000 euros ($410,000) in damages he was awarded because the criminals were ruled insolvent. It makes this winter's string of high-profile theft all the more poignant since he knows what it means to each of the owners. For pigeons taken in a heist, their racing careers are over. Without proper documentation, one cannot get away with winning a big race and not be double- and triple-checked. That door is closed to thieves. The birds cannot be taken to auction, where prices for top birds regularly veer into the five figures and sometimes into six figures. 'The only option open to them is breeding. They cannot take it any place, they cannot go to China, so we suspect that they are going to the Eastern Bloc countries,' as was the case with Bungeneers' birds, said Bodengien. Still, with no clear lead out there, apart from some grainy infrared video and other sketchy information, 'no one really has an overall view on it.' Bungeneers, who was a police officer until his retirement last year, decries the lack of overall, joint investigations and the fact that often the pricy pigeons are seen in the same light as runaway poultry and receive the same level of investigation. He said it was like comparing a farm pony to a champion thoroughbred. 'I remember a colleague of mine who went into the prosecutor's office and the magistrate said: 'gentlemen, what are we going to do? Start prosecuting the theft of chickens, rabbits and pigeons?'' So now, the pigeon-racing federation is warning its members to be extra careful — to the point of not talking to strangers about their hobby. 'If you see that something is happening around the house or around the coops, or see cars that don't really belong there, immediately note down the license plate, take photos, and possibly call the police,' said Bodengien. 'It is really a call that we need to do something about this.' But for Bungeneers that is also a sign that a way of life is being lost. Instead of the bliss of watching their birds swoop overhead, owners have to watch warily over their shoulder to see if someone is near the loft. 'Cameras, sensors, alarms. All the time, when you go somewhere you have to look at your app to check the cameras,' he said. 'If there is an alarm, or sometimes the alarm detection goes off and you go check the sheds. And that gives you turmoil.' 'You have to invest thousands of euros in your own hobby to keep potential thieves away,' he added. 'For many people, that is too much and they drop out.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/belgium-s-pastoral-pastime-of-pigeon-racing-faces-high-anxiety-over-crime-wave/7938689.html	2025-01-17T23:52:05-08:00	
Former CIA analyst pleads guilty of leaking information on Israeli plans to attack Iran	A former CIA analyst pleaded guilty Friday in federal court in Virginia to charges that he leaked classified information about Israeli plans to strike Iran. Asif William Rahman, 34, of Vienna, Virginia, was arrested last year in Cambodia and later taken to Guam. He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on each of the two charges: retention and transmission of classified information related to the national defense. Rahman had worked for the intelligence agency since 2016 and had a top-secret security clearance. Prosecutors said Rahman illegally downloaded and printed classified documents at work and then took the documents home, where he altered the items to cover up the source of the information before distributing it. The secret information was eventually published on the Telegram social media platform. A Justice Department statement said that beginning in the spring of 2024 and lasting until November, Rahman shared the 'top-secret information' he learned at his job with 'multiple individuals he knew were not entitled to receive it.' 'Government employees who are granted security clearances and given access to our nation's classified information must promise to protect it,' Robert Wells, executive assistant director of the FBI’s National Security Branch, said Friday in a statement. 'Rahman blatantly violated that pledge and took multiple steps to hide his actions. The FBI will use all our resources to investigate and hold accountable those who illegally transmit classified information and endanger the national security interests of our country,' Wells said. The Justice Department said Rahman destroyed journal entries and written work products on his personal electronic devices 'to conceal his personal opinions on U.S. policy and drafted entries to construct a false narrative regarding his activity.' He also destroyed several other electronic devices, including an internet router that the Justice Department said Rahman 'used to transmit classified information and photographs of classified documents, and discarded the destroyed devices in public trash receptacles in an effort to thwart potential investigations into him and his unlawful conduct.' The Associated Press reported that Rahman was born in California but grew up in Cincinnati and graduated from Yale University after only three years. Rahman is scheduled to be sentenced May 15. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-cia-analyst-pleads-guilty-of-leaking-info-on-israeli-plans-to-attack-iran/7941453.html	2025-01-17T19:23:41-08:00	
US Treasury to launch measures Tuesday to avoid debt limit breach	WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said that the government would reach its statutory borrowing limit on Tuesday and begin employing 'extraordinary measures' to keep from breaching the cap and risking a potential catastrophic default. Yellen, in a letter on Friday to congressional leaders just three days before the Biden administration turns over U.S. government control to President-elect Donald Trump and his team, said the Treasury would begin using extraordinary measures on Jan. 21. 'The period of time that extraordinary measures may last is subject to considerable uncertainty, including the challenges of forecasting the payments and receipts of the U.S. government months into the future,' Yellen said in the letter. Yellen said the Treasury would suspend investments in two government employee benefit funds through March 14, to claw back borrowing capacity under the $36.1 trillion debt ceiling. As of Thursday, the Treasury reported borrowings of $36.08 trillion. The move will suspend new investments that are not immediately required to pay benefits from the Civil Service Retirement and Disability Fund and the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund. Once the debt limit is increased or suspended, the funds are required to be made whole. Yellen said there was 'considerable uncertainty' about how long the measures would last and urged Congress to raise or suspend the debt limit 'to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.' Trump's problem In late December, Yellen said that the debt cap would likely be reached between Jan. 14 and Jan. 23 after Congress opted against including an extension or permanent revocation of the limit in a last-minute budget deal near the end of the year. Trump himself had urged lawmakers to extend or repeal the debt ceiling and later blasted an earlier failure to do so in 2023 as 'one of the dumbest political decisions made in years.' But many Republican lawmakers view the limit as an important leverage point in fiscal negotiations. The debt ceiling issue presents an early challenge to Yellen's expected successor, Trump Treasury pick Scott Bessent. The hedge fund manager told a U.S. Senate confirmation hearing on Thursday that the ceiling is a 'nuanced convention' but if Trump wants to eliminate it, he would work with Congress and the White House to make that happen. The Treasury has a number of extraordinary balance sheet measures it can employ to avoid default, which budget analysts say could last several months, depending on the strength of tax revenues. Ultimately, failure to raise, suspend or eliminate the debt limit could prevent the Treasury from paying all of its obligations. A default would likely have severe economic consequences. A debt limit is a cap set by Congress on how much money the U.S. government can borrow. Because the government spends more money than it collects in tax revenue, lawmakers need to periodically tackle the issue - a politically difficult task, as many are reluctant to vote for more debt. The debt ceiling's history dates to 1917, when Congress gave the Treasury more borrowing flexibility to finance America's entry into World War I but with certain limits. Lawmakers approved the first modern limit on aggregate debt in 1939 at $45 billion and have approved 103 increases since as spending outran tax revenue. Publicly held debt was 98% of U.S. gross domestic product as of October, compared with 32% in October 2001.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-to-launch-measures-tuesday-to-avoid-debt-limit-breach/7941461.html	2025-01-17T19:14:48-08:00	
The role of Kurdish women in the new Syria	Kurdish women in Syria, who played a vital role during the civil war, are now advocating for gender equality in a post-Assad Syria. They are demanding a part in drafting the new Syrian constitution to ensure that it enshrines women’s rights. VOA’s Zana Omer files this report from Qamishli, Syria, narrated by Amy Katz.

Russia adds VOA, Current Time, BBC journalists to register of 'foreign agents'	WASHINGTON — Russia's Justice Ministry on Friday added more journalists to its list of so-called foreign agents, including reporters for Voice of America, Current Time and the BBC. Six journalists were named to the registry, including Ksenia Turkova, who works for VOA's Russian language service in Washington, and Iryna Romaliiska, who works for Current Time, a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty program in partnership with VOA. Others designated by Russia include Anastasia Lotareva and Andrey Kozenko, who work for BBC Russian; Alexandra Prokopenko, a journalist and research fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin; and Anton Rubin, a journalist at exiled media outlet Ekho Moskvy, who is also the director of a nongovernmental organization that helps orphans. Authorities use law to target critics Russia's foreign agent law came into effect in 2012. Since then, say watchdogs, it has been used by authorities to target groups and individuals who are critical of the Kremlin. Hundreds of media outlets, journalists and civil society groups have been listed by the Justice Ministry. Those named as foreign agents have to mark any online content, even personal social media posts, as having come from a foreign agent, and to share financial details. Failure to comply can lead to fines or even imprisonment. Both VOA and its sister network RFE/RL have been designated as so-called foreign agents. Turkova is the first VOA journalist to be named individually. In a statement, VOA director Mike Abramowitz said that VOA and its journalists, by law, provide 'a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news around the world.' 'We stand with our journalists who often face repercussions for providing this vital public service and we remain committed to ensuring that audiences can access the vital content that VOA provides,' he said. Turkova told VOA that she considers the designation by Russia a 'meaningless label.' 'For the authorities, it's a synonym for 'traitor,' 'enemy of the people,' ' she said. 'For those whom the Russian authorities are targeting, it's, in general, an empty sound, a word that means absolutely nothing.' Previously, Turkova worked in Ukraine, where she reported on Russia's occupation of Crimea, the war in Donbas and repressive actions by Moscow. Since moving to Washington, Turkova said, 'I continued to write and speak about the topics that I consider very important. First of all, it's the war in Ukraine. It's repression in Russia and it's the role of propaganda.' Current Time's Romaliiska said she did not care about the designation. 'This only means that the Current Time channel is working great, that our team is doing a good job, which is what we will continue to do, regardless of any lists and statuses,' she told Current Time. 30 journalists behind bars Russia has a dire media freedom record, ranking 162nd out of 180, where 1 shows the best environment on the World Press Freedom Index. It is also a leading jailer of journalists, with 30 behind bars, according to data released Thursday by the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. The report noted that as well as the high number of journalists in custody, Russia in 2024 'took its transnational repression to new levels.' Foreign correspondents and Russian reporters in exile faced in absentia arrest warrants or sentences. The CPJ report described the action as 'an intimidatory tactic,' adding that it 'serves as a chilling illustration of Moscow's determination to control the narrative of its war in Ukraine.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalists-at-voa-current-time-bbc-added-to-russia-s-so-called-foreign-agent-register/7941382.html	2025-01-17T17:15:57-08:00

SpaceX says fire could have caused Starship to break, spew debris near Caribbean	SpaceX says a fire might have caused its Starship to break during liftoff and send trails of flaming debris near the Caribbean. SpaceX's Elon Musk said preliminary indications are that leaking fuel built up pressure in the cavity above the engine firewall. The resulting fire would have doomed the spacecraft. On Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered SpaceX to investigate what went wrong. The FAA said there were no reports of injuries from Starship debris. The 400-foot Starship — the world's biggest and most powerful rocket — launched from the southern tip of Texas on a test flight early Thursday evening. The booster made it back to the pad for a catch by giant mechanical arms, only the second time in Starship history. But the engines on the still-ascending spacecraft shut down one by one, and communication was lost 8-1/2 minutes into the flight. Dramatic video taken near the Turks and Caicos Islands showed spacecraft debris raining down from the sky in a stream of fireballs. Flights near the falling debris had to be diverted, the FAA said. SpaceX said Starship remained in its designated launch corridor over the Gulf of Mexico and then the Atlantic. Any surviving wreckage would have fallen along that path over water, the company said on its website. Starship had been shooting for a controlled entry over the Indian Ocean, halfway around the world. Ten dummy satellites, mimicking SpaceX's Starlink internet satellites, were on board so the company could practice releasing them. It was the seventh test flight of a Starship, but it featured a new and upgraded spacecraft. The FAA said it must approve SpaceX's accident findings and any corrective actions. SpaceX said the booster and spacecraft for the eighth demo are already built and undergoing testing. Musk said on X the loss was 'barely a bump in the road' in his plans to build a fleet of Starships to carry people to Mars. NASA already has booked two Starships to land astronauts on the moon later this decade under its Artemis program, the successor to Apollo. 'Spaceflight is not easy. It's anything but routine,' NASA Administrator Bill Nelson posted on X after the accident. 'That's why these tests are so important.' Earlier Thursday, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company also had mixed results with the debut of its massive New Glenn rocket. It achieved orbit on its first try, putting a test satellite thousands of miles above Earth. But the booster was destroyed after failing to land on a floating platform in the Atlantic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spacex-says-fire-could-have-caused-starship-to-break-spew-debris-near-caribbean/7941177.html	2025-01-17T16:01:11-08:00	
Kurdish leaders seek unity amid Syria's shifting landscape	WASHINGTON — Kurdish leaders in Iraq and Syria are pledging to collaborate closely to advance Kurdish rights in Syria following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime last month. In a rare meeting near Irbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Masoud Barzani, the longtime leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the ruling party in Iraqi Kurdistan, held talks Thursday with Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The meeting has renewed hopes for unity among Syrian Kurdish factions, which have long been divided by political and ideological differences. 'The two leaders discussed the current situation in Syria, including the latest security and political developments,' Barzani’s office said in a statement following the Thursday meeting. Both leaders emphasized the importance of establishing a unified Kurdish front in Syria, the statement added. Abdi, whose SDF controls nearly one-third of Syria’s territory, said his discussions with the Iraqi Kurdish leader centered on the transitional process in Syria following the ouster of Assad’s regime by rebel forces. 'Together, we reaffirmed that the Kurdish position in Syria must be unified and that dialogue with Damascus must peacefully protect the rights of Kurdish people,' he wrote on the social media platform X on Friday. The Kurdish region in northeast Syria has largely been governed by political groups affiliated with the SDF since 2012, after government forces withdrew to fight rebel groups elsewhere in the country. Since then, a Kurdish-led autonomous administration has expanded into some Arab-majority areas in eastern Syria, particularly as the SDF, with support from a U.S.-led global coalition, played a key role in defeating the Islamic State terror group. There is also the Kurdish National Council in Syria (ENKS), which is a coalition of Kurdish parties that are opposed to SDF’s political affiliates. ENKS has ties with Barzani’s KDP and Turkey. Experts suggest that the evolving dynamics in the Middle East present a valuable opportunity for Kurdish groups to advance their cause. 'As regional powers face mounting challenges — Syria’s future remains uncertain, Iran’s military influence and its axis of resistance continue to wane, and tensions between Turkey and Israel escalate — the prospects for Kurdish unity are growing,' said Loqman Radpey, a research fellow at the Middle East Forum. He told VOA by email that the recent meeting in Irbil mirrors those shifting dynamics in the region. However, these Kurdish efforts for unity come amid persistent threats by Turkey against the SDF. Ankara views the Kurdish group as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. Turkish officials have threatened military action to eliminate the SDF if it refuses to disarm. Syria’s new authorities, which are backed by Turkey and led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, have also called for the disbandment of the SDF and the integration of its members into the country’s new Defense Ministry. However, the SDF has stated it will not lay down its arms without a genuine political process in Syria, one in which it can play a key role in shaping the country’s future military. Barzani, the former president of the Kurdistan Region, holds substantial influence among Syrian Kurds and maintains ties with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Experts say this positions him to play a pivotal role in mediating between Syrian Kurdish groups and Turkey. 'For quite a long time, President Barzani has leveraged his personal and political relationships with key actors in both the Kurdish and Turkish camps when the time was right to defuse tension and broker peace,' said Yerevan Saeed, director of the Global Kurdish Initiative for Peace at American University in Washington. 'I think what sets Barzani apart is not just his diplomatic acumen, but his deep understanding of the Kurdish cause and the regional power dynamics at play,' he told VOA by email. Saeed noted that the Kurdish question is inherently transnational, and addressing it demands a comprehensive approach. 'This is why Kurdish leaders across borders must meet, coordinate and strategize together to ensure that rare opportunities are not squandered,' he said.

L.A. fires have scorched largest urban area in California in at least 40 years	Two wildfires still burning in Los Angeles have torched more urban area than any other fire in the state since at least the mid-1980s, an Associated Press analysis shows. The Eaton and Palisades fires that erupted last week have collectively burned almost 4 square miles of highly dense parts of Los Angeles, more than double the urban acreage consumed by the region's Woolsey fire in 2018, according to the AP's analysis of data from the Silvis Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Experts say several factors could lead to wildfires reaching cities more often. Urban areas continue to sprawl into wildland. Climate change is raising global temperatures that lead to more severe weather, including droughts, especially in the western United States. 'If these conditions get worse or more frequent in the future, it wouldn’t be surprising, in my opinion, if there were more events that threaten densely populated places,' said Franz Schug, a researcher studying the boundaries between the wildland and urban areas at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Eaton and Palisades fires’ rampage through Los Angeles has killed at least 27 people, destroyed more than 12,000 structures and put more than 80,000 under evacuation orders. The fires are likely to be among the most destructive in California history, according to the state agency CalFire. The Woolsey fire eventually grew to about twice the current size of the Eaton and Palisades fires but most of the area it burned was uninhabited. Silvis, and AP, defined urban areas as those that are 'high density,' where the land has at least three housing units for every acre, calculated with U.S. Census data. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 burned about 3.3 square miles of the downtown area of the city, according to the Chicago Architecture Center. San Francisco’s Great Fire of 1906 destroyed 4 square miles of the city, according to the Museum of the City of San Francisco. Besides burning the most urban area, the Eaton and Palisades fires are the largest ever for California in January. Alexandra Syphard, a senior research scientist at the Conservation Biology Institute, said their timing and path through the city 'may have no precedent in history.' Authorities haven't determined a cause for the major blazes in California. But experts have noted the extreme weather that created more favorable conditions: heavy rains that drove vegetation growth, then extreme drought that turned much of that vegetation into good fire fuel. Scientists say such extreme weather events are a hallmark of climate change. Then there’s the human element. Across California, about 1.4 million homes were built in areas where residential areas and vegetation intermingle between 1990 and 2020, a 40% increase, the Silvis Lab found. Fires that begin close to populated areas are often caused by people, and their proximity to people means that they are usually extinguished sooner. As David Helmers, a data scientist and geographer at the Silvis Lab, put it, 'Humans tend to ignite fires, but they also fight fires.' But that wasn't the case with the Eaton and Palisades fires, which were whipped by fierce Santa Ana winds to overwhelm fire crews. The 2017 Tubbs fire in northern California's wine country came under similar high winds. That blaze, sparked by a residential electrical system, tore through suburban areas of Santa Rosa, killing 22 people and destroying more than 5,600 homes, businesses and other structures. Overnight, the rubble of the Coffey Park neighborhood became a symbol for how quickly a wildfire can reach a populated area. Some 53 years prior, another fire — the Hanly fire — burned through almost the exact same area. Winds helped it spread with furious speed. But with little development at the time, nobody died and only 100 homes were lost.	https://www.voanews.com/a/l-a-fires-have-scorched-largest-urban-area-in-california-in-at-least-40-years-/7941169.html	2025-01-17T15:23:08-08:00

Biden says Equal Rights Amendment should be considered ratified	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden announced Friday that the Equal Rights Amendment should be considered a ratified addition to the U.S. Constitution, making a symbolic statement that’s unlikely to alter a decadeslong push for gender equality. 'The Equal Rights Amendment is the law of the land,' Biden said, even though presidents have no role in the constitutional process. He did not direct the leader of the National Archives to certify the amendment, as some activists have called for, sidestepping a legal battle. It was the latest in a collection of pronouncements that Biden has made in the waning days of his presidency as he tries to tie up loose ends and embroider his legacy despite leaving after only one term. He’s also called for a ban on stock trading for members of Congress and proposed term limits for Supreme Court justices — ideas that lingered for years before Biden endorsed them. With his popularity low and political influence running dry before he’s replaced by Donald Trump on Monday, Biden’s statements have stirred aggravation among some allies who believe he should have acted more swiftly and spoken out earlier. The Equal Rights Amendment, which would ban discrimination based on gender, was sent to the states for ratification in 1972. Virginia became the 38th state to ratify it in 2000, although years past the deadline set by Congress, leading to a legal standoff over whether it could be considered valid. Democrats and activists have long pressed to consider the amendment as ratified, but Biden did not say he agreed until Friday. 'I wish it was done sooner because it’s so important,' said Christian F. Nunes, leader of the National Organization for Women. 'The fact that it’s getting done now is more important than the fact that it took long, but we can’t continue to delay women’s protections and equal rights in this country.' Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, said she wished Biden’s statement had come earlier in hopes of influencing the leader of the National Archives, who has declined to certify the amendment because of the expired deadline for ratification. 'But we remain hopeful' that it would help build momentum 'even at this late date,' Farrell said. Biden defended his decision not to weigh in until the end of his term by telling reporters that he 'needed all the facts.' Earlier in the day, Biden issued a statement saying that 'it is long past time to recognize the will of the American people.' 'In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex.' It’s unlikely that Biden’s support will have any impact. On Friday, the National Archives reiterated its position by saying 'the underlying legal and procedural issues have not changed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-says-equal-rights-amendment-should-be-considered-ratified/7941130.html	2025-01-17T14:23:57-08:00	
UNRWA chief: Israel’s planned dismantling of aid agency would be ‘catastrophic’	UNITED NATIONS — The head of the United Nations agency that assists Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, warned Friday that the expected implementation later this month of Israeli legislation aimed at shuttering the agency would be 'catastrophic' to humanitarian efforts in Gaza. 'A chaotic dismantling of UNRWA will irreversibly harm the lives and future of the Palestinians,' said Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. 'I believe it will obliterate their trust in the international community and any solution it attempts to facilitate.' On Oct. 28, Israel’s parliament adopted legislation to ban the agency in Israel and forbid Israeli officials from having any contact with UNRWA representatives. Israel says some UNRWA staff participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack inside Israel. The United Nations investigated the accusations and fired nine staffers. Israel's U.N. envoy, Danny Danon, has said that 'UNRWA Gaza has become a front for Hamas.' Lazzarini told reporters that full implementation of the legislation could potentially cripple UNRWA’s ability to reach millions of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. He said they are still waiting for Israel to issue some guidance on how the two laws will be implemented, but nothing has come down so far, and they plan to stay and deliver, opening their schools and clinics as normal. Israel has suggested that other U.N. and international aid agencies take over UNRWA’s work. But Lazzarini said UNRWA’s services, mainly health care and education, can be transferred only to a functioning state — ideally a Palestinian one. 'A ceasefire in Gaza must be followed by a political transition that includes an orderly conclusion of UNRWA’s mandate and the handover of its public-like services to empowered Palestinian institutions,' he said. U.N. officials have repeatedly stressed that if the Knesset legislation is enforced and UNRWA dismantled, then Israel, as the occupying power, would have the legal responsibility for providing essential services to the Palestinian population. Lazzarini was in New York to brief U.N. Security Council members on the situation. He said he asked them to prevent implementation of the Israeli legislation, insist on a political path forward that clearly delineates UNRWA’s role as a provider of essential services, and ensure the agency’s financial crisis does not end its work. UNRWA has long had funding shortfalls. However, the commissioner-general says those shortfalls have been exacerbated by what he calls a politically driven disinformation campaign by Israel to drive donors away from UNRWA, as well as the growing needs in Gaza over the last 15 months. With a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal struck this week that includes a provision for 600 aid trucks a day to enter the enclave, diplomats say UNRWA’s infrastructure and expertise are even more necessary. 'UNRWA remains absolutely indispensable in Gaza, in the West Bank, everywhere,' French Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere told reporters Friday. 'It would be quite a contradiction to close UNRWA while implementing the ceasefire agreement,' he added. 'Because on the one hand, you will try to improve the situation in Gaza — to improve the humanitarian situation — and on the other hand, since there is no credible Plan B for UNRWA, Gazans would just suffer, and the situation will further deteriorate.' The U.N. General Assembly created UNRWA in 1949 to assist Palestinian refugees who lost their homes and livelihoods because of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that led to the creation of the State of Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unrwa-chief-israel-s-planned-dismantling-of-aid-agency-would-be-catastrophic-/7941105.html	2025-01-17T14:12:19-08:00

Journalists in Azerbaijan face trials, jailings, travel bans	WASHINGTON — An Azerbaijani court on Friday denied petitions by two jailed journalists to be released from house arrest, their lawyers said. The journalists, Aynur Elgunesh and Natig Javadli, work for Meydan TV, an independent outlet based in Germany. They were among six journalists arrested in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, in early December. Azerbaijan is among the worst jailers of journalists in the world, with more than a dozen behind bars, according to a report released this week by the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. Azerbaijan is currently detaining at least 18 journalists for their work, according to CPJ. The group’s latest prison census, which acts as a snapshot of media workers in custody as of Dec. 1, listed 13 journalists in the Azerbaijani prison. One of those was released after the census was taken, but authorities then jailed six more journalists, including Elgunesh and Javadli. The arrests are a concern for local activists and reporters. 'Independent and critical media in Azerbaijan is going through its most difficult period,' Azerbaijani activist Samir Kazimli told VOA. 'If this policy of repression does not stop, if it continues, independent media in Azerbaijan may completely collapse.' The annual CPJ report found 361 journalists behind bars around the world. Azerbaijan ranked eighth worst in the census, behind countries such as China, Israel, Myanmar, Belarus and Russia. 'Azerbaijan has been cracking down on independent media for well over a decade,' CPJ’s CEO, Jodie Ginsberg, told VOA. 'It doesn’t often get the attention that it deserves.' Local journalists like Shamshad Agha are worried that Azerbaijani authorities are trying to stamp out independent media. Agha is editor of Argument.az, a news website covering democracy, corruption and human rights. 'The lives of all independent journalists are in danger,' he told VOA. Agha said he has been banned from leaving the country since July 2024. Azerbaijan’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. Many of the journalists jailed in Azerbaijan are accused of foreign currency smuggling, which media watchdogs have rejected as a sham charge. Many of those currently detained work for the independent outlets Abzas Media and Meydan TV. Farid Mehralizada, an economist and journalist with the Azerbaijani Service of VOA’s sister outlet, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, is among those currently imprisoned. Jailed since May, Mehralizada is facing charges of conspiring to smuggle foreign currency, as well as 'illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion and document forgery.' He denies the charges, which carry a combined sentence of up to 12 years behind bars. On Thursday, Ulviyya Guliyeva, a journalist who has been a contributor to VOA’s Azerbaijani Service since 2019, was summoned to a police station in Baku for questioning. The journalist said she was questioned about Meydan TV, even though she is not an employee there. Guliyeva said she was also placed under a travel ban that blocked her from leaving the country. 'This is a very disturbing situation for me,' Guliyeva said. 'I see this as pressure on my journalistic activities.' Parvana Bayramova of VOA’s Azerbaijani Service contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalists-in-azerbaijan-face-trials-jailings-travel-bans/7941072.html	2025-01-17T13:32:23-08:00

Ethnic attacks, hate speech surging in Sudan, UN rights office says	GENEVA — U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk warned on Friday that Sudanese civilians were in greater peril than ever as ethnically motivated attacks and hate speech by the warring parties becomes 'increasingly common.' 'As the Sudanese Armed Forces [SAF] and Rapid Support Forces [RSF] battle for control at all costs in the senseless war that [has] raged for close to two years now, direct and ethnically motivated attacks on civilians are becoming increasingly common,' he said in a statement. 'The situation for civilians in Sudan is already desperate, and there is evidence of the commission of war crimes and other atrocity crimes,' Türk said. 'I fear the situation is now taking a further, even more dangerous turn.' Since the rival forces and generals went to war in mid-April 2023, the United Nations has said, more than 24,000 people have been killed and more than 14 million have been displaced — 11 million inside the country and over 3 million as refugees in neighboring countries. Widespread hunger The World Food Program has reported that nearly 24.6 million people — nearly half the population — suffer from acute hunger and an estimated 1.5 million are on the verge of famine. The World Health Organization has said around 90% of health facilities are not functional, and that cholera, malaria, dengue and measles have been reported in over 12 states. 'This is an extremely dire situation which deserves all the attention it can get to put whatever pressure the international community can to bring this conflict to an end,' Türk’s spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, told journalists Friday at a briefing in Geneva. In the last week alone, she said, the U.N. Human Rights Office documented at least 21 deaths in two attacks in Al Jazirah state, 'although the actual numbers of attacks directed at civilians and of civilians killed are very likely much higher.' 'The reason why we felt we had to speak out today is because of reports of an imminent battle for Khartoum,' she said. 'We are worried about the kinds of violations that we may see as the parties to the conflict battle for control at all costs for Khartoum, and we are worried that this is taking us further away from peace and further into a horrific situation for civilians.' Türk expressed concern about retaliatory attacks of 'shocking brutality' on entire communities based on real or perceived ethnic identity and hate speech, which he said were on the rise and were acting as 'an incitement to violence.' 'This must, urgently, be brought to an end,' he said. Shamdasani reported that the human rights office has received three videos that document scenes of violence, including summary executions that were hailed by perpetrators as 'a cleaning operation.' The victims were referred to as animals and dirt before being killed. 'The videos reportedly were filmed in Wad Madani with men in SAF uniforms visibly present,' the spokesperson said. 'Serious concerns also persist for civilians in North Darfur, where ethnically motivated attacks by the RSF and its allied Arab militias against African ethnic groups, particularly the Zaghawa and Fur, continue to exact a horrific toll,' she said. Effects on neighbors Aid workers in the region have reported that the multiplying horrors of the war in Sudan are having serious effects on neighboring countries, particularly South Sudan. Speaking from the South Sudanese capital, Juba, Florence Gillette, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in South Sudan, said ICRC’s mobile surgical team in the town of Renk had treated more than 230 patients wounded by weapons in just one month. She said more than 120,000 people from Sudan had fled to South Sudan since early December — this on top of 800,000 people who already had sought safety in South Sudan since the war began. 'Dozens of them, wounded by the violence, have required urgent medical care by ICRC doctors,' she said. 'The ongoing influx of Sudanese refugees and South Sudanese returnees is straining resources throughout Renk communities,' she said. 'This is particularly worrying as South Sudan continues to face a cholera outbreak with more than 20,000 cases recorded in the country so far.' Meanwhile, Türk renewed his call for both warring parties to abide by international humanitarian and human rights law. 'Attacks must never be directed against civilians,' he said Arms embargo Shamdasani said the high commissioner also was calling on all states to abide by a U.N. arms embargo and 'to refrain from providing all types of military support in Sudan.' Just as nations fail to abide by the U.N. arms embargo, she acknowledged, sanctions imposed by individual countries often are not respected. This was a reference to the United States, which declared sanctions on army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Thursday, a week after the U.S. slapped sanctions on RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. Sudan’s army-aligned foreign ministry has rejected the U.S. sanctions, calling them 'immoral.' Shamdasani said her office generally opposed broad sanctions because they can damage human rights in a country. 'But targeted sanctions can be effective in exerting pressure on specific individuals and organizations that are responsible for the perpetration of conflict,' she said. 'So we are calling on states to use whatever measures they can, to use whatever leverage they have to pressure the parties to the conflict to bring this war to an end.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethnic-attacks-hate-speech-surging-in-sudan-un-rights-office-says-/7940973.html	2025-01-17T12:39:12-08:00	
Malawi takes steps to end cholera outbreaks by 2030	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Malawi’s government launched a plan Thursday to stop cholera outbreaks by 2030. Officials say that if the government and international partners can effectively cooperate, they can greatly reduce the prevalence of cholera in the southern African country, where it has killed at least 1,700 people over the past three years. Partners include the World Health Organization, or WHO, and UNICEF. Minister of Health Khumbize Kandodo-Chiponda said, 'The goal of the plan is to reduce the annual cholera rate by 90% and achieve the case fatality rate of less than 1% by the year 2030, as recommended by WHO.' Kandodo-Chiponda said there are several ways to achieve the goal, all of which involve the government, development partners, civil society organizations and other stakeholders supplying expertise and funding to support prevention and control efforts. She said those efforts will be 'to increase access to safe water and sanitation facilities and promote improved hygiene practices; to raise awareness and promote community-led initiatives to prevent and to respond to outbreaks.' Malawi has experienced cholera outbreaks over the past three years, with the most severe occurring in 2022, resulting in over 1,700 deaths nationwide. During Thursday’s event, the Malawian government launched an oral cholera vaccine campaign targeting four districts — Mzimba, Karonga, Balaka and Machinga — to address a recent resurgence of cholera there. Statistics from the Presidential Task Force on Cholera show the disease has caused 14 deaths since September. Shadrack Omol, UNICEF’s representative in Malawi, said the 2024 resurgence of cholera shows that root causes of the infectious bacterial disease persist. 'Health interventions ... are complimentary in support,' Omol said. 'The key to addressing the root causes is in provision of safe drinking water across our country, improving sanitation and improving hygiene practices.' Malawi’s public health experts say goals to eradicate the disease within five years will depend on stakeholder commitments. George Jobe, executive director of the Malawi Health Equity Network, said, 'If financial investments [and] technical investments from partners are done, we believe we can win this battle. It should not be a document that should grow dust on the shelves.' Kandodo-Chiponda said the operational plans will be reviewed at least once every year to keep ahead of any possible cholera outbreaks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-takes-steps-to-end-cholera-outbreaks-by-2030/7940991.html	2025-01-17T12:30:12-08:00	
Crews improve containment of LA fires	WASHINGTON — Firefighters have contained more of the Palisades and Eaton fires in Southern California, the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said Friday morning. For the time being, the strongest winds have calmed, but the National Weather Service said dangerous conditions are expected again next week. The strongest winds are expected Tuesday night. The Palisades fire, which has burned through nearly 10,000 hectares, is now 31% contained, according to the forestry department. That fire broke out more than a week ago on the western edge of Los Angeles. The second-biggest fire, the Eaton fire, is now 65% contained, according to the forestry department. It has burned through more than 5,600 hectares. Those two fires have killed at least 27 people and destroyed more than 12,300 structures. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that 18 people remained missing after the fires. A smaller third fire, known as the Auto fire, is 85% contained and has burned through 24 hectares, according to the forestry department. With calmer winds, some residents have been allowed back into neighborhoods affected by the Eaton and Palisades fires. About 82,000 people remained under mandatory evacuation orders and 90,000 others were under evacuation warnings. Curfews were still in effect for the Palisades and Eaton fire zones from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crews-improve-containment-of-la-fires/7940931.html	2025-01-17T12:01:58-08:00	
Taiwan faces decline in troop numbers, report reveals	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan's military has announced new recruitment and retention measures to help sustain troop levels, as the island faces continued threats from China amid a shrinking number of volunteer soldiers. According to Taiwan’s Central News Agency, the Ministry of National Defense unveiled measures Wednesday that call for pay raises for volunteer enlistees among other incentives. According to data from the Budget Center of Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan, the number of volunteer troops has dropped by 12,000 over the past three years. The military currently has 152,885 soldiers, compared with 164,884 soldiers in 2021. Additionally, more Taiwanese soldiers are choosing to discharge from their service commitments early, according to the data. Some 1,565 troops took early leave in 2024, a sharp increase from the nearly 400 personnel who did so in 2020. The decline has prompted Taiwanese authorities to reinstate a one-year conscripted service requirement for Taiwanese males and make efforts to improve the military’s defense training infrastructure and provide higher salaries to its troops. Still, some analysts are worried that these reforms might not be enough to ensure Taiwan’s combat-readiness. Yu-Ping Chou is a former director of the planning division at the Air Defense Missile Command under the General Staff Headquarters of Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense. He told VOA’s Mandarin Service that so far reforms have not been enough to ease the challenges of troop recruitment and retention. Current active-duty personnel find themselves taking on extended hours of training and service work to offset the impact of depleted troop enrollment, which drives more troops to seek discharge, Chou said. More frequent aggressive maneuvers from China have also required Taiwan’s military to increase surveillance and patrol missions, adding to the burden put on already overworked soldiers, he said. Chou said the military is also facing a type of 'brain-drain.' This problem is particularly prominent within the air force, with many skilled pilots deciding to leave and seek higher salaries in the commercial airline industry. Experienced soldiers are essential to operate advanced weapons systems, which makes the heightened discharge numbers especially challenging for the island’s efforts to modernize its defense force. 'The defense force is currently in the process of upgrading its equipment and weapons systems, and needs quality manpower to operate these new, advanced weapons,' Chou said. 'If there’s no one to operate the best equipment, can it perform at its full potential?' A final reason for the fall in enrollment, Chou said, stems from the perceived heightened danger of serving as a soldier at this time. He said the current 'danger of war' has made some families reluctant to send their children into service. A-Wei, a 32-year-old volunteer officer who has served for 11 years in Matsu, an island off the southeastern coast of mainland China, says he has never considered early retirement. While Wei admits that many units are troubled with a salary mismatch and understaffing, with some even operating with 50% or 60% of the desired manpower, he says that the capacity of Taiwan’s fighting forces has not faltered. For Wei, these present challenges have, on the contrary, pushed the military to become more efficient. He asserts that, despite issues with the military budget and troop recruitment, the capacity of Taiwan’s military has not faltered, and that troops remain steadfast despite the looming threat of war. 'Many of the military's current equipment is actually very advanced. I don't think the decrease in personnel has a big impact. In the past, there were actually some surplus personnel. Now, the training has become much more enhanced and streamlined, eliminating some unnecessary procedures,' Wei told VOA. Upgrades in equipment and a stable, good-enough salary have kept Wei at his position in the military. Wei says that with his salary and bonuses for participating in combat-related missions, he is earning more than some office workers on the island. As for talk online and in the media about whether Taiwanese soldiers are willing or afraid to go to war, Wei said that this is likely a Chinese 'information warfare' tactic. 'The most common reason people leave the military, or why a unit may struggle to keep personnel, is because they feel the task distribution is unfair or the workload is too heavy,' Wei said. 'I've never heard of anyone wanting to leave the military just because they think mainland China is going to attack.' Su Tzu-yun, director of the division of defense strategy and resource under the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, blamed demographic factors for the fall in recruitment, and pointed out that many advanced democracies are also facing challenges in military recruitment. The number of men eligible for military recruitment is falling, dropping below 100,000 in 2024 for the first time in Taiwan’s history, according to the Ministry of the Interior. By 2031, it is predicted that there will be fewer than 75,000 recruitable men on the island. Taiwan is looking to meet this challenge with its reinstatement of one-year compulsory service requirement, Su said, adding that he has faith in the program’s ability to increase manpower and ease the burden on volunteer troops. 'I think that during this transition period, with the addition of conscription soldiers, around 6,900 people, for example, joined the military last year, and more will join this year. After supplementing the manpower, the workload of the voluntary service members will be reduced, which will help decrease their overall discharge rate, thus avoiding this vicious cycle,' Su told VOA. Aside from lengthening the conscription requirement and improving salaries and benefits, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry is looking at a variety of other measures to combat the recruitment and retention problem. These programs include adopting more tolerant management practices within the service and liberalizing entry restrictions to recruit foreign personnel.

Media advocates say jailing of journalists in Venezuela, Cuba stifles reporting	MADRID — Venezuela and Cuba this week released political prisoners, including a free speech advocate, but analysts say the threat of legal action in authoritarian countries stifles media freedom. In Venezuela on Thursday, Carlos Correa, director of the free speech organization Espacio Publico, was freed after a week in custody, his group reported. Authorities had arrested Correa along with at least six others, including opposition politicians, ahead of President Nicolas Maduro’s inauguration last Friday. 'We thank all the people, organizations, governments and groups that joined the voice for [Correa’s] liberation. We continue to defend human dignity,' Espacio Publico said in a post on social media X. Correa’s legal situation remained unclear. The journalist has appeared before an anti-terrorism court, his wife, Mabel Calderin, told reporters Thursday. Calderin said she had no information on the charges brought against her husband. The Venezuelan Communications Ministry did not reply to an email from VOA asking for a comment about the release of Correa. Correa has not replied to messages on social media from VOA. Also, this week, Cuba released 127 activists as part of a deal with outgoing U.S President Joe Biden, who pledged to remove Havana from the U.S. list of terrorism sponsors. Cash-strapped Cuba promised to free up to 553 people, many of whom the U.S. government considers as 'political prisoners.' Most were arrested for taking part in anti-government demonstrations in July 2021 over a series of power cuts, food shortages and price increases. Prisoners Defenders International, a Madrid-based opposition group, estimates Cuba is holding 1,161 political prisoners. Five reporters remain behind bars and another five face legal restrictions on their freedom, Prisoners Defenders said. These restrictions vary from not being able to leave the island to serving sentences under house arrest. None of those released on Wednesday are journalists, Prisoners Defenders International told VOA. Civil society groups welcomed the releases in both countries but warn that the threat of legal action or jailing intimidates independent media. In its annual report of jailed journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ noted that while few Latin American countries are detaining media workers, even a small number of arrests can create a repressive environment. 'That increased criminalization that we’re seeing of journalists is a deliberate tactic by governments to silence journalists, because they know that if there is a threat of being labelled a criminal or there is threat of imprisonment, many journalists will back off from that reporting,' Jodie Ginsberg, who heads CPJ, told VOA. Globally, CPJ found 361 journalists behind bars for their work, the second highest number recorded by the organization since it began recording data in 1992. Ginsberg said that in authoritarian Latin American countries, not many journalists have been jailed but this may show the success of repressive policies. 'So, in some cases, a low number of jailed journalists in a repressive regime is actually an indication of how successful that regime has been in repressing them. In Latin America and the Caribbean, what we see more often is physical attacks on journalists,' added Ginsberg. The leader of Venezuela’s neighbor, Colombia, celebrated the release of Correa and called for all political prisoners to be freed in Latin America. 'When Cuba has released more than 500 prisoners, it is important for peace in the Americas that Venezuela releases all the people detained in the framework of the [presidential] election and the post-election, including the 12 Colombians detained in its territory,' Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrote in a post on X. 'May the Americas be a land of freedom without political prisoners,' he added. Petro declined to attend Maduro’s inauguration amid widespread accusation that last year's Venezuelan election was rigged. Days before Maduro was sworn in for a third term, Caracas detained seven individuals that it described as 'mercenaries,' including two Americans. However, the political party Popular Will said authorities have detained up to 19 people. Witnesses saw Correa being bundled into a car by hooded figures, Espacio Publico said. The same week that he was detained, authorities arrested Enrique Marquez, a politician who ran in the 2024 presidential elections and later backed Edmundo Gonzalez as the victor. Marquez, who is accused of trying to stage a coup against Maduro, remains behind bars. The Venezuelan government is investigating major opposition leaders for alleged conspiracy, among other charges, and has repeatedly accused the opposition of inciting violence with its claims of victory in the presidential election in July.

UK leader condemns 'poison of antisemitism' on Auschwitz visit	WARSAW, POLAND — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday condemned what he called 'the poison of antisemitism rising around the world' after a visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau, the former German Nazi concentration camp. His visit came as many international delegations are expected to attend the Jan. 27 ceremony commemorating 80 years since the Soviet Red Army liberated the death camp built in occupied Poland. King Charles III will be among those attending the ceremony, Buckingham Palace said Monday, in his first visit to the former camp. 'Time and again we condemn this hatred, and we boldly say, 'never again,'' Starmer said in a statement following his visit. 'But where is never again, when we see the poison of antisemitism rising around the world' in the aftermath of October 7th, he said. The Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas staged the deadliest attack in Israeli history. The attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures. Israel's retaliatory campaign has left 46,876 people dead, the majority civilians, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, figures the United Nations has described as reliable. Last week, the Polish government said it would grant free access to Israeli officials wanting to attend the commemoration, despite a warrant issued in November by the International Criminal Court for the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he had information from the Israeli Embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister. The International Criminal Court issued the warrant in November over the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, prompting outrage from Israel and its allies. Auschwitz has become a symbol of Nazi Germany's genocide of 6 million European Jews, 1 million of whom died at the site between 1940 and 1945, along with more than 100,000 non-Jews.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-leader-condemns-poison-of-antisemitism-on-auschwitz-visit/7940776.html	2025-01-17T10:23:24-08:00	
US fortifying Indo-Pacific air bases against potential attacks from China	Washington — The United States has been ramping up its Indo-Pacific region air bases to ensure they are protected against attack, a spokesperson for the U.S. Pacific Air Forces told VOA this week, amid concerns over vulnerabilities they face in countries such as Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea against potential Chinese strikes. 'While we are continually improving our theater posture, warfighting advantage, and integration with allied and partners, Pacific Air Forces stands ready every day to respond to anything that poses a threat to a free and open Indo-Pacific,' the spokesperson said. 'We continue to invest in infrastructure and technology to enhance the resilience and survivability of our bases and facilities across the theater including hardening airfields and buildings while investing in advanced security systems to protect our personnel and assets,' the spokesperson told VOA on Tuesday. The Air Force was authorized with '$916.6 million to improve logistics, maintenance capabilities, and prepositioning of equipment, munitions, fuel, and material in the Indo-Pacific' through the fiscal 2024 Pacific Deterrence Initiative, the spokesperson added. The Pacific Deterrence Initiative is a set of defense priorities set up in 2021 by congress to support U.S. goals in the Indo-Pacific, primarily to counter China. The comments were made in response to a report last week by the Hudson Institute claiming that U.S. aircraft at allied Indo-Pacific country bases could suffer major losses from Chinese attacks unless those bases are fortified. If left unfortified, the U.S. air power in the region would be significantly reduced compared to China’s, according to the report, Concrete Sky: Air Based Hardening in the Western Pacific. One of the reasons, according to the report, is that the U.S. is lagging behind China in the number of shelters that could hide and protect the aircraft from attacks. China more than doubled the number of aircraft shelters since the early 2010s, having more than 3,000, according to the report. Across 134 Chinese air bases located within 1,000 nautical miles from the Taiwan Strait, China has more than 650 hardened aircraft shelters and nearly 2,000 nonhardened individual aircraft shelters. A hardened shelter is a reinforced structure made of steel, concrete, and other materials to protect military aircraft from enemy strikes. In comparison, the U.S. has added two hardened shelters and 41 nonhardened ones within 1,000 nautical miles of the Taiwan Strait and outside South Korea since the 2010s, continues the report. This means if a war breaks out over Taiwan, U.S. aircraft could suffer more damage than China’s if they attacked each other’s bases in the region, which would prevent U.S. air operation for a duration of time, said analysts. According to Kelly Grieco, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center’s Reimagining U.S. Grand Strategy Program, attacks on U.S. bases in the Pacific region, including Japan could 'prevent the U.S. Air Force from conducting fighter operations for about the first 12 days of a conflict from U.S. bases in Japan.' Grieco continued, based on her own report published by the Stimson Center, that Chinese missiles could also take out runways and aerial refueling tankers, rendering them unusable over a month at U.S. bases in Japan and over half week at U.S. military bases in Guam and other Pacific locations. 'It’s not possible to harden a runway or taxiway,' that is exposed as easy targets to destroy, disabling aircraft from taking off, she said. This begs the question of whether it is worth investing in hardening facilities, she adds. The Hudson Institute report says within the 1,000 nautical miles of Taiwan, China has added 20 runways and 49 taxiways since the 2010s while the U.S. added one runway and one taxiway. Unhardened airfields Among U.S. air bases in allied countries of Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea, those in the Philippines are the least protected, Timothy Walton, one of the authors of the Hudson report, told VOA. 'In Japan, Kadena and Misawa Air Bases are the most fortified U.S. bases, while the remainder are largely unfortified,' said Walton, a senior fellow at Hudson’s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology. 'In the Republic of Korea, the two U.S. Air Force bases, Osan and Kunsan, are hardened. Airfields in the Philippines are unhardened,' he said. Grieco said the U.S. would mostly rely on its bases in Japan, Guam, and other Pacific locations as South Korea would 'restrict the use of U.S. bases in its territory in a Taiwan contingency out of concern about North Korean aggression and to avoid a rupture with Beijing.' U.S. Representative John Moolenaar, the chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Senator Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, and 13 other lawmakers underlined last year the importance of hardened shelters to protect against Chinese attacks. In a letter sent to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall and Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro in May, they said, 'U.S. bases in the region have almost no hardened aircraft shelters compared to Chinese military bases,' leading to U.S. air assets being 'highly vulnerable to Chinese strikes.' Aside from hardened shelters, analysts pointed to dispersing airfields as important. Steven Rudder, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former commanding general of U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, said, 'When you look at the number of aircraft in the Asia Pacific, I am not sure that the ability to harden every single aircraft parking space would be as effective as a distributed force.' Bruce Bennett, a senior defense researcher at Rand Corporation, said dispersing airfields are important against nuclear strikes. Against conventional warhead missiles, shelters are 'key to the protection,' said Bennett. 'But if there’s a nuclear threat, you’ve got to have different airfields' as alternative locations to park and land aircraft and to provide logistic support such as fueling, maintenance, and repair, he said. Bennett added the disparity in the number of aircraft shelters between the China and U.S. seems to stem from U.S. air superiority. 'What the U.S. Air Force tends to perceive is that we’ve got the ability to deal with the Chinese air force in an air-to-air combat' where China traditionally felt it would lose air-to-air combat against the U.S. and therefore wants to take U.S. aircraft on the ground before engaging in air while sheltering theirs heavily on the ground, Bennett said. 'The question becomes, as the Chinese aircraft get better and as they start fielding fifth generation fighter, will the U.S. need the ability to attack Chinese airfields with conventional weapons? I don’t think the Defense Department has considered it as one of important tasks,' Bennett said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-fortifying-indo-pacific-air-bases-against-potential-attacks-from-china-/7940739.html	2025-01-17T10:06:59-08:00

Trump’s inauguration swearing-in to be moved indoors due to cold	resident-elect Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony is to be moved inside the U.S. Capitol on Monday because of expected freezing cold temperatures, according to media reports. On Inauguration Day, temperatures in the U.S. capital are expected to hit a low of 11 degrees Fahrenheit (-11 degrees Celsius) and a high of just 23 degrees Fahrenheit (-5 degrees Celsius). The frigid temperatures mean Trump’s inauguration is expected to be the coldest in 40 years, according to meteorologists. With such cold weather, Trump will take the oath of office inside the U.S. Capitol, rather than outside, according to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, both of which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. President Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration in 1985 was the last time a swearing-in ceremony was moved indoors. The news that Trump’s inauguration is moving inside comes soon after confirmation that China is sending Vice President Han Zheng to attend the ceremony. This will be the first time a senior Chinese leader is scheduled to attend a U.S. president’s swearing-in.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-inauguration-swearing-in-to-be-moved-indoors-due-to-cold-/7940721.html	2025-01-17T09:41:08-08:00	
US Treasury sanctions Chinese company over Salt Typhoon hack	Washington — The U.S. Treasury department on Friday sanctioned Singaporean Yin Kechen and cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., accusing both of being involved in a series of hacks against American telecom companies. The intrusions, known under the name 'Salt Typhoon,' have allegedly exposed a huge swathe of Americans' call logs to Chinese spies and rattled the U.S. intelligence community. In some cases, the hackers are alleged to have intercepted conversations, including between prominent U.S. politicians and government officials. Some lawmakers have described them as the worst telecom hack in America's history. In a statement, the Treasury described Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co. as a hacking company with 'strong ties' to China's Ministry of State Security (MSS), an intelligence agency. It said that Yin Kechen had worked as a hacker for over a decade and also had ties to the MSS. It further alleged that he was tied to the recent breach at the U.S. Treasury.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-sanctions-chinese-company-over-salt-typhoon-hack-/7940682.html	2025-01-17T09:11:58-08:00	
Supreme Court upholds law banning TikTok if it's not sold by its Chinese parent company	Washington — The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok beginning Sunday unless it's sold by its China-based parent company, holding that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the United States. A sale does not appear imminent and, although experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users' phones once the law takes effect on Jan. 19, new users won't be able to download it and updates won't be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department has said in court filings. The decision came against the backdrop of unusual political agitation by President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it won't enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Trump, mindful of TikTok’s popularity, and his own 14.7 million followers on the app, finds himself on the opposite side of the argument from prominent Senate Republicans who fault TikTok’s Chinese owner for not finding a buyer before now. It’s unclear what options are open to Trump once he is sworn in as president on Monday. The law allowed for a 90-day pause in the restrictions on the app if there had been progress toward a sale before it took effect. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who defended the law at the Supreme Court for the Democratic Biden administration, told the justices last week that it's uncertain whether the prospect of a sale once the law is in effect could trigger a 90-day respite for TikTok. At arguments, the justices were told by a lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese technology company that is its parent, how difficult it would be to consummate a deal, especially since Chinese law restricts the sale of the proprietary algorithm that has made the social media platform wildly successful. The app allows users to watch hundreds of videos in about half an hour because some are only a few seconds long, according to a lawsuit filed last year by Kentucky complaining that TikTok is designed to be addictive, and it harms kids' mental health. Similar suits were filed by more than a dozen states. TikTok has called the claims inaccurate. The dispute over TikTok's ties to China has come to embody the geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing. The U.S. has said it’s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect. TikTok points out the U.S. has not presented evidence that China has attempted to manipulate content on its U.S. platform or gather American user data through TikTok. Bipartisan majorities in Congress passed legislation, and President Joe Biden signed it into law in April. The law was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over TikTok, which the government sees as a national security threat. TikTok, which sued the government last year over the law, has long denied it could be used as a tool of Beijing. A three-judge panel made up of two Republican appointees and a Democratic appointee unanimously upheld the law in December, prompting TikTok’s quick appeal to the Supreme Court. Without a sale to an approved buyer, the law bars app stores operated by Apple, Google and others from offering TikTok beginning on Sunday. Internet hosting services also will be prohibited from hosting TikTok. ByteDance has said it won’t sell. But some investors have been eyeing it, including Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt. McCourt’s Project Liberty initiative has said it and its unnamed partners have presented a proposal to ByteDance to acquire TikTok’s U.S. assets. The consortium, which includes 'Shark Tank' host Kevin O’Leary, did not disclose the financial terms of the offer. Prelogar told the justices last week that having the law take effect 'might be just the jolt' ByteDance needs to reconsider its position.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-upholds-law-banning-tiktok-if-it-s-not-sold-by-its-chinese-parent-company-/7940533.html	2025-01-17T07:41:10-08:00	
Trump's homeland security pick faces scrutiny on immigration plans	WASHINGTON — South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency central to his vision of cracking down on illegal immigration, is facing senators Friday at a confirmation hearing that is her first chance to lay out her vision for the sprawling Department of Homeland Security. Noem, a two-term governor and former U.S. congresswoman, was chosen by the president-elect to lead the department responsible for key immigration and border-related actions that will be central to his plans for mass deportations and tightened access at the border. The immigration and border-related agencies Noem would oversee include U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. Beyond those agencies, the department is also responsible for securing airline transportation, protecting high-profile dignitaries, responding to natural disasters. She would replace outgoing DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who was so vilified by Republicans angry at the number of migrants crossing the country's southern border that they impeached him in early 2024. Noem would be entering a job that was a pressure cooker under the first Trump administration. Six people cycled through the homeland security secretary position during his four years in office. So far, she appears to have strong backing from Republican senators, who will be crucial to her confirmation. Senator Rand Paul, the Republican chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee where Noem will testify, said he expected a straightforward hearing. 'I'm not aware of any real specific complaints from the Democrats on Kristi Noem,' Paul said. 'I think there's a reasonable chance that she gets some Democrat support.' Still, Democrats are likely to question whether she is qualified to lead a department that is crucial to the country's safety. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat on the committee, said he had 'serious doubts' about her ability to manage 'this huge organization of such serious consequence to national security.' Noem in recent years became a regular presence in Trump's orbit and at one point was even considered to be his running mate. After becoming governor, Noem started working closely with Corey Lewandowski, Trump's 2016 campaign manager. Then, during the pandemic, she rose to prominence in conservative circles for resisting most government regulations to slow the spread of infections. The South Dakota governor has echoed Trump's tough immigration talk. 'Now, the situation at our southern border is nothing short of an invasion. And over the last four years, America's border security has been purposely weakened and ignored. Our laws have not been enforced,' Noem said during her State of the State address Tuesday. Noem joined other Republican governors who sent troops to Texas to assist Operation Lone Star, which sought to discourage migrants. The decision was met with criticism because Noem covered most of the deployment cost with a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire who has often donated to Republicans.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-homeland-security-pick-faces-scrutiny-on-immigration-plans/7940464.html	2025-01-17T07:01:27-08:00	
Report: 67 journalists jailed for their work across Africa	WASHINGTON — At least 67 journalists are imprisoned across Africa, reflecting the continent’s ongoing struggle for a free press, according to a report released Thursday. The cases in Africa contribute to a global total of 361 journalists jailed as of Dec. 1, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. It is the second-highest number ever recorded by CPJ. Muthoki Mumo, the Africa program coordinator at CPJ, said the report highlights a global trend in which authoritarian regimes weaponize laws against journalists, using national security, anti-terror and cybercrime legislation to justify crackdowns. While these trends are not confined to Africa, the continent has seen alarming cases of journalists facing prosecution under such laws, said Mumo. Countries such as Burundi, Ethiopia and Nigeria are using legislation intended for public safety to criminalize journalism, Mumo said. In Nigeria, 'You have four journalists behind bars being prosecuted under cybercrime legislation in connection to their reporting on corruption,' Mumo told VOA in a video interview. And in Ethiopia, six journalists are behind bars. 'Five of them are facing prosecution under anti-terrorism laws. They could potentially face very harsh penalties if they are convicted,' said Mumo. Another trend, the media advocacy group says, is the use of vague and broad laws to target journalists. In Burundi, Sandra Muhoza, a reporter for the online media outlet La Nova Burundi was convicted under national security laws after posting a WhatsApp message. The case, said Mumo, is a clear example of the criminalization of journalism. Muhoza was convicted recently of trying to 'undermine the ‘integrity of the national territory’ — which is a mouthful — but it's essentially, a provision in Burundian laws about national security, and this was turned against this journalist,' Mumo said. VOA sent messages to Burundi’s government spokesperson, Jerome Niyonzima, along with the Ethiopian communication services minister, Legesse Tulu, and Eritrea’s information minister, Yemane Gebremeskel, requesting comment, but inquiries went unanswered. The Washington embassy of Nigeria has not yet responded to VOA requests for comment. The continent’s top jailers are familiar names, with Egypt topping the list as the worst jailer of journalists, with 17 held. 'In Egypt, we’ve seen anti-state laws being turned against the media,' Mumo said. Eritrea, known for its long-standing detention of journalists, follows closely behind, with 16 journalists behind bars — some since 2001. Eritrea is home to the longest-detained journalists in the world, many of whom have never been tried in court. 'That's a very dubious honor on the part of Eritrea that the journalists who have been behind jail the longest in the world are actually Eritreans,' Mumo said. Jodie Ginsberg, the head of CPJ, said it is important to keep advocating for those imprisoned in Eritrea. The country 'falls off the radar internationally,' she told VOA, 'Because of how little press freedom and media freedom there is to report on what's happening inside.' 'It's very easy sometimes to forget some of those longer cases. They go out of the public eye,' Ginsberg told VOA, adding that it is important to talk about 'places where journalists have been in jail for a very, very long time and still need to be fought for.' Ethiopia, where journalists have been held without trial for extended periods, is another major offender, along with Cameroon, Rwanda and Tunisia. In these countries, journalists are often detained under 'anti-state regulation, the use of false news regulations to throw a journalist behind bars and to prosecute them.' Mumo said. CPJ’s report highlights press freedom issues in Angola, where Carlos Raimundo Alberto, an editor who was arrested on Sept. 29, 2023, remains detained. Raimundo qualified for parole in November 2024 but has yet to comply with a court order to publicly apologize to a government official. And in Senegal, journalist Rene Capain Bassene has been jailed for life for a crime that witnesses said he could not have committed, the report said. Mumo said CPJ faces challenges accessing information in some regions about the state of media freedom. But, she said, 'It could also be about intimidation; family members and others who are aware of arrest may not always want to speak out about them.' Despite obstacles, she said, CPJ strives to keep the names of detained journalists alive. The media advocacy group calls on governments to respect the rights of journalists and make sure that their work is not criminalized. While the prison census offers a snapshot of the situation on a specific date, Mumo said the report alone cannot fully capture the often-fluid reality journalists face. The report offers a small window into the larger picture of press freedom, Mumo said, 'because there are journalists who go in and out of prison during other times of the year. They’re not reflected in this number.'

Gaza is in ruins, and it's unclear how it will be rebuilt	Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are eager to leave miserable tent camps and return to their homes if a long-awaited ceasefire agreement halts the Israel-Hamas war, but many will find there is nothing left and no way to rebuild. Israeli bombardment and ground operations have transformed entire neighborhoods in several cities into rubble-strewn wastelands, with blackened shells of buildings and mounds of debris stretching away in all directions. Major roads have been plowed up. Critical water and electricity infrastructure is in ruins. Most hospitals no longer function. And it's unclear when — or even if — much will be rebuilt. The agreement for a phased ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas-led militants does not say who will govern Gaza after the war, or whether Israel and Egypt will lift a blockade limiting the movement of people and goods that they imposed when Hamas seized power in 2007. The United Nations says that it could take more than 350 years to rebuild if the blockade remains. Two-thirds of all structures destroyed The full extent of the damage will only be known when the fighting ends and inspectors have full access to the territory. The most heavily destroyed part of Gaza, in the north, has been sealed off and largely depopulated by Israeli forces in an operation that began in early October. Using satellite data, the United Nations estimated last month that 69% of the structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, including over 245,000 homes. The World Bank estimated $18.5 billion in damage — nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022 — from just the first four months of the war. Israel blames the destruction on Hamas, which ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The military has released photos and video footage showing that Hamas built tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas, and often operated in and around homes, schools and mosques. Mountains of rubble to be moved Before anything can be rebuilt, the rubble must be removed — a staggering task in itself. The U.N. estimates that the war has littered Gaza with over 50 million tons of rubble — roughly 12 times the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. With over 100 trucks working full time, it would take over 15 years to clear the rubble away, and there is little open space in the narrow coastal territory that is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians. Carting the debris away will also be complicated by the fact that it contains huge amounts of unexploded ordnance and other harmful materials, as well as human remains. Gaza's Health Ministry says thousands of people killed in airstrikes are still buried under the rubble. No plan for the day after The rubble clearance and eventual rebuilding of homes will require billions of dollars and the ability to bring construction materials and heavy equipment into the territory — neither of which is assured. The ceasefire agreement calls for a three- to five-year reconstruction project to begin in its final phase, after all the remaining 100 hostages have been released and Israeli troops have withdrawn from the territory. But getting to that point will require agreement on the second and most difficult phase of the deal, which still must be negotiated. Even then, the ability to rebuild will depend on the blockade, which critics have long decried as a form of collective punishment. Israel says it is needed to prevent Hamas from rebuilding its military capabilities, noting that cement and metal pipes can also be used for tunnels and rockets. Israel might be more inclined to lift the blockade if Hamas were no longer in power, but there are no plans for an alternative government. The United States and much of the international community want a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern the West Bank and Gaza with the support of Arab countries ahead of eventual statehood. But that's a nonstarter for Israel's government, which is opposed to a Palestinian state and has ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed authority. International donors are unlikely to invest in an ungoverned territory that has seen five wars in less than two decades, which means the sprawling tent camps along the coast could become a permanent feature of life in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-is-in-ruins-and-it-s-unclear-how-it-will-be-rebuilt-/7940413.html	2025-01-17T05:59:25-08:00	
Army expects to meet recruiting goals, in dramatic turnaround, and denies 'wokeness' is a factor	The Army expects to meet its enlistment goals for 2025, marking a dramatic turnaround for a service that has struggled for several years to bring in enough young people and has undergone a major overhaul of its recruiting programs. In an interview with The Associated Press, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said the Army is on pace to bring in 61,000 young people by the end of the fiscal year in September and will have more than 20,000 additional young people signed up in the delayed entry program for 2026. It's the second straight year of meeting the goals. 'What’s really remarkable is the first quarter contracts that we have signed are the highest rate in the last 10 years,' Wormuth said. 'We are going like gangbusters, which is terrific.' Wormuth, who took over the Army four years ago as restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were devastating recruitment across the military, also flatly rejected suggestions that the Army is 'woke.' Critics have used the term to describe what they call an over-emphasis on diversity and equity programs. Some Republicans have blamed 'wokeness' for the recruiting struggles, a claim repeated by President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, during his confirmation hearing this week. Wormuth dismissed the claims. 'Concerns about the Army being, quote, woke, have not been a significant issue in our recruiting crisis,' she said. 'They weren’t at the beginning of the crisis. They weren’t in the middle of the crisis. They aren’t now. The data does not show that young Americans don’t want to join the Army because they think the army is woke — however they define that.' Hegseth has vowed to remove 'woke' programs and officers from the military. And during his hearing Tuesday, he told senators that troops will rejoice as the Trump administration takes office and makes those changes. 'We’ve already seen it in recruiting numbers,' he said. 'There’s already been a surge since President Trump won the election.' In fact, according to Army data, recruiting numbers have been increasing steadily over the past year, with the highest total in August 2024 — before the November election. Army officials closely track recruiting numbers. Instead, a significant driver of the recruiting success was the Army's decision to launch the Future Soldier Prep Course, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022. That program gives lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them meet military standards and move on to basic training. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2024, the Army met its recruiting goal of 55,000 and began to rebuild its delayed entry pool. About 24% of those recruits came out of the prep course. Wormuth said she expects it will contribute about 30% of this year's recruits. The Army and the military more broadly have struggled with recruiting for about a decade, as the unemployment rate shrank, and competition grew from private companies able and willing to pay more and offer similar or better benefits. Just 23% of young adults are physically, mentally and morally qualified to serve without receiving some type of waiver. Moral behavior issues include drug use, gang ties or a criminal record. And the coronavirus pandemic shut down enlistment stations and in-person recruiting in schools and at public events that the military has long relied upon. Wormuth said a private survey along with more recent data show that the key impediments to joining the military are concerns 'about getting killed or getting hurt, leaving their friends and family, and having a perception that their careers will be on hold.' That survey, done in 2022, found that 'wokeness' was mentioned by just 5% of respondents. Wormuth acknowledged that the latest data show one element mentioned by Hegseth — that the number of white men enlisting is a bit lower. She said the persistent criticism about wokeness could be one reason. 'Any time an institution is being inaccurately criticized and demeaned, it’s going to make it harder to recruit. And I think that is what we have seen,' she said. 'In terms of ‘is the Army woke’ — which I will take to mean focused on things that don’t make us more lethal or effective or better able to defend this nation — I would say the Army is absolutely not woke.' As an example, she said recruits get one hour of equal opportunity instruction in basic training and 95 hours of marksmanship. She also said there has been an increase in minority enlistment. The service brought in the highest number ever of Hispanic recruits in 2024 and saw a 6% increase in Black recruiting. In 2022, the Army fell 15,000 short of its enlistment goal of 60,000. The following year, the service brought in a bit more than 50,000 recruits, widely missing its publicly stated 'stretch goal' of 65,000. The Navy and the Air Force all missed their recruitment targets in 2023, while the Marine Corps and the tiny Space Force have consistently hit their goals. Critics have also charged that the military has lowered standards under President Joe Biden's administration. Asked if that was true for the Army, Wormuth said the service actually resolved not to do that to meet its recruiting goals. Instead, she said, the prep course helps recruits meet the standards. Other changes that have helped the recruiting turnaround, she said, include an overhaul of the system used to select recruiters, which now chooses soldiers more suited to the task, as well as an increased use of data analytics to improve marketing and ads. The Army also increased the number of medical personnel being used to help process routine waivers to move them more quickly through the system. A consistent complaint across the military has been that it took too long to get a waiver approved and that recruits were moving on to other jobs as a result of the delays.	https://www.voanews.com/a/army-expects-to-meet-recruiting-goals-in-dramatic-turnaround-and-denies-wokeness-is-a-factor-/7940367.html	2025-01-17T05:17:19-08:00	
Biden sets record by commuting sentences of nearly 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug charges	Washington — President Joe Biden announced Friday that he was commuting the sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses, using his final days in office on a flurry of clemency actions meant to nullify prison terms he deemed too harsh. The recent round of clemency gives Biden the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued. The Democrat said he is seeking to undo 'disproportionately long sentences compared to the sentences they would receive today under current law, policy, and practice.' 'Today's clemency action provides relief for individuals who received lengthy sentences based on discredited distinctions between crack and powder cocaine, as well as outdated sentencing enhancements for drug crimes,' Biden said in a statement. 'This action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities, and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars.' The White House did not immediately release the names of those receiving commutations. Still, Biden said more could yet be coming, promising to use the time before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated Monday to 'continue to review additional commutations and pardons.' Friday's action follows Biden's commutations last month of the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the pardoning of 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. That was the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. All of this comes as Biden continues to weigh whether to issue sweeping pardons for officials and allies who the White House fears could be unjustly targeted by Trump's administration. Though presidential pardoning powers are absolute, such a preemptive move would be a novel and risky use of the president's extraordinary constitutional power. Last month, Biden also commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment just weeks before Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment, takes office. Trump has vowed to roll back that order after his term begins. Biden also recently pardoned his son Hunter, not just for his convictions on federal gun and tax violations but for any potential federal offense committed over an 11-year period, as the president feared Trump allies would seek to prosecute his son for other offenses. If history is any guide, meanwhile, Biden also is likely to issue more targeted pardons to help allies before leaving the White House, as presidents typically do in some of their final actions. Just before midnight on the final night of his first term, Trump, a Republican, signed a flurry of pardons and commutations for more than 140 people, including his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black and ex-members of Congress. Trump's final act as president in his first term was to announce a pardon for Al Pirro, ex-husband of Fox News Channel host Jeanine Pirro, one of his staunchest defenders. Al Pirro was convicted of conspiracy and tax evasion charges and sentenced to more than two years in prison in 2000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-sets-record-by-commuting-sentences-of-nearly-2-500-people-convicted-of-nonviolent-drug-charges-/7940333.html	2025-01-17T04:44:56-08:00	
Iranian president arrives in Moscow for treaty signing with Putin	MOSCOW — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian arrived in Moscow on Friday for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the signing of a strategic partnership treaty involving closer defense cooperation that is likely to worry the West. Pezeshkian, on his first Kremlin visit since winning the presidency last July, will hold talks with Putin focusing on bilateral ties and international issues before signing the treaty. Ahead of the talks, the Kremlin hailed its ever closer ties with Tehran. 'Iran is an important partner for us with which we are developing multifaceted co-operation,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Moscow has cultivated closer ties with Iran and other countries hostile towards the U.S., such as North Korea, since the start of the Ukraine war, and already has strategic pacts with Pyongyang and close ally Belarus, as well as a strategic partnership agreement with China. The 20-year Russia-Iran agreement is not expected to include a mutual defense clause of the kind sealed with Minsk and Pyongyang, but is still likely to concern the West which sees both countries as malign influences on the world stage. Moscow and Tehran say their increasingly close ties are not directed against other countries. Russia has made extensive use of Iranian drones during the war in Ukraine and the United States accused Tehran in September of delivering close-range ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine. Tehran denies supplying drones or missiles. The Kremlin has declined to confirm it has received Iranian missiles, but has acknowledged that its cooperation with Iran includes 'the most sensitive areas.' Pezeshkian visit to Moscow also comes at a time when Iranian influence across the Middle East is in retreat after Islamist rebels seized power in Syria, expelling ally Bashar al-Assad, and after Iran-backed Hamas has been pounded by Israel in Gaza. Israel has also inflicted serious damage on the Tehran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Russia too finds itself on the backfoot in Syria where it maintains two major military facilities crucial to its geopolitical and military influence in the Middle East and Africa but whose fate under Syria's new rulers is now uncertain. Putin met Pezeshkian on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan in October and at a cultural forum in Turkmenistan the same month. Pezeshkian, who is holding talks with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin before meeting Putin, is accompanied to Moscow by his oil minister, and Western sanctions on the sector and the subject of how to circumvent them are likely to be discussed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iranian-president-arrives-in-moscow-for-treaty-signing-with-putin/7940267.html	2025-01-17T03:26:21-08:00	
Kyiv says Ukraine missiles hit army radars in Russia	Kyiv — Ukraine said Friday it had launched a missile strike one day earlier on the western Belgorod region targeting air defense systems and damaging military radars. Kyiv has stepped up its cross-border drone and missile attacks on Russian territory and said this week it had launched its largest barrage of the war on military sites and energy installations over the border. The Ukrainian General Staff wrote on social media that missile units had carried out 'precision strikes' on Russian military targets in Belgorod, which borders Ukraine. It said it had attacked air defense systems under the 568th anti-aircraft missile regiment and claimed that an S-400 radar had been damaged alongside equipment linked to another brigade. There was no immediate response from Moscow to the claims, which could not be verified by AFP. Moscow in turn has been targeting Ukrainian energy facilities and this week launched dozens of missiles and drones at sites mainly in western Ukraine near the border with Poland. Kyiv said Friday that its air defense systems had shot down 33 Russian drones over 11 Ukrainian region at night.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kyiv-says-ukraine-missiles-hit-army-radars-in-russia-/7940254.html	2025-01-17T03:15:42-08:00	
Russia upholds jail term for ex-US Consulate worker	MOSCOW — A Russian court on Friday upheld the jail term of Robert Shonov, a former U.S. Consulate worker sentenced to almost five years for 'secret collaboration with a foreign state.' Shonov, a Russian citizen, worked for more than 25 years at the U.S. Consulate in the far eastern city of Vladivostok until 2021, when Moscow imposed restrictions on local staff working for foreign missions. He was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of passing secret information about Russia's military offensive against Ukraine to the United States in exchange for money and sentenced to four years and 10 months prison in November 2024. 'The judicial act was upheld,' a court in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk ruled, according to its website, rejecting an appeal Shonov had made against his sentencing. The United States strongly condemned the conviction last year, calling it an 'egregious injustice' based on 'meritless allegations.' In September 2023, Russia expelled two U.S. diplomats it accused of acting as liaison agents for Shonov. In recent years, several U.S. citizens have been arrested and sentenced to long jail terms in Russia. Others are being held pending trial. Washington, which supports Ukraine militarily and financially against Russia's military offensive, accuses Moscow of arresting Americans on baseless charges to use as bargaining chips in prisoner exchanges. Even after a landmark prisoner swap in August, several U.S. nationals and dual nationals remain in detention in Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-upholds-jail-term-for-ex-us-consulate-worker/7940245.html	2025-01-17T02:57:35-08:00	
Russia sentences Navalny lawyers to years behind bars	PETUSHKI, RUSSIA — Russia on Friday sentenced three lawyers who had defended Alexey Navalny to several years in prison for bringing messages from the late opposition leader from prison to the outside world. The sentences come as Russia -- in the midst of a massive crackdown during its Ukraine offensive -- seeks to punish Navalny's associates since his unexplained death in an Arctic prison colony last February. Vadim Kobzev, Alexei Liptser and Igor Sergunin -- who were arrested in October 2023 -- were found guilty of participating in an 'extremist organization,' a court in the Russian town of Petushki ruled. Kobzev, the most high-profile member of Navalny's legal team, was given 5.5 years, while Liptser was handed five years and Sergunin 3.5 years. While serving his 19-year sentence, Navalny communicated with the world by transmitting messages through his lawyers which his team then published on social media. Authorities had moved him to a harsher prison regime that limited outside contact, before sending him to a remote colony above the Arctic Circle where he died. 'We are on trial for passing Navalny's thoughts to other people,' Kobzev said in court last week. The court said the men had 'used their status as lawyers while visiting convict Navalny ... to ensure the regular transfer of information between the members of the extremist community, including those wanted and hiding outside the Russian Federation, and Navalny.' 'Outrageous' It said this allowed Navalny to continue 'planning the preparation and creating conditions for committing crimes with an extremist character.' Navalny had condemned the arrests of the lawyers as 'outrageous' and part of a campaign to further isolate him in jail. The court proceedings, which opened in September in Petushki, a town about 115 kilometers east of Moscow, have been held behind closed doors. The verdicts come several days before four independent journalists accused of helping Navalny will be back in court, facing up to six years in prison. In his messages to the outside world, Navalny denounced the Kremlin's Ukraine offensive as 'criminal' and told supporters 'not to give up.' The texts from prison were also full of tongue-in-cheek dispatches of daily life behind bars. In his speech last week, Kobzev compared Moscow's current crackdown on dissent to Stalin-era mass repression. 'Eight years have passed... and in the Petushki court, people are once again on trial for discrediting officials and the state agencies,' he said, in a speech published by the Novaya Gazeta newspaper. 'Savage' sentences Another member of Navalny's former legal team, Olga Mikhailova, who is in exile, denounced the requested sentences as 'savage,' saying the men had 'honestly and professionally defended Navalny for many years.' Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya has vowed to continue his work. Last week, she said Russia has refused to remove her dead husband from its list of terrorists and extremists. She published a Dec. 16 letter from Russia's financial watchdog Rosfinmonitoring addressed to Navalny's mother that said that the late opposition leader was still being investigated for money laundering and 'financing terrorism.' 'Why does Putin need this? Obviously not to stop Alexei from opening a bank account. That is now impossible,' Navalnaya said. 'Putin is doing this to scare you. He wants you to be scared of even mentioning Alexei and for you to gradually forget his name.' Russia has added Navalnaya to the 'terrorists and extremists' blacklist. In 2021, Moscow banned Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, known for investigations into the alleged corruption of Putin's officials, labeling it 'extremist.' He nearly died in 2020 after being poisoned on a campaign trip to Siberia ahead of regional elections. The West and Moscow were in talks about freeing Navalny in a prisoner exchange when he died. Several of his associates were later freed in the eventual deal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-sentences-navalny-lawyers-to-years-behind-bars/7940230.html	2025-01-17T02:31:17-08:00	
Report: Pakistan court sentences ex-PM Imran Khan to 14 years in land graft case	ISLAMABAD — A Pakistani court sentenced former Prime Minister Imran Khan to 14 years imprisonment on Friday in a land corruption case, local broadcaster ARY News reported. The verdict in the case, the largest in terms of financial wrongdoing faced by Khan, was delivered by an anti-graft court in a prison in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where Khan has been jailed since August 2023. The former cricket star, 72, had been indicted on charges that he and his wife were gifted land by a real estate developer during his premiership from 2018 to 2022 in exchange for illegal favors. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, had pleaded not guilty. The announcement of the verdict was delayed three times, most recently on Monday, amid talks between the government and Khan's party. Bushra Bibi, who is in her late 40s and was out on bail, was taken into custody after she was also convicted in the case, Geo News reported. 'Whilst we wait for detailed decision, it's important to note that, the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,' Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insafparty's foreign media wing said in a statement. The verdict is the biggest setback for Khan and his party since a surprisingly good showing in the 2024 general election when its candidates -- who were forced to contest as independents -- won the most seats but fell short of the majority needed to form a government. Jailed since August 2023, Khan has been facing dozens of cases ranging from charges of graft and misuse of power, to inciting violence against the state after being removed from office in a parliamentary vote of confidence in April 2022. He has either been acquitted or his sentences suspended in most cases, except for one on charges of inciting supporters to rampage through military facilities to protest against his arrest on May 9, 2023. His supporters have led several violent protest rallies since the May 9 incidents. He has been tried inside a jail on security grounds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-pakistan-court-sentences-ex-pm-imran-khan-to-14-years-in-land-graft-case/7940194.html	2025-01-17T00:19:53-08:00

South Korea's Yoon refuses questioning as deadline looms on detention	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday again refused investigators' efforts to question him over his failed martial law bid, as the deadline on his detention neared. Yoon threw the nation into chaos on Dec. 3 when he attempted to impose martial law, citing the need to combat threats from 'anti-state elements.' But his bid lasted just six hours, as the soldiers he directed to storm parliament failed to stop lawmakers from voting to reject martial law. In the following weeks, Yoon was impeached by parliament and resisted arrest while holed up at his guarded residence, before becoming South Korea's first sitting president to be detained. The arrest warrant executed in Wednesday's dawn raid on Yoon's residence allowed investigators to hold Yoon for just 48 hours. But they are expected to seek a new warrant Friday that will likely extend his detention by 20 days, allowing prosecutors time to formalize an indictment against him. The Corruption Investigation Office is investigating him on possible charges of insurrection, which if found guilty could see him jailed for life or executed. The new warrant, if filed Friday, would keep Yoon in detention until at least a court hearing and ruling for its approval over the weekend. If the court rejects it after the hearing, he would be released. The CIO had called Yoon for questioning at 10 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) Friday, Yonhap news agency reported, but his lawyer Yoon Kab-keun told AFP he had refused to appear for the second consecutive day. CIO officials did not immediately respond to AFP requests for comment. Another lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, told reporters Friday Yoon had already explained his position to investigators and had no reason to answer their questions. 'The president will not appear at the CIO today. He has sufficiently expressed his basic stance to the investigators on the first day,' he said. Yoon was questioned for hours Wednesday but exercised his right to silence before refusing to appear for interrogation the next day. Yoon's supporters gathered outside the court Friday where investigators were expected to file for the new warrant, linking arms in an apparent attempt to block them, the Yonhap news agency reported. Impeachment trial Yoon had evaded arrest for weeks by remaining in his residential compound, protected by loyal members of the Presidential Security Service (PSS). Hundreds of CIO investigators and police surrounded his compound on Wednesday in a second, and ultimately successful, effort to arrest him. When he was detained, Yoon said he had agreed to leave his compound to avoid 'bloodshed,' but that he did not accept the legality of the investigation. The opposition Democratic Party celebrated Yoon's arrest, with a top official calling it 'the first step' to restoring constitutional and legal order. In a Facebook post on Wednesday after his detention, Yoon repeated unfounded election fraud claims and referred to 'hostile' nations threatening the country, alluding to North Korea. Although Yoon won presidential elections in 2022, the Democratic Party won parliamentary elections in April last year by a landslide. In a parallel probe, the Constitutional Court is deciding whether to uphold Yoon's impeachment. If that happens, Yoon would lose the presidency and fresh elections would have to be held within 60 days. He did not attend the first two hearings this week. The trial is continuing in Yoon's absence and proceedings could last for months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-yoon-refuses-questioning-as-deadline-looms-on-detention-/7940189.html	2025-01-17T00:03:22-08:00	
Chinese economic growth among slowest in decades	BEIJING — China recorded one of its slowest rates of economic growth in decades last year, data showed Friday, as leaders nervously eye a potential trade standoff with incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Beijing has in recent months announced its most aggressive support measures in years in a bid to reignite an economy that has suffered on multiple fronts, including a prolonged property market debt crisis and sluggish consumer spending. But the economy grew 5% last year, official data from Beijing's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed Friday, slightly above the 4.9% forecast in an AFP survey of analysts. Still, the figure was lower than the 5.2% recorded in 2023. The growth took place in the face of a 'complicated and severe environment with increasing external pressures and internal difficulties,' the NBS said. The economy was still facing 'difficulties and challenges,' officials admitted. Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer sentiment, rose 3.5% -- a major slump from the 7.2% growth seen in 2023 -- though industrial output increased 5.8%, from 4.6% the previous year. However, the 5.4% jump in economic growth seen in the final four months far outpaced the 5% forecast in a Bloomberg survey and was much better than the same period in 2023. The data provided 'mixed messages,' Zhiwei Zhang, president of Pinpoint Asset Management, said. Beijing's recent policy shift had 'helped the economy to stabilize in (the fourth quarter), but it requires large and persistent policy stimulus to boost economic momentum and sustain the recovery,' he said. Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said she expected growth to 'continue accelerating in the coming months.' 'The government's property support measures seem to be providing some relief, with the pace of house price falls slowing and new home sales showing some recovery,' she said. Trouble ahead? The GDP growth rate is the lowest recorded by China since 1990, excluding the financially tumultuous years of the COVID-19 pandemic. And the analysts surveyed by AFP estimated growth could fall to just 4.4% in 2025, and even drop below 4% the following year. China has so far failed to rebound from the pandemic, with domestic spending mired in a slump and indebted local governments dragging on growth. In a rare bright spot, official data showed earlier this week that exports reached a historic high last year. But gathering storm clouds over the country's massive trade surplus mean Beijing may not be able to count on overseas shipments to boost an otherwise lackluster economy. Trump, who will begin his second term next week, has promised to unleash heavy sanctions on China. 'We still expect growth to slow for 2025 as a whole, with Trump likely to follow through on his tariff threats soon and persistent structural imbalances still weighing on the economy,' Huang said. Beijing has introduced a series of measures in recent months to bolster the economy, including cutting key interest rates, easing local government debt and expanding subsidy programs for household goods. Confidence 'crisis' Observers were closely watching Friday's data release for signs those measures succeeded in reviving activity. 'With a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out ... social confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,' the NBS said. China's central bank has indicated in recent weeks that 2025 will see it implement further rate cuts, part of a key shift characterized by a 'moderately loose' monetary policy stance. But analysts warn more efforts are needed to boost domestic consumption as the outlook for Chinese exports becomes more uncertain. 'Monetary policy support alone is unlikely to right the economy,' Harry Murphy Cruise of Moody's Analytics told AFP. 'China is suffering from a crisis of confidence, not one of credit; families and firms do not have the confidence in the economy to warrant borrowing, regardless of how cheap it is to do so,' he wrote. 'To that end, fiscal supports are needed to grease the economy's wheels.' One component of Beijing's newest policy toolbox is a subsidy scheme -- now expanded to include more household items including rice cookers and microwave ovens -- that it hopes will encourage spending. But recent data shows that government efforts have not yet achieved a full rebound in consumer activity. China narrowly avoided a slip into deflation in December, statistics authorities said last week, with prices rising at their slowest pace in nine months. China emerged from a four-month period of deflation in February, a month after suffering the sharpest fall in prices for 14 years. Deflation can pose a threat to the broader economy as consumers tend to postpone purchases under such conditions, hoping for further reductions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-economic-growth-among-slowest-in-decades/7940184.html	2025-01-16T23:49:40-08:00	
Chinese vice president to attend Trump inauguration	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China said Friday that Vice President Han Zheng will attend U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration Monday. Beijing said the move follows 'the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation in viewing and growing its relationship with the United States.' 'We stand ready to work with the new U.S. government to enhance dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, jointly pursue a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship and find the right way for the two countries to get along with each other,' a Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson said in a Friday morning statement. The announcement comes more than a month after Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and other foreign leaders to attend his inauguration. It is an unprecedented move that marks a break from tradition, since foreign ambassadors have historically attended presidential inaugurations. Analysts say Beijing is showing 'goodwill' toward the new Trump administration by sending Han. 'China has no established tradition of letting the president attend other heads of state’s inauguration ceremonies,' said Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. 'Sending the vice president to attend Trump’s inauguration ceremony is the best option and it shows Beijing’s goodwill to President-elect Trump,' he told VOA by phone. While Beijing tries to respond positively to Trump’s invitation, other experts say Han’s attendance will remain largely ceremonial. 'I don’t expect anything concrete out of Han’s trip to Washington,' said Zhiqun Zhu, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at Bucknell University in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Despite the ceremonial nature of Han’s attendance at the inauguration, Zhu said Beijing’s move could still 'lay a good foundation' for U.S.-China relations under the second Trump administration. 'Hopefully, a friendly atmosphere will be built and can be sustained in the weeks and months ahead, so when the two sides sit down to discuss substantive issues, maybe a deal could be struck,' he told VOA by phone. Trump’s return to the White House has created uncertainties for China, which has faced a persistent economic downturn in recent years. During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to impose tariffs up to 60% on Chinese products. Zhou said the possibility of high tariffs has made Beijing cautious about the prospect of U.S.-China relations under the second Trump administration. 'We don’t know how Trump will play his cards, so I believe China will wait to see how his policies towards China play out,' he told VOA. Despite threatening to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump said the two could have a good relationship and that he has been in contact with the Chinese leaders through representatives. 'And I think we will probably get along very well, I predict,' he said during an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Jan. 6, adding that the relationship has to be 'a two-way street.' Additionally, Trump wants to appoint several politicians known for hawkish stances on China, including Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Rep. Mike Waltz to be White House national security adviser. Rubio, during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, described China as 'the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.' 'They have elements that the Soviet Union never possessed. They are a technological adversary and competitor, an industrial competitor, an economic competitor, a geopolitical competitor, a scientific competitor,' he said. Despite Rubio’s seemingly tough rhetoric on China during the hearing, Zhu said it is too early to tell whether that language will translate into actual policies toward China in the new administration. 'Some of the appointees by Trump seem hawkish on China but since they work for Trump, I don’t think they will override Trump’s policies,' he told VOA. Zhu said since it remains unclear how Trump will shape his policies toward China, Washington and Beijing will 'move ahead cautiously. 'Both sides had a terrible experience during Trump’s first term so it looks like they want to start afresh this time,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-vice-president-to-attend-trump-inauguration/7940175.html	2025-01-16T23:24:29-08:00

Israel agrees to hostage deal with Hamas	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a deal to return hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip has been reached, clearing a hurdle toward a ceasefire aimed at ending the 15-month war between the two sides. A statement released early Friday by the prime minister’s office said Netanyahu 'was informed by the negotiating team that agreements have been reached on a deal to release the hostages.' It said Netanyahu’s political-security Cabinet will meet Friday to approve the deal. If approved, the ceasefire agreement would begin Sunday with the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, after which the terms of a permanent end to the conflict would be finalized. Two developments Thursday appeared to threaten the start of the ceasefire and the initial release of hostages. First, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the militants of backtracking on parts of the agreement. A statement from Netanyahu’s office said Hamas was trying to 'extort last-minute concessions.' Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of backtracking on an understanding that he said would give Israel a veto over which Palestinian prisoners convicted of murder would be released in exchange for hostages held by the U.S.-designated terror group. A short time later, Izzat al-Rishq, a senior Hamas official denied the claim, saying the militant group 'is committed to the ceasefire agreement, which was announced by the mediators.' Second, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he would resign from Netanyahu’s government if it ratified the ceasefire deal. In a televised statement, he said the deal was 'reckless' and would 'erase the achievements of the war.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday he is confident that a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal agreed to by Israel and Hamas will start as scheduled on Sunday. 'I am confident, and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday,' Blinken told reporters in Washington at his farewell news conference as America’s top diplomat. 'It's not exactly surprising that in a process and negotiation that has been this challenging and this fraught, you may get a loose end,' Blinken said. 'We're tying up that loose end as we speak.' Even with the prospective ceasefire days away, Palestinian medics said Israeli forces carried out multiple airstrikes Thursday in Gaza, killing at least 77 people. If the ceasefire takes hold, U.N. agencies said they were ready to surge humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, where the United Nations says at least 1.9 million of the 2.3 million people living there have been displaced and 92% of housing units have been destroyed. Israeli President Isaac Herzog offered his strong support for the ceasefire after the deal was announced Wednesday. 'As the president of the State of Israel, I say in the clearest terms: This is the right move,' he said. 'This is an important move. This is a necessary move. There is no greater moral, human, Jewish, or Israeli obligation than to bring our sons and daughters back to us — whether to recover at home, or to be laid to rest.' The first phase of the agreement includes a 42-day ceasefire, the release of 33 hostages from Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israel, a phased Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and an increased flow of aid for Palestinian civilians. During the first phase, there will be negotiations on the details of a second phase focused on bringing a permanent end to the conflict with the release of the remaining hostages and a full Israeli troop withdrawal. A final phase concerns rebuilding Gaza, with a new governing and security structure. The war in Gaza began when Hamas sent its fighters into Israel in an Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed more than 1,200 people and led to the abduction of about 250 hostages. Of those hostages, just under 100 are thought to remain in Hamas custody but about one-third are believed to be dead. Gaza authorities say nearly 47,000 Palestinians – most of them children and women – have been killed in Israeli military operations. Israel, without providing evidence, says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which includes the families of 98 hostages, said Wednesday it welcomes 'with overwhelming joy and relief the agreement to bring our loved ones home.' 'However, deep anxiety and concerns accompany us regarding the possibility that the agreement might not be fully implemented, leaving hostages behind,' the statement continued. 'We urgently call for swift arrangements to ensure all phases of the deal are carried out.' A senior official with the outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters that two of the living American hostages – Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen – will be among the first hostages released. The official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, as is customary in such briefings. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-agrees-to-hostage-deal-with-hamas/7940136.html	2025-01-16T20:40:32-08:00

Inaugural balls, protests planned in Washington	washington — Washington has been bracing for lots of things this week, including several more days of frigid temperatures and hordes of people and police for the presidential inauguration and related protests around the city next week. Officials said this week that they expected about 250,000 ticketed people to descend on the U.S. capital as Donald Trump takes the oath of office as president again. He last served from 2017 to 2021. Fewer visitors are expected for next Monday's ceremony than were present at Trump’s first inauguration, local and federal officials said at a press conference. In 2017, they prepared for more than 1 million people. Temperatures are expected to be particularly low in Washington on Monday. The temperature at noon, when Trump will be sworn in, is predicted to be in the low 20s F, which is about 20 degrees below normal. Enhanced security Even though a lower turnout is expected this time around, recent acts of violence — like the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans — mean there will be an enhanced security presence, the officials said. On Inauguration Day, 25,000 law enforcement and military personnel will be in the District of Columbia to provide security, including the full activation of D.C. police, 7,800 National Guard troops and about 4,000 officers from around the country, according to William McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s Washington Field Office. Leading up to the inauguration, Washington will be home to both celebratory events and protests. A Trump victory rally is planned for Sunday afternoon at Capital One Arena, where the Village People, an American band, will perform. The arena has 20,000 seats, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the company that operates the arena, told a D.C. news station. The company said in a statement to News4 that the arena has been offered to every administration, 'irrespective of party,' for decades. 'We are happy that President Trump has accepted our offer, and we will welcome him and his guests to Capital One Arena on January 19,' the statement said. While there will be three official inaugural balls, more than a dozen unofficial inaugural balls are scheduled throughout the weekend in Washington. However, protests are scheduled, too. On Saturday, a demonstration called the People’s March is expected to draw tens of thousands of people to downtown Washington. The demonstration is organized by various civil rights, racial justice and reproductive health groups. 'As Trump assumes the presidency in January, we are gathering to mobilize our collective power and stand against his efforts to roll back our rights and freedoms,' Analilia Mejia, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, said in a statement. On Monday, the Answer Coalition’s National Day of Action will feature a rally and march, according to media reports. Accustomed to crowds Washington officials said they’re used to managing crowds and protests. 'Here in the city, we allow peaceful protests all the time,' D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said at a press conference this week. 'But when it comes to violating the law, we’re just not going to tolerate it.' On Monday night, after the inauguration, Trump is expected to shuttle among the three official inaugural balls. But inauguration celebrations won’t be limited to Washington. For instance, in Florida, where Trump resides at his Mar-a-Lago resort, the pro-Trump Villages M.A.G.A. Club is hosting an inaugural party on Monday evening, about 60 miles northwest of Orlando. The celebration has already sold out, according to an Eventbrite listing advertising the party.	https://www.voanews.com/a/inaugural-balls-protests-planned-in-washington/7940103.html	2025-01-16T19:17:35-08:00

Siberian air to make Trump swearing-in coldest in 40 years	The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather. Another polar vortex disruption will stretch Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump's second inauguration the coldest in 40 years, meteorologists said. After starting in the Rockies Thursday night, the cold will blast eastward and as far south as the upper Florida peninsula over several days. Up to 280 million Americans will have a day or two where it's colder than Anchorage, Alaska, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue. 'This would be one of the coldest outbreaks certainly of the past 10 years, 15 years,' said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric Environmental Research. 'It's pulling air out of Siberia. And, you know, that's consistent with these stretches, because when the polar vortex stretches, the flow starts in Siberia and ends in the United States.' It will arrive in Washington well before Trump's inauguration Monday outside the U.S. Capitol. The National Weather Service is predicting the temperature to be around minus 6 degrees Celsius at noon during the swearing-in, the coldest since Ronald Reagan's second inauguration saw temperatures plunge to minus 14 Celsius. The temperature for Barack Obama's 2009 swearing-in was minus 2 Celsius. But that's not all - the wind is forecast to be 48 to 56 kilometers per hour. 'The wind chills would be in the single digits for sure,' the NWS's Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor said. 'That's going to be cold, blustery, basically right up the National Mall. And it can get pretty breezy on the mall there with the west-northwest wind right in the face.' Washington could see single digits later; Wednesday morning might get near zero, Maue said. There could be a record low in Baltimore, Taylor said. He said most of the records that will be broken in this cold outbreak are not likely to be overnight lows, but still chilly daytime highs. About 80 million people are likely to have subzero temperatures at some point, Maue said. 'The coldest will be Tuesday morning for the Lower 48 overall,' Maue said. The average low that morning for the entire Lower 48 will be around minus 14 degrees Celsius, he said. Maue said a stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will get the most brutal cold compared with their normal temperatures. 'That's like a corridor of extreme cold, calm winds at night over snow cover. Temperatures could really drop like a rock there,' Maue said. Freezes could go as far as the Gulf Coast and northern Florida, meteorologists said. Earlier this month, long-range forecasts hinted at worst-in-30-years type of cold for the year's first week, but those predictions eased as the cold outbreak got closer. It was cold, but not near record levels. This time, it's the opposite. Each day's computer models show it colder than the previous one, Maue said. There's some possibility of snow squalls here and there, but it's mostly just going to be cold, Taylor said — what Maue called a dry cold. As happened earlier this month, this cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. That ring is being stretched south across North America like a rubber band, Cohen said. These stretching events are happening more often in the past decade or so, Cohen said. He and others have linked these polar vortex outbreaks to human-caused climate change and decreasing pressure and temperature differences between the Arctic and the rest of the globe. Those also trigger changes in the jet stream — the river of air that usually brings weather from west to east — that make cold air and weather systems plunge from north to south like a roller coaster. On the east side of that plunge is cold air and potentially record high pressure, Taylor and others said. On the west side, in Southern California, is not only warmer air but also the extreme pressure differences that could goose the already high winds that are fanning fires around Los Angeles, meteorologists said. Get used to it. There's some debate among meteorologists about how long this extreme cold outbreak will last but below-normal temperatures may stick around through the end of the month for much of the country, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who organized winter weather workshops at the American Meteorological Society's annual conference in New Orleans. And Cohen said long-range forecasts suggest the same polar vortex conditions could return in early February.	https://www.voanews.com/a/siberian-air-to-make-trump-swearing-in-coldest-in-40-years-/7940067.html	2025-01-16T18:49:54-08:00

Trump team might step in to save TikTok from pending US ban	With a pending law declaring the social media application TikTok illegal in the United States, set to take effect on Sunday, the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is signaling that it plans to try to find a way to prevent the service from going offline. Under current law, the service's parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell TikTok to a non-Chinese firm or see it banned in the U.S. Representative Mike Waltz, who has been tapped to serve as Trump's national security adviser, told Fox News on Thursday that the president-elect has options available to postpone enforcement of the law while a possible deal is worked out to sell the company. That includes a section of the law allowing the president to give ByteDance a 90-day extension to finalize a sale. 'We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,' Waltz said, 'as long as a viable deal is on the table. Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going.' Executive action reportedly considered Also on Wednesday, several media outlets reported that Trump is considering issuing an executive order that would protect TikTok. The legality of such a move is unclear and is thrown further into doubt by the fact that the Supreme Court is poised to rule on a request by the company to overturn the law. The high court heard arguments in the case last week and is expected to rule shortly. The outcome is not certain. However, in oral arguments, a majority of the justices appeared to favor upholding the law. Trump's attitude toward TikTok has evolved considerably over the years. During his first term in office, he attempted to shut the service down in the U.S. Since then, though, he has used the service, with considerable success, to connect with his supporters. In a press conference in Florida last month, Trump said, 'I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,' and credited the app with helping him get his message out to younger American voters. Trump has denied that his change of heart about TikTok was influenced by a brief meeting in March with Republican megadonor and ByteDance investor Jeff Yass. Lobbying disclosure reports from 2024 show that ByteDance paid a former Trump campaign aide to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok, and that former senior Trump aide Kellyanne Conway has been paid to advocate for TikTok in Congress via the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth. Trump also said TikTok was not mentioned during his meeting with Yass. Economic concerns In the years since TikTok took off, thousands of U.S.-based content creators have developed large audiences on the app, and in many cases have been able to monetize their TikTok feeds. Many small businesses have found success advertising their products to TikTok users. Other TikTok personalities have parlayed fame on the app into broader celebrity that has led to lucrative product endorsements and other deals. Some members of Congress have expressed concern that abruptly shutting the app down could have economic consequences. On Monday, Democratic Senator Edward Markey introduced legislation that would delay the TikTok ban by 270 days. 'Let me be clear: TikTok has its problems,' Markey said in a statement released by his office. 'Like every social media platform, TikTok poses a serious risk to the privacy and mental health of our young people. I will continue to hold TikTok accountable for such behavior. But a TikTok ban would impose serious consequences on millions of Americans who depend on the app for social connections and their economic livelihood. We cannot allow that to happen.' Viability of sale unclear As the Sunday deadline nears, there have been a number of rumors about a possible sale of the company. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Chinese officials were considering the possibility of selling the service to billionaire Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser who already owns the social media service X, formerly Twitter. Another U.S. billionaire, real estate developer Frank McCourt, told Reuters on Thursday that a consortium of investors he had formed has already made a formal offer to purchase TikTok, valuing the service at $20 billion. However, it is far from clear that a sale is something the Chinese government is prepared to allow. Any sale worth the buyer's investment would have to include the 'recommendation engine,' TikTok's name for the algorithm that makes the service so popular and, many would say, addictive. Last year in a court filing, TikTok characterized such a deal as unavailable. 'Just as the United States restricts the export of U.S.-origin technologies (e.g., certain computer chips), the Chinese government regulates the transfer of technologies developed in China,' the company argued in a court filing. 'The Chinese government has made clear in public statements that it would not permit a forced divestment of the recommendation engine.' Privacy, national security worries A wildly popular service for sharing short videos, TikTok has an estimated 170 million U.S. users. Federal officials have been concerned about TikTok for years because it collects vast amounts of information about its user base. They have argued that Chinese laws compelling domestic companies to cooperate with intelligence agencies could be used to force the company to share that data with the Chinese Communist Party. U.S. officials have expressed concern that China could misuse the private information about U.S. users of the service. They have also warned that Beijing could use TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm to shape public discourse in the U.S. to the benefit of China. In December, when a federal appeals court upheld the law mandating the company's sale or shutdown, Democratic Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, one of the original sponsors of the law, released a statement expressing the thoughts of many of the law's supporters. 'With today's opinion, all three branches of government have reached the same conclusion: ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, and TikTok's ownership by ByteDance is a national security threat that cannot be mitigated through any other means than divestiture,' Krishnamoorthi said. 'Every day that TikTok remains under the Chinese Communist Party's control is a day that our security is at risk,' Krishnamoorthi added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-team-might-step-in-to-save-tiktok-from-pending-us-ban-/7940010.html	2025-01-16T17:11:14-08:00

Cuba releases prominent dissident from prison	Jose Daniel Ferrer, one of Cuba’s most prominent political prisoners and leader of Patriotic Union of Cuba, was released Thursday from prison after 3½ years. 'I am fine, surrounded by family and friends,' he told The Associated Press by phone. Ferrer, 54, is the director of the Patriotic Union of Cuba. 'I am going to continue the nonviolent struggle for freedom and democracy.' Ferrer’s release was secured by a deal between Cuba, the Vatican and the Biden administration. On Tuesday, the White House announced it would lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism. The move was designed to expedite a Vatican-brokered deal to release Cuban political prisoners. Havana told Pope Francis it would gradually free 553 convicts. It added that the gesture was unrelated to the U.S. announcement. The releases began on Wednesday, and so far more than 30 people have been freed, according to Cuban civilian groups. The lifting of Cuba’s terrorism designation could be reversed by the incoming Trump administration. Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s choice to lead the U.S. State Department, is an advocate of sanctions on Cuba. Rubio’s family is Cuban, but they left the country before the communist revolution.

Britain, Ukraine sign 100-year agreement	Britain and Ukraine signed a 100-year agreement Thursday, with Britain pledging to provide Ukraine with $3.6 billion in military aid this year. The deal was announced during a joint news conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, at the presidential palace where British Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Starmer is on his first trip to Ukraine since he took office. Starmer called the agreement historic and said the new partnership 'reflects the huge affection that exists between our two nations.' The partnership will include cooperation in the areas of culture, education, science and technology. Regarding military assistance for Kyiv's war against Russia, Starmer said Britain plans to provide Ukraine with a loan of more than $2.6 billion. He said the loan 'will be paid back not by Ukraine, but from the interest on frozen Russian assets.' Starmer also announced that Britain was providing Ukraine with 150 artillery gun barrels and a new mobile air defense system. In his comments, Starmer credited Ukraine's allies, particularly the United States, for contributing to the success Ukraine has had against 'aggression from Russia.' He said he wanted to pay tribute to the U.S. for 'the work that the U.S. has done here, the support that they have put in, because it's been a vital component of what has been quite an incredible achievement by Ukraine.' The comments came just days before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, a critic of U.S. support for Ukraine, takes office and a day after the new president's pick to be the U.S. secretary of state, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, told a Senate panel the war must end. Speaking at his confirmation hearing, Rubio called the conflict a 'war of attrition' and a 'stalemate' that must be ended. He said the first step should be a ceasefire that halts ground fighting, which has for more than a year mostly occurred in eastern Ukraine. Rubio called the destruction in Ukraine 'extraordinary,' saying it will 'take a generation to rebuild.' 'The truth of the matter is that in this conflict, there is no way Russia takes all of Ukraine,' Rubio said. 'It's also unrealistic to believe that somehow, a nation the size of Ukraine ... is also going to push these people all the way back to where they were on the eve of the invasion.' Even as he argued for a negotiated settlement to end the fighting that started with Russia's invasion in February 2022, Rubio said it was unlikely that there would be much change in the current battle lines. Russia currently holds about a fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian land mass. Democrats, and some Republicans on the committee, continued to voice their support for more military aid to Ukraine, saying it was important to give Kyiv leverage in any eventual peace talks with Moscow. But Rubio said that one of Ukraine's key problems was not a shortage of ammunition or money but its inability to train and recruit enough troops. At Thursday's news conference in Kyiv, Zelenskyy refused to speculate on what U.S. support for Ukraine will look like under a Trump administration. 'It is too early to talk about the details, because we have not yet had a detailed conversation with the new U.S. administration about security guarantees,' he said. Trump has voiced skepticism about continued U.S. military support for Kyiv and repeatedly vowed that he would end the war when he assumed the presidency on Monday. In recent days, his aides have said the new timeline is ending the war in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be by the end of April.

US sanctions Sudan army leader, citing atrocities	washington — Washington has slapped sanctions on Sudan's army leader, citing his responsibility for war crimes in a conflict that has bled the oil-rich country dry over the last year — sparking a famine, killing tens of thousands of people and driving millions from their homes — just a week after the U.S. sanctioned his opponent for acts it described as genocide. Thursday's sanctions on Sudanese Armed Forces leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and a Hong-Kong-based weapons supplier block them from entering or transiting the United States and restrict their access to any U.S. assets. This leaves both sides economically restrained in this brutal conflict that the State Department has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, but where Washington's options are limited because of its strained diplomatic ties to the large African nation. This conflict also has drawn in outside players, with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates arming the rivals. During his final press conference on Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the SAF of war crimes. In last week's sanctions, the State Department accused the opposing Rapid Support Forces of genocide. 'The SAF has also committed war crimes, and it continues to target civilians,' Blinken said. 'It's obstructed the advancement of the peace process. It's refused to participate on numerous occasions in ceasefire talks that we've sought to convene, and together with the RSF, it's caused what is the world's worst humanitarian crisis that people are suffering through every day. And we believe strongly, as we said, there's no military solution to this conflict.' 'Flawed' action, Sudan says Sudan's government expressed its objection to the sanctions, calling them 'flawed,' 'unethical' and 'dubious.' 'This decision lacks the basic principles of justice and objectivity, relying on implausible pretexts,' read its statement, which was posted on social media platform X. 'It also reflects a blatant disregard for the Sudanese people, who stand firmly united behind General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan as a symbol of their sovereignty and armed forces, and as a courageous leader in the battle for dignity against the terrorist Janjaweed militias.' Blinken did not address U.S. media reports citing anonymous U.S. officials that the SAF has used chemical weapons at least twice. VOA's query to the National Security Council went unanswered Thursday. When asked by reporters whether both sides were equally responsible, Blinken replied, 'The actions we took on the RSF, as you know, found a determination of genocide. The actions that we're looking at for the SAF go to war crimes. So there are gradations in these things, and we follow the law.' And Blinken expressed regrets that this conflict has escalated. It has followed many of the same contours as the Darfur conflict at the turn of the century. 'It is, for me, yes, another real regret that when it comes to Sudan, we haven't been able on our watch to get to that day of success,' he said. He added, 'We'll keep working it for the next three days, and I hope the next administration will take that on as well.' Hemedti sanctioned Last week's sanctions targeted RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo, whom the White House named as the leader of a wave of renewed ethnic cleansing, rape and systematic atrocities. Daglo, who is better known by his nickname, Hemedti, was a commander in the Janjaweed militia considered largely responsible for the brutal Darfur conflict, in which Sudanese Arab Janjaweed militias used scorched-earth tactics on the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa people of Western Sudan, killing at least 200,000. The scale and savagery of the violence prompted the International Criminal Court to issue its first-ever warrant for genocide to Sudan's then-president, Omar al-Bashir. Hemedti led the RSF as a paramilitary unit until the April 2023 clash with government forces that sparked the current conflict. The violence has plunged nearly 640,000 people into the misery of famine, the State Department said. And the United Nations estimates that 30 million people — more than half of the nation's population — need humanitarian assistance. Daniel Volman, director of the African Security Research Project, told VOA it's 'unlikely' that the incoming Trump administration will impose further sanctions. He said the U.S. and its allies bear some responsibility for 'the conflict escalating to genocidal heights.' 'I think that the United States, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, bears a major responsibility for failing to take effective action against the Bashir regime [which created the RSF and carried out the first genocide in Darfur] and for failing to take effective action to support the civil society groups fighting for a democratic government, which led to the current civil war,' he said by email. 'The United States is not alone in bearing responsibility. Russia, Iran and other countries are also arming the rival forces and prolonging the conflict.' Complicating factor And, Volman said, the Biden administration's decision to sanction some of Hemedti's foreign backers by targeting companies based in the United Arab Emirates is also a complicating factor. 'The involvement of Egypt and the UAE in arming the rival forces and prolonging the civil war will complicate the Trump administration's relations with these two key allies and may lead them to expand and escalate their military intervention in Sudan,' he said. Andrew Payne, a lecturer in foreign policy and security at City, University of London, told VOA that for now, sanctions are the main tool that Washington has to constrain Khartoum. 'Sanctions are an easy tool that make it appear like an administration is doing something, regardless of whether that is an appropriate tool to use. It's relatively cost-free to the United States. If the alternative is something that requires political will, then that will has to be there. ... Sanctions are always the tool of cheapest resort, in a sense. So, it's a way of seeming like you're engaged, seeming like you're active, without considering more tougher measures,' Payne said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-sudan-army-leader-citing-atrocities/7939740.html	2025-01-16T15:34:32-08:00	
US CDC recommends faster testing for bird flu in hospitalized patients	People hospitalized for flu should be tested for bird flu within 24 hours, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday, in an expansion of the agency's efforts to tackle increasing infections in humans. The advisory is intended to prevent delays in identifying human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses amid high levels of seasonal influenza. The risk to the general public from bird flu is low, and there has been no further evidence of person to person spread, the agency said. Still, influenza A-positive patients, particularly those in an intensive care unit, should be tested ideally within 24 hours of hospitalization to identify the viral subtype and determine whether they have bird flu, the agency said. Prior to Thursday's guidance, hospitals generally sent batches of samples to labs for subtyping every few days. Faster testing also aims to help doctors identify how people became infected and provide their close contacts with testing and medicine more quickly, if needed, said Nirav Shah, the agency's principal deputy director, on a call with reporters. The CDC does not believe it has been missing bird flu infections in people, Shah said. No surveillance system detects 100% of cases, he added later. 'The system is working as it should,' said Shah, adding that health officials want results sooner in case any public health action is needed. 'What we need is to shift to a system that tells us what's happening in the moment.' Nearly 70 people in the United States, most of them farmworkers, have contracted bird flu since April, as the virus has circulated among poultry flocks and dairy herds. Three people have tested positive without a clear source of exposure to the virus, according to CDC. Most infections in humans have been mild, but one fatality was reported in Louisiana last week. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has more than 300 personnel working on its bird flu response and has spent $1.5 billion on its efforts to curb the spread among poultry and dairy cattle, said Eric Deeble, a deputy undersecretary at the agency. The USDA last week said it would rebuild a bird flu vaccine stockpile for poultry. USDA officials have met several times with the transition team of the incoming Donald Trump administration to try to ensure a smooth handoff on agency actions to curb the spread of the virus, including a tabletop exercise at the White House on Wednesday, Deeble said. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, which encompasses CDC, also have repeatedly met with the transition team on Zoom calls and have shared their bird flu playbook, officials said on the press call. HHS said on Thursday it plans to put $211 million toward mRNA-based vaccine technology to better respond to emerging infectious diseases such as bird flu.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-cdc-recommends-faster-testing-for-bird-flu-in-hospitalized-patients-/7939688.html	2025-01-16T14:26:19-08:00	
Standoff in South Africa ends with 87 miners dead, anger at police tactics	STILFONTEIN, South Africa — The death toll in a monthslong standoff between police and miners trapped while working illegally in an abandoned gold mine in South Africa has risen to at least 87, police said Thursday. Authorities faced growing anger and a possible investigation into their initial refusal to help the miners and instead 'smoke them out' by cutting off their food supplies. National police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said 78 bodies were retrieved in a court-ordered rescue operation, with 246 survivors also pulled out from deep underground since the operation began on Monday. Mathe said nine other bodies had been recovered before the rescue operation, without giving details. Community groups launched their own rescue attempts when authorities said last year that they would not help the hundreds of miners because they were 'criminals.' The miners are suspected to have died of starvation and dehydration, although no causes of death have been released. South African authorities have been fiercely criticized for cutting off food and supplies to the miners in the Buffelsfontein Gold Mine last year. That tactic to 'smoke them out,' as described by a prominent Cabinet minister, was condemned by one of South Africa's biggest trade unions. Police and the mine owners also were accused of taking away ropes and dismantling a pulley system the miners used to enter the mine and send supplies down from the surface. A court ordered authorities last year to allow food and water to be sent down to the miners, while another court ruling last week forced them to launch a rescue operation. 'A disgrace' Many say the unfolding disaster underground was clear weeks ago, when community members sporadically pulled decomposing bodies out of the mine, some with notes attached pleading for food to be sent down. 'If the police had acted earlier, we would not be in this situation, with bodies piling up,' said Johannes Qankase, a local community leader. 'It is a disgrace for a constitutional democracy like ours. Somebody needs to account for what has happened here.' South Africa's second biggest political party, which is part of a government coalition, called for President Cyril Ramaphosa to establish an independent inquiry to find out 'why the situation was allowed to get so badly out of hand.' 'The scale of the disaster underground at Buffelsfontein is rapidly proving to be as bad as feared,' the Democratic Alliance party said. Authorities now believe that nearly 2,000 miners were working illegally in the mine near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, since August. Most of them resurfaced on their own over the last few months, police said, and all the survivors have been arrested, even as some emerged this week badly emaciated and barely able to walk to waiting ambulances. A convoy of mortuary vans arrived at the mine to carry away the bodies. Mathe said at least 13 children had also come out of the mine before the official rescue operation. Police announced Wednesday that they were ending the operation after three days and believed no one else was underground. To be sure, a camera was sent down Thursday in a cage that was used to pull out survivors and bodies. Two volunteer rescuers from the community went down in the small cage during the rescue operation to help miners. Authorities had refused to allow any official rescue personnel to go into the shaft because it was too dangerous. 'It has been a tough few days. There were many people who [we] saved but I still feel bad for those whose family members came out in body bags,' said Mandla Charles, one of the volunteer rescuers. 'We did all we could.' The two volunteers were being offered trauma counseling, police said. The mine is one of the deepest in South Africa. It's a maze of tunnels and levels and has several shafts leading into it. The miners were working up to 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) underground in different groups. Exits possible, police say Police have maintained that the miners were able to come out through several shafts but refused out of fear of being arrested. That’s been disputed by groups representing the miners, who say hundreds were trapped and left starving in dark and damp conditions with decomposing bodies around them. Police Minister Senzo Mchunu denied in an interview with a national TV station that the police were responsible for any starvation and said they had allowed food to go down. The initial police operation last year to force the miners to come out and give themselves up for arrest was part of a larger nationwide clampdown on illegal mining called Vala Umgodi, or Close the Hole. Illegal mining is often in the news in South Africa and a major problem for authorities as large groups go into mines that have been shut down to extract leftover deposits. Gold-rich South Africa has an estimated 6,000 abandoned or closed mines. The illicit miners, known as 'zama zamas' — 'hustlers' or 'chancers' in the Zulu language — are usually armed and part of criminal syndicates, the government says, and they rob South Africa of more than $1 billion a year in gold deposits. They are often undocumented foreign nationals, and authorities said that the vast majority who came out of the Buffelsfontein mine were from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Lesotho, and were in South Africa illegally. Police said they seized gold, explosives, firearms and more than $2 million in cash from the miners and have defended their hardline approach. 'By providing food, water and necessities to these illegal miners, it would be the police entertaining and allowing criminality to thrive,' Mathe said Wednesday. But the South African Federation of Trade Unions questioned the government's humanity and how it could 'allow anyone — be they citizens or undocumented immigrants — to starve to death in the depths of the earth.' While the police operation has been condemned by civic groups, the disaster hasn't provoked a strong outpouring of anger across South Africa, where the mostly foreign zama zamas have long been considered unwelcome in a country that already struggles with high rates of violent crime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/standoff-in-south-africa-ends-with-87-miners-dead-anger-at-police-tactics-/7939664.html	2025-01-16T14:10:25-08:00	
US Customs agents intercept contraband cars headed overseas	SPARROWS POINT, MARYLAND — Most Americans and visitors to the United States encounter Customs and Border Protection agents when they enter or return to the country at land crossings or airports. But CBP also is responsible for inspecting goods leaving the country, which creates a nearly impossible assignment of trying to intercept all stolen automobiles being shipped out of the U.S. At the Port of Baltimore, CBP scrutinizes several hundred vehicles every day, and on average will find one illegal export — nearly all headed to a particular region of the world, says Adam Rottman, CBP’s director at the Port of Baltimore. He acknowledges that CBP has neither the time nor manpower to inspect every shipping container. 'I’d say 90 to 95% of every one of our stolen automobiles is headed to West Africa,' he tells VOA. Alex Piquero, a professor of criminology at the University of Miami, said, 'There are people who are stealing cars and car parts to sell them very quickly in the local markets. And then there are people literally stealing cars and putting them on containers and selling them, shipping them all over the world, not just to Africa, but also to the Middle East and to Asia.' On any given day at the Port of Baltimore, CBP’s manifest of seized vehicles resembles the inventory of a small used car lot: a Kia purchased fraudulently at auction in New Jersey is bound for Ghana; a Mercedes-Benz valued at $48,000, purchased with a stolen identity in Ohio, is slated for shipment to Togo; a $75,000 Ford Raptor inside a container with one or two additional stolen vehicles and boxes of new power tools is headed for West Africa. Rottman peeks inside one container for which no vehicles are listed. 'It’s supposed to be only household goods in there,' he says. 'In this example, there’s at least three, probably four cars in that container.' Rottman walks to another container opened for inspection. 'This container, we just opened today. The vehicle on the top there, that Honda, we’ve already verified through the VIN (vehicle identification number) that the car is stolen. There’s two [vehicles], more in the back,' he says. CBP operates giant mobile X-ray trucks, the VACIS M6500s, which in minutes can scan shipping containers and determine if they should be opened for a closer inspection. A growing problem Auto theft is a problem accelerating across the United States. While the early part of the 2010s saw a decline in vehicle thefts, there has been a notable increase since 2020, influenced by factors that include the coronavirus pandemic and social media videos demonstrating how certain car models can easily be stolen. The criminals frequently rent cars for a 30-day period and immediately drive them into a nearby container and paste a fake VIN over the real one. The car will not be reported stolen by the rental agency for a month. By then, it may already be on a ship. Rottman stands in front of the container that has the expensive Ford Raptor inside. 'They’ll take the VIN number on the dashboard on your windshield. They’ll make a fake VIN. They’ll put it over the top, glue it on, so it would come up [on computer databases] clean, or it’s not on file when we look it up,' he explains. 'But right away, we noticed the checked digit on the VIN doesn’t match what’s supposed to be on a Ford truck.' For some buyers in Africa or on other continents, unwittingly acquiring a car stolen in the U.S. may seem like a good deal, but some of the vehicles are known to have been in accidents and could be unsafe, including airbags that no longer work. 'You could be putting your family members in danger by driving some of these stolen cars,' says Rottman. There is also a moral hazard. 'When they purchase a car like this that’s been stolen, they’re funding these transnational criminal organizations. And criminal organizations are willing to do anything to make money,' Rottman says, noting that such activities by car theft gangs include human trafficking, drug smuggling and even terrorism. Authorities in some African countries are working with Interpol and other transnational law enforcement agencies to seize some of the stolen vehicles that slip through American ports. Cooperation is not consistent because of government corruption in some countries. 'Some governments will play nicer, and other governments won't, and you can't search every container. And that's why the security at the port is so critically important,' Piquero of the University of Miami told VOA. With so many buyers seeking a deal on a used car — often with no questions asked — there is unlikely to be a slowdown anytime soon in the global traffic of stolen vehicles.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-customs-agents-intercept-contraband-cars-headed-overseas/7939673.html	2025-01-16T14:08:02-08:00	
Zimbabwe ruling party to push for third term for President Mnangagwa	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwe's ruling party says it will initiate steps to amend the constitution so President Emmerson Mnangagwa can run for a third term in the 2028 elections. The opposition is strongly opposed to amending the 2013 constitution, which limited presidents to two five-year terms. In an interview Thursday with VOA, Ziyambi Ziyambi, Zimbabwe's minister of justice, legal and parliamentary affairs, said the government is ready to move forward once lawmakers introduce the bill to amend the constitution. 'Is there a prohibition in amending anything in the constitution?' Ziyambi said. 'The only prohibition, the only clause that I know in the constitution, it says any electoral amendments have to be done six months before an election for that amendment to be used in the coming election. Anything else I'm not aware.' Lovemore Madhuku, a law professor at the University of Zimbabwe and an opposition leader, said it will be difficult though not impossible for the ruling Zanu-PF party to change the constitution in time for its leader to run in the 2028 election. 'Legally, yes you can go through the steps,' Madhuku said. 'The steps will require a publication of the first bill, give Zimbabweans a 90-day period to debate it. Thereafter, take it to parliament. It must get a two-thirds majority, and thereafter there must be a referendum. That alone tells you that it is very difficult. It cannot be assumed that since Zanu-PF has a two-thirds majority [in parliament], they will obtain the two-thirds majority.' Douglas Mwonzora, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change party, said the MDC will campaign vehemently against the bid to have Mnangagwa stand for a third term. Mwonzora, who is a lawyer, said one referendum will not suffice for Mnangagwa to stand in 2028. 'They will need another referendum,' Mwonzora said. 'This time specifically, stating whether or not President Mnangagwa must stand again and these two referendums must not be within six months of one another. 'We will campaign for a no vote again not because we have anything personal against President Mnangagwa, we think that President Mnangagwa after his term should go and rest, we think it’s time for other leaders, so we will campaign no in that regard.' But Ziyambi said Zanu-PF will overcome all obstacles in the way of Mnangagwa’s third term. 'Zanu-PF is a mass party. Our structures are to the grassroot from village level, so when we are doing resolutions, that's where they start,' Ziyambi said. 'It’s not the top leadership that say that they want anything.' Ziyambi said Mnangagwa said he has been clear that he wants to abide by the constitution, but the push for the resolution to allow him to run for a third term is coming from the grassroots level. President Robert Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years before Mnangagwa, a former army general and Mugabe’s vice president took power in a 2017 coup. Mnangagwa is 82 years old and is currently the fifth oldest head of state in Africa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-ruling-party-to-push-for-third-term-for-president-mnangagwa-/7939642.html	2025-01-16T13:32:40-08:00

David Lynch, filmmaker behind 'Twin Peaks' and 'Mulholland Drive,' dies at 78	LOS ANGELES — David Lynch, the filmmaker celebrated for his uniquely dark vision in such movies as 'Blue Velvet' and 'Mulholland Drive' and the TV series 'Twin Peaks,' has died just days before his 79th birthday. His family announced the death in a Facebook post on Thursday. The cause of death and location was not immediately available, but Lynch had been public about his emphysema. 'We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole,'' the post read. 'It's a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.' Lynch was a onetime artist who broke through in the 1970s with the surreal 'Eraserhead' and rarely failed to startle and inspire audiences and peers in the following decades. His notable releases ranged from the neo-noir 'Mulholland Drive' to the skewed Gothic of 'Blue Velvet' to the eclectic and eccentric 'Twin Peaks.' His other credits included the crime story 'Wild at Heart,' winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival; the biographical drama 'The Elephant Man' and the G-rated, straightforward 'The Straight Story.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/david-lynch-filmmaker-behind-twin-peaks-and-mulholland-drive-dies-at-78/7939447.html	2025-01-16T11:11:59-08:00

Ukraine's Zelenskyy seeking continued US support under Trump	As Russia’s war with Ukraine approaches the three-year mark in February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is emphasizing his country’s hope for continued U.S. support under the incoming Trump administration. 'We are waiting for the inauguration of the U.S. president. I think the whole world is waiting because the United States is a strategic partner in global stability,' Zelenskyy said this week during a joint press conference in Warsaw with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Zelenskyy described the U.S. as 'the largest donor supporting Ukraine in its war for survival against Russian aggression' and expressed optimism for deepened cooperation under the principle of 'peace through strength.' He also said his administration is already coordinating with Washington regarding possible meetings with President-elect Donald Trump, who assumes office on Monday. 'Our teams are working on the details of this crucial discussion. We want to end this war, but on the terms of a just peace,' he said. The key focus for Ukraine in future peace negotiations will be securing robust and comprehensive security guarantees to prevent any future Russian aggression. Trump has voiced skepticism of continued U.S. military support for Kyiv, repeatedly vowing that he would end the war before assuming the presidency on Jan. 20. In recent days, however, his aides have said the new timeline for ending the war is in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be by the end of April. Trump's nominee for secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday: 'Even if the conflict ends, Ukraine must have the ability to defend itself.' He added that this is a matter of long-term security and stability for Ukraine. Tusk, standing alongside Zelenskyy in Warsaw, said Ukraine's best security guarantee would be membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions. But, he pointed out, the thought of Ukraine joining NATO remains 'controversial among some states,' making it vital for the Western alliance to provide Ukraine with a tangible solution to secure peace in Europe. Ukrainian military troop strength Ukraine cannot engage in 'games' by reducing the size of its military, Zelenskyy also said, rejecting any proposals to do so. He said a strong defense force is 'the only security guarantee' ahead of potential peace negotiations with Russia. His remarks referred to Bloomberg News reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to push for Ukraine to sever ties with NATO and adopt a 'neutral state' status with a limited military during any discussions with Trump. Highlighting the current strength of Ukraine's military, Zelenskyy said that it now comprises 880,000 soldiers tasked with countering an estimated 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific regions. According to the president, Ukraine produces more than 30% of its military equipment, mainly drones. He has called for allies and partners to invest in military production in Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine target each other daily with aerial strikes. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the Russian attacks, alongside vast casualties among both Ukrainian and Russian troops since Russia’s February 2022 invasion. European security initiatives Part of the proposed option for security guarantees involves French President Emmanuel Macron’s idea of deploying European forces to Ukraine. During his visit to Warsaw, Zelenskyy confirmed that he had discussed the proposal. Answering questions from VOA, the Ukrainian president said that even though the idea remains in early stages, the initiative, in his view, could be part of Ukraine’s broader security guarantees. 'We support the idea of a contingent involving our allies and strategic partners as part of the security guarantees. However, this alone will not suffice,' Zelenskyy said. As a first step, the Ukrainian president said it would be effective to send Western instructors to Ukraine with a comprehensive training plan to strengthen forces on the ground. Zelenskyy also said he plans to discuss the idea with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who arrived in Kyiv on Thursday with a pledge to help guarantee Ukraine’s security. Britain and Ukraine agreed on a '100-Year Partnership' treaty covering defense, science, energy and trade. The other security guarantees Zelenskyy noted involve additional sanctions, continued weapons shipments, and investments in its military production. He called for urgent international action, including utilizing frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine’s defense. 'The strongest support for the Ukrainian army would be to allocate $250 billion from frozen Russian assets to purchase weapons Ukraine urgently needs,' he said. EU aspirations Polish and Ukrainian leaders embraced Ukraine's European Union aspirations as part of the peace process. Poland, which holds the rotating EU presidency, reaffirmed its commitment to accelerating Ukraine’s European integration. Tusk described the EU presidency as an opportunity to break the impasse and expedite Ukraine’s accession. 'We will work unconditionally with Ukraine and our European partners to speed up this big and essential task,' he said. Tusk noted that Ukraine's EU membership will add to European security, and he promised to make the issue a priority. 'We will break the standstill we have in this issue,' he said during the joint press conference. 'We will accelerate the accession process.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-zelenskyy-seeking-continued-us-support-under-trump/7939430.html	2025-01-16T10:55:24-08:00	
Brazilian court denies Bolsonaro's request to travel to Trump inauguration	SAO PAULO — Brazil's Supreme Court on Thursday denied a request by former President Jair Bolsonaro to temporarily restore his passport so that he could attend the inauguration in Washington of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump next week. Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who Bolsonaro frequently has called his personal foe, said in the ruling that Bolsonaro currently holds no position that would allow him to represent Brazil at the event and that the former president did not adequately prove to the court that he had been invited. Federal police seized Bolsonaro’s passport last February because he was considered a flight risk. He is the subject of several wide-ranging investigations, including over an alleged attempt to stay in office despite his electoral defeat. He denies the allegations against him. The former Brazilian president requested permission to leave the country from Jan. 17 to 22 to attend the inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20 and a Hispanic inaugural ball. Bolsonaro, an outspoken admirer of Trump, said on his social media channels on Jan. 8 that he was 'very happy with this invitation.' 'I'll be representing the conservative, the right-wing, the good, the Brazilian people there in the United States, God willing,' Bolsonaro said. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press after the court ruling. When de Moraes asked Bolsonaro's lawyers for evidence of his invitation on Saturday, they forwarded an invitation letter signed by inauguration committee co-chairs Steve Witkoff and Kelly Loeffler. Still, de Moraes argued that Bolsonaro had not adequately proven that he was invited to the inauguration. In the ruling, de Moraes followed the recommendation of Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet, who said Wednesday that Bolsonaro's private interest in the trip did not outweigh the public interest in prohibiting from traveling abroad. De Moraes said Bolsonaro remains a flight risk and added that he has advocated that his supporters who face legal troubles in cases involving their political allegiance should leave the country and seek asylum. Hundreds of Bolsonaro's supporters involved in the Jan. 8, 2023, riots in capital Brasilia have left Brazil to avoid prosecution. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will not attend Trump's inauguration. Federal police seized Bolsonaro's passport during a raid related to the investigation into whether he and top aides plotted to ignore the 2022 election results and stage an uprising to keep the defeated right-wing leader in power. Brazil's Supreme Court previously has denied a Bolsonaro request to retrieve his passport, in March 2024, following an invitation from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In November, federal police formally accused Bolsonaro and 36 others, including high-ranking military officers, of attempting a coup. Gonet, the prosecutor-general, will decide whether to charge Bolsonaro or toss the investigation. Legal experts believe Bolsonaro could be charged and stand trial in the second half of 2025 at the Supreme Court for allegedly falsifying his COVID-19 vaccination status. Analysts also say there's a reasonable chance he stands trial before 2026 over allegedly embezzling jewels gifted by Saudi Arabian authorities. The former president denies that he tried to stay in office after his narrow electoral defeat in 2022 to his leftist opponent, Lula. The Brazilian ambassador to the United States, Maria Luiza Viotti, will attend Trump's inauguration, the government told The Associated Press on Thursday. President Lula was not officially invited to the ceremony. Trump has invited some global leaders to his inauguration, including Chinese President Xi Jinping and Argentinian President Javier Milei.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazilian-court-denies-bolsonaro-s-request-to-travel-to-trump-inauguration/7939400.html	2025-01-16T10:50:15-08:00	
US Treasury nominee Scott Bessent faces sharp questions from Democrats at confirmation hearing	WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury nominee Scott Bessent on Thursday faced sharp questions from Democrats on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the future of an IRS tax filing system that Republicans have called to be cut. Bessent sat in front of the Senate Finance Committee for his confirmation hearing, where he told lawmakers that President-elect Donald Trump has an opportunity to unleash 'a new economic golden age.' He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary 'who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.' Graham added: 'Your ship came in with this guy.' But Democrats, including senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion. Bennet assailed Bessent for shedding 'crocodile tears' over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. 'There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe' from the tax cuts. Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, notably Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats. In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS's Direct File program — which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free — at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers say the program is a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular. Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee. He also mulled over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary. The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council. If confirmed, Bessent will oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut. Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident. 'Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,' Bessent testified. Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight. In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. He will be asked about this during his hearing. Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years. He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit.	https://www.voanews.com/a/treasury-nominee-scott-bessent-faces-sharp-questions-from-democrats-at-confirmation-hearing/7939346.html	2025-01-16T10:45:11-08:00	
Pope Francis hurts right arm after falling for 2nd time in just over a month	ROME — Pope Francis fell Thursday and hurt his right arm, the Vatican said, just weeks after another apparent fall resulted in a bad bruise on his chin. Francis didn’t break his arm, but a sling was put on as a precaution, the Vatican spokesman said in a statement On Dec. 7, the pope whacked his chin on his nightstand in an apparent fall that resulted in a bad bruise. The 88-year-old pope, who has battled health problems including long bouts of bronchitis, often must use a wheelchair because of bad knees. He uses a walker or cane when moving around his apartment in the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel. The Vatican said that Thursday’s fall also occurred at Santa Marta, and the pope was later seen in audiences with his right arm in a sling. At one of the meetings, Francis apologetically offered his left hand for a handshake when he greeted the head of the U.N. fund for agricultural development, Alvaro Lario. 'This morning, due to a fall at the Casa Santa Marta, Pope Francis suffered a contusion to his right forearm, without fracture. The arm was immobilized as a precautionary measure,' the statement said. Speculation about Francis' health is a constant in Vatican circles, especially after Pope Benedict XVI broke 600 years of tradition and resigned from the papacy in 2013. Benedict's aides have attributed the decision to a nighttime fall that he suffered during a 2012 trip to Mexico, after which he determined he couldn't keep up with the globe-trotting demands of the papacy. Francis has said that he has no plans to resign anytime soon, even if Benedict 'opened the door' to the possibility. In his autobiography Hope released this week, Francis said that he hadn't considered resigning even when he had major intestinal surgery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-hurts-right-arm-after-falling-for-2nd-time-in-just-over-a-month/7939360.html	2025-01-16T10:30:15-08:00	
UN appeals for $3.2 billion to support 8.2 million Ukrainian war victims	GENEVA — The United Nations is appealing for $3.2 billion to provide humanitarian assistance for 8.2 million Ukrainians whose lives have been upended by Russia’s invasion of their country nearly three years ago. 'This has been a period of huge tragedy and despair, destruction and disruption,' Tom Fletcher, U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told journalists in Kyiv at the launch of the U.N. appeal with the government of Ukraine. 'We must be here at the side of the Ukrainian people as they respond to the consequences of a devastating war,' he said, noting that 'the needs are great.' 'We have to respond by showing a real, genuine, sustained international engagement. We have to respond with heart. And when I say sustained, I mean that we will be here with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes to meet these needs,' Fletcher said. The lion’s share of the twin humanitarian and refugee response plans for 2025 — $2.62 billion — will be used to support 6 million people out of more than 12 million people inside Ukraine who need humanitarian aid. 'We are prioritizing the most vulnerable. This is vulnerability driven and needs driven, and our aim is to support people wherever they are,' Matthias Schmale, U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, said. 'It is not geography-based. It is vulnerability and needs-based. Inevitably, a big part of the needs are along the front line. We are supporting those who have chosen to stay near the front line … particularly people with disabilities and older people who find it difficult to move,' he said. A smaller amount of money — $ 1.2 billion — will provide relief and protection over the next two years for more than 2 million Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes and have taken refuge in 11 eastern European host countries bordering Ukraine. 'There are almost 7 million Ukrainian refugees outside the country,' said Filippo Grandi, U.N. high commissioner for refugees. He explained that the current appeal does not cover all host countries because national governments, mainly in western Europe, are able to support the Ukrainian refugees. But the 11 border states of asylum such as Poland and Moldova, 'really need extra support from the international community.' 'So, we are very grateful for what all governments hosting refugees — these 11 countries and others — have done to give refugees access to health services, to education, to the labor market,' he said. 'But of course, we are about to enter the fourth year of this hospitality, and it is important that this generosity continues.' At the same time, Grandi stressed that 'the objective is not to make sure that these people are refugees forever. The objective is for this to create the conditions for these people to return to Ukraine. This is what the majority of the refugees want.' Last July and August, the UNHCR surveyed more than 11,150 refugee households across Europe and inside Ukraine among internally displaced people and returnees. It found that 61% of Ukrainian refugees and 73% of internally displaced people surveyed 'still plan and hope to return home one day.' Fletcher urged the international community to 'stay the course with the people of Ukraine.' 'The needs we have described are great. We are conscious, obviously, that the president, the government, are seeking negotiations, seeking ways to try to end this war. But just because you end a war does not mean the needs go away,' Fletcher said. 'We recognize the needs will change. But even if we get progress, even if we get good news in the period ahead, we will still need to be here alongside our Ukrainian partners supporting the Ukrainian people,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-appeals-for-3-2-billion-to-support-8-2-million-ukrainian-war-victims/7939357.html	2025-01-16T10:27:02-08:00	
Pakistan deports Afghans with UNHCR papers	As part of its drive to expel Afghan citizens from the nation’s capital, Pakistan has deported dozens bearing UNHCR-issued documents, the agency told VOA Thursday. Authorities in Islamabad deported 285 Afghans between Jan. 1 and 15, according to the refugee agency. Its Pakistan representative, Philippa Candler, told VOA that 80 of those deported were in possession of preliminary documents the agency had given them. Although initial documentation issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees does not give legal cover to Afghans, it can show the agency may be determining their refugee status, or that a person may be in the early stages of the resettlement process, Candler explained. Candler said that in the past, Pakistani authorities generally refrained from deporting those possessing any agency-issued papers. 'We could by and large get Afghans with our documents released,' Candler said, referring to actions against Afghans since Pakistan launched a nationwide drive in October 2023 to expel undocumented residents amid rising terrorism. Candler attributed past leniency to goodwill. Expulsion order The tougher action comes after Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi announced in November that all Afghan citizens would require a no-objection certificate, or NOC, from the city administration to stay in the capital past the end of the year. The minister alleged Afghan citizens took part in a protest that saw thousands of supporters of incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan descend on Islamabad between Nov. 24 to 26. At least four security personnel were killed before authorities launched a crackdown that Khan’s party says killed at least 12 supporters. Raids 'It’s not a nice experience,' said Enayatuallah Omid, who said he was detained for hours along with others at a police station in Islamabad after law enforcement authorities raided his neighborhood Jan. 5. An Afghan journalist, Omid arrived in Pakistan in July 2022 on a medical visa to flee Taliban repression. He said the constant fear of deportation is deeply hurting his family. 'My wife has attempted suicide three times. Every time the pressure builds up, she tries to kill herself.' Quoting her, Omid said, ‘What kind of a life is this?’' Amnesty International has decried the requirement of NOC for Afghan refugees as an 'onerous obligation.' Omid said, though, that the process of applying for a no-objection certificate was easy. 'They behaved nicely,' he said, referring to the officials at Islamabad district commissioner’s office. But Omid has only a receipt showing he has applied for the NOC. He said he did not know if he would receive any more documentation allowing him to stay in the capital. International pressure Candler told VOA that her office is working with Pakistani authorities to help Afghans who are registered with UNHCR. However, she said the Afghan Taliban’s claim that Pakistan detained more than 800 Afghans in the first week of the year could not be confirmed. The Afghan Taliban’s envoy in Islamabad, Mawlawi Sardar Ahmad Shakib, met Wednesday with Candler to convey concerns about Pakistan’s detention and deportation of registered Afghan refugees from Islamabad and neighboring Rawalpindi. Islamabad authorities deny targeting documented refugees and registered Afghan citizens, or those awaiting third country repatriation. Responding to reports of mistreatment, officials have said teams abide by the law during raids. Recent press releases from Pakistan’s interior ministry show that envoys from Washington and London discussed the expulsion of Afghans from the capital with Naqvi. Thousands of Afghans in Islamabad are awaiting repatriation to the United States and Britain. 'Mohsin Naqvi stated that no illegal foreigner will be allowed to stay in Pakistan,' according to a handout issued Thursday after the minister’s meeting with the outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Donald Blome. 'Minister highlighted that no action is being taken against any foreign national holding valid documents,' said an interior ministry statement after Naqvi met Saturday with the British high commissioner to Pakistan, Jane Marriott. Pakistan is home to 3.1 million Afghans. More than 800,000 are undocumented. This includes Afghans born in Pakistan, as well as those who fled their country after the Taliban’s return to power in 2021. More than 813,000 Afghans have returned to their home country since September 2023, including about 300,000 last year. More than 38,000 have been deported in almost 15 months, according to the U.N.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-deports-afghans-with-unhcr-papers/7939282.html	2025-01-16T09:52:47-08:00

HRW report: Governments, armed groups intensify abuses in Africa	NAIROBI, KENYA — Human Rights Watch has found that African governments continue to crack down and wrongly arrest political opponents, critics, activists and journalists. The rights group also says armed forces and armed groups in some African countries have targeted civilians, killing them and driving them from their homes. The conflicts in Sudan and Ethiopia feature prominently in a Human Rights Watch report released Thursday. The report says that in Sudan, the war between the armed forces and the rebel Rapid Support Forces has displaced 12 million people, destroyed infrastructure and blocked humanitarian assistance. In Ethiopia, rights group investigators found that government forces in the Amhara region committed widespread attacks against medical professionals, patients and health facilities. Mausi Segun, head of the Human Rights Watch Africa Division, said armed conflict is not the only form of rights violation on the continent. 'On top of all of that, you have civic space restriction abuses, including intolerance for freedom of expression, intolerance for freedom of association and assembly,' Segun said. 'Protests are being clamped down on, and people who are pushing for their rights or even commenting on government policies and measures are being hunted down. Here in East Africa, we are seeing very disturbing trends towards abductions.' Kenya has captured the attention of human rights groups for recent alleged abductions of anti-government protesters and activists from foreign countries, some of whom have been deported to Turkey and Uganda. The HRW report also focuses on the seemingly endless conflict in the Congo, where civilians are killed, women raped, and attacks on camps for the internally displaced push more people into neighboring countries. Congo has accused Rwanda of supporting M23 rebels, an allegation Rwanda denies. Clementine de Montoye, Human Rights Watch senior researcher, said the expansion of conflict worsens civilians' harm, adding, 'we are not seeing significant signs of pressure on the different parties to the conflict to reduce violations and harms to civilians.' The report says that countries in West Africa ruled by the military — like Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger — have cracked down on opposition and dissent, freedom of expression, and backsliding in the fight against corruption. It notes that in Southern Africa, Mozambique is grappling with post-election violence in which hundreds of people have been killed. Elizabeth Kamundia, deputy director of disability rights at Human Rights Watch, said conflict and violence are causing a rise in physical and psychological issues. 'We have seen a rise in the number of people acquiring injuries that lead to disabilities,' Kamundia said. 'We've seen increased psychological distress and mental health impacts on people, families and communities as a result of war and conflict. We've seen difficulties with access to medication for people who have mental health conditions, and therefore, they are forced to stop their treatment.' Human Rights Watch’s newly-released World Report reviewed human rights records of more than 100 countries, including 25 in Africa. Despite the widespread abuses and violence against people in Africa, HRW notes that, like the rest of the world, African people are resisting and pushing back against autocratic rule and abuse of their rights. It notes they are mobilizing on social media and streets to demand an end to the abuses and bad governance that has contributed to divisions and conflict among communities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hrw-report-governments-armed-groups-intensify-abuses-in-africa/7939208.html	2025-01-16T08:31:36-08:00	
Florida attorney general chosen to fill Marco Rubio's open Senate seat	TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA — Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody will take Marco Rubio 's seat in the U.S. Senate, Governor Ron DeSantis announced Thursday, making Moody only the second woman to represent Florida in the chamber. Elected as the state's top law enforcement officer in 2018, Moody campaigned on a pledge to voters that she'd be a prosecutor, not a politician. Along with DeSantis, Moody boosted her political profile during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling on the federal government to 'hold China responsible' for the outbreak. Before running for statewide office, Moody worked as a federal prosecutor. In 2006, she was elected to the post of circuit judge in Hillsborough County, home to Tampa. As the state's attorney general, Moody has been instrumental in defending DeSantis' conservative agenda in court and has joined other Republican-led states in challenging the Biden administration's policies, suing over changes to immigration enforcement, student loan forgiveness and vaccine mandates for federal contractors. Under Florida law, it's up to the Republican governor to pick Rubio's replacement, after President-elect Donald Trump picked the three-term senator to be his next secretary of state. Moody will serve in the Senate until the next general election, in 2026, when the seat will be back on the ballot. Moody fought unsuccessfully to keep an abortion rights measure off the ballot in Florida in 2024, saying proponents were waging 'a war' to protect the procedure. The measure did go before voters but ultimately failed to get the 60% approval needed to pass. She was also among the state attorneys general to sign on to the lawsuit backed by Trump aimed at overturning Joe Biden's election victory in 2020. Republican state Senator Joe Gruters, a key Trump ally in Florida, was among those who had pushed the president-elect's daughter-in-law Lara Trump as their top pick for the Senate seat. Lara Trump removed herself from consideration in December. Still, Gruters praised Moody, calling her 'a winner here in Florida.' 'She's very popular. And I think people see the job that she does, and they appreciate her work and her effort at trying to ... keep Florida safe,' Gruters said ahead of the announcement. Moody's appointment opens a key vacancy in Florida's Cabinet, giving DeSantis another shot at expanding his influence in the state. DeSantis will also get to pick a replacement for outgoing Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, who's leaving his post to run for former Representative Matt Gaetz's open seat in Congress.	https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-attorney-general-chosen-to-fill-marco-rubio-s-open-senate-seat/7939181.html	2025-01-16T08:13:08-08:00	
WHO appeals for $1.5 billion to tackle 'unprecedented' global health crisis	GENEVA — The World Health Organization appealed Thursday for $1.5 billion for emergency operations this year, warning that conflict, climate change, epidemics and displacement had converged to create an 'unprecedented global health crisis.' The U.N. health agency estimated that health crises would leave 305 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance this year. 'WHO is seeking $1.5 billion to support our lifesaving work for the emergencies we know about and to react swiftly to new crises,' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he launched the appeal. The agency's emergency request, which was for the same amount as last year's request, outlined the critical priorities and resources needed to address 42 ongoing health emergencies. 'Conflicts, outbreaks, climate-related disasters and other health emergencies are no longer isolated or occasional — they are relentless, overlapping and intensifying,' Tedros said in a statement. He pointed to the emergency health assistance provided in conflict zones ranging from the occupied Palestinian territories to the Democratic Republic of Congo to Sudan, as well as its work conducting vaccination campaigns, treating malnutrition and helping control outbreaks of diseases like cholera. 'Without adequate and sustainable funding, we face the impossible task of deciding who will receive care and who will not this year,' Tedros said at Thursday's event. 'Your support helps to ensure that WHO remains a lifeline, bridging the gap between sickness and health, despair and hope, life and death for millions of people worldwide.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-appeals-for-1-5-billion-to-tackle-unprecedented-global-health-crisis/7939148.html	2025-01-16T08:00:51-08:00	
China reaches out to US allies ahead of Trump’s inauguration	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China initiated a new round of diplomatic outreach to Japan and the European Union this week as Washington prepares for President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. A delegation of Japanese lawmakers traveled to Beijing and a Chinese military delegation went to Japan for the first time in five years. Meanwhile, the European Council’s new president held his first phone call with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Analysts say China is trying to test the alliance between Washington and its allies through the diplomatic efforts. 'Senior Chinese officials believe the incoming Trump administration will be more hawkish toward China, so Beijing needs to try to take U.S. allies out of Washington’s orbit,' Chen Yuhua, a China studies professor at Akita International University, told VOA in a video interview. Other experts, however, say the effectiveness of Beijing’s strategy remains unclear. While China is 'improving relations with everyone, they are not willing to fundamentally change their external behavior. We don’t know how long [this trend] will last,' said Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo's International Christian University. Seafood and soldiers On Monday, lawmakers from Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, and its coalition partner Komeito began a three-day visit to China. During the trip, Japanese lawmakers met with top Chinese leaders, including Premier Li Qiang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The Japanese side urged China to lift import bans on Japanese seafood 'at an early date' and ensure the safety of Japanese nationals living in China. Hiroshi Moriyama, the secretary general of the LDP, said during his keynote speech on Tuesday that China and Japan 'need to boost mutual understanding between their peoples and strengthen dialogue at various levels to improve their ties.' Moriyama also reiterated Tokyo’s concern about rising tensions in the East China Sea and Beijing’s detention of several Japanese nationals under espionage charges. During his meeting with the Japanese delegation Tuesday, Wang said Japan and China 'face important opportunities' to improve and develop bilateral relations. On Wednesday, Li said Beijing and Tokyo should focus on exploring economic cooperation in areas such as the digital economy and green development, while increasing people-to-people exchanges at the sub-national level. At the same time lawmakers were visiting Beijing, a Chinese military delegation started a five-day visit to Japan. During the trip, the Chinese delegation was expected to meet their Japanese counterparts and visit some military units, according to a statement from China’s Defense Ministry. Japanese government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi said during a press conference on Tuesday that the Chinese delegation’s visit helped to resume 'exchanges among troops' and 'contributes to the peace and stability of the region.' China’s Defense Ministry said the visit 'is expected to strengthen mutual understanding and trust while advancing defense exchanges between the two countries.' The latest bilateral exchanges between Japan and China follow Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya’s trip to Beijing on Dec. 25, during which Tokyo and Beijing agreed to facilitate Wang’s trip to Japan and hold high-level economic and security dialogues. Despite Japan and China’s attempts to improve bilateral relations, Nagy said the efforts can’t be sustained. 'China thinks Japan and other countries’ growing alignment on issues such as the South China Sea dispute, economic security and resilience policy are against its core interests,' he told VOA by phone. So 'while they can have exchanges with Japan, it doesn’t take away their concerns about these issues,' Nagy said. Driving a wedge Apart from mending ties with Japan, China has also been trying to improve relations with the European Union amid rising trade tensions in recent months. During his first phone call with European Council President Antonio Costa on Tuesday, Xi said there are 'no clash of fundamental interests or geopolitical conflicts' between China and the EU, 'making them partners that can contribute to each other's success.' 'China remains confident in the EU and hopes the EU will also prove to be a trustworthy cooperation partner for China,' he said, adding that both sides should 'expand mutual openness, consolidate existing cooperation mechanisms and foster new growth points in their cooperation.' Costa said he had a 'constructive' phone call with Xi, during which he highlighted how Russia’s war against Ukraine threatens global peace and agreed with Xi that China and the EU should work together to 'tackle global challenges.' 'The EU and China are important trading partners. Our relations need to be balanced and based on a level-playing field,' Costa wrote in a post on the social media platform X. The call between Xi and Costa comes amid rising trade tensions between China and the EU. Last October, the EU decided to impose tariffs of up to 45.3% on imported Chinese electric vehicles. The move prompted Beijing to impose 'temporary anti-dumping measures' on brandy imported from the EU. Experts say China’s outreach to the EU is part of Beijing’s attempt to weaken the alliance between Washington and Brussels ahead of Trump’s return to office. 'China always has this anxiety that the U.S. and EU would work together to deal with China, so the upcoming regime change in Washington presents an opportunity [for Beijing] to exploit the anxiety that European countries have about the second Trump administration,' Matej Simalcik, executive director of the Central European Institute of Asian Studies, told VOA in an interview in Taipei. In his view, while China’s approach is unlikely to soften the EU’s tough trade approach against Beijing, it could present challenges to the bloc’s foreign policy agenda by leveraging its influence over certain EU member states. 'There are a lot of policy areas where EU member states have to agree on them unanimously and China could use its friendly relationship with certain member states to veto certain parts of the EU’s foreign policy agenda,' Simalcik said. While the effectiveness of Beijing’s diplomatic outreach to U.S. allies remains unclear, Chen in Japan said these efforts show China’s foreign policy approach has become 'more sophisticated.' 'Compared to their ‘wolf warrior diplomacy’ during the first Trump administration, China’s current diplomatic approach has become more delicate,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-reaches-out-to-us-allies-ahead-of-trump-s-inauguration/7939122.html	2025-01-16T07:43:33-08:00	
Human Rights Watch sees some encouraging signs in Asia in 2024	BANGKOK — In an uneven year for democracy and rights globally, the Asia-Pacific region saw some encouraging signs, Human Rights Watch says in its World Report 2025, released today. The organization cited citizen action by Indian voters against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the toppling of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by students, and a people’s protest blocking a bid by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to disempower political opponents by using martial law. However, at the same time, Myanmar’s junta continued to jail and bomb its opponents nearly four years after it seized power from the elected government; in Afghanistan the Taliban rolled back years of gains on women’s rights; and China, under President Xi Jinping, continued its descent into repression, the New York-based group said in the report. Taken together the message is clear, according to HRW Executive Director Tirana Hassan. 'When rights are protected, humanity flourishes,' she said in her introductory essay. 'When they are denied, the cost is measured not in abstract principles but in human lives. This is the challenge — and the opportunity — of our time,' she said. Bangladesh In Bangladesh, Hasina was ousted and fled the country amid student-led protests in August after 15 years of increasingly repressive government. Supporters of her Awami League party and police attacked peaceful demonstrations by students initially aimed at a government job quota plan, the HRW report said. The crackdown imposed an internet blackout and a curfew with a 'shoot-on-sight' order. 'Nearly 1,000 people, including over 100 children, were reportedly killed in the violence in July and in reprisal violence after Hasina’s ouster,' the report said. The report adds that since Hasina fled, the interim government of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has released thousands of people who were detained during the protests, restored order and set the country back on the path toward democratic elections. Accountability is at the heart of Yunus’ efforts, with the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights invited to send a fact-finding team to investigate abuses during the protests and their root causes, HRW reported. India and South Korea Another example of what the rights organization called 'meaningful democratic resistance' occurred in June in neighboring India, the rights organization said, as voters turned away from the populist and often anti-Muslim rhetoric of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, denying him an electoral majority. That showed 'that even in the face of systemic challenges, democracy can still put a check on power,' Hassan said. As the year ended, South Korea’s president, Yoon, stunned the world with a declaration of martial law to fend off mounting discontent with his administration, but the move backfired as thousands marched on the National Assembly, which overturned the decree a few hours later as the specter of a coup quickly evaporated. 'These resistance movements highlight a crucial reality,' Hassan said. 'The fight for rights is often driven by ordinary people, fed up with injustice and corruption, bringing together their collective power to compel governments to uphold basic rights and serve the people, instead of their own interests.' China and Hong Kong Xi’s China took the opposite turn in 2024, according to HRW, which said a slumping economy has seen 'heightened repression throughout the country,' from the jailing of hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs to the decline in civil liberties in Hong Kong. 'There is no independent civil society, no freedom of expression, association, assembly or religion, and human rights defenders and other perceived critics of the government are persecuted,' the report said. As China’s economy loses steam, Xi has intensified his smothering of dissent, including by the arbitrary detention of economists, artists and civil society leaders, the study said. Hong Kong’s handpicked judiciary tightened controls, HRW said, with 14 activists and former lawmakers jailed for four to 10 years for 'conspiracy to commit subversion' because of organizing an unofficial primary poll in 2020. Media freedom took more hits with the ongoing trial of outspoken 76-year-old tycoon Jimmy Lai, under national security laws and the jailing of two journalists in September for 21 and 11 months, respectively, for alleged sedition. 'While foreign governments recognize the Chinese government’s worsening rights record, they have not confronted Beijing,' the report said. Afghanistan Rights were stripped from women and girls in Afghanistan last year, as a resurgent Taliban banned secondary and university education and restricted employment and free movement of women. An August law promoting 'virtue and preventing vice' banned women from traveling or using public transport without a male companion. 'Under the law, women and girls are required to cover their faces in public and are prohibited from singing in public or letting their voices be heard outside the house,' the report said, adding women and girls had been detained for alleged breaches of draconian new dress codes. Myanmar and Singapore Meanwhile, in Myanmar, the junta continued to pound civilian areas with airstrikes and artillery and jail opponents, while it forced young conscripts into an army facing heavy losses across the country. HRW noted the International Criminal Court’s issuance of an arrest warrant for junta leader Min Aung Hlaing for crimes against humanity committed in a crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in 2017. But enforcement of ICC warrants is 'an ever-present hurdle' making 'consistent support of ICC member countries, [which] is critical for securing justice, almost always a long game,' the report said. Across Southeast Asia, HRW underlined Singapore’s continued use of the death penalty, mainly for drug offenses, and the limits of Thailand’s democracy after the 2023 election-winning Move Forward Party was dissolved by the courts in August. 'Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has done little to improve respect for fundamental freedoms and resolve outstanding human rights problems,' the report said, although it pointed to Thai recognition of same-sex marriages, the first such move in the region, as 'one positive step.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-watch-sees-some-encouraging-signs-in-asia-in-2024/7939027.html	2025-01-16T06:57:11-08:00

Analysts weigh in on what 2nd Trump term means for Africa	NAIROBI, KENYA — As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to be sworn into office, African analysts weigh in on what governing for the second term-president may feel like for the continent compared to his first term. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s first term included the launch of some initiatives for Africa. However, many people remember him for referring to the continent using degrading language. Edgar Githua is a professor of international relations at Strathmore University in Kenya. 'He called Africa a shithole, excuse my French,' said Githua. Estimated at over 1 billion people, Africa’s population is growing fast and expected to reach 2.5 billion by 2050, according to various estimates. It’s a big market that plays a key role in the global economy, Githua said, and in terms of business and trade, Trump may be interested in Africa but only because of the inroads China has made here. 'Since China is hellbent on capturing Africa as a business destination, Trump will come to Africa not so much because he cares about Africa but because he’s coming to counter Chinese influence on the African soil. So that fight, that proxy war, that geopolitical repositioning, in my view, is what could probably benefit Africa,' he said. But Trump’s first term saw the birth of initiatives such as Prosper Africa, aimed at facilitating economic engagement between the U.S. and African nations. Since its launch in 2019, the U.S. has helped close nearly 3,000 deals across 49 countries for a value of more than $120 billion, according to figures shared on the initiative’s website. While every American president establishes his own policies, many programs - including Prosper Africa; AGOA or the African Growth and Opportunity Act; and PEPFAR or the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief – continue beyond the end of presidents’ terms because they have solid bipartisan support in Congress. No matter who’s in power in Washington, countries need to redefine what they want and how they want to work with the new administration, Rwandan economic analyst Teddy Kaberuka told VOA. And while Trump’s America First policy may suggest more focus on America, some emerging economies in Africa still can benefit, he said. 'Because, if he’s focused on boosting domestic production, obviously, the U.S. will import a lot of raw material from all over the world and most likely in Africa, being in minerals, being in agriculture,' he said. Kaberuka said the Ukraine war has hurt African economies, especially the grain supply disruption it caused, triggering a shortage of about 30 million metric tons of grain in Africa in the first year of the war alone, according to the Atlantic Council, a policy research organization based in Washington. He said Trump didn’t engage in wars during his first term and complimented the president-elect for publicly stating he aimed to help end to the Ukraine war shortly after he takes office. 'As an African and someone who has that overview of the global economy, of the African economy, the war we are facing, the consequences, I would say that people like me are excited because from the experience, [during] the Trump administration, there were less wars,' said Kaberuka. In the Sahel, a region recently plagued by coups, the U.S. closed two military bases and withdrew from Niger last year at the request of a junta that staged a coup the prior year. Their presence, U.S. officials said, was to help the region’s counterterrorism efforts. Analyst Rida Lyammouri, who’s done field work in the Sahel/Lake Chad Basin, is a senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South, a Moroccan-based policy research firm in Washington. 'We are increasingly seeing this narrative, this perception that is changing, toward the West, accusing the West of being one of the problems why Africa has not seen significant ... economic development. The priority for the Trump administration is to find ways to … keep a positive image toward the U.S. and avoid what is currently happening, for example, to France in Francophone Africa,' he said. Lyammouri said he doesn’t think the Sahel will be a priority for this new administration but if that was to be, what happened in Niger should be a lesson. 'It’s … a message to the U.S. going forward not to take things for granted. I think Niger has been a reliable partner in the region, but this decision shows that it doesn't mean it’s guaranteed that the partnership is going to be forever,' he said. Trump will take the oath of office January 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-weigh-in-on-what-2nd-trump-term-means-for-africa/7939026.html	2025-01-16T06:30:03-08:00

Bezos' Blue Origin reaches orbit in first New Glenn launch, misses booster landing	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — Blue Origin's giant New Glenn rocket blasted off from Florida early Thursday morning on its first mission to space, an inaugural step into Earth's orbit for Jeff Bezos' space company as it aims to rival SpaceX in the satellite launch business. Thirty stories tall with a reusable first stage, New Glenn launched around 2 a.m. ET (0700 GMT) from Blue Origin's launchpad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, its seven engines thundering for miles under cloudy skies on its second liftoff attempt this week. Hundreds of employees at the company's Kent, Washington headquarters and its Cape Canaveral, Florida rocket factory roared in applause as Blue Origin VP Ariane Cornell announced the rocket's second stage made it to orbit, achieving a long-awaited milestone. 'We hit our key, critical, number-one objective, we got to orbit safely,' Cornell said on a company live stream. 'And y'all we did it on our first go.' The rocket's reusable first stage booster was due to land on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean after separating from its second stage, but failed to make that landing, Cornell confirmed. Telemetry from the booster blacked out minutes after liftoff. 'We did in fact lose the booster,' Cornell said. The culmination of a decade-long, multi-billion-dollar development journey, the mission marks Blue Origin's first trek to Earth's orbit in the 25 years since Bezos founded the company. Bezos told Reuters on Sunday, before Blue Origin's first launch attempt, that he was most nervous about landing the booster. But he added that sticking the landing would be the 'icing on the cake' if they could achieve the milestone of getting the payload to its intended orbit. Secured inside New Glenn's payload bay for the mission is the first prototype of Blue Origin's Blue Ring vehicle, a maneuverable spacecraft the company plans to sell to the Pentagon and commercial customers for national security and satellite servicing missions. The rocket's first attempt to launch on Monday was scrubbed around 3 a.m. ET because ice had accumulated on a propellant line. On Thursday, the company cited no issues ahead of launch. Bezos monitored the launch from a few miles away in Blue Origin's mission control room, wearing a large headset and flanked by dozens of launch staff. The company's CEO, Dave Limp, was next to him. New Glenn is expected to press ahead with a backlog of dozens of missions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, including up to 27 launches for Amazon's Kuiper satellite internet network that will rival SpaceX's Starlink service. New Glenn is the latest U.S. rocket to debut in recent years as governments and private companies beef up their space programs and race to challenge Elon Musk's SpaceX and its workhorse Falcon 9. NASA's giant Space Launch System rocket had a successful debut in 2022, as did the Vulcan rocket last year from United Launch Alliance, Boeing and Lockheed Martin's joint launch venture. New Glenn is roughly twice as powerful as Falcon 9, the world's most active rocket, with a payload bay diameter two times larger to fit bigger batches of satellites. Blue Origin has not disclosed the rocket's launch pricing. Falcon 9 starts at around $62 million. The development of New Glenn has spanned three Blue Origin CEOs and faced numerous delays as SpaceX grew into an industry juggernaut. SpaceX's giant, next-generation Starship rocket in development, which New Glenn will also compete with, is expected to further rattle the industry with cheap rides to space and full reusability. Bezos in late 2023 moved to speed things up at Blue Origin, prioritizing the development of New Glenn and its BE-4 engines. He named Limp, an Amazon veteran, as CEO, who employees say introduced a sense of urgency to compete with SpaceX.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bezos-blue-origin-reaches-orbit-in-first-new-glenn-launch-misses-booster-landing/7938901.html	2025-01-16T04:29:34-08:00	
Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan out of danger after stabbing at Mumbai home	MUMBAI — Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was stabbed repeatedly by an intruder at his home in Mumbai on Thursday, but doctors treating him said he was out of danger after surgery. Khan, 54, was 'on the path to complete recovery' after receiving stab wounds on his spine, neck and hand, the doctors told reporters. 'He sustained a major injury to the thoracic spinal chord due to a lodged knife in the spine. Surgery was performed to remove the knife and also repair the leaking spinal fluid,' said Nitin Dange, one of the doctors operating on Khan. Khan was attacked just after midnight when he tried to stop the intruder, believed to be a burglar, from entering his apartment in the upscale neighborhood of Bandra, police and local media said. A female employee at the apartment was also attacked and was being treated, police said. Among the country's most bankable stars, Khan, 54, is the son of India's former cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and actress Sharmila Tagore. He is married to actor Kareena Kapoor, and his daughter from a previous marriage, Sara, is also a Bollywood actor. Police had identified the perpetrator and had launched a search for him, senior police official Dikshit Gedam told reporters. 'The accused attempted to enter through a fire escape. It appears to be a robbery attempt,' he said. Khan, who has featured in more than 70 films and television series, is a regular on the red carpet. He and Kapoor have two young sons and are one of Bollywood's most well-known couples. Khan has acted in several notable films and series, including Sacred Games, Netflix's first Indian production, which released in 2018. Film stars and opposition leaders called for police to beef up security measures in the city. 'If such high-profile people with ... security can be attacked in their homes, what could happen to common citizens?' Clyde Crasto, spokesperson of the Nationalist Congress Party, asked on X. India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies won November elections in the western state of Maharashtra, the capital of which is Mumbai. Actor and filmmaker Pooja Bhatt also called for a greater police presence in the suburb home to many in the film industry. 'The city, and especially the queen of the suburbs, have never felt so unsafe before,' she said on X, using a popular description for the trendy Bandra area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bollywood-star-saif-ali-khan-out-of-danger-after-stabbing-at-mumbai-home/7938896.html	2025-01-16T04:16:43-08:00	
Congo court sentences Chinese nationals to 7 years in prison in illegal mining crackdown	UVIRA, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO — A court in the Democratic Republic of Congo has sentenced three Chinese nationals to seven years in prison for engaging in activities related to illegal mining. The court, in Congo’s eastern city of Bukavu, the capital of Congo’s gold-rich South Kivu province, sentenced the men late Tuesday for the illegal purchase and possession of minerals, money laundering and other offenses. The suspects were found in possession of $400,000 in cash and a substantial amount of gold on Sunday, raising concerns about the scale of their operations and the potential involvement of organized networks. Speaking to reporters on Monday, the governor of South Kivu province, Jean Jacque Purusi, said people there are tired of those who plunder the country's resources. 'This is only one-tenth of what they have already taken from us. We will not let it go. This is the wealth of the people of South Kivu. We are determined to go all the way because enough is enough,' Purusi said. Jean Paul Kasinga a local official, told VOA that it was unusual for someone to be moving around with that much money. 'They didn’t have any official document allowing them to work and without government knowledge.' Etienne Mutware, a lecturer at the Evangelical University in Africa in Panzi, Bukavu, said that illegal mining activities rob the local community of potential revenue. 'Partnerships are meant to bring mutual benefits like infrastructure, schools, and development. However, fraud, corruption, and illegal mining in the Congo have thwarted these expectations, resulting in a significant loss for both the population and the nation,' Mutware told VOA. Purusi halted mineral mining in July to curb illegal mining and ensure that mining operations are conducted in a regulated and sustainable manner. In December religious groups and civil society members in South Kivu’s Mwenga territory took to the streets, voicing their concerns over the activities of Chinese mining companies. Protesters demanded infrastructure development and accountability from foreign companies. 'These Chinese companies in (the towns of) Lugusha, Kitutu, Kaboke, Suguru, and Mitobo have failed to fulfill their promises. They promised to build schools, bridges, roads, hospitals, and a stadium, and to provide scholarships for our students. But they have done nothing,' one protester told VOA’s Central Africa Service. This story originated in VOA's Central Africa Service. Some information also came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congo-court-sentences-chinese-nationals-to-7-years-in-prison-in-illegal-mining-crackdown/7938876.html	2025-01-16T03:51:25-08:00	
Indian space agency achieves satellite docking milestone	BENGALURU — India became the world's fourth nation on Thursday to achieve the feat of space docking, a technological milestone that underscores its ambitions to expand its share of a rapidly growing $400-billion global space market. Target and Chaser, two satellites of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) that are each roughly the size of a large refrigerator, successfully latched onto each other Thursday morning, an agency spokesperson said. The indigenous technology, crucial for satellite servicing, space station operations, and interplanetary missions, positions India for a key role in commercial and exploratory space efforts. 'India has ambitious missions planned and to achieve those, this is an important technology,' astrophysicist Jayant Murthy said. 'Various missions, like building a space station, need assembly in space, which is not possible without space docking.' ISRO said the two satellites participating in its Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX), will now be controlled as a single object, with power transfer checks made in the next few days. The mission had been postponed twice, first because the docking process needed further validation through ground simulations, and then to resolve an issue stemming from excess drift between the satellites. SpaDeX, launched on Dec. 30 from India's main spaceport, deployed the satellites in orbit with an Indian-made rocket. Among 24 payloads and experiments were eight cowpea seeds, sent to space to study plant growth in microgravity conditions, which germinated within four days of the mission's launch. Scientists say this is a critical step demonstrating that food can eventually be grown in space during long missions. The mission also will demonstrate the transfer of electric power between docked spacecraft, key to applications such as in-space robotics, composite spacecraft control and payload operations after undocking. Such techniques are essential for missions requiring multiple rocket launches. Space exploration and commercialization is a key part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to position India as a global superpower. The successful SpaDeX mission 'is a significant stepping stone for India's ambitious space missions in the years to come,' Modi said on X. On Thursday, India approved the setting-up of a third launch pad in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, to be completed in four years at a cost of $461 million, giving a further boost to its space plans. ISRO is focused on deep-space exploration and enabling private companies to commercialize the sector, with projects ranging from solar studies to orbital astronaut missions and planetary defense, in collaboration with NASA. With the global commercial space market expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, India aims to grow its share to $44 billion by 2040, up from $8 billion, or a slice of just 2%, now.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-space-agency-achieves-satellite-docking-milestone/7938864.html	2025-01-16T03:32:25-08:00	
Cyprus says US decree on security affirms island's stabilizing role in region	NICOSIA, Cyprus — Cyprus on Thursday hailed a U.S. memorandum allowing military sales, including arms, to the island as a milestone affirming recognition of the island as a pillar of stability in the east Mediterranean region which has been fraught with conflict. U.S. President Joe Biden boosted security ties with Cyprus on Wednesday by issuing a memorandum that makes the island eligible to receive American defense articles, military sales and training. Cyprus has over the years played a key role in evacuating people out of conflict zones and established a maritime corridor for aid to war-ravaged Gaza last year. 'This (memorandum) is a clear recognition of the Republic of Cyprus as a pillar of stability and security in the Eastern Mediterranean, with the potential to further contribute to peace and the management of humanitarian challenges,' the Cypriot presidency said in a statement. The foreign ministry of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot administration in northern Cyprus said the U.S. decision showed Cyprus' internationally recognized Greek government would 'continue its arms race as if it were preparing for war.' 'We call on the countries that support the warmongering of the Greek Cypriot side to act by calculating the consequences of these actions and to be sensible,' the statement said, adding it would keep taking steps with Turkey to protect the security of its citizens. Cyprus was close to Russia for decades, but there has been a marked shift in allegiances in recent years. Many in Cyprus have drawn parallels between Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Turkey's invasion of Cyprus in 1974, and EU-member Cyprus has followed its peers in adopting sanctions on Moscow. It is now getting FBI expertise in countering illicit finance. The U.S. embassy in Nicosia said access to U.S. programs would enable greater interoperability to respond to regional humanitarian crises, counter malign influence, and combat terrorism and transnational organized crime. The deepening in ties between the U.S. and Cyprus has been closely followed by Turkey, which in September criticized the pair's signing of a roadmap to boost defense co-operation. The 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus followed a brief Greek-inspired coup after years of sporadic violence between Greek and Turkish Cypriots that had led to the collapse of a power-sharing administration in 1963.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyprus-says-us-decree-on-security-affirms-island-s-stabilizing-role-in-region/7938840.html	2025-01-16T02:53:26-08:00	
China reports problems at 5 reservoirs in Tibet after earthquake	BEIJING — Chinese authorities in Tibet have detected problems, including cracks, at five out of 14 hydropower dams that they have inspected since a magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked the southwest region last week, an emergency official said Thursday. Of the five affected dams, three have since been emptied, the Tibet emergency management official told a news conference. In the county of Tingri, the quake's epicenter, the walls of one hydrodam have tilted, prompting the evacuation of about 1,500 people from six villages downstream to higher ground, he said. At another hydrodam, monitoring devices have been installed as it is being drained. The earthquake, which has killed at least 126 people and injured hundreds, was a reminder of the risks from a hydropower-building spree by China and India in one of the world's most remote, quake-prone regions. Earthquakes have damaged dams in the past, particularly by setting off landslides and rockfalls. A massive earthquake in Nepal in 2015 shuttered almost a fifth of its hydropower for more than a year. The Jan. 7 quake in Tibet, the fifth-deadliest in China since the 2008 Sichuan temblor, destroyed more than 3,600 houses and damaged religious structures, with aftershocks of up to 5.0 in magnitude still shaking the area. Southwestern parts of China, Nepal and northern India are often hit by earthquakes caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Tingri, which sits atop the zone where the Indian plate pushes under Tibet, is particularly vulnerable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-reports-problems-at-5-reservoirs-in-tibet-after-earthquake/7938832.html	2025-01-16T02:48:11-08:00	
US experts question reason for probe of loudspeaker broadcasts into North Korea	A move by South Korean opposition leaders to launch an independent probe of embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol over Seoul’s use of loudspeaker broadcasts into North Korea is raising questions among some U.S. experts about the future direction of Seoul’s approach toward Pyongyang. Yoon, who was impeached and suspended from his duties last month for imposing emergency martial law on his unsuspecting country, was arrested Wednesday after a weeks-long standoff with investigators at the presidential compound. Yoon, the first sitting president of South Korea to be under criminal investigation, faces a trial at the country’s Constitutional Court, which has the final say on whether he should be completely removed from his presidential responsibilities. The country’s opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in parliament, and other smaller opposition parties introduced a revised bill last week to launch a special counsel investigation into Yoon’s alleged insurrection attempt during his short-lived declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, 2024. The revised bill accuses Yoon of blasting loudspeaker broadcasts toward North Korea and sending propaganda leaflets to Pyongyang. They were cited as cases of provoking aggression from outside the country. The South Korean Defense Ministry rejected the opposition’s allegations that the country’s military activities, including the use of loudspeakers, are intended to provoke North Korea. 'Our military has deterred North Korea’s provocations through a consistent policy toward North Korea while maintaining firm military readiness,' the ministry said Monday in a statement, adding that some people are 'distorting the normal activities of our military.' VOA Korean sought comment from the U.S. State Department on the latest controversy over South Korea’s information campaigns toward North Korea but did not receive a response. However, a State Department spokesman said in an email on June 10, 2024, to VOA Korean that the United States supports the North Korean people’s right to access information from outside. 'We continue to promote the free flow of information into, out of, and within the DPRK [North Korea],' the spokesperson said, a day after the South Korean military resumed loudspeaker broadcasts on the inter-Korean border for the first time in six years in response to North Korea’s trash balloon offensive. 'It is critical for the people of North Korea to have access to independent information not controlled by the DPRK regime,' the spokesperson said. Gittipong Paruchabutr, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told VOA Korean by phone Wednesday that loudspeaker broadcasts are 'a low-risk, effective tool' for communicating with North Koreans. 'Absolutely, it’s a critical capability. It’s a low-risk capability that when we want to communicate to North Koreans, not just soldiers, but anybody within audio range. And I say low risk because it doesn’t really put Korean soldiers’ lives at risk,' Paruchabutr, who also served as chief of psychological operations for U.S. Forces Korea, said. Paruchabutr added that in the past, South Korean loudspeaker broadcasts usually played K-pop songs and rebroadcasts of South Korean domestic news that included social topics promoting human rights, rather than information that 'directly criticize North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his family.' Controversy over accusation Sydney Seiler, former national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council, pointed out that the allegations that Yoon provoked North Korea’s aggression is a political claim that ignores the threats North Korea is posing to South Korea. 'The accusation that these are treason is ludicrous, nothing short of ludicrous,' Seiler said Tuesday by phone. 'This is a democratically elected government taking seriously its responsibilities for the national security of the Republic of Korea. This is not treason. This is just political maneuvering on the opposition parties’ part,' Seiler said, using the official name to refer to South Korea. David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said the opposition parties’ assertion stokes concerns of 'an extreme naivete about the strategy of the Kim family regime.' 'This is really troubling. They are sending the message that they do not think South Korea should be sending information into North Korea. That’s fundamentally what they’re talking about,' Maxwell, a former U.S. Special Forces colonel, told VOA Korean by phone on Tuesday. Others shared more cautious views, saying more details are needed before determining whether Yoon’s policy decisions were legitimate or not. Evans Revere, a former acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, highlighted the need for an investigation. 'The idea of propaganda balloons going into North Korea. The idea of loudspeakers blasting music and news and propaganda into North Korea — that’s been going on for many years, and it hasn't been regarded by most people as an attempt to instigate a conflict or a confrontation,' Revere told VOA Korean by phone on Tuesday. 'But now, the opposition is using that as one of the charges against [Yoon], and it needs to be looked into. It needs to be investigated,' Revere said. 'The question that’s probably weighing on the minds of a lot of policymakers in the United States right now is the question of whether there was some effort on the part of the Yoon administration to provoke a confrontation with North Korea. That’s a very serious charge,' he added. Meanwhile, Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, said South Korea’s Democratic Party’s criticism of the information warfare reflects its thinking on policy toward North Korea. 'The main impact will be that if a Democratic Party government came in as a result of a special election, the Democratic Party would indeed have very different foreign security policies, would be much more conciliatory, if not concessionary, towards China and North Korea,' Klingner said Tuesday by phone. VOA’s Sangjin Cho contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-experts-question-reason-for-probe-of-loudspeaker-broadcasts-into-north-korea/7938830.html	2025-01-16T02:34:36-08:00	
Netanyahu accuses Hamas of backtracking on Gaza ceasefire deal	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of backtracking on parts of a Gaza ceasefire deal Thursday and said his Cabinet would not meet to give necessary approval to the agreement until the militant group accepts all of the elements. A statement from Netanyahu’s office said Hamas was trying to 'extort last minute concessions.' The multiphase ceasefire, announced Wednesday after months of negotiations, was due to go into effect Sunday if fully approved. Palestinian medics said Israeli forces carried out multiple deadly airstrikes Thursday in the Gaza Strip. U.N. agencies said they were ready to surge humanitarian aid into Gaza, where the United Nations says at least 1.9 million of the 2.3 million population have been displaced and 92% of housing units have been destroyed. Israeli President Isaac Herzog offered his strong support for the ceasefire after the deal was announced Wednesday. 'As the President of the State of Israel, I say in the clearest terms: This is the right move,' he said. 'This is an important move. This is a necessary move. There is no greater moral, human, Jewish, or Israeli obligation than to bring our sons and daughters back to us — whether to recover at home, or to be laid to rest.' But one of the main opponents of the deal in the government, minister of finance Bezalel Smotrich, called it 'a bad and dangerous deal for the national security of the State of Israel.' The first phase of the agreement includes a 42-day ceasefire, the release of 33 hostages from Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israel, a phased Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and an increased flow of aid for Palestinian civilians. During the first phase, there will be negotiations on the details of a second phase focused on bringing a permanent end to the conflict with the release of the remaining hostages and a full Israeli withdrawal. A final phase concerns rebuilding Gaza, with a new governing and security structure. The war in Gaza began when Hamas sent its fighters into Israel in a stunning Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed more than 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 people. Of those hostages, just under 100 are thought to remain in Hamas custody and a third are believed to be dead. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Gazan authorities say more than 46,700 Palestinians – most of them children and women – have been killed in Israeli military operations. In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which includes the families of 98 hostages, said Wednesday they welcomed 'with overwhelming joy and relief the agreement to bring our loved ones home.' 'However, deep anxiety and concerns accompany us regarding the possibility that the agreement might not be fully implemented, leaving hostages behind,' the statement continued. 'We urgently call for swift arrangements to ensure all phases of the deal are carried out.' A senior Biden administration official told reporters that two of the living American hostages – Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen – will be among the first hostages released. The official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, as customary in such briefings. 'Fighting in Gaza will stop, and soon the hostages return home to their families,' U.S. President Joe Biden said as he announced the ceasefire deal Wednesday at the White House. Biden urged his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, to implement the agreement, as Biden prepares to hand over power on Jan. 20. Trump said, on his social media network, that he was 'thrilled' and that his administration would build upon the success of this deal to expand U.S.-mediated Abraham Accords to normalize Arab-Israeli relations. 'This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,' he wrote on Truth Social. Analysts say Trump’s fiery threats last week – of 'all hell' breaking loose unless there was a deal before his inauguration – may have played a role. 'President-elect Trump has been very, very clear, he said he would unleash hell on Hamas if the hostages weren't released,' said Mirette Mabrouk, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'I mean, really, there isn't very much more hell that you could unleash on the current inhabitants of Gaza. They're already in hell, but there's also the feeling that he must have placed some pressure on [Israeli] Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu as well. And this is why we are now moving forward.' What about the day after? Some analysts looking to the proverbial 'day after' expressed doubt the next administration can reach the big goal, which is the U.S.’s vocal longtime support of a two-state solution. 'I don't see it under the Trump administration and that's not squarely a criticism of the Trump administration or anyone else,' said Jonathan Ruhe, director of foreign policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America. 'I think both the Israelis and Palestinians are so far off on making the sort of the hard agreements necessary to achieve a two-state solution – I don't think there's the political will on either the Israeli or Palestinian side.' But as Biden and Qatar’s prime minister laid out in explaining the newly inked agreements, the deal is complex enough. Biden on Wednesday also emphasized how arduous the negotiations have been, and he used that point to underscore his administration's strong support for Israel, which has provoked tension between the U.S. and its closest allies. 'This is one of the toughest negotiations I've ever experienced,' the president said. 'And it reached this point because of the pressure that Israel built on Hamas backed by the United States.'

Britain announces Ukraine pact with military collaboration	Britain announced Thursday a treaty with Ukraine that includes military collaboration, science and technology partnerships, and an effort to track stolen Ukrainian grain. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is visiting Kyiv to sign the pact with Ukrainian leaders. Starmer is also announcing a new round of lethal military aid for Ukrainian forces, his office said. 'This is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come,' Starmer said in a statement. Starmer said Russian President Vladimir Putin has failed to 'wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners,' and instead has left Ukraine and its allies 'closer than ever.' The agreement includes cooperation on maritime security in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to deter Russian aggression, Starmer’s office said. Outside of military collaboration, the two countries will work together on agricultural technology, healthcare and space issues. Aerial attacks Ukraine’s military said Thursday that Russian drone attacks caused damage at a farm in the Chernihiv region, while debris from drones destroyed by Ukrainian air defenses damaged houses in Kharkiv and Poltava. Chernihiv Governor Vyacheslav Chaus said on Telegram the farm damage included a hangar used to store corn, and that there were no casualties from the attack. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram his region was targeted by Russian drones, missiles and heavy artillery, killing one person, injuring another and damaging about three dozen homes. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 34 of the 55 total drones Russia launched overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday its air defenses destroyed 27 Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod, Voronezh, Tambov and Kursk regions. Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said on Telegram that a Ukrainian drone attack caused a fire at an oil depot, but no casualties.

Reports say Israel seeks to retain security control of Gaza after ceasefire	The ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas allows Israeli forces to remain in parts of Gaza until all Israeli hostages are released. Linda Gradstein reports for VOA from Jerusalem. Camera: Ricki Rosen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/reports-say-israel-seeks-to-retain-security-control-of-gaza-after-ceasefire-/7938808.html	2025-01-16T01:37:48-08:00	
Israeli Cabinet to vote on Gaza ceasefire deal	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s Cabinet was expected to vote Thursday on a ceasefire deal with Hamas, while Palestinian medics said Israeli forces carried out multiple deadly airstrikes in the Gaza Strip. If the multiphase ceasefire gets final approval, it is set to go into effect Sunday, halting more than 15 months of war. U.N. agencies said they were ready to surge humanitarian aid into Gaza, where the United Nations says at least 1.9 million of the 2.3 million population have been displaced and 92% of housing units have been destroyed. Israeli President Isaac Herzog offered his strong support for the ceasefire after the deal was announced Wednesday. 'As the President of the State of Israel, I say in the clearest terms: This is the right move,' he said. 'This is an important move. This is a necessary move. There is no greater moral, human, Jewish, or Israeli obligation than to bring our sons and daughters back to us — whether to recover at home, or to be laid to rest.' But one of the main opponents of the deal in the government, minister of finance Bezalel Smotrich, called it 'a bad and dangerous deal for the national security of the State of Israel.' The first phase of the agreement includes a 42-day ceasefire, the release of 33 hostages from Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israel, a phased Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and an increased flow of aid for Palestinian civilians. During the first phase, there will be negotiations on the details of a second phase focused on bringing a permanent end to the conflict with the release of the remaining hostages and a full Israeli withdrawal. A final phase concerns rebuilding Gaza, with a new governing and security structure. The war in Gaza began when Hamas sent its fighters into Israel in a stunning Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed more than 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 people. Of those hostages, just under 100 are thought to remain in Hamas custody and a third are believed to be dead. Gazan authorities say more than 46,700 Palestinians – most of them children and women – have been killed in Israeli military operations. In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which includes the families of 98 hostages, said Wednesday they welcomed 'with overwhelming joy and relief the agreement to bring our loved ones home.' 'However, deep anxiety and concerns accompany us regarding the possibility that the agreement might not be fully implemented, leaving hostages behind,' the statement continued. 'We urgently call for swift arrangements to ensure all phases of the deal are carried out.' A senior Biden administration official told reporters that two of the living American hostages – Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen – will be among the first hostages released. The official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, as customary in such briefings. 'Fighting in Gaza will stop, and soon the hostages return home to their families,' U.S. President Joe Biden said as he announced the ceasefire deal Wednesday at the White House. Biden urged his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, to implement the agreement, as Biden prepares to hand over power on Jan. 20. Trump said, on his social media network, that he was 'thrilled' and that his administration would build upon the success of this deal to expand U.S.-mediated Abraham Accords to normalize Arab-Israeli relations. 'This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,' he wrote on Truth Social. Analysts say Trump’s fiery threats last week – of 'all hell' breaking loose unless there was a deal before his inauguration – may have played a role. 'President-elect Trump has been very, very clear, he said he would unleash hell on Hamas if the hostages weren't released,' said Mirette Mabrouk, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'I mean, really, there isn't very much more hell that you could unleash on the current inhabitants of Gaza. They're already in hell, but there's also the feeling that he must have placed some pressure on [Israeli] Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu as well. And this is why we are now moving forward.' What about the day after? Some analysts looking to the proverbial 'day after' expressed doubt the next administration can reach the big goal, which is the U.S.’s vocal longtime support of a two-state solution. 'I don't see it under the Trump administration and that's not squarely a criticism of the Trump administration or anyone else,' said Jonathan Ruhe, director of foreign policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America. 'I think both the Israelis and Palestinians are so far off on making the sort of the hard agreements necessary to achieve a two-state solution – I don't think there's the political will on either the Israeli or Palestinian side.' But as Biden and Qatar’s prime minister laid out in explaining the newly inked agreements, the deal is complex enough. Biden on Wednesday also emphasized how arduous the negotiations have been, and he used that point to underscore his administration's strong support for Israel, which has provoked tension between the U.S. and its closest allies. 'This is one of the toughest negotiations I've ever experienced,' the president said. 'And it reached this point because of the pressure that Israel built on Hamas backed by the United States.'

Dry, windy weather to ease as firefighters battle LA wildfires	Southern California firefighters made some progress in containing two major wildfires, while forecasters said weather conditions in the coming days could bring welcome relief from the days of dry air and high winds that have plagued the region. The relief will give firefighters a key window to battle the Palisades Fire on the west edge of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in the foothills east of the city before another potential turn to dangerous conditions next week. 'Good news: We are expecting a much-needed break from the fire weather concerns to close this week,' the National Weather Service said Wednesday. 'Bad News: Next week is a concern. While confident that we will NOT see a repeat of last week, dangerous fire weather conditions are expected.' The Palisades Fire was 21% contained late Wednesday after burning 96 square kilometers, according to the California Department of Foresty and Fire Protection. The agency said the Eaton Fire was 45% contained and had burned 57 square kilometers. More than 82,000 people were under evacuation orders, while 8,500 firefighters from the United States, Canada and Mexico were battling the two fires and several smaller ones in the region. The fires have killed at least 25 people and burned 12,000 homes and other structures, according to authorities. The wildfires ignited Jan. 7, fueled by strong Santa Ana winds in a region that has been largely without rain for eight months. Weather forecasts show little to no chance of rain in the next week. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dry-windy-weather-to-ease-as-firefighters-battle-la-wildfires/7938763.html	2025-01-15T22:00:02-08:00	
Billionaires and foreign dignitaries to attend Trump’s inauguration	Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, will be among several billionaires attending Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration. Tesla CEO Musk was instrumental in Trump’s reelection with his contribution of over a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump’s campaign coffers, according to Forbes. Musk is set to head Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur. Reports say that Musk is slated to be seated at the inauguration with fellow billionaires Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. While it is not customary to invite foreign leaders, Trump has invited several. Argentinian President Javier Milei is expected to attend, according to Bloomberg. Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after he won November’s election. Trump has also invited Chinese President Xi Jinping who is sending an envoy. Far-right Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has also received an invitation, but she has said she is not sure her schedule will allow her to attend. It is customary for all the living presidents to attend the inauguration. Outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will attend Monday’s ceremony. When Biden was sworn in four years ago, following Trump’s losing reelection bid, Trump did not attend because he held on to the belief that he had won the election. Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton will also attend Trump’s inauguration. Bush and Clinton are set to be there with their wives, Laura Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 'Former first lady Michelle Obama will not attend the upcoming inauguration,' the Office of Barack and Michelle Obama said in a statement. It will be the second time in recent weeks, following her absence at President Jimmy Carter’s funeral, that she has not attended a public ceremony with other former presidents and their wives. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, second gentleman Douglas Emhoff, are also expected to be at the ceremony Monday. Harris was the Democratic candidate in last year’s presidential election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/billionaires-and-foreign-dignitaries-to-attend-trump-s-inauguration/7938759.html	2025-01-15T21:43:54-08:00

Cuba begins freeing prisoners after US says it will lift terror designation	HAVANA — Cuba started releasing some prisoners Wednesday as part of talks with the Vatican, a day after President Joe Biden's administration announced his intent to lift the U.S. designation of the island nation as a state sponsor of terrorism. More than a dozen people who were convicted of different crimes — and some of them were arrested after taking part in historic 2021 protests — were released during the day, according to Cuban civil groups following the cases of detainees in the island. Among those freed was tattooist Reyna Yacnara Barreto Batista, 24, who was detained in the 2021 protests and convicted to four years in prison for attacks and public disorder. She was released from a prison in the province of Camagüey and told The Associated Press that eight men were freed along with her. On Tuesday, the Biden administration said it notified Congress of its intent to lift the designation of Cuba as part of a deal facilitated by the Vatican. Cuban authorities would release some of them before Biden's administration ends on Jan. 20, officials said. Hours later, the Cuban foreign ministry said the government informed Pope Francis it would gradually release 553 convicts as authorities explore legal and humanitarian ways to make it happen. Havana did not link the prisoners' release to the U.S. decision on lifting the designation but said it was 'in the spirit of the Ordinary Jubilee of the year 2025 declared by His Holiness,' referring to the Vatican's once-every-25-year tradition of a Jubilee, in which the Catholic faithful make pilgrimages to Rome. The Cuban Observatory of Human Rights, one of the civil groups, said that by 4 p.m. EST, 18 people had been released, including Barreto Batista. 'At three in the morning they knocked,' Barreto Batista told the AP over the phone. 'I was sleeping (in the cell) and they told me to gather all my things, that I was free.' She said that she and the eight men were warned it was not a pardon or a forgiveness and that they had to be on good behavior or they could be sent back to prison. 'I am at home with my mother,' she said. 'The whole family is celebrating.' In July 2021, thousands of Cubans took to the streets to protest widespread power outages and shortages amid a severe economic crisis. The government's crackdown on the demonstrators, which included arrests and detentions, sparked international criticism, while Cuban officials blamed U.S. sanctions and a media campaign for the unrest. In November, another Cuban nongovernmental organization, Justice 11J, said that 554 people remained in custody in connection with the protests. Biden's intention to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism is likely to be reversed as early as next week after President-elect Donald Trump takes office and Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio assumes the position of America's top diplomat. Rubio, whose family left Cuba in the 1950s before the communist revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, has long been a proponent of sanctions on the communist island.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cuba-begins-freeing-prisoners-after-us-says-it-will-lift-terror-designation-/7938700.html	2025-01-15T18:34:04-08:00

House speaker removes chairman of House Intelligence Committee	WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday removed the Republican chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee, who was a vocal supporter of assistance for Ukraine and held other views that put him at odds with President-elect Donald Trump. Johnson told reporters late Wednesday that Representative Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, would no longer lead the committee, which oversees the nation's intelligence agencies and holds tremendous influence over law enforcement and foreign policy. Johnson last year also gave two Trump allies highly sought spots on the panel. Johnson said he made the decision to remove Turner because the 'intelligence community and everything related to (the committee) needs a fresh start.' The Republican speaker, who has aligned himself closely with Trump, said he would soon announce the new chairperson for the committee. Johnson went on to praise Turner and say he would play an important role in working with NATO. Turner's stances on foreign policy had run afoul of the incoming president, who will take the White House next week with a vision of reshaping the federal government's intelligence and law enforcement capabilities. Turner last year also pushed back on Trump's false claims that Haitian migrants in his Ohio district were eating pets. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/house-speaker-removes-chairman-of-house-intelligence-committee/7938675.html	2025-01-15T17:44:22-08:00

Gaza ceasefire deal to pave way for Israeli hostage release, return of displaced Palestinians	Jerusalem — The prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, announced that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire deal that promised the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas and the return of hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to their homes. The ceasefire deal was reached after mediation by Qatar and Egypt. U.S. President Joe Biden welcomed the deal. 'The deal is structured in three phases. Phase one will last six weeks. It includes a full and complete ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the populated areas of Gaza, and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas, including women and elderly and the wounded. And I'm proud to say Americans will be part of that hostage release in phase one as well.' On the streets of Gaza, Palestinians celebrated the ceasefire, which will end the fighting for 42 days, see the release of dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and provide more humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza who have been suffering a humanitarian crisis. The Palestinians in Gaza have paid the heaviest price for the war with Israel, which began almost 16 months ago when Hamas militants attacked Israel. The Hamas-run Health Ministry says Israel has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians since then. Moatasem al-Namrouti, a resident of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza, welcomed the ceasefire. 'We have been waiting for this joyful moment,' he said. 'We have been at war for a long time.' In a televised address, acting Hamas leader Khalil al Hayya said that Israel failed to achieve its goals in Gaza. On the streets of Tel Aviv, some also celebrated. The Hostage Family Forum called it a significant step forward that brings closer the return of all those held captive. However, they said in a statement, they also have deep anxiety and concern regarding the possibility the agreement might not be fully implemented, and hostages would be left behind. Demonstrator Nofar Honigman said she was cautiously optimistic. 'We really hope that no one will mess it up, not on our side, not on their side. And we really wait for this very, very needed thing to happen, for the war to stop, for the hostages to come home.' The Israeli government is expected to approve the deal on Thursday, and it will take effect on Sunday. Israeli press reports say that on Sunday, the first three hostages are to be released. Hamas has refused to say how many of the 33 women, children and elderly who are to be freed in the first stage of the deal, are still alive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-ceasefire-deal-to-pave-way-for-israeli-hostage-release-return-of-displaced-palestinians/7938639.html	2025-01-15T16:25:08-08:00

Trump's pick to lead CIA promises more focus, firmer posture	WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CIA signaled substantial changes are in store for America’s premier spy agency, telling lawmakers that it must be more aggressive both in collecting intelligence and pushing back against Washington’s adversaries. John Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump’s first term, told the Senate Intelligence Committee during his confirmation hearing Wednesday that the CIA’s human intelligence collection capability 'isn’t where it needs to be.' 'We will collect intelligence, especially human intelligence, in every corner of the globe no matter how dark or difficult,' Ratcliffe said of his plans for the spy agency, should he be confirmed. 'We will conduct covert actions at the direction of the president, going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do,' he added. Ratcliffe promised the CIA would deliver insights and information free of personal and political bias, and said that if confirmed, he would hold accountable employees and analysts who fail to perform up to standard and eliminate programs that shift focus from the CIA’s key responsibilities. 'If you have a politically motivated, bureaucratically imposed social justice agenda that takes up part of your attention, that can distract from the core mission of collecting human intelligence that matter and providing it to you in a timely way,' he said. 'To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,' Ratcliffe said. 'If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.' Republican approval Ratcliffe’s comments were met with approval from Senate Intelligence Committee Republicans, who praised his experience and his plans to refocus the CIA. 'The CIA needs to get back to its roots,' said committee chairman Tom Cotton. 'Stealing secrets.' 'The nation needs a strong, capable and aggressive CIA,' Cotton said, calling Ratcliffe the right man for the job. 'I believe the men and women you will lead want to serve in just that kind of agency. They joined the CIA after all, not a church choir or a therapy session,' he added. Democrats on the committee were, at times, more skeptical, asking Ratcliffe for assurances that officers and analysts will not be subjected to political loyalty tests. 'Mr. Ratcliffe today is your opportunity to reassure the men and women of the CIA that they [need] not fear reprisal for speaking truth to power — the most critical role of the IC [intelligence community],' said Democrat Mark Warner, the committee’s vice chair. 'I need your commitment that you will not fire or force out CIA employees because of their perceived political views, and that you will not ask these employees to place loyalty to a political figure above loyalty to country,' he said. Ratcliffe responded, assuring lawmakers that he would not oversee a purge of the agency. CIA role 'If you look at my record, and my record as DNI, that never took place,' Ratcliffe said. 'That's not something anyone has alleged and something I would ever do.' Other lawmakers raised concerns about Trump’s history of mistrust of the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, fueled in part by U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia sought to intervene in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Trump win. 'It seems to me you have an initial task that's a little unusual but also very important, and that is to restore the confidence of the president-elect in the intelligence community,' said Senator Angus King, an independent. 'You need to get him to a place where he does have confidence in the judgments that are coming to him,' King added. Ratcliffe said that was likely why he was chosen to lead the CIA. 'I think one of the reasons I have this opportunity for you all to consider me for confirmation is because President Trump knows and wants me to lead with integrity,' he told the committee. Still, some former U.S. intelligence officials have taken a dim view of Ratcliffe’s qualifications to lead the spy agency despite his time as the nation’s top intelligence official. Lingering doubts 'As DNI, Ratcliffe repeatedly demonstrated that his first priority was to advance Donald Trump's political interests rather than to function as an apolitical intelligence chief,' said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA officer who now teaches at Georgetown University. As examples, Pillar pointed to Ratcliffe’s decision to release a Russian intelligence assessment that seemed to back Trump’s allegations about nefarious activity by his opponent in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Pillar also noted that Ratcliffe also shunned transparency, refusing to attend Congress’ annual worldwide threats hearing 'because the previous year's assessment reported facts that Trump didn't like.' 'To politicize the role of CIA director in a similar manner is just as damaging to the proper role of intelligence as politicizing the role of DNI,' Pillar told VOA. 'There is no reason to expect Ratcliffe to perform any differently in this respect in the CIA job than he did as DNI.' But other former officials saw Ratcliffe’s performance during the hearing Wednesday as a positive step. 'Ratcliffe performed well and should rightly obtain an easy confirmation,' said Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff and former senior director of the White House Situation Room. 'He said all the right things about the importance of analytic and operational integrity and about the technical challenges facing CIA today,' Pfeiffer told VOA. 'More importantly, he offered assurances he would assiduously avoid and counter politicization of the agency. … This will be reassuring to anyone inside CIA today who is nervous about the incoming Trump administration.' Top threats Ratcliffe told lawmakers the list of threats and challenges facing the United States is long, topped by an ever more aggressive China that is 'committed to dominating the world economically, militarily and technologically.' He also cited threats from transnational criminal organizations and drug cartels, Iran and its proxies, North Korea and multiple terror groups. And he acknowledged the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. 'The Russia-Ukraine war rages on, spreading devastation and increasing the risk of the United States being pulled into a conflict with a nuclear power,' Ratcliffe warned. But he also said that Russia, unlike China, is unable to confront the U.S. across multiple domains at once. Russia 'falls into that category' of 'countries that can't compete with the United States in terms of kinetic firepower across the board,' Ratcliffe said. 'The Russians have to decide where they're going to compete,' he said, noting that Moscow has chosen areas like hypersonic missile technology at the expense of overall troop readiness. Ratcliffe further promised lawmakers he would ensure the CIA seeks answers to the cause of Havana Syndrome — the name given to a series of brain injuries and other serious health ailments that have struck hundreds of U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials. And he voiced support for maintaining controversial U.S. surveillance authorities under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, calling it an indispensable tool, going as far to reject calls to require a warrant before accessing certain communications or data — a view that conflicts with positions previously espoused by other Trump nominees. 'You're going to need to share your experience and your wisdom with the nominees for FBI and director of national security,' Republican Senator John Cornyn told Ratcliffe, 'because we've had these conversations as well, and I think there's some confusion.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-pick-to-lead-cia-promises-more-focus-firmer-posture-/7938361.html	2025-01-15T15:09:08-08:00

Mozambique president sworn in amid tight security, protests	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — Under tight security measures, Mozambique’s new president, Daniel Chapo, was sworn in as the country’s fifth president on Wednesday. Around 2,500 guests, including the presidents of South Africa and Guinea-Bissau, endured intense heat as Chapo took his oath to become Mozambique’s president for the next five years. The ceremony took place as hundreds of demonstrators gathered on streets near the Maputo city hall, saying the election was rigged. Official results showed the 48-year-old winning the October election with about 65% of the votes. However, opposition parties rejected the results, and for close to 10 weeks, Mozambique has endured large street protests as well as a violent crackdown by security forces. Presidential runner-up Venancio Mondlane has been leading the push for protests on social media, demanding what he calls the 'restoration of the electoral truth.' The European Union and some Western countries, including the United States, also have questioned the credibility of the elections. The unrest has left at least 300 people dead, according to local and international human rights organizations. New leader faces challenges Chapo inherits a country ravaged by corruption and deep economic challenges, including high unemployment and frequent job strikes by civil servants such as teachers, nurses and doctors. In his speech Wednesday, Chapo called corruption a disease that has 'corroded the tissue of our state and our people.' 'This has to end,' said the new president. 'There is no place in this government — nor in this country — for anyone who puts his interests above those of the people. We will fight until the end to defend the interests of the Mozambican people in all sectors, public and private.' Chapo, whose Frelimo party has been in power for almost 50 years, promised a leaner government by reducing some ministries and senior government positions. He said that could save more than $260 million, which could be redirected toward improving the lives of people. 'It is just the beginning' Political analyst Evaristo Cumbane said the new president is facing an uphill climb, one that includes pacifying the country and winning the confidence of foreign investors. 'Now, a big challenge he has is how he will deal with this political instability, because taking over the government is not everything, it is just the beginning,' said Cumbane. 'He does not have popular support and his opponent, Venancio Mondlane, believing that their votes were stolen, will continue with their protests until the truth is revealed. So, let's see how he'll handle it. I believe he will invite Venancio to sit with him and that will be the way forward. If they can do that, the country will get back on track.' Fernando Lima, the political editor of the independent weekly Savana, says the only way to end the ongoing protests is for the new president to talk to Mondlane. Mondlane returned to the country last week after almost three months of self-imposed exile. 'He is the one who has the ability to help resolve the political bottlenecks that the country is facing, and is probably the most important political actor in entertaining the dialogue with the government and Frelimo,' said Lima. 'So, things are going to change from that point of view. And he said exactly that upon his arrival, that he is here to entertain the dialogue, it is not here to accept public positions, to receive financial benefits.' Along with the post-election protests, Chapo will have to contend with a jihadist insurgency in the oil- and gas-rich northern province of Cabo Delgado that has killed 6,000 people and left 2 million others internally displaced.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-president-sworn-in-amid-tight-security-protests/7939591.html	2025-01-15T15:00:43-08:00	
Trump's pick for top diplomat calls for ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine	Russia’s nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine has become a 'war of attrition' and a 'stalemate' that must be ended, Senator Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to be secretary of state, told senators at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday. Rubio broke from the passive stance of the administration of outgoing President Joe Biden, which has said it was up to Kyiv to decide under what terms it would be open to peace talks with Moscow. In the meantime, the U.S., along with its European allies, has continued to send billions of dollars of armaments to Ukraine to continue the fight. Rubio instead said the first step in ending the war should be a ceasefire that halts ground fighting, which has for more than a year mostly occurred in eastern Ukraine. However, ongoing fighting is also raging in Russia’s Kursk region, which Ukraine captured in August, even as Moscow has attempted to retake it with the help of North Korean troops. Both countries also target each other daily with aerial strikes, drones and missiles, with thousands of Ukrainian civilians killed in the Russian attacks, along with vast numbers of both countries’ troops. 'This war has to end,' he said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rubio called the destruction in Ukraine 'extraordinary,' saying it will 'take a generation to rebuild.' But even as he argued for a negotiated settlement to end the fighting that started with Russia’s invasion in February 2022, Rubio said it was unlikely that there would be much change in the current battle lines. Russia currently holds about a fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian land mass. 'The truth of the matter is that in this conflict, there is no way Russia takes all of Ukraine,' Rubio said. 'It’s also unrealistic to believe that somehow, a nation the size of Ukraine, no matter how incompetent and no matter how much damage the Russian Federation has suffered as a result of this invasion, there’s no way Ukraine is also going to push these people all the way back to where they were on the eve of the invasion.' Democrats, and some Republicans on the committee, continued to voice their support for more military aid to Ukraine, saying it was important to give Kyiv leverage in any eventual peace talks with Moscow. But Rubio said that one of Ukraine’s key problems was not a shortage of ammunition or money but its inability to train and recruit enough troops. 'The problem that Ukraine is facing is not that they’re running out of money, [it] is that they’re running out of Ukrainians,' he said. Trump has voiced skepticism of continued U.S. military support for Kyiv and repeatedly vowed that he would end the war before he assumed the presidency on Jan. 20. In recent days, his aides have said the new timeline is ending the war in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be by the end of April. On the battlefront, officials in western Ukraine said Wednesday that a Russian missile attack hit critical infrastructure facilities in the Lviv region, part of a series of attacks that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said included more than 40 missiles and 70 drones. Zelenskyy said Russia’s targets included 'gas and energy facilities that sustain normal life for our people,' but that Ukrainian air defenses shot down 30 of the missiles. 'Thanks to our air defense forces and all involved units, we’ve managed to maintain the functionality of our energy system,' Zelenskyy said. 'However, we must continue strengthening the capabilities of Ukraine’s air shield. Promises made by partners at the NATO summit in Washington and within the Ramstein format still remain partially unfulfilled.' Ukraine’s military issued air alerts for regions across the country Wednesday, while the national power grid operator instituted power cuts in six regions. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that Russian forces attacked overnight with drones and missiles, with fragments from destroyed drones damaging two houses. In Dnipropetrovsk, Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that Russian attacks included artillery, drones and missiles that damaged an industrial site. Kirovohrad Governor Andriy Raikovich reported on Telegram what he described as a massive Russian drone attack that damaged several residential buildings. Officials in the Rivne region also said Russian missiles targeted the area overnight. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed two Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod area and another drone over the Tambov region. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that Ukrainian attacks injured one person, while Tambov Governor Yevgeny Pervyshov reported damage to a house.

US imposes export controls on biotech equipment over AI security concerns	On Wednesday the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it would implement new export controls on certain biotechnology equipment, citing national security concerns relating to artificial intelligence and data science. The Commerce Department warned that China could use the biotech equipment’s technology to bolster its military capabilities and help design new weapons using artificial intelligence. The department said the technology has many applications, including its ability to be used for 'human performance enhancement, brain-machine interfaces, biologically inspired synthetic materials and possibly biological weapons.' The sanctions effectively restrict shipments of the technology to countries without a U.S. license, such as China. The controls apply to parameter flow cytometers and certain mass spectrometry equipment, which according to the Commerce Department, can 'generate high-quality, high-content biological data, including that which is suitable for use to facilitate the development of AI and biological design tools.' Last week, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said Beijing 'firmly opposes any country's development, possession or use of biological weapons.' This latest move by the United States follows recent policy decisions that reflect Washington’s broad aim to limit Beijing’s access to U.S. technology and data. Washington announced on Monday that it would tighten Beijing’s access to AI chip and technology exports by implementing new regulations that cap the number of chips that can be exported to certain countries, including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. This month, the ban on popular Chinese-owned social media TikTok is planned to go into effect due to U.S. concerns over its potential to share sensitive data with China’s government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-export-controls-on-biotech-equipment-over-ai-security-concerns/7938147.html	2025-01-15T12:40:07-08:00

US 'TikTok Refugees' migrate to another Chinese app as ban looms	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As TikTok’s Sunday deadline to divest or face a U.S. ban approaches, hundreds of American users of the popular social media video app say they are migrating to another Chinese social media app, Xiaohongshu, or RedNote. Dubbing themselves 'TikTok Refugees,' some say they are making the move in search of a new home; others say their exodus is a form of protest against the ban. With just days to go before the deadline, users are facing growing uncertainty as they wait for a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on whether the ban will be upheld. Reports are now suggesting that TikTok may just shut down its operations in the United States if the ban goes through. 'Our government is out of their mind if they think we are going to stand for this TikTok ban,' said American user Heather Roberts in one video on Xiaohongshu. 'We are just going to a new Chinese app and here we are.' Sky Bynum, an 18-year-old makeup content creator in the eastern state of New Jersey, told VOA that she is joining Xiaohongshu because she wants to find another social media site with a sense of community. 'The best thing about TikTok is the community on there,' Bynum told VOA in a video interview via Zoom. 'When I posted my first few makeup videos, TikTok pushed them to the makeup people and I instantly found my community. I think [the potential ban on TikTok] is awful because I’m not going to have the same thing that I had on TikTok. 'Xiaohongshu is really cool because a lot of TikTok users were trying to find new communities on Xiaohongshu,' Bynum added. Founded in 2013, Xiaohongshu is similar to Instagram and Pinterest. It currently has around 300 million users, most of them in China, and is widely used to share travel tips, makeup tutorials, and fashion trends. The name literally means 'little red book' but the company says it’s not a reference to former Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong’s collection of sayings. Downloads surge With many promoting and talking about their exodus to Xiaohongshu on 'TikTok Refugees,' Xiaohongshu became the most downloaded app on Apple’s U.S. App Store this week. More than 700,000 new users have joined Xiaohongshu this week, according to Reuters. Downloads of the app rose more than 200% year-over-year this week, according to app data research firm Sensor Tower. With more American users expected to join Xiaohongshu, some Chinese users recorded English tutorials or welcome videos for American users. 'I guess [there has] never been a lifetime or history time [that] a platform has Chinese and Americans come together and have direct views. So welcome and we respect you,' Zhou Shu-Fu, a Chinese Xiaohongshu user from the southwestern province of Sichuan, said in a video released on Jan. 15. Compared to Chinese social media users’ enthusiasm, the Chinese government offered a more cautious comment on the influx of American TikTok users to Xiaohongshu, describing the phenomenon as a 'personal choice.' 'China has always supported and encouraged strengthening cultural exchanges and promoting mutual understanding among the peoples of all countries,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during the regular press conference on Wednesday. The influx of American users has also prompted Xiaohongshu to build Chinese-English translation tools and hire English content moderators, according to the Reuters news agency and Chinese media outlets. Most of the posts on the app are in Chinese and RedNote does not have an auto-translate function. Some American users tell VOA that their interactions with Chinese users are helping to increase their curiosity about China. 'My experience on RedNote makes me realize how toxic American social media has gotten and I’m excited to learn some basic Chinese and learn about what it’s really like in China,' Kia Epley, a 44-year-old engineer from Las Vegas, told VOA in a video interview. TikTok content creators say they are looking for more than just a safe and welcoming community. One key concern for them is how they can keep making a living on social media. 'Most of my income is made on TikTok so if the ban comes into effect, a big chunk of my income will get taken away,' said Essence Whitaker, a 28-year-old makeup content producer in Michigan. 'A lot of content creators in the U.S. will be unemployed,' she told VOA in a video interview. VOA reached out to TikTok for comment on the exodus but has yet to receive a response. Tech media The Information reported on Tuesday that TikTok plans to shut the app for American users when the federal ban comes into effect on Sunday, citing anonymous sources with knowledge of the matter. Trend or temporary protest? While the migration of American users to Xiaohongshu continues, some users say it remains unclear whether the exodus is a temporary phenomenon or a long-term trend. TikTok has more than 170 million users and so far, less than a million have moved over to Xiaohongshu. 'I don’t think the move to Xiaohongshu is going to be long-term because the biggest thing that creators worry about is monetization. Xiaohongshu doesn’t have that feature so I think other creators are still looking for an alternative to TikTok,' Bynum in New Jersey told VOA. But others say similarities between TikTok and Xiaohongshu may help convince some American users to stay on the Chinese app. 'I like how real TikTok is because you get to see people’s natural reactions,' said Whitaker in Michigan, adding that Xiaohongshu has that same vibe. 'While I can’t tell whether people are going to stay on the app or not, I think the authenticity of the content will keep some users on there,' she told VOA in a video interview. While many American users are excited about the prospect of Xiaohongshu being an alternative to TikTok, some analysts describe the mass migration as 'going from the frying pan into the fire.' 'TikTok is owned by a Chinese company but it has international operations, which means there are theoretically several layers between TikTok and the Chinese Party-State,' said Bethany Allen, the head of China Investigations and Analysis at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. But 'there are no layers of insulation between Xiaohongshu and Beijing,' she told VOA by phone, adding that issues such as political censorship or lack of data privacy protection could be 'far worse' on Xiaohongshu than TikTok. American users 'are going to have absolutely no power to pressure Xiaohongshu as a company to do anything,' Allen added. VOA has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment but has yet to receive a response. And despite the friendly interactions between Chinese and American users on Xiaohongshu over the last few days, experts said the 'honeymoon period' may not last long. 'I think the Chinese government is probably going to get spooked [by the interaction between American users and Chinese users],' Sarah Cook, an independent China analyst, told VOA by phone. She added that Beijing could impose a temporary shutdown on Xiaohongshu to implement some moderation or initiate 'a mass cleanout' of accounts or content deemed inappropriate or sensitive on the app. VOA’s Katherine Michaelson contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-tiktok-refugees-migrate-to-another-chinese-app-as-ban-looms/7938164.html	2025-01-15T12:28:21-08:00	
White House says Biden leaving Ukraine in strongest position possible	While U.S. President Joe Biden views his response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a cornerstone of his foreign policy legacy, critics argue he missed a historic opportunity to help Ukraine win the war. Michael Carpenter, director for Europe at the National Security Council, spoke with VOA, defending the administration’s policies on Ukraine, stating they were undeterred by Russia’s nuclear threats, and attributing Ukraine’s lack of success in regaining lost territories to manpower shortages. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: Is President Biden leaving Ukraine in the strongest position possible? Michael Carpenter, Senior Director for Europe at the National Security Council: He is. Look, the United States has given Ukraine every capability militarily that they have asked for. We have secured through painstaking diplomacy with our G7 partners a $50 billion loan. We have lifted all restrictions on rules of engagement for our military systems, for our weapons that we have provided to Ukraine. And we have worked with the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian leadership to devise a strategy for them to be able to defend themselves and ideally negotiate from a position of strength where they can achieve their aims to maintain a sovereign, independent, democratic Ukraine. That's always been our goal and it remains our goal. I fail to mention the sanctions and the costs that we have levied on the Russian Federation. Unprecedented sanctions in the energy sector and in the financial sector over the course of the last three months. So were handing things off, I think, on very good terms. VOA: Does it mean that Ukraine, in your view, is ready to enter any possible negotiations with Russia next year from the position of strength? Carpenter: Well, look, I think it's very important that Ukraine's leaders, that President Zelensky in particular, decide when he wants to negotiate with the Russians. And what I will say is, at this point in time, I do not assess the President Putin wants to enter into a negotiation on good faith on anything other than the terms for the capitulation of Ukraine. So Ukraine has to decide when it feels that it is empowered to enter into this negotiation. And it'll be up to the next administration to hold the Russians’ feet to the fire and ensure that they have the appropriate leverage to ensure that this is not a sellout of Ukraine's sovereignty, but that this is a negotiation that leads to a just, durable, lasting peace, that preserves Ukraine as a sovereign, democratic, independent state. VOA: But is Ukraine in the strongest possible position for that? Because that was one of the goals. Carpenter: It is, under the circumstances. Look, war is messy. War involves all kinds of suffering. And Ukraine has certainly suffered over the course of the more than 1000 days of Russia's brutal aggression against it. At the end of the day, Russia has occupied parts of Ukraine that I wish had not come to pass. But there are also realities in this war. And one of those realities has to do with manpower on the two sides of the front lines of this battle space. And Ukraine simply has fewer people on the battle space than Russia is able to muster. And that has resulted in the situation that we're in today. I think Ukraine is in a strong position. I think it's in a strong position financially. I think the capabilities that we have given, the investments we've made in things like Ukrainian production of unmanned aerial vehicles, in terms of the capabilities, the armored vehicles that we've provided, the HIMARS systems that have been highly effective, the air defense systems, including the Patriot, all of that has been, I think, incredibly useful for Ukraine. Of course, the situation remains tenuous in certain parts of the Donbass, and that is simply a reality of this war. VOA: You said that the Biden administration achieved its goals towards Ukraine, but wasn't, at some point, the goal a victory of Ukraine? Carpenter: Ideally, Ukraine would have been able to liberate its territory. I think there's still hope that Ukraine can continue to work towards not just defense but also liberating some of its land. But at the end of the day, this boils down to what I said earlier. This is a fundamentally a physics and a math problem in terms of the number of people on both sides of the front lines. And Russia is able to bring more soldiers to bear in this war than Ukraine has been able to. And we can give all the capabilities: from F-16s to Abrams tanks to HIMARS systems, ATACMS missiles, you name it. But without the manpower on the front lines, it's impossible to achieve what you have just outlined, which is complete liberation of all of Ukraine's territory. And so, look, it's up to Ukrainians again to decide when and under what circumstances they want to negotiate. But we have set them up for success, given the capabilities that we have provided, which I just want to remind your viewers, is close to $70 billion in security assistance. That is a significant amount of capability that the United States has provided. VOA: You mentioned the assistance. In December, you assured us that the United States and the Biden administration will use all of that approved funds to provide Ukraine military assistance. But now there is $3.8 billion that this administration is leaving for the next. Why didn't the Biden administration use those funds? And do you have any concern that the next administration might not want to use these funds to support Ukraine? Carpenter: Well, you know, I don't want to get into a complex discussion of the way our budgetary process works, but there is a difference between authorized funds and obligated funds. So we have provided all of the funds that Congress has obligated for Ukraine. That's not all the funds that have been authorized. But it takes coordination between the administration and Congress to be able to move all of that money. We have moved all of it that we had available to us. Yes, the next administration will now have the option to use some of that authorized money to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine. And some of what we have obligated is on contract, or is en route, and will arrive in the coming weeks. But all of that is available to the next administration to continue to support Ukraine. VOA: Before leaving office, Biden’s administration, as you said, imposed major energy sanctions against Russia. Do you think that these measures might be something that pushes Russia economy closer to a collapse and something that can actually stop Russia's war machine? Carpenter: Well, our hope is that this additional pressure, which is extraordinary because we have imposed full blocking sanctions on two of the largest Russian oil companies. Surgutneftegas and Gazprom Neft, together with over 180 vessels from Russia's shadow fleet. We hope that additional cost in position will bring Putin closer to a realistic and durable solution to this conflict when he sits down at the negotiating table eventually, whenever that happens. I think, of course, any type of sanctions that reduce the revenues available to the Russian Federation is less money in the hands of those who fuel Russia's war machine and Russia's aggression against Ukraine. And it provides more space for Ukraine to be able to negotiate from a position of strength. VOA: In his foreign policy speech yesterday, President Biden mentioned as one of his accomplishments that he was able to prevent a direct confrontation between two nuclear powers, the United States and Russia. Many analysts that we're talking to say that fears of nuclear escalation prevented President Biden from helping Ukraine win the war. Why was the United States deterred by Russia's 'red lines,' but not vice versa? Carpenter: Nobody was deterred. The United States provided every capability that Ukraine asked for. It is only logical that as the world's largest nuclear superpower, that the United States has to factor in escalation management. Anyone who says to the contrary is being irresponsible about foreign policy and does not sit in the Oval Office and have to make those weighty decisions. VOA: But does it send a signal that Russia's 'nuclear card' will always beat everything else? Carpenter: No, it does not, because the Ukrainians have done extraordinarily well at certain points on the battlefield. But this fundamentally gets back to what the question you raised earlier, which is manpower. And that's not a variable that the United States controls. VOA: How do you hope the next administration approaches the policy towards Ukraine? And how does President Biden feel about the fact that his legacy towards Ukraine will be largely defined by the policies of the next administration? Carpenter: I'm not going to speak to what the next administration will do or won't do. I will just say that, again, this administration, we have tried to hand off a situation where Russia is both on its back foot, thanks to our sanctions in the energy and financial spheres; [and] Ukraine is in a solid macro financial state thanks to the $50 billion loan that we negotiated together with our G-7 partners, and that Ukraine has the capabilities militarily to be able to continue to maintain the defense of its territory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-says-biden-leaving-ukraine-in-strongest-position-possible/7937892.html	2025-01-15T12:11:27-08:00	
Pakistan welcomes World Bank's $20 billion lending pledge	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan confirmed on Wednesday that the World Bank has pledged to lend $20 billion over the next decade, commencing in 2026 under its Country Partnership Framework, to help address the impoverished country's acute development challenges. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif applauded what he described as the lender's 'first-ever' pledge of its kind, saying the program is intended to develop child nutrition, education, clean energy and climate resilience to boost private sector growth. The Country Partnership Framework 'reflects the World Bank’s confidence in Pakistan’s economic resilience and potential,' Sharif said on the social media platform X. 'We look forward to strengthening our partnership as we align our efforts for creating lasting opportunities for our people.' The cash-strapped South Asian nation has been struggling to tackle serious economic challenges for several years and is currently relying on a $7 billion bailout loan program from the International Monetary Fund. Persistent political instability in Pakistan, rising militant attacks, and devastating flooding in 2022 have further strained the troubled economy. 'Our new decadelong partnership framework for Pakistan represents a long-term anchor for our joint commitment with the government to address some of the most acute development challenges facing the country,' said World Bank Country Director Najy Benhassine. The U.S.-based lender stated that the country's annual commitments under the partnership 'are expected to remain in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion range' from 2026 onward. It added that the loans will depend on available funding and the fulfillment of project requirements. 'The pace of economic growth and structural transformation has been long stunted by distortive policies that benefit only a few, who have historically coalesced to oppose growth-oriented reforms as well as increases in progressive public spending in human capital and basic services for the poorest,' the World Bank partnership documented stated. It added that Pakistan must change its current development model to reduce poverty and achieve shared prosperity on a livable planet. 'We are focused on prioritizing investment and advisory interventions that will help crowd in much-needed private investment in sectors critical for Pakistan’s sustainable growth and job creation,' said Zeeshan Sheikh, International Finance Corporation country manager for Pakistan and Afghanistan. The ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan from power in 2022 and his subsequent imprisonment over contested corruption charges have plunged Pakistan into a political crisis that experts say is hampering government attempts to attract domestic and foreign investments. The World Bank's document highlights that the South Asian nation, home to over 240 million people, ranks among the top 10 countries most affected by climate change and natural disasters worldwide. It noted that climate change will increasingly strain livelihoods, food security, productivity, and growth caused by rising extreme heat, air pollution, and altered water availability and precipitation. 'These risks can significantly compromise development in an already fiscally constrained environment and make sustained progress in poverty reduction and human development even more challenging than it is today,' the World Bank stated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-welcomes-world-bank-s-20-billion-lending-pledge/7938025.html	2025-01-15T11:25:24-08:00	
Southern California faces new fire-spreading wind threats	Hundreds of thousands in Southern California faced new threats of fire-spreading high winds on Wednesday as firefighters continued to fight wildfires that have killed at least 25 people and left nearly 30 missing. A day after firefighters got a reprieve with lighter winds than expected, gusts were hitting up to 56 kilometers per hour on the Pacific coast and 88 kilometers per hour in the mountains before dawn, National Weather Service meteorologist Todd Hall said. 'This is really just the last push of these winds here today,' Hall said. 'Hopefully, if we get through today, we're going to have some better conditions for late week, especially into Friday and Saturday.' The National Weather Service issued a high-level 'particularly dangerous situation' warning through 3 p.m. local time Wednesday and extended a red-flag warning through Thursday for some areas north of the city. 'Please stay on guard for a fast-moving fire,' forecasters said. On Tuesday, weaker-than-expected winds had allowed firefighters to make some progress in containing the two largest blazes, the Palisades and Eaton fires, but they were far from fully controlled. Authorities said that the Palisades blaze was 19% contained and the Eaton fire 45%. But no more homes or major structures were reported burning in the two blazes, although officials said embers could still be lingering unseen and that it could take weeks to fully extinguish them. The wildfires, which ignited on January 7, have displaced more than 100,000 people and left thousands more on edge, wondering whether they could be forced to evacuate their homes and flee for safety on a moment’s notice. More than 82,000 people in Los Angeles County are under evacuation orders, with another 90,400 under evacuation warnings, county Sheriff Robert Luna told reporters. Diminishing winds will likely make it easier for firefighters to gain control of the blazes, though meteorologists have warned the dangerous Santa Ana windstorms may return early next week. Weather forecasts show little to no chance of rain. Utility companies have shut off power to more than 77,000 households to prevent their power lines from sparking new blazes. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour of the affected areas on Monday. 'The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually see it,' Bass said. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southern-california-faces-new-fire-spreading-wind-threats/7938048.html	2025-01-15T10:56:23-08:00	
World Economic Forum will highlight conflict, AI, climate change	GENEVA — More than 3,000 global leaders from upwards of 130 countries will make their annual pilgrimage next week to the World Economic Forum, meeting in the plush Swiss Alpine resort of Davos. Nearly 5,000 Swiss army personnel will be on hand to ensure security for thousands of the world’s top movers and shakers in government, business, technology, civil society, the humanities and art. They will convene between Jan. 20 and 24 to discuss and seek solutions for some of the most pressing issues of the day. Among the decision-makers expected to attend will be President-elect Donald Trump, who will be president of the United States when he makes a virtual appearance later next week at the yearly event. 'The same week as we are opening our annual meeting next week, there also will be an inauguration happening in the largest economy in the world, the United States,' Borge Brende, president and CEO of the WEF, told journalists at a news conference Tuesday. 'So, we are pleased that also the key leaders from the largest economies in the world — the United States, China, and European Union — will be with us in Davos,' he said, noting that Trump 'has joined us physically in Davos before as president' during his first term. 'He will on Thursday afternoon join us digitally, online live in the dialogue with our participants,' he said. 'We think that will be a very special moment also to learn more what the new administration’s policy priorities are.' Since the U.S. is likely to have confirmed a number of Trump’s picks for his Cabinet, he said that toward the end of the week, 'we do expect even additional high-level representation from the Trump administration.' 'So, we are very pleased by that because we know that there is a lot of interest among our participants and the rest of the world to decipher and understand the policies of the new administration,' Brende said. 'So, it will be a very interesting week.' Asked whether multibillionaire Elon Musk might be among those attending the forum, he replied, 'We don’t know. He is, of course, also welcome with Donald Trump when he, hopefully, comes physically also at our next annual meeting.' Brende noted that this year’s forum is taking place at a time of greater global uncertainty than has been seen in a generation. He asserted that geopolitical tensions, economic fragmentation and accelerating climate change demonstrate the critical need for dialogue. 'Within this more unsettled climate, the only way to address urgent challenges and unlock new opportunities is through innovative, cooperative approaches,' he said. Key topics on next week’s forum agenda include the conflicts raging in the Middle East. Special panels will explore the 'terrible humanitarian situation in Gaza,' the future governance and rebuilding of Syria, and concerns about the potential escalation of conflicts in the region, particularly between Israel and Iran. 'I don’t think we are out of the woods yet,' said Brende, noting that a strong Israeli delegation and Iran’s vice president, Mohammad Javar Zarif, will be in Davos. 'So, it should be possible for dialogue, and hopefully we can also find a path forward for peace and reconciliation, and address humanitarian sufferings.' He said the 'forgotten conflict in Sudan that, unfortunately, is also turning into a proxy war' will be debated, as will Myanmar and other areas of instability. 'We know that the war in Ukraine is, unfortunately, continuing with huge humanitarian consequences,' he said, noting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will give a special address at the forum. The overall theme of the annual meeting is 'Collaboration in the intelligent age.' Linked to this is the rapid technological advancements that hold both benefits and risks for society. 'AI, or artificial intelligence, and generative artificial intelligence, or Gen AI, obviously, is front and center of our agenda. It is this super technology, if you will, that interacts with a lot of the other technologies,' said Mirek Dusek, managing director of the WEF. 'Among the host of technologies that we are tracking with the notion of the intelligent age, AI, and particularly Gen AI, over the past few years is a game changer,' he said, underscoring the need for standards to assure the ethical use of that technology. 'We are quite clear-eyed about the opportunities of these technologies, particularly AI, but also quite clear-eyed about what are the risks and how important it is that we deploy those technologies with ethical, societal, and other considerations,' he said. 'There is no intelligent age if there is no healthy planet, and without collaboration, we will not be able to build and address the climate and nature emergency,' warned Gim Huay Neo, managing director of the WEF. 'The climate and nature crisis requires urgent attention and action,' she said, noting that annual global warming reached 1.54 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average last year. 'A lot of the focus of the annual meeting will thus be on what are the issues and the challenges … and in addressing the solutions that can help address the crisis,' she said. Klaus Schwab, founder and chairman of the board of trustees of the WEF, touted the importance of bringing together thousands of decision-makers from governments, business, and civil society at the beginning of the year 'to address the challenges of a world in deep transformation.' 'Despite divergent positions and great uncertainties, the annual meeting 2025 will foster a spirit of cooperation and constructive optimism with the objective of shaping the forthcoming Intelligent Age in a more sustainable and inclusive way,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-economic-forum-will-highlight-conflict-ai-climate-change/7937968.html	2025-01-15T10:19:01-08:00	
UN chief appeals for Gaza ceasefire, hostage deal	UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. secretary-general on Wednesday urged all parties to the Gaza war to finalize a ceasefire and hostage release, as mediators say they are in the final stages of a deal. 'For months, there has been no ceiling to the suffering and no bottom to the horrors,' Antonio Guterres told the U.N. General Assembly of the situation in Gaza during a speech laying out his 2025 United Nations priorities. A deal is expected to see Hamas release the hostages it has held captive since the group’s Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack in Israel. Israeli authorities would in turn release Palestinian prisoners and carry out a phased troop withdrawal from Gaza. The U.N. chief said we are seeing a 'reshaping' of the Middle East region, with uncertain outcomes, pointing to the future of Israel and the Palestinians but also a post-Assad Syria and a changed Iran. 'Throughout the region, we must deny extremists a veto over a peaceful future,' Guterres said of actors across the region. The secretary-general is scheduled to depart Wednesday night for what he is calling a 'solidarity' visit to Lebanon. The country, recovering from a destructive war between Hezbollah and Israel, just filled a lengthy political vacuum, electing a president who appointed a new prime minister. 'A window has opened for a new era of institutional stability, with a state fully able to protect its citizens and a system that would allow the tremendous potential of the Lebanese people to flourish,' he said. 'We will do everything to help keep that window open wide — a window that will allow both Lebanese and Israelis to live in security.' In a wide-ranging speech, Guterres warned that the world is in a period of 'turmoil and grave uncertainty.' He urged the international community to rein in major challenges that threaten to disrupt progress and even 'our very existence.' 'Runaway conflicts. Rampant inequalities. The raging climate crisis and out-of-control technology' are the main dangers to humanity, he said. 'The good news is that we have the plans to tackle these challenges,' he said. 'We don’t need to reinvent the wheel — we need to get the wheel moving.' On Monday, Guterres will face an additional challenge: the start of a second Trump administration in the United States. During Donald Trump’s first term as president, he withdrew hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to the world body, sought to leave the Paris Climate Accord, quit the Iran nuclear deal and pulled the U.S. out of some U.N. agencies and programs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-appeals-for-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-deal/7937897.html	2025-01-15T09:38:18-08:00	
Biden bids farewell with Oval Office address	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden gives his farewell address from the Oval Office Wednesday evening, five days before he ends his term and President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. In a letter released Wednesday morning, Biden reflected on how his administration began in the shadows of COVID-19 and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters intent on overturning the result of the 2020 election that Biden won. 'Four years ago, we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities,' he said in the letter. 'But we came together as Americans, and we braved through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous, and more secure.' The president’s farewell address comes a day after Jack Smith, the special counsel who indicted Trump on charges of illegally trying to cling to power after the 2020 election, released his final report. Smith’s report said that the evidence would have been sufficient to convict the president-elect in a trial, had his 2024 election victory not made it impossible for the prosecution to continue. Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked the special counsel’s work as politically motivated. Biden’s speech follows remarks he made Monday at the U.S. State Department defending his foreign policy record and will be his fifth and final formal address from the Oval Office. In his previous Oval Office address six months ago, Biden explained his decision to step aside and endorse his vice president, Kamala Harris, to run against Trump in the 2024 election. Biden reflected on the 'battle for the soul of America' framework that he campaigned on in 2020 when he won against Trump. 'I ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake,' Biden wrote, arguing that is still the case and that America is an idea based on the belief that 'we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' 'We’ve never fully lived up to this sacred idea, but we’ve never walked away from it either,' he said. 'And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.' Biden’s legacy Biden is leaving office with a 39% approval rating, according to Gallup. He has been using the final weeks of his administration to cement his legacy. Thomas Schwartz, presidential historian from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, said that Biden’s legacy will be affected by how Trump governs in the next four years. 'If Trump ends up being a disaster … either ushering economic chaos, or if there's more world chaos from conflicts, Biden will be remembered more favorably,' he told VOA. 'If Trump really proves to be as dangerous to democratic norms as Biden and the Democrats suggested, then I think he may be seen as very prophetic.' Conversely, by inheriting a strong economy and a winding down of U.S. foreign entanglements, Trump has the potential to become a president in the caliber of Ronald Reagan, Schwartz said. In which case Biden will be noted by historians for his legislative achievements but 'won’t be remembered as fondly.' The White House also released an extensive fact sheet detailing the Biden-Harris administration’s achievements domestically and abroad. The sheet highlighted 'historic' economic progress that added 16.6 million jobs, grew the GDP by 12.6% and raised median household wealth by 37%. It underscored investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and semiconductors through Biden’s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act. The White House argued that through targeted relief and fair taxation, the Biden administration rebuilt a 'stronger, fairer economy,' creating opportunity from the bottom up. On the foreign policy front, the administration insists it is leaving the incoming Trump administration with a 'very strong hand to play.' 'We're leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure,' the president said in his foreign policy address Monday, 'an America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions.' The president again defended his decision to withdraw the U.S. from Afghanistan in 2021. Republicans and some Democrats have criticized the manner with which Biden ended America's longest war as chaotic, costing the lives of 13 service members and dozens of Afghan civilians in a terrorist attack in Kabul. Biden said in the letter it has been 'the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years.' 'Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States,' he added. 'I have given my heart and my soul to our nation. And I have been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people.' Asked about his post-presidency role, Biden last week said, 'I’m not going to be out of sight or out of mind.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-bids-farewell-with-oval-office-address-/7937842.html	2025-01-15T09:18:29-08:00	
US steps up Russia sanctions, placing threat of more sanctions on businesses partnering with Russia	Washington — The U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday that it is expanding the web of sanctions on companies and institutions supporting Russia's war efforts in Ukraine, re-designating about 100 entities for sanctions and placing sanctions on 15 new entities. A senior Treasury Department official said that under the sanctions, any company that does meaningful business with parts of Russia's military industrial complex also would face the risk of penalties. The official insisted on anonymity to preview the announcement on a call with reporters. The official said that removal of the sanctions would require congressional notification. That step could potentially make it harder for the incoming Republican Trump administration to adjust and change sanctions without drawing public scrutiny. The official stressed that there are new sanctions on 15 companies related to Russia and China that have worked together to avoid existing sanctions. Treasury is sanctioning the following Russian companies as being involved in this scheme: Herbarium Office Management, Atlant Torg, Sigma Partners, Tranzaktsii I Raschety, Arctur and Paylink Limited. It's also sanctioning Russian national Andrei Prikhodko, the general director of Herbarium. Additionally, there are sanctions on China-based companies: Anhui Hongsheng International Trade, Qingyuan Fo Feng Leda Supply Chain Service, Heilongjiang Shunsheng Economic and Trade Development, Qingdao Hezhi Business Service, Xinjiang Financial Import and Export, Hangzhou Xianghe Trading, Shaanxi Hongrun Jinhua Trading, Fujian Xinfuwang International Trade, and Jilin Province Shunda Trading Company. Separately, the Keremet Bank in Kyrgyzstan is being sanctioned for coordinating with Russian officials and a U.S. bank to evade sanctions. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, an assault that led to aggressive sanctioning by the U.S. and its allies and efforts by Russia and its partners to get around the financial restrictions. The Democratic Biden administration sees recent changes in the global oil market as making it easier to crack down on Russia's oil revenues without hurting global supplies. The Treasury Department announced last week that it was expanding sanctions against the Russian energy sector for its nearly 3-year-old war in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-steps-up-russia-sanctions-placing-threat-of-more-sanctions-on-businesses-partnering-with-russia-/7937853.html	2025-01-15T08:56:47-08:00	
Chinese men jailed in east Congo over gold bars	BUKAVU, CONGO — Three Chinese nationals have been sentenced to seven years in prison in the Congo's east after being arrested in possession of gold bars and large sums of cash. The court sentenced the men late Tuesday for the illegal purchase and illegal possession of minerals in Bukavu, the capital of the gold-rich South Kivu province. The three men, who presented themselves during the trial as simple traders, were arrested in early January in a car. They were carrying 10 gold bars and $400,000 in cash, all of which was seized. The Bukavu court condemned the men to prison and handed them a fine of $600,000 for 'illegal purchase and possession of mineral substances, lack of transparency, traceability in the exercise of mining activities and money laundering.' The charge of 'illicit exploitation of minerals' was not retained, but they were found guilty of 'illegal stay' in the Congo. Their lawyer did not respond to comment when contacted by AFP. Hundreds of mining companies, most of which are Chinese, extract gold in the resource-rich province without declaring profits and often without valid permits, according to local authorities. Last year the local government declared it was suspending the activities of mining companies that did not comply with Congolese law. At the start of the year several hundred people in Bukavu protested against illegal mining in the region, demanding that the country's riches be used to help local communities. The eastern Congo is abundant with reserves of gold, diamonds and minerals which are widely used in manufacturing mobile phones and electric cars. This mineral wealth is at the heart of conflicts that have plagued the region for 30 years, which intensified at the end of 2021 with the resurgence of the M23 armed group. Kinshasa accuses Rwanda of supporting the M23 and of trying to get its hands on the region's resources.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-men-jailed-in-east-congo-over-gold-bars/7937791.html	2025-01-15T08:26:31-08:00	
France faces big challenges in rebuilding cyclone-hit Mayotte	The French government won praise last month for making good on its promise to rebuild the fire-hit Notre Dame cathedral in just five years. But authorities are facing a rockier time when it comes to rebuilding cyclone-hit Mayotte — France’s impoverished overseas territory off the coast of East Africa. Lawmakers this week began fractious hearings about how to speed up reconstruction of Mayotte, where Cyclone Chido last month killed dozens, injured thousands and flattened thousands of buildings, especially in shantytowns. On Sunday, another tropical storm triggered flooding in the archipelago, underscoring the fallout of extreme weather events that are becoming more intense and frequent with climate change. French Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville announced that there were only a few injuries and no deaths from the latest storm and that it was time to get back to work. Visiting days after Cyclone Chido, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to swiftly rebuild Mayotte. But reconstructing Mayotte has dug up a raft of grievances and triggered hot political debate. The overseas territory — with an official population of about 320,000 — is the poorest and most underdeveloped department of France. Macron and his centrist government are accused of being too slow in delivering aid and water and restoring power after Cyclone Chido. Many of Mayotte’s residents are not French citizens, but rather undocumented immigrants, many from nearby Comoros. Top French ministers are now talking about cracking down on illegal immigration. So is far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whose National Rally party is the most popular in France. During a visit to the territory earlier this month, Le Pen got an enthusiastic welcome from many Mayotte citizens — who largely voted for her during 2022 presidential elections. She blames the government for poor public services like education — and for undercounting the number of migrants there illegally.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-faces-big-challenges-in-rebuilding-cyclone-hit-mayotte/7937756.html	2025-01-15T08:00:05-08:00	
Bondi faces skeptical reception from Democrats at confirmation hearing	WASHINGTON — Pam Bondi, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, will face sharp questioning from Democratic senators at a confirmation hearing Wednesday expected to center on concerns that Trump will look to use the Justice Department's powers to seek retribution against his adversaries. Bondi, a former Florida attorney general who was part of Trump's legal team during his first of two Senate impeachment trials, encounters a skeptical reception from Democrats concerned by her perceived loyalty to Trump. Republicans, by contrast, eagerly welcome her as a course correction to a Justice Department they believe has pursued an overly liberal agenda and unfairly pursued Trump through investigations and a special counsel appointment resulting in two indictments. 'If confirmed, I will work to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice — and each of its components,' Bondi said in her opening remarks. 'Under my watch, the partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end. America must have one tier of justice for all.' She did not elaborate on what she meant by 'one tier of justice.' The Justice Department under outgoing Attorney General Merrick Garland also investigated President Joe Biden over his mishandling of classified information — no charges were filed — and named a special counsel to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, who was charged with tax and gun crimes before being pardoned in December by his father. Democrats such as Senator Richard Durbin are expected to seize on Bondi's yearslong presence in Trump's orbit and her public defense of him on cable news appearances, including one on Fox News Channel last year in which she said: 'The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted — the bad ones. ... The investigators will be investigated.' Bondi has also said members of the so-called deep state were 'hiding in the shadows' during Trump's first term 'but now they have a spotlight on them, and they can all be investigated.' Such comments have raised alarms that the department under Bondi's watch could pursue investigations at Trump's behest. Although longstanding norms dictate that presidents have no role in individual criminal investigations, Trump was known during his first term to call for specific inquiries into adversaries and berated his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for having recused from an investigation into Russian election interference that ultimately shadowed much of his tenure. 'I need to know that you would tell the president no if you're asked to do something that's wrong, illegal or unconstitutional,' Durbin, the panel's top Democrat, told Bondi, noting how she had been his personal lawyer and had echoed his baseless claims that the 2020 election had been stolen. Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the committee, offered a different take, laying out a laundry list of years of grievances against the Justice Department that includes the Russia investigation and, more recently, a Garland-era memo aimed at targeting threats from parents at school board meetings. Bondi, a corporate lobbyist who spent 18 years in the Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office in Florida, was named to the attorney general position after Trump's first pick, former Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, withdrew from consideration during fallout over a federal sex trafficking investigation that ended without charges. Bondi is likely to try to keep the focus of Wednesday's hearing on her own agenda for the department. In her opening statement, she pledged to protect the First Amendment rights of free speech and religion, as well as the Second Amendment right to bear arms, and to reform the federal Bureau of Prisons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bondi-faces-skeptical-reception-from-democrats-at-confirmation-hearing/7937780.html	2025-01-15T07:56:33-08:00	
Austin failed to tell Congress or White House about health problems as required, report says	WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did not inform Congress or the White House as required when he was incapacitated due to treatment for prostate cancer or when complications worsened his condition last year, the Pentagon's watchdog concluded in a highly critical report released Wednesday. The inspector general's report faults Austin for the communications failures early last year in which he kept his hospitalization secret for days, even from President Joe Biden. The inspector general found that his strong desire for privacy likely influenced his staff in deciding not to prod further into his condition. In one example, he directed his staff that if anyone had questions, 'you're more than welcome to ask (me) directly' — likely chilling further inquiry, the report said. Austin did not inform either Congress or the White House of his initial treatment in December 2023 for prostate cancer or tell his staff or the White House of his worsening complications on Jan. 1, 2024, which led him to be taken by ambulance to Walter Reed Army National Military Medical Center. 'No one on Secretary Austin's staff knew the seriousness of his condition, including when his condition became worse and he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) the following day,' the report said. The report, signed by inspector general Robert Storch, comes just four days before Austin leaves the job and President-elect Donald Trump takes office. It provides new details on communications between Austin and members of his staff, but no real bombshells about the stunning lapse. The findings mirror much of the criticism in an internal review done about a month after Austin was admitted to Walter Reed. That internal review, done by Austin's subordinates, largely absolved anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding his hospitalization. And it said flatly there was 'no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.' Although he transferred decision-making authorities to Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks during his initial surgery and then again when he was in intensive care, he did not tell her why and he did not inform the White House. The incident angered the White House and infuriated members of Congress, who called him to Capitol Hill for a hearing, where he faced bipartisan criticism and demands that someone should have been held accountable. Austin himself, in a lengthy press conference after he returned to work, largely took the blame. He told reporters that he never told his staff to keep his surgery and hospitalization secret from the White House, but acknowledged that he should have handled it differently and apologized for keeping Biden and others in the dark. Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early December 2023 and went to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for surgery on Dec. 22. On Jan. 1, 2024, he was taken back to Walter Reed by ambulance after experiencing significant pain and was moved to the intensive care unit the next day. Pentagon officials have acknowledged that public affairs and defense aides were told on Jan. 2 that Austin had been hospitalized, but did not make it public and did not tell the military service leaders or the National Security Council until Jan. 4. Only then did Biden find out. It took four more days before the reason for his hospitalization was disclosed. The internal review blamed privacy restrictions and staff hesitancy for their failure to quickly notify the president and other senior leaders about Austin's hospitalization. And it called for a number of procedural changes to improve communications and avoid similar problems in the future. The changes include better guidelines for the transfer of authorities and better reporting requirements during those incidents. And the White House also made changes in federal guidelines as a result of the incident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austin-failed-to-tell-congress-or-white-house-about-health-problems-as-required-report-says/7937754.html	2025-01-15T07:35:39-08:00

Botswana records grim gender-based violence statistics	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Despite efforts by Botswanan authorities to combat gender-based violence, nearly 100 women were raped and 10 murdered during the late-December festive season, officials said Tuesday. Botswana Police Service Commissioner Dinah Marathe told reporters that 10 of the 25 murders recorded between Dec. 19 and Jan. 2 were related to gender-based violence. During the same period, 93 rapes were reported. Of all reported crimes, she said, 61% were related to gender-based violence. 'What comes out clear is that we are a nation with a culture of violence,' Marathe said. The government introduced laws and policies last year meant to combat gender-based violence, including courts dedicated to dealing with such cases and the establishment of a sex offender registry. Despite the measures, the violence persists. Minister of Youth and Gender Affairs Lesego Chombo called for what she described as a preventative approach. 'In the way we behave with each other, in our personal and professional spaces, we all take this as a priority to ensure that we inculcate a culture that is conducive for mental health and a culture that is conducive for gender equality, so that we can curb this issue,' she said. Local nonprofit Feminists Alliance Botswana argues the government has not done enough to stop the trend. Alliance spokeswoman Thembiso Nhlekisana said women remain vulnerable. 'These figures represent a grim reminder of the pervasive violence that women and girls in our society continue to face,' she said. 'This is not just a statistic; it is a reflection of lives lost, futures stolen and communities broken. These numbers underscore a profound failure in protecting women and girls from violence, despite repeated calls for systemic reforms and stronger preventive measures.' Nhlekisana called for swift prosecution and stiffer penalties for perpetrators of gender-based violence. 'We call on the Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services and the Botswana Police Service to prioritize cases of gender-based violence, ensuring timely investigations, prosecutions and convictions for perpetrators,' she said. A 2023 report by the World Bank said more than 42% of women in east and southern Africa experience physical and sexual violence in their lifetime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-records-grim-gender-based-violence-statistics/7937708.html	2025-01-15T07:12:56-08:00	
Poland's leader accuses Russia of planning acts of terror against 'airlines around the world'	WARSAW, POLAND — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk accused Russia on Wednesday of planning acts of sabotage worldwide that included 'acts of air terror' against airlines. Tusk spoke at a news conference in Warsaw alongside Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy. 'I will not go into details, I can only confirm the validity of fears that Russia was planning acts of air terror, not only against Poland, but against airlines around the world,' Tusk said. The Kremlin has dismissed previous Western claims that Russia sponsored acts of sabotage and attacks in Europe. Western security officials suspect Russian intelligence was behind a plot to put incendiary devices in packages on cargo planes headed to North America, including one that caught fire at a courier hub in Germany and another that ignited in a warehouse in England last year. The pro-European Union government in Warsaw says that Russia is pursuing acts of hybrid war against Poland and other Western countries in retaliation for their support for Poland's neighbor Ukraine in its struggle against Russia's full-scale invasion. The government has accused Russia, and its ally Belarus, of fomenting a migration crisis on the EU's eastern border with Belarus in order to create chaos and division in the EU. Last year, Poland's foreign minister ordered the closure of one of three Russian consulates in the country in response to acts of sabotage, including arson attacks that he said were sponsored by Moscow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-s-leader-accuses-russia-of-planning-acts-of-terror-against-airlines-around-the-world-/7937704.html	2025-01-15T07:12:22-08:00	
WHO says suspected outbreak of Marburg disease kills 8 in remote part of Tanzania	ARUSHA, Tanzania — The World Health Organization said Wednesday an outbreak of suspected Marburg disease has killed eight people in a remote part of northern Tanzania. 'We are aware of 9 cases so far, including 8 people who have died,' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. 'We would expect further cases in coming days as disease surveillance improves.' Like Ebola, the Marburg virus originates in fruit bats and spreads between people through close contact with the bodily fluids of infected individuals or with surfaces, such as contaminated bed sheets. Without treatment, Marburg can be fatal in up to 88% of people who fall ill with the disease. Symptoms include fever, muscle pains, diarrhea, vomiting and in some cases death from extreme blood loss. There is no authorized vaccine or treatment for Marburg. WHO said its risk assessment for the suspected outbreak in Tanzania is high at national and regional levels but low globally. There was no immediate comment from Tanzanian health authorities. An outbreak of Marburg in Rwanda, first reported on Sept. 27, was declared over on Dec. 20. Rwandan officials reported a total of 15 deaths and 66 cases, with the majority of those affected healthcare workers who handled the first patients. An outbreak in 2023 of Marburg in Kagera, which shares a border with Rwanda, killed at least five people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-says-suspected-outbreak-of-marburg-disease-kills-8-in-remote-part-of-tanzania-/7937629.html	2025-01-15T06:00:30-08:00	
Europe mulls seizing Russia’s billions to aid Ukraine	London — Support appears to be growing in the West to fully seize hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Russian assets that were frozen following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, amid speculation that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will try to seek a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv soon after he takes office next week. Nations, including the United States, Canada, Britain, several European Union members states and Japan, froze about $300 billion of assets owned by Russia’s Central Bank after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Some $200 billion of the assets are held in the Euroclear facility in Brussels, with approximately $5 billion frozen in the United States. U.S. media reported Tuesday that outgoing President Joe Biden is making a last-minute push for European allies to fully seize the assets so they can be used as leverage in any future peace negotiations. Some European lawmakers are pushing for the assets to be given to Ukraine, however, to buy weapons and help to rebuild the country. Others fear that seizing the assets would deter investors and destabilize Western currencies. Moscow has said that any seizure of its assets would be illegal and has pledged to retaliate. Ukraine reconstruction Ukraine’s reconstruction costs will reach at least $486 billion over the next decade, according to a February 2024 report by the Ukrainian government, the World Bank Group, the European Commission and the United Nations. Britain holds about $22 billion worth of Russian assets. Lawmakers voted last week in favor of a nonbinding motion to seize the assets and give the money to Kyiv. Member of Parliament Mike Martin, who brought the motion, cited uncertainty over future military aid for Kyiv under Trump. 'We do know that he feels differently about Ukraine. He feels differently about the security of Europe, and he feels differently about Russia. So, if we want to shift the dial on Ukraine, especially in the face of a drawdown or potential drawdown in U.S. support, we need to go further and faster, and we need to seize these $300 billions of frozen assets and send them to Ukraine,' Martin told lawmakers. Geopolitical signals 'It is not just about actions that lead to practical outcomes. It is also about signals that we send to our geopolitical opponents. ... Any potential small amount of financial instability that the G7 countries moving together will create will be miniscule as compared to the financial instability of Ukraine losing this war,' Martin said. The Liberal Democrat MP was among the signatories to a letter to The Times of London newspaper earlier this month calling for concerted European action to seize the assets. It also was signed by senior lawmakers from Germany, Poland, the Baltic countries and Finland. 'Previous loans and emergency funding are not enough — and leave Western taxpayers on the hook. Only using the assets themselves ensures that Russia pays for its crimes,' the letter said. G7 loans G7 nations already are providing Ukraine with $50 billion in loans, using the Russian assets as collateral. Additionally, the interest earned on the frozen assets is being used to fund aid for Kyiv. Any decision by the incoming Trump administration to cut U.S. aid for Kyiv could prompt Europe to seize the Russian assets, said Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis. 'We would have a fear of abandoning Ukraine to Putin's war machine. And honestly, I suspect if it comes to that, the decision would be to give this money to Ukraine.' US weapons Kyiv could pledge to use the assets to purchase American weapons and secure Trump’s support, Kolyandr added. 'It fits nicely into the America First idea. It helps Ukraine to get the arms. It helps Trump to score some victories at home,' he told VOA. There is some opposition in Europe, though, to seizing the assets. European fears 'The reservations are mostly coming from the European Central Bank and the national governments,' Kolyandr said. 'They are afraid that if they seize the Russian assets or practically nationalize them and give it to Ukraine, then it would thwart trust in the euro as a reserve currency — and foreign countries would be pretty afraid of investing their sovereign assets in European stocks, shares, bonds and currency. 'In my view, if a foreign country had any reservations about the safety of its sovereign assets, those reservations should have appeared ... when the assets were frozen,' Kolyandr said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-mulls-seizing-russia-s-billions-to-aid-ukraine-/7937521.html	2025-01-15T05:40:30-08:00	
Europe mulls seizing Russia’s billions to aid Ukraine	Support is growing in the West to seize hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Russian assets that were frozen following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. As Henry Ridgwell reports, European allies fear incoming U.S. President Donald Trump may slash military aid for Kyiv – and some say the Russian assets could make up the shortfall.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-mulls-seizing-russia-s-billions-to-aid-ukraine-/7937576.html	2025-01-15T05:38:14-08:00	
White House says Biden leaving Ukraine in strongest position possible, attributes lack of success to manpower shortages	Michael Carpenter, director for Europe at the National Security Council, spoke with VOA, defending the Biden administration’s policies on Ukraine, stating they were undeterred by Russia’s nuclear threats, and attributing Ukraine’s lack of success in regaining lost territories to manpower shortages.

Rubio vows to place US interests 'above all else' as Trump's top diplomat	Washington — Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is promising to implement President-elect Donald Trump's 'America First' vision as secretary of state, vowing in his confirmation hearing Wednesday that the incoming administration will forge a new path by placing American interests 'above all else.' 'Placing our core national interests above all else is not isolationism,' Rubio will tell the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press. 'It is the commonsense realization that a foreign policy centered on our national interest is not some outdated relic.' 'The postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is now a weapon being used against us,' Rubio says. It's a remarkable opening salvo from Rubio, who was born in Miami to Cuban immigrants, and who, if confirmed, would become the first Latino ever to serve as the nation's top diplomat. The confirmation hearing begins a new chapter in the political career of the 53-year-old Florida Republican, whose relationship with Trump has evolved over the last decade. Once rivals trading schoolyard insults as they campaigned for president in 2016, the two men became close allies as Trump campaigned for another White House term last year. Rubio first came to Washington as part of the 'tea party' wave in 2010 and once advocated for allowing a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. But like other Republicans, Rubio's views on immigration have shifted toward the hardline stance of Trump, who has pledged to aggressively pursue deportations once he takes office on Monday. Unlike many of Trump's Cabinet selections, Rubio is expected to easily win confirmation, notching support not only from Republicans but also Democrats who endorse him as a 'responsible' pick to represent the U.S. abroad. Many expect he will be among the first of Trump's Cabinet picks approved. Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz, who served alongside Rubio on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he has high hopes that the Florida Republican will reject the isolationist approach of other Trump allies. 'I think Marco is a hawk, but he's also an internationalist, and I think the challenge for him will be to maintain the long bipartisan tradition of America being indispensable in world affairs,' the Hawaii lawmaker told AP. 'And there are people in the Trump world who want us to run away from being the leaders of the free world. And I'm hoping that Marco's instincts towards American strength will win the day.' Rubio's approach to foreign affairs is grounded in his years of service on the Foreign Relations committee and the Senate Intelligence panel. In his speeches and writings, he's delivered increasingly stern warnings about growing military and economic threats to the United States, particularly from China, which he says has benefited from a 'global world order' that he characterizes as obsolete. China, Rubio will tell the committee, has 'lied, cheated, hacked, and stolen their way to global superpower status, at our expense.' If confirmed, Rubio will become the leader of U.S. foreign policy — though his role will surely remain secondary to Trump, who relishes the global stage and frequently uses the bully pulpit against America's allies. Even before taking office, Trump has stirred angst in foreign capitals by threatening to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland and suggesting he will pressure Canada to become the nation's 51st state. By winning another term, Trump has won an 'unmistakable mandate from the voters,' Rubio will say. 'They want a strong America. Engaged in the world. But guided by a clear objective, to promote peace abroad, and security and prosperity here at home.' A Biden administration decision to rescind Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism with just days left in office is likely to irk Rubio, who has long supported tough sanctions on the communist-run island. Rubio's office did not respond to multiple queries Tuesday about the senator's reaction to the move, which many believe will almost certainly be reversed by the Trump administration. Secretaries of state have played a key role in formulating the foreign policy of the country since its founding, starting with the first one, Thomas Jefferson, who served in the top Cabinet position under President George Washington. Since then, Jefferson, as well as his 19th century successors James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren and James Buchanan, have all gone on to be elected president. More recent secretaries of state have been less successful in their political ambitions, including John Kerry, who lost the 2004 presidential election to President George W. Bush before becoming the top diplomat, and Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to Trump. The most successful secretaries of state have been known for their closeness to the presidents whom they serve, notably James Baker under George H.W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice under George W. Bush and, to some extent, Clinton under Barack Obama. Like Clinton, Rubio was once a political rival to the president-elect who nominated them. However, the Clinton-Obama relationship during the 2008 Democratic primaries was not nearly as hostile as that between Trump and Rubio in the 2016 GOP primaries, which was marked by name-calling and personal insults. Trump had an acrimonious relationship with his first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. Trump fired him from the position via a social media post less than two years into his term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-vows-to-place-us-interests-above-all-else-as-trump-s-top-diplomat-/7937510.html	2025-01-15T04:21:02-08:00	
India's defense minister cites power rivalry in Indian Ocean region	NEW DELHI — International power rivalry is playing out in the Indian Ocean region, India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday, adding that a strong naval presence in the key trade route was his country's biggest priority. While Singh did not name any country, analysts say that China, which commands the world's largest naval force with more than 370 ships, has been a security concern for India since ties nosedived in 2020 after 24 troops died in clashes along their Himalayan frontier. The UK and the U.S. also have a joint military base in the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. Chinese and Indian troops have pulled back from two face-off points after a deal was struck in October following a series of talks, but India's army chief told reporters this week that 'a degree of standoff' still persists. 'A large part of the world's trade and commerce passes through the Indian Ocean region. Due to geo-strategic reasons, the region is also becoming a part of international power rivalry,' Defense Minister Singh said during the induction of one submarine and two navy ships in the city of Mumbai. He said 95% of India's trade, in terms of volume, is linked to the Indian Ocean region. 'In such a situation, the presence of a strong Indian Navy becomes our biggest priority,' he said. India has sought to counter China as Beijing grows its influence in India's neighborhood through investments and development projects in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. New Delhi plans to build a 175-ship strong naval force by 2035 with an increasing emphasis on using domestically made components, but analysts say the pace of construction is slow as compared to China, which builds almost 14 warships a year, while India constructs just four.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-defense-minister-cites-power-rivalry-in-indian-ocean-region-/7937502.html	2025-01-15T04:04:53-08:00	
India steps up engagement with Taliban	New Delhi — The first high level diplomatic meeting held between India and the Taliban leadership marked a significant step in rebuilding New Delhi’s influence in Afghanistan, according to analysts. They say New Delhi’s growing engagement with the Taliban is prompted by strategic considerations in the Central Asian country that has important implications for its security and is likely to deepen amid growing tensions between the Taliban and Pakistan. In the meeting between Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri and acting Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, held in Dubai last week, India agreed to consider engaging in development projects in Afghanistan 'in the near future' and provide more support to the health sector and refugee rehabilitation. Both sides also discussed boosting trade ties. Calling India a 'significant regional and economic partner,' the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement that 'we want to strengthen political and economic relations with India.' The engagement marked a major shift since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, which was seen as a huge diplomatic setback for India’s two-decade long efforts to build deeper ties with Kabul. 'New Delhi’s approach is a pragmatic one, grounded in the view that isolating the Taliban will make it tougher to achieve its goals in Afghanistan,' Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, told VOA in emailed comments. The Taliban’s return had raised fears in New Delhi that Afghanistan will become a haven for militants from Pakistan who have been at the forefront of a three-decade violent separatist insurgency in Indian Kashmir. But analysts point out that the Taliban leadership has built confidence in New Delhi by not doing anything that goes against India’s security interests. 'They have observed their commitments to not allow anti-India terror activity on their soil quite scrupulously. So the level of engagement has been upgraded steadily,' said Sushant Sareen, senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. 'Afghanistan is seen as the epicenter of the arc of instability in this region and it is critical for India’s interests to be present there.' India’s détente with the Taliban began in 2022 when it started dispatching food and medicine as part of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. In the same year, it reopened its mission in Kabul with a small 'technical team.' The engagement between the two countries likely will gain momentum amid tensions between Kabul and Islamabad over Pakistan’s allegations that the Taliban support militants linked to the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, in carrying out attacks against Pakistani civilians and security forces. 'India’s outreach to the Taliban is certainly easier given Pakistan’s messy ties with the Taliban,' Kugelman said. 'And given the reality of India-Pakistan rivalry, New Delhi likely sees an opportunity to exploit Pakistan’s tensions with the Taliban and pursue closer ties with the Taliban, to gain an upper hand in a longstanding competition between India and Pakistan for influence in Afghanistan.' During last week’s meeting between Misri and Muttaqi, India underlined 'its readiness to respond to the urgent developmental needs of the Afghan people.' Before the Taliban takeover in 2021, India was the largest regional provider of development aid to Kabul and had invested about $3 billion in projects that included schools, roads, dams and hospitals. Many of those projects had stalled after the Taliban takeover. Some could restart, analysts say. 'The Indian goal is to protect the good things India has done over the decades, and renew its developmental activities,' said Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga Institute of Indo Pacific Studies in New Delhi. 'Afghanistan is a very important country for us, so India is interested in engaging the Taliban rather than isolating it, no matter who is in the seat of power. And to achieve stability, there needs to be a modicum of economic development.' Both sides also agreed to promote the use of Iran’s Chabahar port for supporting trade and commercial activities – the port, which India is helping develop, is seen as crucial for both sides. India wants to strengthen connectivity via Afghanistan and Iran to Central Asia which it cannot access directly by land due to Pakistan's refusal of transit rights. For landlocked Afghanistan, which has to rely heavily on Pakistani land routes and seaports to conduct trade, the Chabahar port provides an alternate route. The Taliban also has urged New Delhi to issue visas to Afghan businessmen, patients and students — a process that virtually halted after its takeover because of the closure of Indian consulates, security concerns and because India, like most countries, does not officially recognize the Taliban. But New Delhi will take a calibrated approach toward potential visitors from Afghanistan, according to analyst Sareen. 'India is not ready to open the floodgates for Afghans coming into India. New Delhi will remain cautious, but it will continue to deepen the engagement. Because while India has reservations on some aspects of the Taliban’s policies towards women and its ideology, realism is guiding Indian policy. After all, it cannot pretend that Afghanistan does not exist anymore. We are virtually their next door neighbors,' Sareen said. India’s decision to build ties with the Taliban at a time when countries like Russia and China are strengthening relations with Kabul, is likely to find support in countries like the United States. 'As the U.S. contemplates how to approach the Taliban when it comes to sensitive but pressing issues, from Americans still being held captive in Afghanistan to concerns about Islamic State terrorism, it will likely find it useful that a key US partner has decided to opt for the path of engagement,' Kugelman said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-steps-up-engagement-with-the-taliban-/7937468.html	2025-01-15T03:24:01-08:00	
Negotiators push to finalize Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal	Mediators pushed Wednesday to finalize a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, while Israel’s military reported carrying out airstrikes overnight in northern, central and southern Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces said it struck Hamas targets in Gaza City, Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. U.S. and Qatari officials expressed optimism Tuesday that Israel and Hamas were close to a deal, while cautioning that some details remained to be worked out. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a Washington speech, 'I believe we will get a ceasefire,' but added that it was up to Hamas to give its final assent. 'It's right on the brink. It's closer than it's ever been before.' Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari described the ongoing talks as in the 'final stages' and at the 'closest point' yet to an agreement. Hamas said it was awaiting maps from Israel showing which parts of Gaza it would withdraw its troops from in the initial stages of the ceasefire. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel will not compromise on security and will intervene if it sees a threat from Gaza in the future. The basic parameters of the ceasefire proposal would see the process play out in several stages. Hamas would release hostages it has been holding since the militants carried out their October 2023 attack on Israel, while Israeli authorities would release Palestinian prisoners. Israeli troops would carry out a phased withdrawal from Gaza, and some Palestinians displaced by the conflict would be allowed to return, along with a surge in aid for Palestinian civilians. The United Nations said on Tuesday that it was preparing to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza under the potential ceasefire. But challenges — such as uncertainty surrounding border access and security — remain. Months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have failed to bring a halt to the fighting, but in recent weeks, the effort has gained momentum at a time when the United States is preparing for President-elect Donald Trump to take office January 20 as Biden's four-year term ends. Blinken made a last-minute case Tuesday for a plan for the post-war reconstruction and governance of Gaza. 'We have a responsibility to ensure that the strategic gains of the last 15 months endure and lay the foundation for a better future,' Blinken told the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based policy research organization. 'All too often in the Middle East, we've seen how the shoes of one dictator can be filled by another or give way to conflict and chaos.' Blinken said the plan envisions the Palestinian Authority inviting 'international partners' to create an interim governing authority to run critical services and oversee the territory. Other partners, notably Arab states, would provide forces to ensure security in the short term, he said. That security mission would depend on a pathway to an independent Palestinian state unifying Gaza and the West Bank and would be tasked with creating 'a secure environment for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts and ensuring border security,' Blinken said. Creation of a Palestinian state, which Israel has refused to support, has been a sticking point in the negotiations. Israel launched its assault on Hamas in Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed across its borders on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. Since then, more than 46,600 people have been killed in Gaza, with most of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, although Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants it has killed. Much of Gaza has been laid to waste during the fighting and gripped by a humanitarian crisis, with most of its 2.3 million population displaced, often multiple times. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/negotiators-push-to-finalize-israel-hamas-ceasefire-deal/7937452.html	2025-01-15T02:32:59-08:00	
Indonesia to push social media protections ahead of age-limit law	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesia will impose interim child protection guidelines on social media companies while the government carves out a law to set a minimum age for users of the platforms, a senior communications ministry official said on Wednesday. On Monday, communications minister Meutya Hafid said the government planned to issue a regulation to set a minimum age for social media users, after discussing the proposal to protect children online with President Prabowo Subianto. The plan follows Australia's decision to ban children under 16 from accessing social media, with fines for tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta to TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, if they failed to prevent children from accessing their platforms. 'What the minister means is that the government is headed for the direction of a stronger regulation on age limit, which is through the formation of a law,' Alexander Sabar, a senior official at the communications and digital ministry, told Reuters. In the meantime, the government will issue a regulation for digital platforms, including social media companies, to adhere to child protection guidelines, he said, without providing details. 'The emphasis for the government regulation is child protection — how they are protected from physical, mental, or moral perils,' he said, adding the regulation would not totally limit children's access to social media. Meta and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. Nurmayanti, a 46-year-old mother of three who goes by one name, said she agreed with the plan to curtail social media content, particularly content promoting pornography or discrimination. 'They now can freely open social media so that is concerning to us as parents,' she said, adding the law must be strict and clear. However, Anis Hidayah, a commissioner at Indonesia's main human rights body, said that limiting the internet for children was important but the government must be careful to not curb their right to information. Nearly 50% of children under 12 in tech-savvy Indonesia use the internet with some respondents of that age group using Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, according to a survey by the Indonesia internet service providers' association.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-to-push-social-media-protections-ahead-of-age-limit-law/7937439.html	2025-01-15T01:53:48-08:00	
California firefighters battle wildfires as forecasters warn of dangerous winds	Warnings were in place again Wednesday in the Los Angeles area for the prospect of strong winds combining with dry conditions to spread wildfires as firefighters battled a series of blazes in the region that have already killed at least 25 people. After winds were weaker than expected during the day Tuesday, the National Weather Service said the region was 'not out of the woods yet,' with the potential for a surge in winds through early Wednesday afternoon. Utility companies shut off power to more than 77,000 households to prevent their power lines from sparking new blazes. The winds threatened to undermine incremental gains that firefighters have made in recent days as they try to control two main fires that have been burning since last week, as well as a smaller fire that sparked Monday. The California Department of Foresty and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said the Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles had burned 96 square kilometers and was 18% contained as of early Wednesday. The Eaton Fire in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains on the east side of the city was 35% contained and has burned 57 square kilometers, Cal Fire said. About 88,000 people remained under evacuation orders with another nearly 85,000 being warned they might be ordered to evacuate. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna encouraged people to consider leaving when they get a warning without waiting for an order. He said deputies have had to rescue many people who waited until the last minute after receiving orders. Authorities said nearly 30 people remain missing, and that the death toll was likely to rise as search crews gain access to areas that have already burned. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour of the affected areas on Monday. 'The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually see it,' Bass said. Some information for this report is from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-firefighters-battle-wildfires-as-forecasters-warn-of-dangerous-winds/7937431.html	2025-01-15T01:33:03-08:00	
Russian missile, drone attacks cause damage in multiple Ukrainian regions	Officials in western Ukraine said Wednesday a Russian missile attack hit critical infrastructure facilities in the Lviv region. Lviv Governor Maksym Kozytskyi said the missile strikes took place in two separate areas, and that there were no casualties. Ukraine’s military issued air alerts for regions across the country Wednesday, while the national power grid operator instituted power cuts in six regions. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that Russian forces attacked overnight with drones and missiles, with fragments from destroyed drones damaging two houses. In Dnipropetrovsk, Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that Russian attacks included artillery, drones and missiles that damaged an industrial site. Kirovohrad Governor Andriy Raikovich reported on Telegram what he described as a massive Russian drone attack that damaged several residential buildings. Officials in the Rivne region also said Russian missiles targeted the area overnight. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed two Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod area and another drone over the Tambov region. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that Ukrainian attacks injured one person, while Tambov Governor Yevgeny Pervyshov reported damage to a house.

Japan 'gravely concerned' about maritime tensions escalating, foreign minister says	Manila, Philippines — Japan is gravely concerned about actions in the South China Sea that are raising tensions, and strongly opposes any unilateral attempt to change the status quo, its foreign minister said on Wednesday. Speaking during a visit to the Philippines, Takeshi Iwaya also said Japan would continue to provide development and security assistance to Manila and support for its maritime security, adding that a trilateral mechanism which also includes the United States would be strengthened when a new administration takes over in Washington. Iwaya's visit follows a virtual call between Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden where the three leaders affirmed their 'trilateral arrangement' in deepening economic, security and technology cooperation in the face of growing tensions in the region. The transition to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's administration on Jan. 20 leaves Marcos as the only original leader out of those who established the trilateral initiative in 2024. Under Marcos, security engagements between the Philippines and Japan, two of the closest Asian allies of the U.S., have significantly deepened as both nations address shared maritime concerns over China's increasingly assertive actions in the region. 'Japan strongly opposes any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo by force or build up tension in the region. We strongly ask for easing of tensions,' Iwaya told a joint press conference with his Philippine counterpart in Manila, without mentioning China. China claims much of the South China Sea, a conduit for the bulk of northeast Asia's trade with the rest of the world. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the waterway. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comments on Iwaya's remarks. Japan, which announced in 2023 its biggest military build-up since World War II in a step away from post-war pacifism, does not have any claims to the busy waterway. But it has a separate maritime dispute with China in the East China Sea, where the neighbors have repeatedly faced off. Last year, Japan signed a landmark military pact with the Philippines allowing deployment of forces on each other's soil. Manila also became one of the first recipients of Tokyo's official security assistance, a program aimed at helping boost deterrence capabilities of its partner countries. The Philippines has been embroiled in wrangles at sea with China in the past two years as the two countries face off regularly around disputed features in the South China Sea that fall inside Manila's exclusive economic zone. Both countries have accused each other of encroachment, while the Philippines has condemned Beijing over the presence and conduct of its coast guard fleet. 'I am gravely concerned that actions heightening tension in the South China Sea are repeated. Issue over South China Sea is a legitimate concern for the international community,' Iwaya said. Philippine Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo said his country's relationship with Tokyo was among the most resilient and dynamic in the region. The two ministers discussed the security situation in the East and South China Seas and their work together amid an evolving geopolitical landscape, he said, adding the two remain committed to a regional rules-based order.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-gravely-concerned-about-maritime-tensions-escalating-foreign-minister-says/7937428.html	2025-01-15T01:17:34-08:00

US, Japanese companies send landers on moon missions	Two moon landers built by private U.S. and Japanese companies are on their way to the moon after lifting off early Wednesday on a shared ride aboard a SpaceX rocket. The launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida is the latest in a public-private program that put a spacecraft from Intuitive Machines on the moon last year. Wednesday’s launch included a lander from Japanese space exploration company ispace that is carrying a rover with the capability of collecting lunar dirt and testing potential food and water sources on the moon. The spacecraft is also carrying a small red 'Moonhouse' built by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg. The ispace mission is expected to reach its destination on the moon’s far north in four to five months. The company is making its second attempt at a lunar landing, after a 2023 mission failed in the final stages. Also aboard the rocket heading toward the moon is a lander from U.S. company Firefly Aerospace that is set to carry out 10 experiments for NASA. The planned experiments include gathering dirt and measuring subsurface temperatures. The spacecraft is expected to arrive in about 45 days.

South African rescue operation brings illegal miners, bodies, to surface	Johannesburg — Rescue operations were underway at a gold mine in South Africa’s North West province where hundreds of illegal miners have been underground for months. More than 50 bodies were brought to the surface at the mine, police confirmed on Tuesday, as operations to rescue those still trapped underground continued. More than 100 people were brought up alive. The illegal miners, known in South Africa as 'zama zamas,' or 'those who take a chance,' have been down the unused mine shaft for more than two months, after police launched an operation to crack down on the illegal activity. At first, authorities said the miners were refusing to resurface to avoid arrest, but civil society groups say they are unable to get back to the surface as they are too weak from starvation. A court last week ordered the government to launch a rescue operation, which started Monday. But Mzukisi Jam, an activist who has been involved in rescue operations, said it was too little too late. 'Our volunteers confirmed with us yesterday that there are more than 400 live illegal miners who are still trapped, and our own volunteers confirmed — who went down there — that there are more than 100 dead bodies,' Jam said. Police have not confirmed how many miners, living or dead, remain trapped. But Jam said the tragedy could have been prevented. 'We literally begged the government to say, 'Could you please just save them? Take them and put them to the surface?’ Then, you can further process them in terms of [the] criminality you’re saying they’ve committed.' But the police minister and minister of mineral resources and energy, who visited the rescue site on Tuesday, defended the government’s actions. 'I’ve not changed my views that illegal mining is a criminal activity,' said Gwede Mantashe, mineral resources minister. Mantashe said illegal mining was an 'attack on the economy,' with the illicit precious metal trade estimated at over $3 billion in 2024. 'While there’s a criminal activity, there’s a crime scene. … It should be intensifying the fight against illegal mining,' Mantashe said. But for Zinzi Tom, whose 26-year-old brother is still down the mine, all that matters is that he comes out alive. 'They told us that he’s not in good condition — the guy who was with him was saying that he last saw him two weeks ago. It’s a very sad moment, but one thing that I told myself is that I pray to God to give me strength,' Tom said. 'I have to make sure that he’s OK, and pray to God.' Illegal miners like her brother are forced to eke out a dangerous living underground because of high unemployment, she said. Some are South African, but many others are from neighboring countries like Lesotho and Mozambique. Experts say that while the actual zama zamas taking the risks make little money, the criminal syndicates who run illegal operations are getting rich. The rescue operation is expected to take 10 days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-african-rescue-operation-brings-illegal-miners-bodies-to-surface/7937395.html	2025-01-14T23:09:02-08:00	
After cable damage, Taiwan to step up surveillance of flag of convenience ships	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan will step up the surveillance and management of ships carrying flags of convenience, including boarding them, after a Chinese-linked cargo vessel was suspected of damaging an undersea communications cable, the government said. Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, said a ship owned by a Hong Kong company but registered both in Cameroon and Tanzania, damaged a cable to the north of the island earlier this month, although it says it has not been able to verify the ship's intentions and was unable to board it due to bad weather. The ship's owner has denied involvement, and China's government has said Taiwan was making up accusations before the facts were clear. The incident has particularly alarmed Taiwan given it has repeatedly complained about 'gray zone' Chinese activities around the island, designed to pressure it without direct confrontation, such as balloon overflights and sand dredging. In a report to lawmakers ahead of ministers taking questions in parliament on Thursday, Taiwan's National Security Bureau said it plans to step up surveillance and management of ships carrying so-called flags of convenience, referring to those registered to other countries than their actual owner. Such ships, which previously have been found to misreport information, will be put on a list for priority inspection at ports, it said. If these ships enter within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan's coast and are close to where undersea cables are, the coast guard will be dispatched to board them and investigate, the bureau added. Taiwan will also promote greater international cooperation with the United States and Europe over suspected damage to undersea cables, it said. 'The bureau will continue to exchange intelligence with like-minded countries, collect threat alert information, analyze developing trends in sabotage techniques and false covers, and share prevention and response experience.' It did not give details. Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, has pointed to similarities between what it experienced and damage to undersea cables in the Baltic Sea following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Taiwan's government said Chinese ships flying flags of convenience have 'the mark of evil about them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-cable-damage-taiwan-to-step-up-surveillance-of-flag-of-convenience-ships/7937390.html	2025-01-14T22:05:28-08:00

Why did US exclude India from unrestricted access to AI chips?	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden signed on Tuesday an executive order to boost development of artificial intelligence infrastructure in America. A day earlier, his administration announced sweeping measures to block access to the most advanced semiconductors by China and other adversaries. But the U.S. left India, its strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific, off a list of 18 countries that are allowed unrestricted access to advanced AI chips. Analysts say while a growing technological relationship between the two countries would likely make India eligible in the future to access advanced U.S. AI chips, New Delhi's existing ties with Moscow and the perception of a less robust technology regulatory framework led to its exclusion from the top list. Exclusion not a surprise The Commerce Department's policy framework divides the world into three categories. The first tier includes the U.S. and 18 countries with unrestricted access, followed by a list of more than 100 countries that will be subjected to new caps on advanced semiconductors with individual exemptions. The third tier includes adversaries such as China and Russia that face maximum restrictions. India falls in the second category, along with U.S. allies like Israel and close friends such as Singapore. Bhaskar Chakravorti, the dean of global business at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said that India's relationship with Russia 'puts it outside a super safe category.' India has had close ties with Russia since the Soviet Union supported its desire for independence from Britain. It maintained those ties during the Cold War, when the U.S. sided with India's rival Pakistan. Scott Jones, a non-resident fellow at Washington's Stimson Center think tank, highlighted recent reports that accused a few Indian companies of aiding Russia's war on Ukraine, but stressed that while being excluded is a disappointment, it's 'not a setback for India.' He also pointed to the perception that 'India's ability to control and manage technology is perhaps not as robust as evidenced in some of the 18 countries.' While India may be off the unrestricted list for now, analysts say its growing technological cooperation with the U.S. may shield it from some curbs. Richard Rossow, senior adviser and chair on India and Emerging Asia Economies at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the presence of caveats in the new framework would ensure India's later participation. 'The fact that they have announced that there will be a pathway for some countries to get exemptions that are above what they're going to consider the standard cap, India, I imagine, would be on the short list of countries,' he told VOA. In early January, national security adviser Jake Sullivan traveled to India and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior officials. During the trip, both sides reiterated their commitment to forge a 'strategic technology partnership' and strengthen cooperation under the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), a bilateral mechanism focused on technology partnership. On semiconductors, the U.S. is facilitating investments in India's semiconductor manufacturing and intensifying R&D collaboration. During his trip, Sullivan highlighted the investment of $2.7 billion in India by U.S. chipmaker Micron to create semiconductor packaging facilities, which he hoped would contribute to establishing 'India as a new hub in the global chip ecosystem.' The Indian government too is investing billions of dollars through its dedicated program called the India Semiconductor Mission and Production Linked Incentive scheme. Rossow argued that the Indian government would not have been 'terribly surprised' that 'they were not included' in the list. Jones of the Stimson Center agreed. 'Jake Sullivan was in New Delhi last week, and I would be very surprised if he did not inform his Indian counterparts of what was going to happen,' he said. Ensuring America's leadership in AI The Biden administration has focused on the centrality of artificial intelligence to America's security and economic strength. According to a White House factsheet, the latest steps are part of its effort to prevent offshoring this critical technology and ensure that 'the world's AI runs on American rails.' Since October 2022, the U.S. government has enacted a series of export controls, blocking access of advanced semiconductors to China to prevent its use for military applications. While initially the measures adversely affected the Chinese semiconductor industry, Beijing has continued to advance its capabilities and is attempting to narrow the technology gap. According to Chakravorti of the Fletcher School, there are numerous implementation challenges of this expansive global strategy. 'From lobbying from the U.S. chipmakers that will start as soon as Trump takes office to potential leaks in the carefully calibrated list of countries. Will there be a secondary market? How does this affect where future data centers are built?' he asked. Jones of the Stimson Center argued that the policy is more a 'symbolic gesture than a practical consideration' but has a stern message for the rest of the world. 'The U.S. is clearly saying, if you want to participate in the U.S.-sponsored AI ecosystem, you have to pick now. You pick China or you pick us. You can't have it both ways. You can't play one off against the other. You have to choose,' he concluded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-did-the-us-exclude-india-from-unrestricted-access-to-ai-chips-/7936974.html	2025-01-14T19:57:54-08:00	
US SEC sues Elon Musk over late disclosure of Twitter stake	Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the world's richest person of waiting too long to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social media company he later bought. In a complaint filed in Washington, the SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his initial purchase of 5% of Twitter's common shares. An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days, or by March 24, 2022, in Musk's case, when they cross a 5% ownership threshold. The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk bought more than $500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2% stake. Twitter's share price rose more than 27% following that disclosure, the SEC said. Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and disgorge profits he didn't deserve. Musk eventually purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, in an email called the SEC lawsuit the culmination of the regulator's 'multi-year campaign of harassment' against his client. 'Today's action is an admission by the SEC that they cannot bring an actual case,' he said. 'Mr. Musk has done nothing wrong and everyone sees this sham for what it is.' Spiro added that the lawsuit addresses a mere 'alleged administrative failure to file a single form — an offense that, even if proven, carries a nominal penalty.' Musk, an adviser to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, is worth $417 billion according to Forbes magazine, through businesses such as the electric car maker Tesla and rocket company. He is worth nearly twice as much as Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, the world's second-richest person at $232 billion, Forbes said. The SEC sued Musk six days before Trump's January 20 presidential inauguration. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler is stepping down that day, and Paul Atkins, who Trump nominated to succeed him, is expected to review many of Gensler's rules and enforcement actions. Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure. In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that 'all indications' were that his delay was a mistake. Musk has long feuded with the SEC, including after it sued him in 2018 over his Twitter posts about possibly taking Tesla private and having secured funding to do so. He settled that lawsuit by paying a $20 million civil fine, agreeing to have Tesla lawyers review some Twitter posts in advance, and giving up his role as Tesla's chairman. The SEC also sought sanctions from Musk after he missed court-ordered testimony last September for the Twitter probe so he could attend the launch of SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission at Florida's Cape Canaveral. A federal judge in San Francisco rejected that request, because Musk later testified and agreed to pay the SEC's travel costs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sec-sues-elon-musk-over-late-disclosure-of-twitter-stake/7937332.html	2025-01-14T19:10:57-08:00	
Biden announces 2 new national monuments in California	WASHINGTON — In an announcement postponed by the Los Angeles wildfires, President Joe Biden on Tuesday designated two sites in California as national monuments that will honor Native American tribes while shielding picturesque mountains and deserts from mining and energy development. Biden made the designations at an event at the White House, a week after and on the other side of the country from where he'd originally planned to do so with a speech in California's Eastern Coachella Valley. The president landed in California on January 6 but made it as far as Los Angeles before high winds — which helped spark the Los Angeles blazes — forced officials to scrap the event. It was a stark reminder that, even as Biden uses the last days of his administration to attempt to safeguard the environment, climate change is already helping to exacerbate natural disasters. Instead, Biden spoke next to screens featuring towering peaks, desert vistas and an array of plant and animal life. 'I was hoping we were going to do this in place,' the president said. 'This is as close as we could get.' Biden formally created the Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park, and the Sáttítla Highlands National Monument, in Northern California. The declarations bar oil and natural gas drilling, as well as mining and other exploration and production initiatives, on the 2,400-square-kilometer Chuckwalla site, and roughly 800 square kilometers near the California-Oregon border. The protected area encompasses natural wonders, including the Painted Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and is home to 50-plus rare species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the Chuckwalla lizard, which the monument is named for, the White House said in a statement. At the event, Biden talked about taking his children to national monuments around the country yearly when they were young to 'witness the majesty, the beauty.' 'Our national wonders are the heart and soul of this nation,' he said. 'It's a birthright we pass on from generation to generation.' The monuments becoming realities honor past tribal requests. Many Native American tribes and environmental groups have pushed for designation of the Chuckwalla National Monument, while the Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the Sáttítla Highlands National Monument. Biden joked about being careful not to mispronounce Sáttítla, then still struggled to pronounce it. When he sat down to sign the formal acts, he simply referred to it as the 'highlands' monument, so he didn't have to give it another try. The designations are part of a larger Biden administration effort to conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. They follow Biden's recent move banning new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, including in California. That was an attempt to thwart possible efforts by the incoming Republican administration to expand offshore drilling, but President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to quickly reverse the order.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-announces-2-new-national-monuments-in-california/7937323.html	2025-01-14T18:50:56-08:00	
Exodus continues from Ethiopia earthquake epicenter	AWASH FENTALE, AFAR REGION, ETHIOPIA — A semi-desert plain that lies between two rugged mountains has, for about five months, been the epicenter of volcanic activity in Ethiopia's Afar region. From a distance, it looks serene and peaceful. As you approach, however, you're met with rifts from the strong land vibrations that occur two to three times every week. Smoke billows from a deep hole beneath the ground. Nearby holes spit out hot mud and water. The water smells like sulfuric acid from a kilometer away. The locals call it 'Seganto,' which also means the name of the plant that commonly grows in this small area between the Dofan and Fentale mountains, located in Ethiopia's Afar region. Both mountains have volcanic activity and small lakes on their peaks. Fentale mountain is distinctive, with smoke billowing from the top. Nearly two weeks ago, an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck the region. The vibration from the quake was felt in nearby towns such as Awash Sebat Kilo and Awash Arba, about 220 kilometers from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Many have been displaced so far, and Ado Ali, a resident in Awash Fentale and a mother of four, said it was time to go. 'We heard a big noise from the ground; it sounds like gun salute,' she said. 'Our animals get shocked. We were praying to get out safely.' It was the same story for Hassan Kamil, a Seganto resident who was particularly worried about the potential for a bigger eruption. 'Dofan mountain is the one behind me, and Fentale is the one in front of me; the rift created following the earthquake is now going from Dofan to Fentale mountain,' he said. 'The holes through which the explosion is being seen used to be few; now there are more than 10 in this place in Seganto Kebele alone.' Another resident of Awash Fentale; Ahmed Hisis, said his house was destroyed by volcanic eruptions. 'To this day, the vibration is demolishing homes, creating cracks,' he said. Hisis said he does not feel safe as the vibration is ongoing. Evacuations The explosions in December led to the exodus of the estimated 10,000 community members living in Seganto. Today, Seganto remains empty. Hassan Kamil Konte, a community elder, fled and now lives in a nearby shelter as the community relocates the residents. The earthquake activity has destroyed most local infrastructure. The shock following the ground shaking demolished 37 schools and forced 5,000 students from their classrooms, according to Moussa Adam, deputy head of the Afar National Regional State Education Bureau. A state-run sugar factory with more than 4,000 employees ceased operation as locals fled the area, the local administration said. Last week, the Ethiopian federal government announced plans to evacuate at least 80,000 residents from the spots of the active volcano sites in Afar and the nearby localities of the Oromia and Amhara regions. Officials say the majority of the targeted residents in the most affected Afar region have left the active volcanic sites. 'We have managed to evacuate at least 54,000 people so far, our aim is to relocate the victims from the active volcanic sites, and we are succeeding,' Moussa told VOA. Humanitarian needs Residents are now getting into local internally displaced centers at nearby Awash Arba town and waiting for help from the state and humanitarian agencies. Despite living in the shelter for more than a week, some say they still do not have their basic needs met. Fakir Mohammed is among them. 'The situation is tough as you can see. Many did not get shelters, drinking water is also not adequate,' he told VOA. He said the government is trying to provide resources but the number of the people in need exceeds resources available. Balli Hasan, a mother of three, also said she is happy to have escaped from the active earthquake spot, but as the shelter is not able to protect her children from the sun, the situation in the camp is still a challenge, she said. Officials try to meet needs Moussa, the Afar regional official said the state is trying to fill the need for the people in shelters. 'The Ethiopian Disaster and Risk Management Commission, together with other humanitarian NGOs are providing help. Newcomers may not be able to get food the day they arrive as they have to go through a process of registration, but, we have not encountered human death due to hunger,' Moussa said. The people displaced because of the earthquake said they still do not feel safe because they are not far from the epicenter of the active volcano. Some newly built shelters for the displaced are just 10 kilometers from the epicenter of the recent eruption. But the government said the displaced are being relocated to safer areas following strict review by experts from Samara University. The Ethiopian Disaster and Risk Management Commission said it is working to provide help for the communities affected by the recent active earthquake. According to a statement from the commission, more than $2.2 million (280 million Birr) in food and nonfood items has been dispatched to crisis sites in Afar, and the Oromia and Amhara regions to reach people in need.

South Korean investigators arrest impeached President Yoon	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean authorities arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over insurrection accusations related to his December 3 martial law declaration, investigators said. A motorcade was seen leaving the gates of his hillside residence where Yoon had been holed up for weeks behind barbed wire barriers and a small army of personal security. More than 3,000 police officers and anti-corruption investigators had gathered there before dawn, pushing through throngs of Yoon supporters and members of his ruling People Power Party protesting attempts to detain him. Yoon's lawyers have argued attempts to detain Yoon are illegal and designed to publicly humiliate him. The warrant investigators secured for his arrest is the first ever issued against an incumbent South Korean president. As local news broadcasters reported that Yoon's detention may come soon, some minor scuffles broke out between tearful pro-Yoon protesters and police near the residence, according to a Reuters witness at the scene. Yoon's declaration of martial law stunned South Koreans and plunged one of Asia's most vibrant democracies into an unprecedented period of political turmoil. Lawmakers voted to impeach Yoon on December 14 and remove him from duties. Separately, the Constitutional Court is deliberating over to uphold that impeachment and permanently remove him from office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-investigators-arrest-impeached-president-yoon/7937321.html	2025-01-14T18:21:48-08:00

Biden to lift state sponsor of terrorism designation on Cuba	U.S. President Joe Biden notified Congress on Tuesday that he intends to delist Cuba as a U.S.-designated state sponsor of terrorism in a deal facilitated by the Catholic Church to free political prisoners on the island. Speaking on the condition of anonymity before the announcement, senior administration officials told reporters that dozens of political prisoners and others deemed unjustly detained by U.S. officials would be freed by noon on January 20. The announcement also indicated the U.S. would aim to reduce economic pressure on the island nation. 'Today's actions demonstrate that President Biden's Cuba policy, which is focused on achieving practical results with respect to human rights in Cuba, will pay dividends for the Cuban people,' a senior official told reporters, acknowledging Havana's 'direct dialogue with the Catholic Church.' Hours after Biden's announcement, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said his government would gradually release 553 prisoners after talks with the church. Earlier, his government expressed gratitude. 'Despite its limited scope, this is a decision that points to the right direction and is in line with the sustained and firm demand by the government and the people of Cuba,' the country's foreign ministry said in a press release. 'The decision announced today by the United States, rectifies, in a very limited way, some aspects of a cruel and unjust policy,' it added. In Congress, the backlash to Biden's announcement was swift. 'Today's decision is unacceptable on its merits,' Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement. 'The terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision.' Fellow Republican Representative Carlos Gimenez also criticized the announcement, predicting a quick reversal on the policy by President-elect Donald Trump. 'President Biden is a pathetic coward,' Gimenez posted on X. 'Come January 20th, there will be a NEW SHERIFF in town & President Trump alongside Secretary of State @SenMarcoRubio will not only put #Cuba BACK on the list but PULVERIZE the regime once & for all!' According to The Associated Press, human rights groups and activists, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, have been pressing the Biden administration to lift the designation to ease the suffering of Cuban people who feel the impact of Cuba's economic isolation.

South Korean police raid Yoon's residence in fresh detention effort	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean authorities are making a fresh effort to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, days after he evaded the first attempt to enforce a court-approved warrant with the protection of presidential security and military forces. A team of investigators arrived before dawn Wednesday at the heavily fortified presidential compound in central Seoul. Yoon has been holed up there as he pushes against a government insurrection investigation related to his short-lived declaration of martial law. Reports suggest authorities are prepared to use a much larger force — consisting of about 1,000 police officers — and more forceful tactics to detain Yoon than they did in their previous attempt nearly two weeks ago. According to Yonhap News Agency, authorities are bracing for an operation that could last up to three days and may use loudspeakers for psychological warfare, as well as cranes and tow trucks to remove any barriers. The presidential residence, which lies in a sprawling, hilly compound in the Hannam-dong neighborhood, has been fortified with extra barbed wire fencing and tightly packed buses and other vehicles that block the path to Yoon's residence. Despite the predawn hour and subfreezing temperatures, police estimate that 6,500 Yoon supporters were gathered in the area early Wednesday. For weeks, the large street outside the compound has been filled with protesters — mostly supporters of the embattled conservative president, who has vowed to 'fight to the end.' According to Yonhap, some ruling party lawmakers formed a human chain early Wednesday outside the main entrance of Yoon's residence to prevent his detention. If Yoon is detained, authorities would have 48 hours to decide whether to file for a formal arrest warrant or release him. It would be the first time a sitting South Korean president has been taken into police custody. Yoon was impeached last month following his declaration of martial law. The country's Constitutional Court must uphold his impeachment for him to be removed from office. Separately, Yoon faces a criminal investigation into insurrection and abuse of power but has defied multiple requests to appear for questioning as part of that probe. Yoon's lawyers have slammed the detention effort as politically motivated. They also argue that the court that issued the detention warrant had no jurisdiction to do so, and that the anti-corruption agency leading the investigation has no mandate to investigate the president for insurrection. Earlier this week, South Korea's acting president, Choi Sang-mok, warned against the possibility of clashes between security forces, urging both sides to act in a 'peaceful and restrained manner.' The previous detention attempt on January 3 was suspended after a six-hour standoff, with the detention team citing the risk of violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-police-raid-yoon-s-residence-in-fresh-detention-effort/7936934.html	2025-01-14T14:58:31-08:00	
New Orleans attacker had researched similar rampage, and how to access Bourbon Street balcony	BATON ROUGE — Before plowing a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year's revelers in New Orleans, killing 14 people, the man who carried out the Islamic State group-inspired attack had researched how to access a balcony on the city's famed Bourbon Street and looked up information about a similar recent attack at a Christmas market in Germany, the FBI said. Nearly two weeks after Shamsud-Din Jabbar's rampage, the FBI continues to uncover new information detailing the extensive planning by the 42-year-old Army veteran who scouted out the area multiple times in the months leading up to the attack. Authorities also have been piecing together a timeline of his radicalization. In the early hours of New Year's Day, Jabbar could be seen on video surveillance placing two containers with explosive devices, which would remain undetonated, in the French Quarter. Shortly after, about 3:15 a.m., Jabbar sped a white pickup truck around a police car blockading the entrance of Bourbon Street, where partygoers continued to wander around the street lined with bars. He drove through revelers before crashing and being killed by police in a shootout. Fifty-seven people were injured, authorities said. Just hours before the deadly onslaught, Jabbar had searched online for information about an attack at a busy outdoor Christmas Market in east Germany that occurred just 10 days earlier and where a car was also used as a mass weapon, the FBI said on Tuesday. The attack in Europe left five people dead and more than 200 injured after a car slammed into a crowd. Police arrested a 50-year-old doctor from Saudi Arabia who has renounced Islam and supports the far-right AfD party. In other online searches, Jabbar had looked up how to access a balcony on Bourbon Street, information about Mardi Gras, and several recent shootings in the city, the FBI said. But Jabbar's research ahead of the attack was not limited to online: He also made a one-day visit to New Orleans from Houston on Nov. 10, during which he looked for an apartment, the FBI said. While Jabbar applied to rent the apartment, he later told the landlord that he changed his mind. That was not his only visit to New Orleans, though. The FBI had previously reported that Jabbar had traveled to the city for a planning trip on Oct. 31, when he used glasses from Meta, the parent company of Facebook, to record video as he rode through the French Quarter on a bicycle. In a series of online videos, posted hours before he struck, Jabbar proclaimed support for the Islamic State militant group. The Bourbon Street attack was the deadliest Islamic State-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years. On Tuesday, the FBI continued to draft out a timeline of Jabbar's radicalization, saying that he began isolating himself from society and became a more devout Muslim in 2022. By the spring of 2024, he began following extremist views. While investigations into the attack are ongoing and additional information continues to trickle out about Jabbar's planning of the deadly rampage, city officials face questions about safety concerns. State and local authorities have launched probes into possible security deficiencies that left New Orleans vulnerable. The work is especially urgent since Carnival season, a monthslong celebration that attracts tens of thousands of visitors to the French Quarter, began last week. The city is also set to host the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-attacker-had-researched-similar-rampage-and-how-to-access-bourbon-street-balcony/7936963.html	2025-01-14T14:44:42-08:00	
Rights groups in Kenya blame police for increase in abductions of government critics	NAIROBI, Kenya — Human rights groups in Kenya are blaming police for a recent increase in the abductions of critics who have protested government policies. The activists say at least 29 people are missing after raising concerns about poor governance. Kenyan cartoonist Gideon Kibet said that unknown people trailed him to a bus on his way from a meeting in the capital, Nairobi, in December 2024. He said he was forced into a car by masked assailants, who tore his shirt and used it to cover his eyes and tie his hands. Kibet was eventually released. Kibet has drawn cartoons mocking government figures such as President William Ruto. One caricature, which depicted the president in a coffin, went viral. Kibet’s experience is among 82 cases of abductions and forced disappearances in just six months, according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. Although Kibet and four others have been released, that has not been the case for dozens of others. From September 2023 to August 2024, Kenya saw a 44% increase in abductions compared to the same time period from the previous year, according to the national security report. Officials say there were 52 abductions in Kenya from September 2023 to August 2024, compared to 36 the previous year. Many of the victims are critics of bad governance, say rights groups. ''What we are seeing is essentially the use of extrajudicial power to course fear among those citizens that are legitimately protesting against bad governance or raising concerns with the government,'' said Irungu Houghton, executive director for Amnesty International Kenya. Some Kenyans have taken to social media to protest the government on issues including increases in taxes and corruption. However, at a public event Sunday, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen referred to such critics as criminals. ''If the criminals and people with bad behavior have moved ... to the digital space, I want to tell you that we will follow you there because that is where we want to ensure that there is law and order,'' he said. Kenyan lawyers have petitioned the country’s high court to hold the inspector general of police responsible for the abductions. According to the lawyers, the state is evading accountability. ''Our question has been from July until today, no investigation has been done, no investigation has been cleared, we are not being told the people who are responsible,'' said Gloria Kimani, a member of the Law Society of Kenya. Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja and Director of Criminal Investigations Mohammed Amin are to appear in court Friday regarding the abductions. The two have snubbed three previous court summonses in the abduction cases.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-groups-in-kenya-blame-police-for-increase-in-abductions-of-government-critics/7936898.html	2025-01-14T14:00:31-08:00	
US finalizes rules banning Chinese, Russian smart cars	The White House says it has finalized rules that crack down on Chinese and Russian automobile technology effectively banning all personal smart cars from the two countries from entering the U.S. market. In a White House fact sheet detailing the decision, the Biden administration Tuesday said that while connected vehicles offer advantages, the involvement of foreign adversaries such as China and Russia in their supply chains presents serious risks granting 'malign actors unfettered access to these connected systems and the data they collect.' 'The Department of Commerce has issued a final rule that will prohibit the sale and import of connected vehicle hardware and software systems, as well as completed connected vehicles, from the PRC and Russia,' the fact sheet said. PRC is the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. Connected vehicles are smart cars that are designed to be convenient for consumers and provide safety for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians through the use of many connected parts such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and satellite connectivity. 'Cars today aren't just steel on wheels; they're computers,' said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo when speaking on the rule. 'This is a targeted approach to ensure we keep PRC- and Russian-manufactured technologies off American roads,' said Raimondo. The new rule is the 'culmination of a year-long examination' of potential risks posed by connected vehicles and will 'help the United States defend against the PRC’s cyber espionage and intrusion operations, which continue to pose a significant threat to U.S. critical infrastructure and public safety.' The crackdown on cars follows Washington’s announcement earlier this month that the U.S. consider new rules aimed at addressing risks posed by drones that utilize technology from China and Russia. The U.S. has repeatedly emphasized the need to balance technological progress with the protection of national security interests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-finalizes-rules-banning-chinese-russian-smart-cars/7936903.html	2025-01-14T13:59:13-08:00	
Huge challenges ahead for Lebanon's new leaders, analysts say	Lebanon has a new president and prime minister that many Lebanese and Gulf and Arab countries hope will bring the war-scarred Mediterranean nation out of its economic and political crisis. Lebanon’s new President Joseph Aoun vows to tackle corruption and wants only the national army to hold weapons and protect Lebanon’s borders, moves likely to challenge the Shiite militia Hezbollah and Israel. Many Lebanese see both Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam as being above the political infighting that has paralyzed Lebanon in recent times. Aoun headed Lebanon’s national army for years, winning the respect of citizens and foreign leaders, while Salam is a leading international judge who won parliament’s support. But as analyst Dania Koleilat Khatib, president of the Research Center for Cooperation and Peace Building in Beirut, told VOA, they face a mammoth task ahead fixing the country’s broken financial system and seeing the Hezbollah militia ultimately disarmed. 'Joseph Aoun has a lot of challenges. He raised the bar very high,' Khatib said. 'Returning the money of the depositors, removing the arms. But for him to deliver on his promises, he needs support. Unless Saudi [Arabia] and the UAE (United Arab Emirates) really keep the pressure on the Lebanese political structure, on the deputies, the political parties, he won’t be able to deliver.' Hezbollah’s political wing and other Shiite lawmakers have been accused of stymying necessary economic reforms and justice on issues, such as the disastrous 2020 Beirut port blast. Senior Hezbollah lawmaker Mohammed Raad accused Aoun of trying to exclude the group from power in Lebanon by not allowing their choice of caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati stay in the post. 'Hezbollah is weakened, but they still are there,' Khatib said. 'They still have a political bloc. So, they (Saudi Arabia and the UAE) have to pressure everyone on the political scene to make sure he (Aoun) can do reforms. Reforming means exposing all these guys because they are all involved in the corruption. Will they accept that? It’s a very much uphill battle.' Needed reforms include rooting out corruption from Lebanon’s state institutions, restructuring its public debt and overhauling the banking system to unlock financial aid from the International Monetary Fund and Gulf Arabs. Rebuilding south Lebanon and parts of Beirut are priorities following the Israel-Hezbollah fighting that stopped with a fragile truce in November. Israel has warned the ceasefire could collapse later this month if Hezbollah does not withdraw beyond the Litani River in the south. Nicholas Heras of the Washington-based New Lines Institute said Hezbollah still has weapons that could be viewed by some Lebanese as useful for protecting their territory from Israeli aggression. But he said Hezbollah has to be disarmed and integrated into the national military, or Israeli attacks will continue. 'President Aoun’s entire portfolio is how do you secure Lebanon’s borders and how do you return the sovereignty of the Lebanese state over all of its territory, which has the implied task to put Hezbollah on a process of disarmament,' Heras said. 'The Israeli interpretation of their ability to maneuver in Lebanon assumes that there will be an unsuccessful attempt by the Lebanese armed forces to subordinate Hezbollah or contain it.' Heras said Prime Minister Salam will be tasked with moving 'Lebanon on a path to recovery with getting its geopolitics squared away.' 'The prime minister is going to be judged on how effectively he can navigate the geopolitical currents,' Heras said, 'which is still uncertain in terms of the seeming rise of Turkish influence, how Iran reassesses its approach, how Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates decide to respond to the fall of the Assad government in Syria.' According to Lebanon’s sectarian power-sharing system, the president is a Maronite Christian, and the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim. The president selects him in consultation with the Shiite parliament speaker based on support by the lawmakers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/huge-challenges-ahead-for-lebanon-s-new-leaders-analysts-say/7936701.html	2025-01-14T12:30:25-08:00	
US House Speaker orders Capitol flags raised to full height for Trump inauguration	U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday ordered that flags at the Capitol be raised to their full height on Inauguration Day, pausing a 30-day flag-lowering order following the death of former President Jimmy Carter. The Republican leader's decision means that President-elect Donald Trump will not take the oath of office for his second term under a half-staff flag, a prospect that he had previously complained about. It mirrors actions taken in recent days by some Republican governors who have announced that flags in their states would be raised on Inauguration Day to mark Trump's second term. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee did so on Tuesday, noting in social media posts that U.S. flags across their states would be relowered on Jan. 21 in honor of Carter. Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a similar notice on Monday. The 30-day flag-lowering period, set into motion with President Joe Biden's order, affects flags at federal government buildings and their grounds, as well as at U.S. embassies and other facilities abroad, including military installations and vessels. It runs through Jan. 28, which encompasses Trump's inauguration and first week in office. In line with Biden's order, governors throughout the country issued their own orders to govern flags in their respective states. The incoming president has expressed consternation that flags would still be lowered when he takes the oath, and it's possible that he could order the overall reversal of Biden's decision once he's installed as president on Jan. 20. 'Democrats are all 'giddy'' about the notion that flags will be lowered on Inauguration Day, Trump wrote Jan. 3 on social media. 'Nobody wants to see this,' Trump wrote. He added that 'no American can be happy about it. Let's see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' Trump has already acted over the flags that he can control: at his home in Florida. In the days following Carter's burial, a large U.S. flag at Trump's private Mar-a-Lago club was observed flying at its full height, despite an order from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis that mirrors Biden's. As of Tuesday, DeSantis had not made alterations to the flag order in his own state. The U.S. flag code lays out parameters for lowering the U.S. flag to half-staff, including a 30-day period for current or former presidents to cover flags at federal government buildings and their grounds, as well as at U.S. embassies and other facilities abroad, including military installations and vessels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-speaker-orders-capitol-flags-raised-to-full-height-for-trump-inauguration/7936775.html	2025-01-14T12:05:29-08:00	
Cameroon says host villages attacked people displaced by Boko Haram	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Cameroonian officials said Monday five people are dead and several hundred are homeless in ongoing conflicts between host communities and people who arrived after being displaced by Boko Haram terrorism in the nation’s border area near Chad and Nigeria. Hundreds of irate host community members set fire to at least 60 government-built houses for internally displaced people in Yala Yalta, military officials said. Three displaced people died, and two host community residents died of injuries while being rushed to a local hospital. Government officials say it was the second burning of houses in the past five days. Residents of Yala Yalta, a village in Mayo-Sava, an administrative unit near Cameroon's border with Chad and Nigeria, say they no longer want the people who were displaced by Boko Haram Islamic terrorists in their village. They accuse the displaced people of kidnapping for ransom and provoking conflicts over scarce water, farm crops and fuel wood. Cameroon's Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure said at least 400 of about 2,000 people displaced by terrorism in Mayo-Sava live in Yala Yalta and surrounding villages. Local churches, including the Roman Catholic Church and the Cameroon Evangelical Church, say the abduction of members of the host community is the immediate cause of the ongoing conflicts. Cameroon's military said it freed four host community members abducted for ransom. Halidu Harouna, a pastor of the Cameroon Evangelical Church, told VOA via phone from Yala Yalta that villagers used bows and arrows, machetes and spears to attack the people seeking refuge in Yala Yalta. He said they torched houses after someone identified two members of a gang that kidnapped civilians for ransom as being among the displaced people. Villagers are also angry that theft of their cattle and crops has increased in recent months, Harouna said. Military officials said host community members have attacked and wounded at least 20 displaced persons for allegedly stealing from their plantations within the past two weeks. Captain Mark Nya Nanah, a commander of Cameroonian forces fighting Boko Haram in the central African state, said troops have been deployed to stop host communities from attacking displaced persons and their property. The military has asked people who have fled the violence to return and has assured communities they will get military protection. Some internally displaced people have acknowledged that some of their peers attack villagers and steal. They said a majority of the displaced people who attack villagers are either former fighters who surrendered or thieves hiding among displaced persons, a claim VOA could not independently verify. Cameroon's ministries of agriculture and livestock said conflicts between host communities and displaced persons are increasing because of a food shortage caused by floods in October. The government said several thousand goats, sheep and cows were either killed or swept away by flood waters, while several thousand hectares of farmland were destroyed. The United Nations says over 40,000 people have been killed and 3 million have fled their homes in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad since 2009, when fighting between Nigerian government troops and Boko Haram militants spread to the other three countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-says-host-villages-attacking-people-displaced-by-boko-haram/7936741.html	2025-01-14T11:59:28-08:00	
Despite international concerns, doctors say China flu-like virus is no COVID-19	Reports of rising cases of a flu-like illness in China, where COVID-19 was first detected five years ago, sparked international concerns about the potential for another worldwide pandemic. But medical experts say the human metapneumovirus, known as HMPV, is no COVID-19. 'That’s a routine virus that commonly causes upper respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis that might cause cough and sinuses,' says Dr. Paul Auwaerter, clinical director of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s division of infectious diseases. 'I don't feel we should be especially worried about it. It is not nearly as serious as influenza or COVID disease.' HMPV is a common virus that has been around at least since 2001. Children under five, particularly infants, and adults over 65 — especially those with health problems — can sometimes become seriously ill from HMPV. However, for most other people, the symptoms are generally mild. 'Almost everyone has been infected with this virus by the age of five,' Auwaerter says. 'HMPV has been here for, you know, a long time [and] has infected millions of people that already have immunity. It's not as though this is a brand-new virus that might cause devastating problems.' On Sunday, China said cases of HMPV had declined among residents in its northern provinces, where the respiratory infections were rising. Chinese health officials say the number of patients seeking medical help remains lower compared to the same period last year. Still, some health experts are calling for more transparency in order to reduce the spread of rumors and misunderstandings. 'International scholars are calling on China to disclose pathogen information and conduct genetic research to confirm that it is not a new virus. Even if it is an old virus, it could still be a new variant,' Dr. Ho Mei-Shang, a research fellow emeritus at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences in Taipei, told VOA’s Mandarin Service. Ho said China's COVID-19 prevention measures during the pandemic curbed the spread of diseases, which led to a decline in herd immunity, potentially causing the current surge in cases over a short time period. Auwaerter agrees. 'They stayed home, refrained from work, wore masks,' he says. 'So, the usual cycles of acquiring an infection, for example, during the respiratory season of winter, people didn't get infected. So, their specific immunity, they weren't boosted, and so there was a larger population that might be more susceptible.' There is no real treatment or vaccine for HMPV. Doctors say any patients who have trouble breathing should seek medical help.

Trump says he will create an 'External Revenue Service' agency to collect tariff income	Washington — President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday announced plans to create a new agency called the External Revenue Service to collect tariffs and other revenues from foreign nations. 'We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying,' Trump said Tuesday on his social media site, Truth Social. He compared his planned creation to the Internal Revenue Service, which is the nation's domestic tax collector. The creation of a new agency requires an act of Congress, and Republicans hold the majority of both the House and the Senate. Trump, who has vowed to shrink the size of government, would be creating a new agency to perform functions already handled by existing agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Customs and Border Patrol, which collect duties and revenues from other nations. The president-elect has tapped two business titans to lead his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations, all part of what he calls his 'Save America' agenda for a second term in the White House. Billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy are leading the DOGE's ambitious efforts to reduce the size and scope of the federal government. Tariffs, with the threat of a potential 25% levy on all goods from allies like Canada and Mexico and 60% on goods from China, have become a benchmark of Trump's economic agenda as he heads into his second term. Economists have said the cost of the tariffs will be passed on to consumers, and are generally skeptical of them, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity. Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the External Revenue Service plan. 'No amount of silly rebranding will hide the fact that Trump is planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax hike on American families and small businesses to pay for another round of tax handouts to the rich,' Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-he-will-create-an-external-revenue-service-agency-to-collect-tariff-income/7936718.html	2025-01-14T11:01:55-08:00	
Hegseth vows a 'warrior culture' if confirmed as Trump's defense secretary	WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump's choice for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, vowed Tuesday to foster a 'warrior culture' at the Pentagon, portraying himself as a 'change agent' during a testy Senate confirmation hearing that drew protesters but also veterans in support. Hegseth did not initially address the allegations of sexual assault, excessive drinking or his derisive views on women in combat and minorities, as senators determine whether the veteran and TV news show host is fit to lead the U.S. military. Instead, he focused on his combat experience in the Army National Guard. 'It's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm. A change agent,' Hegseth said in his opening remarks. 'This is not academic,' he declared, wearing an American flag pocket square on his suit coat. 'This is my life.' Asked directly about the sexual assault allegation, Hegseth dismissed it as a 'smear campaign' and unfair attack. But he did not specifically address any of the accusations, or tell the senators that he did not drink or womanize. Senators immediately began drilling down on the questions surrounding Hegseth, with the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee acknowledging the 'unconventional' choice and the top Democrat warning of 'extremely alarming' allegations against him. Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, the chairman, compared Hegseth to Trump himself, dismissed the various allegations against him as unfounded and said he will 'bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the bureaucracy.' But Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said flatly: 'I do not believe that you are qualified to meet the overwhelming demands of this job.' Hegseth, 44, comes from a new generation of veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and his military experience is widely viewed as an asset. But he also brings a jarring record of past actions and statements, including about women, minorities and 'woke' generals. He has vowed not to drink alcohol if he is confirmed to lead the Pentagon. Trump backed his pick, saying Hegseth has 'my Complete and Total support' in a morning post. The hearing at the Senate Armed Services Committee is the start of a weeklong marathon as senators begin scrutinizing Trump's choices for more than a dozen top administrative positions. Hegseth is among the most endangered of Trump's Cabinet choices, but GOP allies are determined to turn him into a cause célèbre for Trump's governing approach amid the nation's culture wars. Outside groups, including those aligned with the Heritage Foundation, are running costly campaigns to prop up Hegseth's bid. In the audience were cadres of men wearing clothing expressing support for veterans or service in the military, but also protesters who momentarily disrupted proceedings but were removed from the room. The Republican-led Senate is rushing to have some of Trump's picks ready to be confirmed as soon as Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, despite potential opposition to some from both sides of the aisle. With a narrow GOP majority, they need almost all Republicans to support Trump's pick if Democrats oppose. Hegseth faces perhaps the most difficult path to confirmation. He was forced to confront allegations of sexual assault, which he has denied, and his own comments that are far from the military mainstream. Pressed on his opposition to diversity initiatives in the military and women serving in combat roles, Hegseth agreed that the military 'was a forerunner in courageous racial integration.' But he argued that modern diversity and inclusion policies 'divide' current troops and don't prioritize 'meritocracy.' And Hegseth had to answer for his comments that women should 'straight up' not be in combat roles in the military, a view he has softened following recent meetings with senators. In one fiery exchange, Senator Kristen Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, told Hegseth: 'You will have to change how you see women to do this job.' Gillibrand said of Hegseth's comments: 'They are brutal, and they're mean, and they disrespect men and women' who fight for this country. Hegseth was combative at times, and scoffed as Reed asked him to explain what a 'jagoff' was. Only after further pressure from Reed did Hegseth say it was a military lawyer, a JAG officer, who 'put their own priorities in front of the warfighters.' Many senators have not yet met with Hegseth and most do not have access to his FBI background check, as only committee leaders were briefed on its findings. Reed said the background check on Hegseth was 'insufficient.' It did not probe or produce new information beyond what's already in the public realm about him, according to a person familiar with the situation who insisted on anonymity to discuss it. In many ways, the Hegseth hearing was following the template set during Trump's first term, when one of his choices for Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, came under intense scrutiny over allegations of sexual assault but turned the tables on his critics and recouped to win confirmation to the high court. 'He will be ripped. He will be demeaned. He will be talked about,' said Senator Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, at an event with former Navy SEALs, Army special forces and Marines supporting the nominee. 'But we're going to get him across the finish line.' Hegseth was largely unknown on Capitol Hill when Trump tapped him for the top Pentagon job. A co-host of Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends Weekend, he had been a contributor with the network since 2014 and apparently caught the eye of the president-elect, who is an avid consumer of television and the news channel, in particular. Hegseth attended Princeton University and served in the Army National Guard from 2002 to 2021, deploying to Iraq in 2005 and Afghanistan in 2011 and earning two Bronze Stars. But he lacks senior military and national security experience. In 2017, a woman told police that Hegseth sexually assaulted her, according to a detailed investigative report recently made public. Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing and told police at the time that the encounter at a Republican women's event in California was consensual. He later paid the woman a confidential settlement to head off a potential lawsuit. If confirmed, Hegseth would take over a military juggling an array of crises on the global stage and domestic challenges in military recruitment, retention and ongoing funding. Besides being a key national security adviser to the president, the defense secretary oversees a massive organization, with nearly 2.1 million service members, about 780,000 civilians and a budget of roughly $850 billion. The secretary is responsible for tens of thousands of U.S. troops deployed overseas and at sea, including in combat zones where they face attacks, such as in Syria and Iraq and in the waters around Yemen. The secretary makes all final recommendations to the president on what units are deployed, where they go and how long they stay. The secretary's main job is to make sure the U.S. military is ready, trained and equipped to meet any call to duty. But the secretary also must ensure that American troops are safe and secure at home, with proper housing, health care, pay and support for programs dealing with suicide, sexual assault and financial scams. Pentagon chiefs also routinely travel across the world, meeting with international leaders on a vast range of security issues including U.S. military aid, counterterrorism support, troop presence and global coalition building. And they play a key role at NATO as a critical partner to allies across the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hegseth-vows-a-warrior-culture-if-confirmed-as-trump-s-defense-secretary/7936614.html	2025-01-14T10:10:50-08:00	
Residents in violence-hit Pakistani district face malnutrition, depression	Islamabad — 'We are disturbed mentally. I have a son. I can’t even sleep at night. He says he will go and fight,' Laila Ibrahim of Pakistan’s Kurram tribal district tells VOA by phone. Surrounded by Afghanistan on three sides, the district in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has been largely cut off from the country, the highway connecting it to the rest of Pakistan closed to traffic since a deadly wave of sectarian violence between Shiite and Sunni tribes erupted in mid-October. Medical staff tell VOA that Kurram’s besieged residents, facing severe shortages of food and medicine, are showing signs of malnutrition and deep mental distress. 'We saw that most of the population has gone toward malnutrition,' district health officer Dr. Qaiser Bangash, who led a survey of health conditions in the region’s hard-to-reach villages, told VOA by phone from Parachinar. 'They don’t have vegetables, fruits, lentils, clarified butter,' he said. 'They cannot find milk. There is no formula milk for children. Because of this, the situation is quite bad.' In the absence of regular food deliveries, he said, people mostly get by on boiled rice, plain wheat bread, tea without milk and sugar, and locally grown seasonal produce. Wave of violence Nearly 250 people were killed in Kurram’s sectarian violence between July and December of last year. After scores were killed over the summer and fall, Nov. 21 marked a sharp escalation, when a convoy of Shiite passengers was targeted, killing 52. No group claimed responsibility for the massacre, but retaliatory attacks saw nearly another 80 killed within a matter of days. Kurram’s violence is rooted in historic land disputes between Shiite and Sunni tribes but often takes a sectarian bent. More than a century of competing security interests coupled with militancy spilling over from wars in Afghanistan have pushed each side to heavily arm itself. The targeting of the Shiite convoy in November followed an Oct. 12 attack on Sunni residents. Supply shortages Since the deadly October attack, few trucks carrying essential supplies have entered the region from the major entry point in the south. A convoy carrying mostly fruits, vegetables, and poultry arrived Wednesday after being delayed for days over threats of violence. What arrived was expensive and partly spoiled because of the hold up. Few got their hands on the limited supplies. 'We could not buy anything. It was so busy, people were pushing each other,' Mehwish Shazad, a Parachinar-based mother of three told VOA on the phone. Villagers traveling to the city for supplies didn’t have much luck either. 'The vehicles arrived in the evening. There’s no diesel or petrol that could enable people from villages to come to the city to purchase the goods,' local journalist Hidayat Pasdar told VOA. 'By the time people arrived from the villages, locals living in the suburbs had bought everything,' said Pasdar. 'There was nothing left.' A 25-vehicle convoy carrying food supplies arrived Tuesday. Pasdar said that’s half the number of vehicles that were expected. Pharmacy shelves are almost empty. With smaller clinics unable to provide medicine, patients are increasingly turning to the district headquarters hospital in Parachinar. Bangash says the patient load has more than doubled. Although government and aid groups have delivered tranches of medicine via helicopter, the quantities, Bangash said, aren’t sufficient. 'Even with hundreds of trucks, it will be hard to cover the gap that has occurred,' said the physician. Psychological scars The violence is also causing deep psychological pain. 'Mostly there were cases of depression — anxiety, too — and phobia,' said psychologist Kalsoom Bangash. 'Children have become phobic. Those who have been displaced were worried about how they will set up everything again when they go back.' The psychologist was part of the team of medical professionals that surveyed the medical needs of local communities, providing mental health support to women and children displaced by violence. Even those not displaced by the violence are living in constant fear. 'I have noticed that when children play, they worry a bullet may come flying from somewhere,' psychologist Bangash told VOA. 'If they hear a sound, they say it’s the sound of a bullet.' Delicate peace On Jan. 1, warring Sunni and Shiite tribes reached a 14-point peace deal, after weeks of government-led negotiations. Despite a January 5 gun attack on a government convoy that injured the Kurram deputy commissioner, a tenuous peace has remained. On Monday, security forces began destroying bunkers that armed fighters from both sides have erected across the region. Rivals have also agreed to disarm. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif expressed hope Tuesday the peace would hold. Successful implementation of the deal would mean people and goods will once again move across the district, likely under heavy security. For Ibrahim, peace means her 15-year-old son may have a future other than as a fighter. 'I want him to get a good education, but he can’t get it because the school is shut down again and again,' the mother said. 'His lessons get disturbed. I get disturbed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/residents-in-violence-hit-pakistani-district-face-malnutrition-depression/7936610.html	2025-01-14T10:07:24-08:00	
France's new prime minister announces renegotiation of contested plan to raise retirement age	PARIS — France's new prime minister, Francois Bayrou, announced Tuesday the renegotiation of a contested plan raising the retirement age from 62 to 64, in a crucial move to seek more stability for his minority government. In his first address to lawmakers at the National Assembly, Bayrou said: 'I'm choosing to put this subject back on the agenda, with the social partners, for a short time and under transparent conditions.' Bayrou vowed to seek 'a new path of reform, without any totems or taboos, not even the retirement age,' as long as the financing for the changes is guaranteed. President Emmanuel Macron's plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 unleashed months of mass protests from January to June 2023 that damaged his leadership. Bayrou also outlined other top priorities, including key budget decisions, one month after he was appointed by Macron. What is Bayrou proposing? Bayrou urgently needs to pass a budget bill for 2025. Following the collapse of the previous government, an emergency law has been approved to enable the state to levy taxes from Jan. 1, pay basic expenses and avoid a shutdown. But only a proper budget would help reduce France's deficit and allow key expenses such as defense measures needed amid the war in Ukraine or aid promised to angry farmers. Financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission are pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt and keep France's borrowing costs from spiraling. That would threaten the prosperity of eurozone countries. France's deficit is estimated to reach 6% of its gross domestic product in 2024. Bayrou on Tuesday said the government was aiming for a deficit of 5.4% this year, with the goal to reduce it to 3% — in line with EU rules — by 2029. Can the government be toppled again? Bayrou's Cabinet relies on a fragile deal between Macron's centrist allies and conservatives of The Republicans party who even together have no parliamentary majority. The previous government was in place for only three months before being brought down by opposition lawmakers from both the left and the far right amid a budget dispute. To avoid a repetition of that scenario, Bayrou seeks to secure a nonaggression pact with the Socialists so that they wouldn't support any future move to topple the new government. The Socialists said they are open to talks on the condition that they would include negotiations on the pension reform. However, the possibility of another no-confidence vote is still looming. The hard-left France Unbowed party refused to enter into talks with the government and already announced it would file a no-confidence motion. A vote later this week would have little chance of succeeding as the far right appears unwilling to support such a move in the immediate term. Yet the question could be raised again during the future budget debate at parliament, with more uncertainty on the result. Why are pension reform talks key? The pension reform, which was enacted into law in April 2023 despite mass protests, has gradually started being implemented. It also requires people to work 43 years to receive a full pension. The Socialists urged Bayrou to announce a 'suspension' of the reform with the aim of backtracking on the age of 64 and introducing specific measures for those who have long careers and certain professions considered to be hard work. Bayrou on Tuesday stopped short of announcing such a move, yet his proposal to renegotiate it appears as a hand stretched out towards the left. He suggested the age of 64, which was the most criticized change, could possibly be decreased depending on the outcome of the negotiations. 'We cannot deteriorate the financial balance' of the pension system, Bayrou insisted. On the other side of the political spectrum, the conservatives had warned against any suspension of the pension changes. 'If we were to repeal the pension reform, the cost would be 3.4 billion euros ($3.47 billion) in 2025 and almost 16 billion ($16.3 billion) in 2032,' said the president of the Senate, Gerard Larcher, a conservative. Does the far right still have leverage? Far-right leader Marine Le Pen — Macron's fiercest rival — was instrumental in ousting the previous government. Bayrou consulted her when forming the new government, and Le Pen remains a powerful force. Her National Rally party has the largest single group in the National Assembly, France's powerful lower house of parliament. In recent days, Bayrou's government sought to sideline Le Pen by negotiating instead with the Socialists, the Greens and the Communists on budget issues. The president of the National Rally, Jordan Bardella, criticized those talks and warned Monday that his party would oppose any budget that would raise the cost of medication, provide more health care for migrants staying illegally in the country and impose new taxes on businesses. Such measures would justify a no-confidence vote, he said. But Le Pen faces her own headaches in the months to come — a March court ruling over alleged illegal party financing could see her barred from running for office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-new-prime-minister-announces-renegotiation-of-contested-plan-to-raise-retirement-age/7936437.html	2025-01-14T08:04:00-08:00

World Economic Forum says Trump to take part virtually in Davos meeting, days after inauguration	GENEVA — U.S. President Donald Trump will take part virtually in the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos just days after his inauguration, the forum president said Tuesday. Borge Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister who heads the Geneva-based organization, noted that Trump had twice attended the elite gathering of business, government and other leaders in person during his first term. 'On Thursday afternoon, he will join us digitally, online, live in a dialogue with our participants,' Brende told reporters Tuesday as he presented the five-day program that will start Monday — the day of Trump's inauguration. 'We think that will be a very special moment,' he added, notably to help learn the administration's 'policy priorities.' Brende said he didn't know whether Elon Musk, the multibillionaire who is poised to co-lead Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, would attend, but said the forum expects 'additional, high-level representation' from the administration once confirmation processes for Trump's nominees get underway in the U.S. Senate as early as Monday. Forum organizers say a record of around 900 business leaders, including from important emerging markets, will take part in the annual meeting this year, which is expected to draw nearly 3,000 participants from over 130 countries. With climate change, war, global tensions, economic uncertainty and other issues in mind, Brende acknowledged that the 55th annual meeting of the forum will take place 'against the most complicated geopolitical backdrop in generations.' 'But still in that fragmented and partly polarized world, there are still areas where we can collaborate and ... we have big opportunities and responsibilities to find those areas where there is a possibility to improve the state of the world,' he said. The theme of this year's edition is 'Collaboration for the Intelligent Age' — a nod to the growing importance of technology in the world. The WEF has long been derided as a gathering of world elites who plot the future at a cushy, snow-bound powwow in the Swiss Alps. Critics often argue the developing world gets less attention than global powers and big business in the West or Gulf states. Forum managing director Mirek Dusek insisted that the number of businesses from developing countries in the 'Global South' was growing, and the attendance of their leaders was 'on parity' with the participation of leaders in the developed world. Ursula Von Der Leyen, president of the European Union's executive commission, plans to attend the opening day of meetings on Tuesday, after an introductory gala the night before. Other top envoys include President Javier Milei of Argentina, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, and Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang. The vast array of topics will include the future of Syria — its new foreign minister is expected to attend — after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad last month; the fight against climate change; the threats and promise of artificial intelligence; global trade and economic growth; and wars in places like Ukraine, Sudan and beyond. 'We are ready to roll up our sleeves to make the best out of a situation where we are faced with many, many challenges,' Brende said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-economic-forum-says-trump-to-take-part-virtually-in-davos-meeting-days-after-inauguration-/7936369.html	2025-01-14T07:11:00-08:00	
Despite international concerns, doctors say China flu-like virus is no COVID-19	China says HMPV infections in the northern part of the country are declining. News of increased respiratory illnesses in China kindled international concerns about another potential pandemic. But, as VOA’s Dora Mekouar reports, medical experts say HMPV is nothing like COVID-19. VOA Mandarin contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-international-concerns-doctors-say-china-flu-like-virus-is-no-covid-19/7936262.html	2025-01-14T06:28:47-08:00	
Chinese actor’s abduction to Myanmar sign of growing diversity of scams	Bangkok — The recent abduction of a Chinese TV actor to Myanmar and his subsequent release is shedding new light on the lengths to which human traffickers operating online scam centers in the war-torn country will go to in order to lure would-be victims. Chinese actor Wang Xing went missing on January 3, in Mae Sot, a city in northern Thailand, which borders Myanmar. Two days later his family reported him missing, and with growing cries on social media, the case prompted Thai and Chinese authorities to act. Last week, on January 7, Thai authorities say they found Wang in Myanmar and brought him back to Thailand. Thai police said Wang was trafficked across the Thai-Myanmar border and held captive at KK Park in Myawaddy, which is notorious for its illegal scam operations. According to local media reports, Wang was lured to Thailand under the false pretense of a film audition. He received the job offer via social media platform WeChat. Wang flew to Bangkok and was transported to Myanmar. Wang’s head was shaved. He was held captive and forced into training on how to perform online scams, according to media reports. He said there were 50 other Chinese nationals in similar circumstances. After his rescue and return to Thailand, Wang, 31, flew to Shanghai on Friday. Wang’s rescue has prompted others to speak out and according to state media in China, the families of some 174 individuals have been circulating a joint letter on Chinese social media asking for help. According to the letter, family members say their loved ones are trapped in northern and eastern Myanmar. Experts say Wang’s case highlights the growing sophistication of the masterminds of scam operations. 'This is a very deliberate form of kidnapping, of hostage taking, that you’re seeing these scam syndicates now go about. The means of trafficking people into these compounds is increasingly changing,' Jason Tower, the Myanmar country director at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), told VOA. 'This shows how these criminal actors are adapting and going to greater lengths to lure people of a wide range of demographics into captivity, to either suck funds out of them directly or get them involved in forced labor criminality,' he said. At least one other Chinese national, Wu Jiaqi, 21, was also rescued from captivity in Myanmar in recent days, local media report. The targeting of Chinese citizens by criminal gangs in Southeast Asia has become a growing problem in recent years. Chen, a Chinese national who withheld his full name for security concerns, toldRadio Free Asia in 2023 that he was a trafficking victim in a scam compound in Myanmar, and that there were at least 1,000 Chinese nationals also trapped, with scam bosses demanding $30,000 per individual for their release. Many illegal scam centers in Southeast Asia are linked with Chinese criminal networks operating in the region, experts say. Individuals from all over the world are lured into false business opportunities and forced into scam compounds. A report in June by the United States Institute of Peace revealed that scam centers operating in Southeast Asia countries, including Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar have swindled billions of dollars. All three countries share borders with Thailand. 'This is becoming a greater and greater problem. These Chinese criminal syndicates are quite deeply embedded in all of Thailand’s neighboring countries, but they are in Thailand as well,' Tower added. Nikorndej Balankura, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand, said last week that combatting cross-border crimes is a national priority. 'Thailand has consistently emphasized the importance of regular cooperation to promote border peace and security and combat cross-border crimes, including illegal drug trafficking, human trafficking, cybercrime, telecom and online fraud. The Thai government attaches great importance to combatting cross-border crimes and considers it a national priority,' he told local media. But Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a Thai political scientist, told VOA that the fight against transnational crime needs more support from Thai law enforcement and officials. 'Thailand is the vortex and nexus of scam centers and other transnational crimes. It is also a country with endemic corruption and decayed institutions, particularly the police force,' he said. Scammers are a big problem for China and telecom fraud has been a persistent concern in recent years with Beijing passing a telecom and online fraud law in December 2022. Chinese authorities have increased public information campaigns and even tried to use draconian tactics to deter its citizens from visiting Southeast Asia, Tower said. 'In 2022, a narrative started to emerge that going to Thailand could result in getting trafficked into Myanmar and losing your kidneys,' he said. 'Later on, you started to see that the police will make phone calls to people when they book tickets to ask them what they're doing in Southeast Asia.' The Chinese language movie 'No More Bets,' released in August 2023, depicts Chinese tourists visiting an unnamed Southeast Asian country, only to be trafficked into a scam compound and forced into labor. Benedikt Hofmann, the deputy representative Southeast Asia and the Pacific for the U.N. Office for Drugs and Crime, said that despite warnings, individuals are still being fooled. 'We are still seeing a lot of this despite the massive efforts that have gone into raising awareness of the risks — things like the movie 'No More Bets' really brought a lot attention to this — which really shows how effective these groups are in creating incentives for young people to go there,' Hoffman said. Chinese tourism in Thailand could also be affected. Chinese nationals are the biggest visitors to Thailand, with more than 6 million arrivals in 2024. But reports in Hong Kong say many tourists from China are cancelling their trips ahead of the Lunar New Year celebrations which begin on January 27. Thailand’s tourism bureau has attempted to reassure Chinese visitors, publishing a press release in Mandarin on January 10, stating that Thailand 'attaches great importance to the safety of tourists.' On Sunday, Thai and Chinese authorities held a high-level meeting to discuss strengthening cooperation in combatting transnational crime and human trafficking. VOA reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok for comment on the case and growing concerns but did not receive a response. Vincent Vichit-Vadakan, a Bangkok-based travel analyst, said he doesn’t believe the recent cases will have a long-term impact on Thailand as a tourist destination. 'Hopefully these high-profile cases will prompt Thai and Chinese authorities to find more effective ways to prevent criminals from using Thailand as a hub for their activities,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-actor-s-abduction-to-myanmar-sign-of-growing-diversity-of-scams-/7936112.html	2025-01-14T04:44:37-08:00	
Washington braces for Trump inauguration with fortress-like fencing, extra police	WASHINGTON — With 48 km of tall black temporary fencing, 25,000 law enforcement officers and security checkpoints set up to process hundreds of thousands of spectators, Washington is braced for President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next week. The Monday swearing-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and parade to the White House will follow a weekend featuring protests by Trump's opponents and parties and rallies by the Republican's supporters. The inauguration follows a campaign marked by two attempts on Trump's life — including one from a would-be assassin who nicked his ear with a bullet — and a pair of New Year's Day attacks on ordinary Americans. In one, 14 people were killed and dozens injured when a U.S. Army veteran rammed a truck into a crowd of New Year's Eve revelers in New Orleans. The same day, an active-duty U.S. Army soldier detonated a Tesla Cybertruck outside a Trump-branded hotel in Las Vegas, killing himself. 'We are in a higher-threat environment,' said U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool at a Monday press briefing. The inauguration itself, when Trump formally takes the oath of office with members of Congress, the Supreme Court, his incoming administration and tens of thousands of others looking on, will take place on the Capitol steps, facing the Washington Monument. That is the same spot where, on Jan. 6, 2021, thousands of Trump supporters smashed windows, fought with police and sent lawmakers running for their lives in an attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden. Trump's 2024 election rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, conceded her defeat in the Nov. 5 contest, unlike Trump who continues to falsely maintain that his loss was the result of fraud. Fear of lone wolf Security officials said they were not aware of any specific, coordinated threats to the inauguration. What they are worried about is lone wolves, such as the New Orleans attacker, or two separate incidents last week. In one, a man was arrested for trying to bring a machete into the Capitol. In the other, a man was arrested for trying to ignite a fire near the Capitol, according to U.S. Capitol Police. 'That threat of the lone actor remains the biggest justification for us being at this heightened state of alert throughout the next week,' U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger told the security briefing. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned police nationwide of the risk of copycat attacks similar to the New Orleans incident. A large chunk of downtown Washington — stretching about 3 km from the White House to the Capitol — will be closed to vehicular traffic, with entry points blocked with concrete barriers, garbage trucks and other heavy items. The 48 km of 2-meters-tall black fencing, designed to be unclimbable, will be the longest ever erected in Washington, officials said. Some 7,800 National Guard troops and 4,000 officers brought in from other police departments around the country will reinforce security. While some residents of the city, where 90% of voters cast ballots for Harris over Trump, were readying to leave for the holiday weekend or hunker down at home to avoid the gridlock, tens of thousands of people were expected to descend upon the city for celebrations and protests. About 70% of Washington's 34,500 hotel rooms were booked for the night of the inauguration and the night before as of last week, according to data from Smith Travel Research and shared with Reuters by Destination DC, Washington’s official tourism organization. Hotel occupancy was at about 95% for Trump's 2017 inauguration, and about 78% for former President Barack Obama’s second inauguration in 2013. Marches and rallies Trump's 2017 inauguration was marked by massive protests and counter-protests. His former spokesman, Sean Spicer, famously began his tenure by claiming — contrary to photographic evidence — that the crowd on the grassy National Mall was 'the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration — period.' The Women's March the following day drew hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets of Washington — and even more in pop-up solidarity events that took place around the country. A far smaller crowd of 25,000 people is expected to take part in the anti-Trump People's March on DC on Saturday, Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said on Monday. Thousands are expected to show up for nearly a dozen other protests or rallies that local officials have permitted between Saturday and Monday, including a Trump rally at the 20,000-seat Capital One Arena on Sunday. Juliette Kayyem, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School who served as a homeland security official during the Obama administration, said officials appeared to follow standard practice in planning for all possibilities. 'What you're planning for is a worst-case scenario, but my suspicion is you're not going to get it, which is good,' Kayyem said. 'In terms of planning, it's always easier to ratchet down than ratchet up.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/washington-braces-for-trump-inauguration-with-fortress-like-fencing-extra-police-/7936074.html	2025-01-14T03:59:39-08:00	
UN: More than one million people internally displaced in Haiti	Geneva — The number of people in Haiti who have fled their homes due to gang violence has risen threefold in the last year to over one million, the UN said on Tuesday. The United Nations' International Organization for Migration said its latest data 'reveals that 1,041,000 people, many displaced multiple times, are struggling amidst an intensifying humanitarian crisis.' 'In December 2023, we (recorded) around 315,000 people were displaced from the violence,' IOM spokesman Kennedy Okoth Omondi told reporters. 'One year since then, we have seen the number tripled to over a million people who have now been displaced because of gang violence in Haiti.' In the capital, Port-au-Prince, the IOM said displacement had risen by 87 percent 'fueled by relentless gang violence, the collapse of essential services — particularly healthcare — and worsening food insecurity.' The poor Caribbean country has been mired for decades by political instability, made worse in recent years by gangs that have grown in strength. Despite a Kenyan-led police support mission, backed by the United States and the UN, violence has continued to burgeon. Last week, the UN rights office said soaring gang violence in Haiti had left more than 5,600 people dead last year and thousands more injured or kidnapped. 'Haiti needs sustained humanitarian assistance right now to save and protect lives,' IOM director general Amy Pope said. 'We must work together to address the root causes of the violence and instability that has led to so much death and destruction.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-more-than-one-million-people-internally-displaced-in-haiti/7936052.html	2025-01-14T03:19:49-08:00	
UK's antitrust regulator to investigate Google's search services	LONDON — Britain's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it would investigate Google's search services using its new powers to see how they impact consumers and businesses, including advertisers, news publishers and rival search engines. The Competition and Markets Authority, which has gained new powers to examine big tech, said search was vital for economic growth and it was critical that competition was working well. 'Millions of people and businesses relied on Google's search and advertising services - with 90% of searches happening on their platform and more than 200,000 UK businesses advertising there,' CMA boss Sarah Cardell said in a statement. 'It's our job to ensure people get the full benefit of choice and innovation in search services and get a fair deal.' The CMA's move comes after U.S. prosecutors in November argued to a judge that Google must sell its Chrome browser, share data, and search results with rivals, and take a range of other measures to end its monopoly on online search. Google did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-antitrust-regulator-to-investigate-google-s-search-services/7936036.html	2025-01-14T02:53:11-08:00	
Baltic Sea nations seek to limit further incidents after cable breaches	HELSINKI — European nations must be prepared to face further incidents in the Baltic Sea following the recent damage to undersea infrastructure, leaders of NATO countries in the region said on Tuesday ahead of a security meeting in Helsinki. Baltic Sea nations are on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and are discussing an increased NATO presence. Some 2,000 ships are crossing the Baltic Sea every day, making it difficult to monitor it all, Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said. 'Let's face it, we can't ensure 100% protection but if we are sending a bold signal then I think that such incidents are going to decrease or even to stop,' Rinkevics told reporters. Finnish police last month seized a tanker carrying Russian oil and said they suspected the vessel had damaged the Finnish-Estonian Estlink 2 power line and four telecoms cables by dragging its anchor across the seabed. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that this and other recent incidents in the Baltic Sea must be assumed to be part of a hybrid strategy that is threatening European countries. 'It is important that we come together here now and talk about how we can work together to ensure greater security in the Baltic Sea region,' Scholz said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/baltic-sea-nations-seek-to-limit-further-incidents-after-cable-breaches/7936014.html	2025-01-14T01:51:28-08:00	
Negotiators to try to finalize Gaza ceasefire deal	Mediators were set to meet Tuesday in Qatar to try to finalize a proposed ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The talks come after 15 months of fighting and what people familiar with the negotiations said was a breakthrough this week in the effort to bring an end to the war in Gaza. U.S. President Joe Biden said Monday that the deal was on 'the brink' of 'finally coming to fruition.' In a speech at the State Department to highlight his foreign policy achievements, Biden said the deal would 'free the hostages, halt the fighting, provide security to Israel and allow us to significantly surge humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians who suffered terribly in this war that Hamas started.' The basic parameters of the ceasefire proposal would see the process play out in several stages. Hamas would release hostages it has been holding since the militants carried out their October 2023 attack on Israel, while Israeli authorities would release Palestinian prisoners. Israeli troops would carry out a phased withdrawal from Gaza, and some Palestinians displaced by the conflict would be allowed to return along with a surge in aid for Palestinian civilians. Months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have failed to bring a halt to the fighting, but in recent weeks, the effort has gained momentum at a time when the U.S. is preparing to go through a change in its leadership. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told MSNBC on Monday that the sides were 'closer than we've ever been' to a deal, and said the ball was in Hamas' court. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan said Monday that Biden administration officials were keeping President-elect Donald Trump’s Mideast advisers abreast of the negotiations. Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been involved in the latest round of talks. Israel launched its assault on Hamas in Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed across its borders on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 46,500 people have been killed in Gaza, with most of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, although Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants it has killed. Much of Gaza, a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea, has been laid to waste during the fighting and gripped by a humanitarian crisis, with most of its 2.3 million population displaced, often multiple times. White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report.

German defense minister visits Ukraine in show of support	German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius visited Ukraine on Tuesday in a show of support for the country in its fight against the Russian invasion that began nearly three years ago. German officials said the visit was aimed at reassuring Ukraine it will continue to receive support, with Pistorius to meet with top Ukrainian officials. The visit comes less than a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration and the questions about how U.S. policy toward Ukraine might change under the new administration. Officials in multiple Russian regions said Tuesday their areas came under major Ukrainian drone attacks, including in Saratov, where Governor Roman Busargin said there was damage at two industrial enterprises in the neighboring cities of Saratov and Engels. That area is home to a base for Russian bomber planes. Last week, a Ukrainian attack hit an oil depot that serves the base. Oryol Governor Andrei Klychkov said on Telegram that Russian air defenses shot down 17 Ukrainian drones in his region. He reported no damage or casualties from the attacks. Rostov Governor Yury Slyusar said on Telegram 14 drones were destroyed overnight, while officials in Voronezh said several Ukrainian drones were shot down without causing damage. Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it destroyed 58 of 80 drones that Russian forces used to target 11 different regions. The Ukrainian air force reported damage to apartment buildings, commercial buildings and cars in the Cherkasy, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions as a result of falling debris from downed drones. Ukrainian air defenses also destroyed Russian drones over the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa and Poltava regions, the Ukrainian air force said.

153 winners of Nobel and World Food prizes seek new ways to grow food	DES MOINES, Iowa — More than 150 recipients of the Nobel and World Food prizes released an open letter Tuesday calling for a dramatic increase in research and a commitment to new food distribution efforts with a goal of producing more crops and avoiding a global hunger crisis in coming decades. The letter notes that an estimated 700 million people now are 'food insecure and desperately poor' but that without a 'moonshot' effort to grow more and different kinds of food, far more people will be in dire need of food because of climate change and population growth. 'As difficult and as uncomfortable as it might be to imagine, humanity is headed towards an even more food insecure, unstable world by mid-century than exists today, worsened by a vicious cycle of conflict and food insecurity,' states the letter, signed by 153 recipients of the two prizes. 'Climate change is projected to decrease the productivity of most major staples when substantial increases are needed to feed a world which will add another 1.5 billion people to its population by 2050.' Corn production in Africa is expected to decline and much of the world could see more soil degradation and water shortages, the letter says. 'We are not on track to meet future food needs. Not even close,' it adds. The letter grew from a meeting of food accessibility experts last fall. Despite the potential gloom, it holds out hope for an optimistic vision of the future if people take needed actions. The letter says that a dramatic increase in research funding coupled with more effective ways to share information and distribute food could prevent a hunger crisis. Brian Schmidt, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2011, said the need to dramatically increase food production in the coming decades is a huge challenge. He calls it a 'destination with destiny,' but one that can be achieved with proper funding to enhance existing knowledge as well as global leadership. 'It is an imminently solvable problem. It is a problem that will affect billions of people in 25 years. It is a problem that to solve it, there are no losers, only winners,' Schmidt said in an interview. 'All we have to do is do it.' Schmidt said he hopes governments in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere can commit to solving the problem, but he thinks private groups like the Gates Foundation may need to take the lead in funding initial steps that will draw attention and prompt action by politicians. The letter calls for 'transformational efforts' such as enhancing photosynthesis in essential crops such as wheat and rice, developing crops that are not as reliant on chemical fertilizers and lengthening the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. Cynthia Rosenzweig, a climate research scientist at NASA who won the World Food Prize in 2022, said in an interview that researchers are already making progress toward breakthroughs, but their work needs to be turbocharged with more funding and emphasis from world leaders. 'It's not that we have to dream up new solutions,' Rosenzweig said. 'The solutions are very much being tested but in order to actually take them from the lab out into the agriculture regions of the world, we really do need the moonshot approach.' The term moonshot refers to an unprecedented effort, stemming from President John F. Kennedy's call in 1962 for Americans to rocket to the Moon. Rosenzweig, noting she works for NASA, said meeting the food needs of a growing population will take the kind of commitment the U.S. made in achieving Kennedy's goal of reaching the Moon. 'Look at how the scientists had to come together. The engineers had to be part of it. The funding had to come together as well as the general public,' she said. 'That base of support has to be there as well.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/winners-of-nobel-and-world-food-prizes-seek-new-ways-to-grow-food/7935994.html	2025-01-14T00:24:02-08:00	
Malaysia eyes greater sustainability in palm oil sector as EU law looms	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — Malaysia said on Tuesday it will encourage sustainability while maintaining the competitiveness of its palm oil industry ahead of the implementation of the European Union's anti-deforestation law at the end of this year. The EU last month approved a one-year delay to the landmark deforestation law, which bans the importation of palm oil, soy and other goods linked to the destruction of forests. The bill now takes effect from Dec. 30 this year. The law requires companies and traders selling soy, beef, coffee, palm oil and other products in the EU to provide proof their supply chains do not contribute to deforestation. Malaysia and Indonesia, the world's largest exporters of palm oil, have previously complained that the law and implementation rules are discriminatory. Malaysia's Deputy Plantation and Commodities Minister Chan Foong Hin said it was crucial for the country's palm oil industry to understand the impact of the EU law so that domestic practices could be adapted and market access maintained. 'By aligning our operations with these standards, we bolster our market position and enhance competitiveness,' Chan told an industry conference on Tuesday. Chan said the success of Malaysia's palm oil industry depended on the adoption of green initiatives, including advanced agriculture technologies, sustainable farming, and new production methods, to help protect the environment while creating new growth opportunities. Speaking at the same conference, Malaysian Palm Oil Board director-general Ahmad Parveez Ghulam Kadir said authorities would work with the local industry. 'We are looking forward to a better outlook in 2025,' Ahmad Parveez said. 'The ministry and agencies will continuously collaborate closely to address environmental concerns while also promoting economic stability and social responsibility within the industry to foster a more sustainable and balanced future.' He said Malaysian palm oil stocks are expected to fall to around 1.6 million metric tons this year, compared with 1.71 million tons in 2024. Production in the world's second-largest producer in 2025 should come in at 19.5 million tons, marginally higher than the 19.34 million tons in 2024. Palm oil exports are expected to be 17.3 million tons in 2025, up from 16.9 million tons in 2024, Ahmad Parveez added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-eyes-greater-sustainability-in-palm-oil-sector-as-eu-law-looms/7935981.html	2025-01-13T23:53:46-08:00	
Sydney closes nine beaches due to mysterious ball-shaped debris	SYDNEY — Nine beaches in Sydney, including well-known Manly beach, were closed to bathers on Tuesday after small white and gray balls of debris washed up on the shores at the height of the summer holiday season. Northern Beaches Council said it was working on safely removing the matter. Most of the samples of the ball-shaped debris were the size of marbles, with some larger, it said in a statement. Sydney's ocean beaches, famed for golden sand and clean water, draw tourists from around the globe. Beachgoers were advised to avoid Manly, Dee Why, Long Reef, Queenscliff, Freshwater, North and South Curl Curl, North Steyne and North Narrabeen beaches until further notice and keep away from the material while the clean-up and investigations continued. Authorities said they were working closely with the state's environmental agency to collect samples of the debris for testing. Last October, several beaches including the iconic Bondi beach east of downtown Sydney, were shut after thousands of black balls appeared on the shores. An inquiry later found that those balls were formed from fatty acids, chemicals similar to those in cosmetics and cleaning products, as well as hair, food waste and other materials associated with wastewater.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sydney-closes-nine-beaches-due-to-mysterious-ball-shaped-debris/7935971.html	2025-01-13T23:16:47-08:00	
US special counsel report says prosecutors had enough evidence to convict Trump in 2020 election case	In a report to Congress released early Tuesday, special counsel Jack Smith said his office had sufficient evidence to 'obtain and sustain' a trial conviction of President-elect Donald Trump for efforts to overturn Trump’s loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Smith said Trump 'resorted to a series of criminal efforts to retain power' after it became clear that he had lost and that legal ways to challenge the results had failed. 'This included attempts to induce state officials to ignore true vote counts; to manufacture fraudulent slates of presidential electors in seven states that he had lost; to force Justice Department officials and his own Vice President, Michael R. Pence, to act in contravention of their oaths and to instead advance Mr. Trump's personal interests; and, on January 6 , 2021, to direct an angry mob to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification of the presidential election and then leverage rioters,' Smith said in his report. Smith said Trump acted both in his private capacity as an election candidate, as well as with the help of multiple co-conspirators, and that Trump tried to use 'the power and authority of the United States Government in furtherance of his scheme.' The report further says that Trump’s false claims, such as votes being cast by large numbers of dead people or ineligible voters, or that voting machines had changed votes for Trump into votes for Biden, were 'demonstrably and, in many cases, obviously false.' Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked the special counsel’s work as politically motivated. He responded to the report’s release early Tuesday with a post on his Truth Social platform calling Smith 'a lamebrain prosecutor.' 'Deranged Jack Smith was unable to successfully prosecute the Political Opponent of his ‘boss,’ Crooked Joe Biden, so he ends up writing yet another ‘Report’ based on information that the Unselect Committee of Political Hacks and Thugs ILLEGALLY DESTROYED AND DELETED, because it showed how totally innocent I was, and how completely guilty Nancy Pelosi, and others, were,' Trump said. Trump is set to be inaugurated for a new term next week after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. During the 2024 campaign, Trump denied he lost the 2020 vote, including in a September debate with Harris. Tuesday’s report release came a day after U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon cleared the Justice Department to make public the portion of Smith’s report that dealt with Trump’s efforts to cling to power. Judge Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, had earlier blocked the release of Smith’s full report, which also includes an unreleased section about accusations that Trump illegally retained classified documents after he left office. Smith sought to prosecute Trump on both matters, while Trump denied wrongdoing. Judge Cannon dismissed the classified documents case in July, ruling that Smith was illegally appointed. The Supreme Court also ruled in July that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts, which blunted Smith’s efforts in the election interference case. After Trump defeated Harris, the Justice Department dropped both cases against Trump, citing longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting U.S. leader.

Impeachment trial of South Korea's Yoon adjourned after he does not attend	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's Constitutional Court adjourned the opening session of the impeachment trial of suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol within minutes on Tuesday after the embattled leader did not attend court. A lawyer advising Yoon had said the president, who has been holed up in his hillside villa in Seoul for weeks, would not attend, saying a bid by authorities to detain him prevented Yoon from expressing his position at the trial. The next trial session is scheduled for Thursday and if Yoon also decides not to attend the trial, proceedings will start with his legal team representing him. Outside the court, one of Yoon's lawyers, Yoon Kab-keun, said the president would decide whether to go to the court in person on Thursday after discussions on his defense strategy. The Constitutional Court must decide within 180 days whether to remove Yoon from office or restore his presidential powers. Yoon also faces a criminal investigation for alleged insurrection, with authorities seeking to execute an arrest warrant after he ignored summons to appear for questioning. His lawyer repeated on Tuesday that the arrest warrant of investigating authorities was invalid, and said Yoon will respond to a valid detention warrant that is executed legally. Yoon's declaration of martial law on Dec. 3 that was withdrawn after about six hours has plunged one of Asia's most vibrant democracies into a period of unprecedented political turbulence. Yoon's chief of staff said on Tuesday that Yoon's office was ready to consult with investigating authorities in order to avoid a clash during the execution of the arrest warrant against Yoon. Yoon could go to a third location outside of his fortified residence, or a visit to his home could be arranged so that investigating authorities could question Yoon, presidential chief of staff Chung Jin-suk said Tuesday in a statement. Investigating authorities, including the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), and the police, have received a re-issued arrest warrant from a South Korean court after their first attempt to detain Yoon for questioning failed after a stand-off with presidential security officers earlier this month. CIO, the police and Presidential Security Service (PSS) met on Tuesday to discuss the execution of the latest arrest warrant, investigating authorities said in a statement. At the meeting, police and CIO asked the PSS for cooperation in executing the warrant peacefully and safely, and were awaiting a response. The defense ministry said on Tuesday that military forces in charge of presidential security would not be mobilized in relation to Yoon's warrant execution. Amid South Korea's political chaos, North Korea launched several short-range ballistic missiles on Tuesday, coinciding with a visit to Seoul by Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, and less than a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. South Korean lawmakers, after being briefed by the National Intelligence Service, said on Monday that the North's recent weapons tests were partly aimed at 'showing off its U.S. deterrent assets and drawing Trump's attention.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/impeachment-trial-of-south-korea-s-yoon-adjourned-after-he-does-not-attend/7935965.html	2025-01-13T22:26:09-08:00	
Thailand's Thaksin bullish on legalizing online gambling, crypto	Thailand's political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra believes Southeast Asia's second-largest economy should push to legalize online gambling, which he said could net the government as much as 100 billion baht, or $2.89 billion, in annual revenues. Although without a formal role in government, the former prime minister, 75, is one of the most influential figures in Thai politics and is widely seen as a key power center behind the premiership of his 38-year-old daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra. Speaking at an event in Bangkok late on Monday, just hours after the Thai cabinet approved a draft law to legalize casinos, Thaksin said the government was coming up with ways to control access to, and tax revenue from, online gambling. 'Online gambling has 2 to 4 million Thai users with savings of 300 billion baht and gains and losses of about 500 billion per year,' said Thaksin. 'If we can tax 20% ... we would get more than 100 billion per year,' he said. While most forms of gambling are illegal in Thailand, it is hugely popular and successive governments led or backed by Thaksin have pushed to legalize it to create jobs and boost tourism, arguing huge sums of money are being lost that can be turned into state revenue. The government was working on an identification system to control access to online gaming that would prevent underage use and allow the monitoring of gambling addicts, Thaksin said. 'We would have like a passport to control who can play,' he said, without elaborating. Thaksin also made a push for Thailand's financial institutions to be more open to cryptocurrency, citing incoming U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance, including his appointment of crypto deregulation advocate Paul Atkins as the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He said the Thai's SEC needs to have more digital approach, like 'allowing trade of stablecoin, or coin that are backed by assets.' The Thai government is already looking to allow using crypto as a form of payment, with the resort island of Phuket a possible site for a pilot, he said. 'There will be no risk, it is just another currency in the world,' Thaksin said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-s-thaksin-bullish-on-legalizing-online-gambling-crypto/7935955.html	2025-01-13T21:56:42-08:00	
Release of US special counsel’s report could bring new insight into Trump’s 2020 efforts to cling to power	The public could learn as early as Tuesday new details about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden. A federal judge has cleared the U.S. Department of Justice to release special counsel Jack Smith’s report about Trump’s efforts to cling to power as he falsely claimed he won the election and a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, had earlier blocked the release of Smith’s full report, which also includes a section about accusations that Trump illegally retained classified documents after he left office. Judge Cannon on Monday ruled the Justice Department can release the election interference portion, but not the classified documents section. Smith sought to prosecute Trump on both matters, while Trump denied wrongdoing. Judge Cannon dismissed the classified documents case in July, ruling that Smith was illegally appointed. The Supreme Court also ruled in July that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts, which blunted Smith’s efforts in the election interference case. After Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election, the Justice Department dropped both cases against Trump, citing longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting U.S. leader.

California firefighters ‘better prepared’ amid wind-fueled extreme fire threat	California firefighters backed by fresh reinforcements of manpower and equipment prepared for the potential of new or worsening wildfires in southern California on Tuesday amid warnings of high winds and dry conditions. The National Weather Service said wind gusts Tuesday could exceed 100 kph, putting large areas of southern California under extreme fire danger warnings. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Monday that firefighters were 'absolutely better prepared' than when a series of wildfires rapidly emerged last week, but that the wind gusts could force authorities to ground the aircraft critical to the firefighting effort. Such restrictions were in place for part of last week as four major fires burned. Together, those blazes have scorched more than 160 square kilometers. Firefighters have brought one fire fully under control, while another north of Los Angeles was 97% percent contained. Danger remained from the two largest fires, including the Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles that has burned 96 square kilometers and was 14% contained as of late Monday, according to the California Department of Foresty and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The other major fire was the Eaton Fire in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains on the east side of the city. That fire was 33% contained and has burned 57 square kilometers, Cal Fire said. The fires have killed at least 24 people, while authorities continue to search for dozens of people who have been reported missing. About 100,000 people in the region remained under evacuation orders. U.S. President Joe Biden pledged additional federal support on Monday and said during a briefing at the White House, 'We’re going to keep doing everything possible to help you get through this.' 'It was a heartbreaking weekend for a lot of people in Los Angeles,' Biden said. 'Ash was raining down like snow, homes burned to the ground. Thousands of those homes are gone. And we learned we lost more of our fellow Americans. So, let’s say again to the people of Los Angeles, we’re with you.' The president also praised the work of emergency responders. 'Los Angeles is the City of Angels, and you’re now the angels,' Biden said. 'You’re the angels literally saving people’s lives, and we owe you.' Biden said the federal government was providing aid to help with overtime pay for firefighters, debris removal and temporary shelters. He said the region will need tens of billions of dollars to recover and called on Congress to 'step up' and provide funding. Some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested federal aid only be given with conditions, as they criticized California leaders for what they allege is mismanaging water and forest resources. California Governor Gavin Newsom has said in recent days that the state has increased its firefighter force and forest management efforts since he took office in 2019. On Monday, a lawsuit filed against Southern California Edison claims the utility’s equipment sparked the deadly Eaton Fire that began Jan. 7. Edison acknowledged that fire agencies are investigating whether its equipment may have started a smaller fire in the area that also occurred Jan. 7. Authorities have not yet determined an official cause for the fire. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also was sued on Monday. The suit claims that the utility failed to properly manage water supplies critical to fighting the deadly Palisades Fire, which has killed at least eight people and destroyed thousands of structures, according to the court filing. Some information was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-firefighters-better-prepared-amid-wind-fueled-extreme-fire-threat/7935943.html	2025-01-13T21:25:05-08:00	
Jeff Bezos' space company tries to launch rocket after last-minute postponement	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Blue Origin will try again to launch its massive new rocket as early as Tuesday after calling off the debut launch because of ice buildup in critical plumbing. The 98-meter New Glenn rocket was supposed to blast off before dawn Monday with a prototype satellite. But ice formed in a purge line for a unit powering some of the rocket's hydraulic systems and launch controllers ran out of time to clear it, according to the company. Founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin said Tuesday's poor weather forecast could cause more delay. Thick clouds and stiff wind were expected at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The test flight already had been delayed by rough seas that posed a risk to the company's plan to land the first-stage booster on a floating platform in the Atlantic. New Glenn is named after the first American to orbit Earth, John Glenn. It is five times taller than Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket that carries paying customers to the edge of space from Texas. Bezos founded the company 25 years ago. He took part in Monday's countdown from Mission Control, located at the rocket factory just outside the gates of NASA's Kennedy Space Center. No matter what happens, Bezos said this weekend, 'We're going to pick ourselves up and keep going.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jeff-bezos-space-company-tries-to-launch-rocket-after-last-minute-postponement/7935939.html	2025-01-13T20:31:09-08:00	
Supreme Court rejects Utah's push to wrest control of public land from the federal government	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday turned back a push by the state of Utah to wrest control of vast areas of public land from the federal government, marking a small victory for land conservation advocates who worry that similar efforts may escalate in a Republican-controlled Washington. The high court refused to let the GOP-controlled state file a lawsuit seeking to bring the land and its resources under state control. The decision came in a brief order in which the court did not explain its reasoning, as is typical. It marks the latest roadblock for states in a running feud with the U.S. government over who should control huge swaths of the West and the enormous oil and gas, timber, and other resources they contain. Utah's top state leaders said they have not ruled out taking their lawsuit to a lower court. In the Western state known for its rugged mountains popular with skiers and red-rock vistas that draw throngs of tourists, federal agencies control almost 70% of the land. Utah argues that local control would be more responsive and allow the state access to revenue from taxes and development projects. The complaint sought control of about half of federal land, which still amounts to an area nearly as large as South Carolina. The parcels are used for things like energy production, grazing, mining and recreation. Utah's world-famous national parks and national monuments would have stayed in federal hands. Monday's decision by the high court comes as the newly Republican-controlled Congress adopted a rules package that includes language allowing lawmakers to more easily transfer or sell off public lands managed by federal agencies. The rules consider public lands to have no monetary value, meaning lawmakers will no longer need to account for lost revenue if they decide to give parcels to states or extractive industries. While conservationists applauded the court's rejection of what they called a land-grab lawsuit, many remained worried that the efforts will continue. Public lands under state control could be vulnerable to privatization, degradation and oil drilling, said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. 'If successful, Utah's lawsuit would result in the sale of millions of acres of public lands in red-rock country to the highest bidder, an end to America's system of federal public lands and the dismantling of the American West as we know it,' Bloch said. Utah's Republican Sens. Mike Lee and John Curtis criticized the court's decision and promised legislative action. Curtis, who campaigned on being a climate-conscious Republican, said the people of Utah should be entrusted to manage the land they have lived on for generations. 'Building roads, moving cattle and cleaning up campgrounds all require navigating a behemothic bureaucracy that's stacked up against the average Utahn,' Curtis said. In a joint statement with Utah's Republican legislative leaders and attorney general, Gov. Spencer Cox said he was disappointed in the court's decision to turn away the lawsuit. 'Utah remains able and willing to challenge any BLM land management decisions that harm Utah,' state leaders said. 'We are also heartened to know the incoming administration shares our commitments to the principle of 'multiple use' for these federal lands and is committed to working with us to improve land management.' While lawsuits typically start in federal district courts and eventually work their way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, disputes involving states can start at the nation's highest court if the justices agree to hear them. Utah leaders noted that the high court did not comment on the merits of their arguments or prevent them from filing the lawsuit in a federal district court. Conservation groups say they'll remain ready to challenge any future lawsuits. 'This lawsuit is an assault on the country's long-standing and successful history of safeguarding valuable and vulnerable landscapes in trust for all Americans,' said Chris Hill, who leads the Conservation Lands Foundation. 'And while the Supreme Court's decision to not hear the case is a reprieve, we fully expect this small group of anti-public lands politicians to continue to waste taxpayer dollars and shop their bad ideas.' The federal Bureau of Land Management declined to comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-rejects-utah-s-push-to-wrest-control-of-public-land-from-the-federal-government/7935933.html	2025-01-13T19:51:56-08:00	
Impeachment trial of South Korean President Yoon to begin	SEOUL, South Korea — The impeachment trial of South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol begins Tuesday, with the country's Constitutional Court set to weigh whether to strip him of his presidential duties over a failed martial law bid. Yoon's Dec. 3 power grab plunged South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his suspension of civilian rule. He was impeached soon after and suspended from duty, but has gone to ground in his residence since, refusing summonses from investigators probing him on insurrection charges and using his presidential security team to resist arrest. Lawmakers also impeached Yoon's stand-in last month, putting the country in further political instability, and the current acting president has appeared unwilling to wade into the standoff, instead urging all parties to negotiate for a solution. The trial's first of five hearings is slated to begin at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT). The following sessions take place on Jan. 16, 21, 23 and Feb. 4. The court will decide mainly two issues, whether Yoon's martial law declaration was unconstitutional and if it was illegal. 'This impeachment case focuses solely on the martial law situation, so the facts are not particularly complex,' lawyer Kim Nam-ju told AFP. 'Since most of the individuals involved have already been indicted and the facts have been somewhat established, it doesn't seem like it will take a long time.' The court has up to 180 days from Dec. 14, when it received the case, to make its ruling on whether Yoon indeed violated the constitution and the martial law act. Yoon's legal team said he would not appear at the first hearing over purported safety concerns, saying he would be willing to appear at a later date if security issues were ironed out. 'Concerns about safety and potential incidents have arisen. Therefore, the president will not be able to attend the trial on Jan. 14,' lawyer Yoon Kab-keun told AFP. The trial will continue in his absence if he does not appear. Former presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Park Geun-hye did not appear for their impeachment trials in 2004 and 2016-2017, respectively. Yoon's lawyers have argued the court must utilize the full 180 days — specifically to examine what 'led to the declaration of martial law.' Separate to the trial, a joint team of investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) — which is probing Yoon over insurrection — and police are preparing a fresh attempt to arrest the president. An earlier attempt failed after Yoon's presidential guards blocked access to investigators. If the new warrant is executed successfully, Yoon would become the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested. If eventually convicted in that case, Yoon faces prison or even the death penalty. As media speculation rose that the second attempt would take place this week, the police, CIO and Yoon's presidential security service met Tuesday to discuss the arrest warrant, the Yonhap news agency reported. The CIO said it would 'prepare thoroughly' for its second effort to arrest Yoon, with police reportedly preparing 1,000 investigators for the fresh attempt. Meanwhile, Yoon's guards have reinforced his Seoul compound with barbed wire installations and bus barricades. On Tuesday Yoon's chief of staff Chung Jin-suk said his office was 'ready to consider all options for investigation or visits' to the sitting leader 'at a third location.' Yoon's legal team has also sought to put pressure on police to avoid being involved in the arrest attempt, claiming officers would be in 'in violation of multiple laws' if they cooperated with investigators. Late Sunday, the CIO sent a letter to the defense ministry and presidential security service saying anyone blocking Yoon's potential arrest 'may face criminal charges' for obstruction and abuse of authority.	https://www.voanews.com/a/impeachment-trial-of-south-korean-president-yoon-to-begin/7935919.html	2025-01-13T19:03:56-08:00

North Korea launches missiles toward eastern waters in 2nd launch of year, South says	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Tuesday test-fired multiple missiles toward its eastern waters, South Korea's military said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the weapons were fired from a northern inland area and were suspected to be short-range ballistic missiles. It wasn't immediately clear how far the weapon flew. The joint chiefs said the South Korean military has strengthened surveillance while sharing the launch information with the U.S. and Japanese militaries. It was North Korea's second launch event of 2025, following a ballistic launch last week. North Korea said the Jan. 6 test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong Un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations. North Korea is coming off a torrid year in weapons testing. The systems it demonstrated in 2024 included solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to strike the U.S. mainland and various shorter-range missiles designed to overwhelm missile defenses in South Korea. There concerns that its military capabilities could advance further through technology transfers from Russia, as the two countries align over the war in Ukraine. At a year-end political conference, Kim vowed to implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy and criticized the Biden administration's efforts to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a 'nuclear military bloc for aggression.' North Korean state media did not specify Kim's policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term as president, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Even if Trump returns to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely. Kim's strengthened position — built on his expanded nuclear arsenal, deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of U.S. international sanctions — presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff, experts say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-launches-missiles-toward-eastern-waters-in-2nd-launch-of-year-south-says/7935902.html	2025-01-13T18:25:59-08:00

Peru court throws out graft trial of presidential candidate Fujimori	LIMA, PERU — A court in Peru on Monday suspended the money laundering trial of three-time presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori, citing errors in the indictment. The 49-year-old daughter of ex-President Alberto Fujimori was on trial for allegedly taking money from scandal-tainted Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht to fund failed presidential bids in 2011 and 2016. She is charged with money laundering, organized crime, obstruction of justice and making false declarations. Fujimori had already spent 16 months in pre-trial detention before being freed ahead of the 2021 presidential elections, which she also lost. Prosecutors had sought a 30-year prison sentence for Fujimori, and a 15-year ban on her holding public office — which would rule her out for elections in 2026. A judge ruled Monday that the charge sheet had been 'flawed' and would have to be corrected if there is to be a new trial. This came after the Constitutional Court annulled the charges against one of Fujimori's co-defendants. Prosecutors will be able to appeal Monday's ruling.	https://www.voanews.com/a/peru-court-throws-out-graft-trial-of-presidential-candidate-fujimori-/7935865.html	2025-01-13T16:58:49-08:00	
Crypto firm Tether and its founders finalizing move to El Salvador	DUBAI — Cryptocurrency firm Tether plans to move its headquarters to El Salvador, its chief executive said, as the founders of the world's biggest stablecoin look to capitalize on the Central American country's bid to become a hub for crypto trading. Tether has emerged as a dominant force in the booming market for stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a constant value by being pegged to traditional currencies and offer users a way to move money between cryptocurrencies without exposure to price swings. CEO Paolo Ardoino told Reuters that Tether would relocate to El Salvador after the cryptocurrency recently obtained a license there as a digital asset service provider. Ardoino and his fellow managers and co-founders of Tether will also move their residences to El Salvador, he said. Previously, the company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. 'This move to El Salvador will be the first time we're going to have also a physical headquarters,' he said. But not all of the company's 100-plus employees will move there, he said, adding that many of the staff work remotely. The company plans to hire 100 Salvadorans over the next several years, he said. The booming market for stablecoins has worried regulators concerned that growing stablecoin reserves expose the broader financial system to bigger risks, because they act as a bridge between the crypto universe and mainstream financial markets. Tether has faced questions around its reserves and does not fully disclose where they are held or in what form. The firm says the vast majority of its stablecoin is backed by traditional currency reserves held with Wall Street brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald, whose CEO, Howard Lutnick, has been nominated to head the U.S. Commerce Department under President-elect Donald Trump. 'So, we have some liquidity on other banks, but the vast, vast majority of the T-bills are in Cantor,' Ardoino said. Boosting monitoring of tokens The company said last year it was increasing monitoring of how its tokens are used to combat illicit finance. Asked whether Tether had considered alternative locations for its headquarters, Ardoino said it lacked a license to operate in the European Union and had ruled out the United States for now. It was 'quite premature' to predict possible changes that might be implemented under Trump, he said. Trump's victory in the November U.S. election sparked a record rise in cryptocurrency prices. The Republican has vowed to introduce a friendlier regulatory environment for crypto and said he planned to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. El Salvador is seeking to become a hub for digital currency trading, and three years ago President Nayib Bukele made it the first country to establish bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the dollar. 'Welcome home,' Bukele wrote on social media platform X in response to Tether's announcement. In a separate post on Monday, Bukele asked the CEO of Rumble, Chris Pavlovski, to consider moving the headquarters of the video-sharing platform to El Salvador. Days earlier, the company announced a cloud services agreement with Bukele's government. Tether's eponymous dollar-pegged token USDT=CCCL (USDT) accounts for roughly two-thirds of the $212 billion worth of stablecoins in circulation, according to CoinGecko data. The overall market has grown around 45% over the last year, the data shows.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crypto-firm-tether-and-its-founders-finalizing-move-to-el-salvador-/7935830.html	2025-01-13T16:37:42-08:00	
Mexico's Sheinbaum lays out road map to make country economic powerhouse	MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Monday rolled out her administration's road map to make the nation one of the world's top economies by the time she leaves office. Mexico, currently the No. 12 economy according to World Bank data, aims to crack the Top 10 by 2030, Sheinbaum said. The nation will do so by boosting local manufacturing and swapping out imports, creating manufacturing jobs and cutting through red tape to attract investments in the country, Sheinbaum said. The business-friendly agenda represents a shift in tone from Sheinbaum's predecessor and mentor, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who left office in October and often tussled with private firms. Sheinbaum laid out a laundry list of goals on Monday for her country, including bumping investments up to 28% of GDP, adding 1.5 million manufacturing jobs and boosting local sourcing for industries subject to Chinese imports — a key source of tensions with the United States and Canada. Mexico plans to boost its position using trade agreements, tariff policies and strengthening customs enforcement, a government presentation showed. The moves come as trade tensions with the United States — Mexico's top trade partner — are heightened on tariff threats from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has accused Mexico of being a back door for Chinese goods to circumvent existing U.S. tariffs. Mexico denies such accusations but has since cracked down on contraband goods coming into the country from Asia and rolled out tariffs targeting e-commerce giants such as Shein and Temu. 'This is a collective job,' Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said at the presentation, thanking private-sector representatives who helped build what he called a 'navigational chart for the new era we are entering.' 'There are uncertainties in the immediate future. But if we work together and have a direction for the nation like the one we have, my friends, we are going to come out on top,' he added. Sheinbaum's administration will boost local sourcing in the key textile and automotive industries, the presentation showed, while also working with Mexican steel producers, who have long accused China of undercutting the market. Sheinbaum, a climate scientist who has made strong environmental pledges, will also work to make Mexico's energy grid run on 45% sustainable energy, her presentation showed. However, that promise could be challenged by the heavily polluting and heavily indebted state oil firm Pemex. Lopez Obrador poured billions of dollars into the company during his administration. Sheinbaum's presentation also pledged to maintain the country's hydrocarbon reserves-to-production ratio for at least the next decade. 'Our goal is to reduce poverty and inequality,' Sheinbaum said. 'In the face of any uncertainty in the near future, Mexico has a plan and is united going forward.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-s-sheinbaum-lays-out-road-map-to-make-country-economic-powerhouse-/7935828.html	2025-01-13T16:35:38-08:00	
Premier of separatist Moldova region says gas cutoff shattered foreign trade	CHISINAU, MOLDOVA — The prime minister of Moldova's separatist Transniestria region said Monday that the abrupt curtailment of Russian gas supplies that plunged the region into an energy crisis has also shattered both its exports and imports. The cutoff, prompted by Ukraine's refusal to renew an agreement allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine, has led to daily blackouts in the pro-Russian region of some 350,000 people and disruptions in heating and water supplies. Prime Minister Alexander Rozenberg told local media that the New Year cutoff had triggered a 43% decline in imports and a 60% plunge in exports in the region, which split from Moldova in the final days of Soviet rule. 'The steepest drop in the volume of export operations ... has been registered in the metals sector, in manufacture of machines and in the chemical industry,' he said. 'Exports of cement have been completely stopped.' Transniestria depends heavily on assistance from Moscow and its leaders acknowledge that the Russian gas it has long received was provided free of charge as 'humanitarian assistance.' The gas cutoff affects operations at a thermal plant that provides electricity both for Transniestria and much of the area controlled by the central Moldovan government. Its operations have been switched to coal, and Ukraine, Moldova's eastern neighbor, has offered to provide supplies. Moldovan President Maia Sandu, who has spearheaded the country's drive to join the EU, called a meeting of Moldova's Supreme Security Council on Tuesday to discuss energy. Both Moldova and Transniestria have proclaimed states of emergency. Much of Transniestria's industry has been forced to close or obliged to operate at night, when there is less strain on the power grid. Among the factories closed are a cement plant and a steel mill in the town of Rybnita, with the latter accounting for 35% of the region's budget revenue. The region's separatist authorities last week said energy savings had enabled them to reduce rolling blackouts from eight hours a day to three by the weekend. But a blackout of five hours had been announced for Monday. Moldova, which denounces Russia's invasion of Ukraine, says Moscow fomented the crisis and has suggested shipping gas on a route through Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania. Russian gas giant Gazprom said it will provide no supplies until Moldova settles arrears it estimates at $709 million, a figure disputed by Moldovan authorities. Transniestria's leaders say Moldova has done nothing to ease the crisis and reject any notion that Moldova's government has offered to help purchase power from Western Europe. More than 30 years after Transniestria waged a brief war against the newly independent Moldovan state, the region continues to exist alongside Moldova with little turmoil. But 1,500 Russian 'peacekeepers' remain in the territory and efforts to resolve the separatist dispute have made little headway.	https://www.voanews.com/a/premier-of-separatist-moldova-region-says-gas-cutoff-shattered-foreign-trade-/7935845.html	2025-01-13T16:34:02-08:00	
US agencies warn of potential New Orleans copycat attack	WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned of a potential public safety threat from violent extremists who might try to copy the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people. The warning comes a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. 'The FBI and DHS are concerned about possible copycat or retaliatory attacks due to the persistent appeal of vehicle ramming as a tactic for aspiring violent extremist attackers,' the agencies said in a statement. Early on New Year's Day, more than a dozen people were killed and a dozen others injured when a man rammed a rented pickup truck into a crowd of revelers along Bourbon Street in New Orleans. The man who carried out the attack was a U.S. Army veteran who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State and appeared to have made recordings condemning music, drugs and alcohol. The agencies said such attacks, inspired by foreign 'terrorist' organizations, have been carried out in the U.S. and abroad using rented, stolen and personally owned vehicles. Attackers could also attempt to use improvised explosive devices to supplement a vehicle attack, they said. The agencies said past targets have included pedestrians, law enforcement or military members, and crowded public venues that are accessible from roadways. 'We ask that the public remain vigilant regarding possible copycat or retaliatory attacks and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement,' they said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agencies-warn-of-potential-new-orleans-copycat-attack/7935595.html	2025-01-13T16:04:52-08:00	
Russian forces bypass key stronghold to cut off supplies to Ukrainians	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russian forces are bypassing a key stronghold in eastern Ukraine that they have fought for months to capture and are focusing instead on cutting supply lines to it, a Ukrainian official said Monday. Russian troops are going around the vital logistics hub of Pokrovsk, where a steadfast Ukrainian defense has kept them at bay, and are taking aim at a highway that leads from there to the central Ukraine city of Dnipro, Major Viktor Trehubov, a local Ukrainian army spokesperson, told The Associated Press. That route is crucial for supplies feeding Ukrainian forces in the entire region. Cutting the highway traffic would also severely weaken Pokrovsk. 'So far, they have not achieved their goal and [Ukrainian forces] are working to ensure that they do not achieve it in the future — just as they have not been successful in other attempts to bypass the city,' Trehubov said in a WhatsApp message. Ukraine’s army is under severe strain along parts of the approximately 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where Pokrovsk is located. After almost three years of war, Ukrainian units are depleted and are outnumbered by Russian forces. Though its battlefield progress has been slow and costly, momentum in the war is in Russia’s favor and its onslaught has gradually swallowed up towns and villages, especially in Donetsk. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Monday its forces had seized the village of Pishchane. In his daily video address to the nation late Sunday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said fighting around Pokrovsk was 'the most intense' in recent days. In separate comments to local media, Trehubov, the army spokesperson, speculated that Russia's heavy losses of troops and armor in the Donetsk operation had prompted it to alter its strategy. 'Now they are acting more cautiously,' he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin is pressing his advantage ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s arrival in the White House next week. Trump says he wants to bring a swift end to the war, though he hasn’t publicized details of his plans. In 2022, Moscow illegally annexed the Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk regions, which make up the economically important Donbas industrial area, together with the southeastern provinces of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But Russian forces don’t fully control any of them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-forces-bypass-key-stronghold-to-cut-off-supplies-to-ukrainians-/7935592.html	2025-01-13T16:00:37-08:00

Millions have had student loans canceled under Biden, despite collapse of his forgiveness plan	WASHINGTON — Despite failing to deliver his promise for broad student loan forgiveness, President Joe Biden has now overseen the cancellation of student loans for more than 5 million Americans — more than any other president in U.S. history. In a last-minute action on Monday, the Education Department canceled loans for 150,000 borrowers through programs that existed before Biden took office. His administration expanded those programs and used them to their fullest extent, pressing on with cancellation even after the Supreme Court rejected Biden's plan for a new forgiveness policy. 'My Administration has taken historic action to reduce the burden of student debt, hold bad actors accountable, and fight on behalf of students across the country,' Biden said in a written statement. In total, the administration says it has waived $183.6 billion in student loans. The wave of cancellations could dry up when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump hasn't detailed his student loan policies but previously called cancellation 'vile' and illegal. Republicans have fought relentlessly against Biden's plans, saying cancellation is ultimately shouldered by taxpayers who never attended college or already repaid their loans. Biden loosened rules for debt forgiveness The latest round of relief mostly comes through a program known as borrower defense, which allows students to get their loans canceled if they're cheated or misled by their colleges. It was created in 1994 but rarely used until a wave of high-profile for-profit college scandals during the Obama administration. A smaller share of the relief came through a program for borrowers with disabilities and through Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which was created in 2007 and offers to erase all remaining debt for borrowers in a government or nonprofit job who make 10 years of monthly payments. Most of Monday's borrower defense cancellations were for students who attended several defunct colleges owned by Center for Excellence in Higher Education, including CollegeAmerica, Stevens-Henager College, and Independence University. They are based on past findings that the schools lied to prospective students about their employment prospects and the terms of private loans. Before Biden took office, those programs were criticized by advocates who said complex rules made it difficult for borrowers to get relief. The Biden administration loosened some of the rules using its regulatory power, a maneuver that expanded eligibility without going through Congress. As an example, just 7,000 borrowers had gotten their loans canceled through Public Service Loan Forgiveness before the Biden administration took office. Widespread confusion about eligibility, along with errors by loan servicers, resulted in a 99% rejection rate for applicants. Huge numbers of borrowers made years of payments only to find out they were in an ineligible repayment plan. Some were improperly put into forbearance — a pause on payments — by their loan servicers. Those periods didn't end up counting toward the 10 years of payments needed for cancellation. The Biden administration temporarily relaxed the eligibility rules during the pandemic and then made it more permanent in 2023. As a result, more than 1 million public servants have now had their balances zeroed out through the program. All those rule changes were meant to be a companion to Biden's marquee policy for student debt, which proposed up to $20,000 in relief for more than 40 million Americans. But after the Supreme Court blocked the move, the Biden administration shifted its focus to maximizing relief through existing mechanisms. Republicans have called for a different approach Announcements of new cancellation became routine, even as conservatives in Congress accused Biden of overstepping his power. Republican states fought off Biden's later attempts at mass forgiveness, but the smaller batches of relief continued without any major legal challenge. As Republicans take hold of both chambers of Congress and the White House, Biden's changes could be targeted for a rollback. But it's unclear how far the next administration will go to tighten the cancellation spigot. Trump proposed eliminating PSLF during his first term in office, but Congress rejected the idea. Project 2025, a blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, proposes ending PSLF, and narrowing borrower defense and making repayment plans less generous than existing ones.	https://www.voanews.com/a/millions-have-had-student-loans-canceled-under-biden-despite-collapse-of-his-forgiveness-plan-/7935510.html	2025-01-13T14:10:30-08:00

Palestinians dedicate new West Bank olive grove to Jimmy Carter	TULKAREM, West Bank — Palestinian activists and residents planted a grove of 250 olive trees in a northern West Bank town Monday in memory of the late U.S. President Jimmy Carter, describing him as a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause. The former president’s legacy is 'rooted' among Palestinians and across the globe, said Abbas Melhem, executive manager of the Palestinian Farmers Union. Carter was one of the few world leaders who 'stood firmly supporting the struggle of the Palestinians for independence and for freedom,' he said. Under clear winter skies, Palestinian kids helped a handful of adults place the trees into newly dug holes. Melhem said the 10-dunam (2.5-acre) grove in the city of Tulkarem, titled 'Freedom Farm,' would be fenced in to protect it from wildlife or extremist Jewish settlers, who have attacked Palestinian olive trees in the past. The advocacy group for farmers in the West Bank launched the project in collaboration with U.S.-based nonprofit Treedom for Palestine, which plants trees to empower Palestinian farmers. Carter, who died last month at the age of 100, brokered the Camp David peace accords between Israel and Egypt in 1978. In his later years, Carter was highly critical of Israel’s military rule over the Palestinians, saying conditions in the occupied West Bank amounted to apartheid. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. 'I think planting olive trees that live at least 100 years old like him is a very suitable way to honor his life and his legacy,' said George Zeidan, the Carter Center’s director in Israel and Palestine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinians-dedicate-new-west-bank-olive-grove-to-jimmy-carter/7935489.html	2025-01-13T14:00:34-08:00	
Lasers help archaeologists study ancient tattoos on Peruvian mummies	WASHINGTON — For more than 5,000 years, humans have adorned themselves with tattoos. In a new study, researchers used lasers to uncover highly intricate designs of ancient tattoos on mummies from Peru. The preserved skin of the mummies and the black tattoo ink used show a stark contrast — revealing fine details in tattoos dating to around 1250 A.D. that aren’t visible to the naked eye, said study co-author Michael Pittman, an archaeologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The researchers examined around 100 mummies from coastal Peru’s Chancay culture – a civilization that flourished before the Inca empire and the arrival of Europeans. All the individuals had some form of tattoos on the back of their hands, knuckles, forearms or other body parts. The study focused on four individuals with 'exceptional tattoos' — designs of geometric shapes such as triangles and diamonds, said Pittman. It wasn't clear exactly how the tattoos were created, but they are 'of a quality that stands up against the really good electric tattooing of today,' said Aaron Deter-Wolf, an expert in pre-Columbian tattoos and an archaeologist at the Tennessee Division of Archaeology, who was not involved in the research. Results were published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Using lasers that make skin faintly glow, 'we basically turn skin into a light bulb,' said co-author Tom Kaye of the nonprofit Foundation for Scientific Advancement in Sierra Vista, Arizona. The findings were 'helpful to learn about new non-destructive technologies that can help us study and document sensitive archaeological materials,' such as mummies, said Deter-Wolf. The oldest known tattoos were found on remains of a Neolithic man who lived in the Italian Alps around 3,000 B.C. Many mummies from ancient Egypt also have tattoos, as do remains from cultures around the world. Throughout history, tattoos have been used in many ways — to mark cultural or individual identity, life events or social status, or to 'ward off maladies or help enhance relationships with spirits or deities,' said Lars Krutak, an archaeologist at the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, who was not involved in the research. While designs on pottery, textiles and stonework are more commonly preserved and studied by researchers, 'when ancient tattoos are available to us, they give exciting insights into forms of figurative and abstract art that we aren’t otherwise able to access,' said Bournemouth University archaeologist Martin Smith, who was not part of the study.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lasers-help-archaeologists-study-ancient-tattoos-on-peruvian-mummies-/7935481.html	2025-01-13T13:58:22-08:00	
Ryanair calls for alcoholic drink limit at EU airports amid legal action against unruly passenger	NEW YORK — Ryanair is calling on European authorities to limit the sale of alcoholic beverages at airports across the continent, as the Irish airline continues legal action against a passenger who it says caused a costly flight diversion last year. The budget airline is seeking more than 15,000 euros ($15,324) in damages over the April 2024 incident. Ryanair alleges that this passenger's 'inexcusable behavior' on a flight from Dublin to Lanzarote in Spain's Canary Islands was so disruptive that it forced the aircraft to divert to Porto, Portugal, for safety — where crew members and over 160 other passengers were later delayed overnight. After announcing its civil suit against the passenger last week, Ryanair on Monday shared further information detailing the costs it incurred for excess fuel, lodging, legal fees and more as a result of this diversion. And the airline also suggested a drink limit for airports across the European Union. 'It is time that EU authorities take action to limit the sale of alcohol at airports,' Ryanair wrote in a statement. 'We fail to understand why passengers at airports are not limited to two alcoholic drinks [using their boarding pass in exactly the same way they limit duty-free sales], as this would result in safer and better passenger behavior on board aircraft, and a safer travel experience for passengers and crews all over Europe.' Ryanair noted that it and other airlines already limit alcohol sales in-flight — but said that passengers can still consume excess alcohol at airports before boarding, particularly during flight delays, without similar restrictions. Aviation agencies have long expressed concern with disruptive, in-flight incidents — particularly those that result in violence against others on board, verbal abuse, harassment or other health hazards like smoking. Although still rare, reports of unruly passengers seen on planes have recently been on the rise. When reached for comment Monday, a spokesperson for European Union Aviation Safety Agency noted that, while the agency could not provide specifics, 'both the number and severity of incidents' have increased in Europe since 2020. Worldwide, the International Air Transport Association found that there was one disruptive incident for every 480 flights in 2023 — the latest figures from the trade organization, which used data from more 24,500 reports and 50 operators worldwide. That's up from one every 568 in 2022. How many of those incidents involved alcohol was not immediately known. But, among efforts aimed at preventing in-flight disruptive behavior overall, the IATA and other aviation groups have previously underlined the importance of serving alcohol responsibly, not allowing travelers who are too intoxicated to board and participating in additional safety initiatives, like 'One Too Many' in the U.K. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration reported that it received 2,102 reports of unruly passenger incidents last year, resulting in $7.5 million in fines levied. That incident count is up 1% from 2023, but still far below a 2021 peak of 5,973.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ryanair-calls-for-alcoholic-drink-limit-at-eu-airports-amid-legal-action-against-unruly-passenger-/7935464.html	2025-01-13T13:54:15-08:00	
Elon Musk says third patient got Neuralink brain implant	Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines. 'We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,' he said during a recent wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X. Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year. Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones. The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess. But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better. Who's working on brain-computer interface technology? More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces. Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people 'using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches' that combine neural recording with stimulation. What are the benefits of BCIs? Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology 'very exciting' with potential benefits to people with paralysis. Through clinical trials, 'we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,' he said. 'It’s a little early to know.' Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink. 'We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be,' he said. How are BCIs tested and regulated? Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people. While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an 'investigational device exemption' from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices. Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study. Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety. She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board. The role of such boards 'is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll,' said Redberg.	https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-says-third-patient-got-neuralink-brain-implant/7935447.html	2025-01-13T13:39:59-08:00	
In Nigeria, spate of airstrikes killing civilians sparks concern	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Human rights groups in Nigeria are condemning a pattern of civilian deaths from airstrikes in the northeast, and are calling for an impartial investigation of the military's operations. This follows reports from local residents that a weekend airstrike targeting armed gangs in Zamfara state killed at least 15 civilians. Nigeria’s air force has confirmed it is investigating multiple reports of civilian casualties from the Saturday raid. An air force spokesperson, Air Vice Marshal Olusola Akinboyewa, stated Sunday that there is no confirmed evidence of civilian casualties and clarified that the airstrike targeted criminal gangs, resulting in the rescue of several people. Local residents in Tungar Kara village, however, told the news media that at least 15 people were killed, including members of a local militia. The incident follows a Christmas Day airstrike in nearby Sokoto state that killed 10 civilians. Isa Sanusi of Amnesty International condemned the reports of frequent civilian casualties. 'It is actually unfortunate that the military is repeatedly doing the same thing — striking without proper verification of their target,' Sanusi said. 'It has now reached a level that we can no longer call it a mistake. The reason why the military is doing this is because the government could not hold them to account.' Amnesty International says it has received testimonies and evidence indicating that the recent airstrike in Tungar Kara killed innocent civilians. Nigerian authorities have struggled to curtail the operations of armed gangs and terror groups, often resorting to aerial strikes to fight them. Civilian deaths, however, have become more frequent. On Monday, Nigeria’s chief of defense staff, General Christopher Musa, told local media that the military does not intentionally target civilians, and that an investigation into the accident is underway. Sanusi, however, insisted on greater accountability. 'The military should be asked to hand over every detail they have. A panel should be constituted, including experts in military air operations, so that the exact reason why this is happening should be confirmed and avoided in the future,' Sanusi said, adding, 'The families of the victims have also approached us.' Security analyst Chidi Omeje said the military must exercise caution in its aerial operations. 'I’m not sure that when you have this type of intensive military operation, you always get it right. That’s why I’m actually not very comfortable with the use of aerial combat in this manner, because I’m not sure we have reached the point where we can be very precise in our attacks,' Omeje said. Since 2017, air raids by the military have resulted in the deaths of more than 400 Nigerian civilians, according to SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based research firm.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-nigeria-spate-of-airstrikes-killing-civilians-sparks-concern/7935425.html	2025-01-13T13:30:43-08:00	
China's EV sales surge in 2024; foreign automakers struggle in shifting market	A new industry report released Monday shows China made big strides last year toward an EV-driven future, as domestic sales of all types of electric vehicles rose by 40% in 2024. Sales of gasoline powered cars tumbled, including foreign imports. In 2024, a total of 31.4 million total vehicles were sold in the world’s largest automobile market by sales, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That marked a 4.5% rise compared with the previous year. Despite the uptick in sales, foreign automobile importers are increasingly finding it hard to compete with local brands in China who have been offering a wide variety of affordable EVs and intensified market competition. One example is German luxury car maker Porsche, who closed several of its physical stores in China in 2024. Porsche sales in China were down 29% year on year which marked the third consecutive year of decline. In addition to Porsche, luxury carmakers BMW, Mercedes, and Audi each saw a drop in their vehicle sales in China in 2024 with BMW sales falling 13.4%, Mercedes sales by 7%, and Audi sales by 11%. Tai Chih-yen, an associate researcher at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research in Taipei told VOA’s Mandarin service that a sense of patriotism and support for national brands has created additional pressures that have contributed to the struggles international automakers are facing. 'Higher-end consumers have started to abandon foreign brands and are turning to comparatively better priced high-end domestic cars,' Tai told VOA. 'This is not a so-called consumption downgrade, but more a reflection of the current situation, where many are choosing to be more discreet [in the kinds of cars they drive] and show their patriotism by driving domestic luxury brands.' The industry report also noted that sales of traditional gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles in China sank 17% in 2024, from 14 million to 11.6 million, a slide that coincides with Beijing’s focus on transitioning to electric vehicles. At the same time, Chinese vehicle exports were up 19.3% in 2024, according to the report. However, export growth is expected to cool with the report estimating only a 5.8% increase in 2025. China faced a backlash in 2024 as it moved to expand EV sales overseas, with the U.S., Canada and EU unveiling steep tariffs to stop a flood of cheap electric vehicles into their markets. The U.S., Canada and EU have raised concerns about subsidies that the Chinese government provides EV makers that allows them to sell their cars for lower prices. They have also voiced concerned that China has too much production of EVs and that cars are being dumped into foreign markets, allegations that Beijing has repeatedly denied. China argues that its EV subsidies are similar to those of other countries and that sales of electric vehicles help with climate change. China has filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization over the EU’s tariff decision. Michael Baturin and VOA Mandarin Service reporter Nai-chuan Lin contributed to this report.

At least 100 illegal miners died trapped in South African mine	JOHANNESBURG — At least 100 people who were mining illegally in an abandoned gold mine in South Africa have died after being trapped deep underground for months while police tried to get them out, a group representing the miners said Monday. Sabelo Mnguni, a spokesperson for the Mining Affected Communities United in Action Group told The Associated Press that a cellphone sent to the surface with some rescued miners Friday had two videos on it showing dozens of bodies underground wrapped in plastic. Mnguni said 'a minimum' of 100 men had died in the mine in North West province where police first launched an operation in November to force the miners out. They were suspected to have died of starvation or dehydration, Mnguni said. He said 18 bodies have been brought out since Friday. Police spokesperson Brig. Sebata Mokgwabone said they were still verifying information on how many bodies had been recovered and how many survivors were brought out after starting a new rescue operation Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-100-illegal-miners-died-trapped-in-south-african-mine/7935416.html	2025-01-13T13:14:13-08:00	
Biden defends foreign policy record despite ongoing crises	Washington — Outgoing President Joe Biden sought to burnish his foreign policy record Monday and said U.S. adversaries are weaker than when he took office four years ago despite global crises that remain unresolved. A week before handing over to President-elect Donald Trump, Biden in a rare State Department speech touted his administration's backing for Ukraine against Russia's 2022 invasion and for Israel's wars in the Middle East. Biden said the United States was 'winning the worldwide competition' and would not be surpassed economically by China as had been predicted, while Russia and Iran have been weakened by wars without direct U.S. involvement. 'Compared to four years ago, America is stronger, our alliances are stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker,' Biden said. 'We have not gone to war to make these things happen.' While wars continue to rage in Ukraine and the Middle East, officials hope a deal between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas can be reached before Biden departs the White House on Jan. 20. Biden said negotiators were close to reaching a deal that would free hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and halt the fighting in the Palestinian enclave to allow a surge of humanitarian aid. 'So many innocent people have been killed, so many communities have been destroyed. Palestinian people deserve peace,' he said. Biden has faced criticism for providing Israel with weapons and diplomatic support during its assault on Gaza after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 46,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials, with much of the enclave laid to waste and most of its population displaced. Protesters shouting 'war criminal' greeted Biden outside the State Department on Monday, some with signs and some throwing red liquid intended to look like blood. Biden said he had helped Israel defeat adversaries like Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both backed by Iran. The U.S. president also hailed Washington's support for Israel during two Iranian attacks in 2024. 'All told, Iran is weaker than it's been in decades,' he added, noting the collapse of the Syrian Assad government. 'There's no question that our actions contributed significantly.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-defends-foreign-policy-record-despite-ongoing-crises/7935441.html	2025-01-13T13:06:33-08:00	
Biggest European allies to swiftly implement new NATO targets, Berlin says	BERLIN — Germany, Poland, Britain, France and Italy will implement as swiftly as possible new NATO targets for weapons and troop numbers which the alliance is about to agree upon, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius pledged on Monday. The chief of NATO's Military Committee, Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer, told Reuters earlier that the alliance aims to bring forward the decision on new targets for weapons and troop numbers to this summer. The Western military and political alliance has been under pressure not only in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine but also internally, with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump calling on its members to spend much more on defense. A NATO summit in The Hague at the end of June will also discuss hiking NATO's existing military spending target of 2% of national GDP, with 3% being floated by some experts as one potential new target. Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20, recently urged a 5% goal. Speaking after a meeting with his four counterparts in the Polish village of Nowa Wies, Pistorius welcomed NATO's decision to fix the alliance's new capability targets in June instead of October as originally planned, a move he said was triggered by a German request. 'This buys us a lot of time and we can much earlier kick off the implementation,' Pistorius told reporters. At the same time, he rejected Trump's push to have members raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, arguing this would equal more than 40% of Germany's total budget. 'The crucial question for me is: How fast do we … every single ally, manage to meet NATO's new capability targets? … How quickly are we fully capable of defending ourselves when we need to be?' Pistorius said. France's defense minister, Sebastien Lecornu, said military budgets would continue to increase but did not specify a figure for a new NATO target. 'The situation is worse than it was during the Cold War. ... We can be defeated without being invaded,' he said, referring to cyberattacks. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said the next meeting of the Group of Five in Paris would discuss how to finance the organization and the development of the arms industry in Europe. 'We will coordinate all defense-related activities between our countries. This is a priority. Europe must show its strength. Europe can again be a beacon for the whole world, it just needs to say clearly: Security is number one,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biggest-european-allies-to-swiftly-implement-new-nato-targets-berlin-says/7935426.html	2025-01-13T12:57:52-08:00	
Baltimore prosecutors back Adnan Syed's request to have his sentence reduced to time served	Baltiomore, Md. — Baltimore prosecutors filed a motion supporting Adnan Syed's recent request to have his sentence reduced to time served, which could ensure he remains free indefinitely as he awaits further court decisions in a decadeslong legal saga that amassed a large following from the hit podcast 'Serial.' Syed was released from prison in 2022 after prosecutors asked a judge to overturn his murder conviction in the 1999 slaying of his high school ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. But challenges from Lee's family later led to his conviction being reinstated. In August, the Maryland Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision ordering a new hearing about vacating the conviction. Last month, Syed's attorneys filed a motion asking for his sentence to be reduced under Maryland's relatively new Juvenile Restoration Act, which allows people serving long sentences for crimes they committed as minors to seek release after 20 years behind bars. The legislation was passed amid growing consensus that such defendants are especially open to rehabilitation, in part because brain science shows cognitive development continues well beyond the teenage years. Syed was 17 when Lee was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave. Prosecutors filed the motion in support of a sentence reduction on Sunday, according to the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office. In it, State's Attorney Ivan Bates said Syed's request is 'in the interest of justice.' 'I truly believe Mr. Syed's case is precisely what legislators envisioned when they crafted the Juvenile Restoration Act,' Bates said in a statement Monday. 'We have an individual who has served over 20 years in prison from the time he was a teenager and who has displayed tremendous personal growth and reform.' But attorneys for the Lee family argue it's premature to consider a sentence reduction while the integrity of the conviction is still up in the air. 'That question regarding ultimate guilt or innocence needs to be resolved before any thought of reducing Mr. Syed's sentence can be considered,' attorney David Sanford said in a statement. 'Currently Mr. Syed remains a convicted murderer and nothing the State or Mr. Syed has ever presented calls that fact into question.' The case, which has been rife with legal twists and turns, has more recently pitted criminal justice reform efforts against the rights of crime victims and their families, whose voices are often at odds with a growing movement to acknowledge and correct longstanding issues such as systemic racism, police misconduct and prosecutorial missteps. Since his release in 2022, Syed has been working at Georgetown University's Prisons and Justice Initiative and helping care for his aging parents, according to court filings. His father died in October after a long illness. 'He cares so much about our family,' his mother wrote in a recent letter to the court. 'He is married and tries to be the best husband he can. He is always trying to help us out anyway that he can. He has tried hard to become a positive member of his community.' Syed has maintained his innocence from the beginning, but many questions about the case remain unanswered even after the 'Serial' podcast combed through the evidence, reexamined legal arguments and interviewed witnesses. The series debuted in 2014 and drew millions of listeners who became armchair detectives. Prosecutors wrote that since his release from prison in 2022, Syed, 43, has shown he doesn't pose a threat to public safety. 'In taking this position, the State does not want to minimize the seriousness of the crime in this case,' the motion says. 'The State, however, does not believe in warehousing individuals who committed a crime when they were a juvenile and have demonstrated maturity, have been rehabilitated [and] are now fit to reenter society.' But the motion doesn't present a position on Syed's conviction itself. The Maryland Supreme Court's 4-3 ruling in August called for a new hearing on whether the conviction should be vacated because the victim's relatives didn't receive adequate notice to allow them to attend the original proceeding, which won Syed his freedom. Bates, who took office as state's attorney a few months after the 2022 hearing, is now weighing how to proceed given the Supreme Court's decision. But if Syed's motion for a reduced sentence is granted, he would likely avoid going back to prison regardless.	https://www.voanews.com/a/baltimore-prosecutors-back-adnan-syed-s-request-to-have-his-sentence-reduced-to-time-served/7935393.html	2025-01-13T12:55:14-08:00	
Sahel vacuum provides opportunities for China, analysts say	JOHANNESBURG — Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, Africa’s Sahel region is experiencing security problems and surging anti-Western sentiment that could prove an opportunity for China, analysts say. China’s top diplomat was in the volatile Sahel last week as a part of his weeklong trip to the continent, where he pledged military aid on a visit that happened to coincide with an attack on the presidential compound in Chad. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit also came amid a spat between France and its former African colonies. In Nigeria, on the last leg of what has become a regular January trip to Africa, Wang said China would help train 6,000 troops and 1,000 police officers across the continent. Additionally, he pledged $136 million in military aid to the region. His pledge was a reiteration of Beijing’s promises at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in September. But the choices of countries on his itinerary, including Chad and Nigeria, were telling, experts said. 'Wang's focus on military aid and training, and the choice of countries to be visited, is in line with China's new focus on defense diplomacy as opposed to the purely economic and diplomatic engagements that used to characterize Chinese engagement with the continent a decade ago,' Darren Olivier, director of the conflict research consultancy African Defense Review, told VOA. Both Chad and Nigeria are battling insurgencies, and just a few hours after Wang met with Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby – who seized power in a 2021 coup – Deby’s compound was attacked by armed men. The attack failed, but the incident 'emphasizes the insecurity' in the region on which China could be looking to capitalize, said Alex Vines, Africa program director at Chatham House. 'There is a mercantilist, commercial element to Wang’s trip, which is to look at where to expand on market share, and Nigeria and Chad are very much in the market for defense sales and diversifying their security partnerships,' Vines told VOA. In fact, China has already surpassed Russia as the top arms supplier to sub-Saharan Africa. Oluwole Ojewale, a Nigerian researcher with the Institute for Security Studies, said Nigeria has had trouble in the past buying weapons from the U.S. due to alleged rights violations, which has prompted it to look elsewhere. 'For the case of Chad and most countries who are decoupling from the France security partnership … it is almost expected that they also need to look for other international partners that can provide some form of help in terms of armaments, in terms of training,' Ojewale said of the Chinese announcement. Macron raises ire Chad in December became the latest Sahel country to kick out French troops that had been operating military bases in the country for years, following the lead of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Senegal and Ivory Coast have also now asked French forces to withdraw. The trend comes amid rising anti-French sentiment in a region that has been dubbed Africa’s 'coup belt' for the number of military takeovers in recent years. French President Emmanuel Macron heightened such sentiment last week when he said France’s former colonies 'forgot to say thank you' for Paris’ security efforts in West Africa, adding that 'none of them would be in a sovereign country today if the French army had not been deployed in this region.' The U.S. has also been made to pull out of the Sahel, with Niger demanding Washington withdraw about 1,000 troops last year and close its largest drone base in Africa. The U.S. has been struggling to maintain influence in the region, where it had been supporting counter-terror efforts for years. The Pentagon is currently looking at maintaining a smaller force presence in the region. Some West African countries, such as Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, have turned for help to Russia, which publicly emphasizes its lack of colonial history. China takes a similar tack, positioning itself as a fellow 'Global South' developing country that doesn’t preach to Africa on human rights or other issues. Of Macron’s 'clumsiness,' Vines said, 'China will kind of capitalize on it … and the Chinese will privately point out, look, you know, this is what’s different from us.' Paul Nantulya, a China analyst at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, noted that China has recently become bolder in taking advantage of the French vacuum by delivering batches of high-end security equipment to Sahel countries over the last 15 months. 'And at the FOCAC summit, the representatives of these military regimes were received very, very well in Beijing,' he said, adding that they also visited weapons manufacturers during their time in China. Filling a vacuum At FOCAC, China also emphasized its Global Security Initiative (GSI), which was proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2022 as an alternative to the existing world order in terms of solving conflicts and ensuring peace. China’s vision of a foreign security policy includes seeking 'the biggest common denominator and the widest converging interests, rather than create closed small circles or reshape the existing international security order.' While the initiative may signal China’s desire to play a bigger role in international politics, Cobus van Staden, a China researcher with the South African Institute for International Affairs, said Beijing is anti-interventionist and while it might provide training, it’s not going to commit to being a security provider itself. 'Overall, what struck me about the comments was that while they were talking about this kind of military cooperation, Wang was always framing that under the Global Security Initiative which focuses on self-sufficiency rather than external security provisions,' he told VOA. Deborah Brautigam, director of the Chinese Africa research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, echoed this. 'Military aid and training are low-key, low-cost forms of support that also help open markets to Chinese arms exports. They’re opportunistic and unlikely to be a pathway into the stationing of troops or deeper military engagement,' she told VOA. Christian Geraud Neema, Africa editor at the China-Global South Project, said he thinks China will stay away from getting directly involved in African crises to 'avoid any blowback in case of failures.' 'When speaking with decision-makers on the continent, many have a hard time telling you what China's GSI is about and how concretely it can fit to their context,' he added. 'So many of them consider China an easier option for military equipment than anything else.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sahel-vacuum-provides-opportunities-for-china-analysts-say/7935372.html	2025-01-13T12:45:26-08:00	
Rights activist links brief kidnapping in Kenya to Tanzanian government	Nairobi, Kenya — A Tanzanian human rights activist who was briefly abducted on Sunday says she was targeted because of her comments accusing the government of abusing and oppressing its people. Maria Sarungi Tsehai was kidnapped in Nairobi by unidentified gunmen, alarming fellow activists. Tanzanian human rights activist Maria Sarungi Tsehai said she is fortunate to be free after armed men abducted her in Kenya’s capital Sunday afternoon. Tsehai said she was out walking when three men grabbed her, bundled her into a vehicle and physically assaulted her as they tried to establish her identity and gain access to her mobile phone. 'I am sure part of the abduction was to get access to my devices and to get access to the activities I do online, which sometimes include whistleblowing and also doing a lot about abductions in Tanzania. That's the first thing I felt they really wanted,' she said. The Tanzanian national, who has been living in Kenya for the past four years, has criticized her country’s government and the ruling party for alleged human rights violations and for closing civic space for critics, journalists, opposition groups, and politicians. The armed men eventually abandoned her on a street in the dark and told her not to look back. Tsehai said she was able to secure some of her belongings and money and take a cab ride home, where she contacted family members and supporters who had posted on social media about her disappearance, and had trooped to police stations trying to find her. There was no immediate comment from Tanzanian officials on the alleged abduction. Kenya has seen an increase in the abduction of foreigners in recent months. Several Turkish asylum seekers were abducted in October, and four of them were sent back to their country, a move that has angered the United Nations and rights groups. A month later, Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye found himself in front of a Ugandan military court; his wife said he was kidnapped in Nairobi. Roland Ebole is an East African regional researcher at Amnesty International. He said the kidnapping trend is not good for Kenya if it wants to attract foreign business and diplomatic activity. 'This is a very dangerous precedent for Kenya, considering that we host many expatriates in this country. Kenya is set to be the third largest U.N. hub in the world, and when foreign nationals do not feel protected, they don't feel secure in this country, then this is really dangerous,' he said. Rights groups such as Amnesty are also following up on the abduction of Kenyan government critics, a trend that started after anti-government protests in June and July that included the storming of parliament by critics of a bill to increase taxes. Despite the recent human rights violations in Kenya, Tsehai said she feels safer in Kenya than in Tanzania due to its vibrant citizens' movement for good governance, rights, and the rule of law. 'What I experienced yesterday, I don't know how many people know when you are being abducted and you see people fighting for you, and they don't know who you are. That gives me a sense. Later, I was told that social media Kenyans were trending and commenting about it as if I was one of their own. The second that gives me safety and security, unlike in Tanzania, there is a rule of law,' she said. Tanzania is expected to hold a general election later this year, and rights groups and opposition groups are already predicting the government will attempt to stifle dissent and political activity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-activist-links-brief-kidnapping-in-kenya-to-tanzanian-government/7935276.html	2025-01-13T11:43:23-08:00	
Pakistan claims killing 27 Baloch insurgents	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan reported Monday that its security forces raided a 'terrorists’ location' in southwestern Balochistan province and killed 27 insurgents during what was described as an intelligence-driven operation. A military statement said that 'multiple hideouts, including caches of arms, ammunition, and explosives, were also destroyed during the operation' in the central Kachhi district of the large but sparsely populated province. The announcement noted that law enforcement agencies wanted the slain insurgents for allegedly orchestrating 'terrorist activities' against security personnel and civilians in the district, where the outlawed separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and its allies are active. VOA could not immediately verify the official claims from independent sources, nor have Baloch insurgents commented on them. Regional experts describe BLA as the largest and most lethal of all the separatist groups active in natural resources-rich Balochistan, which sits on Pakistan’s border with Iran and Afghanistan. The group, designated as a global terrorist organization by the United States, has claimed almost all local attacks in recent months, killing and injuring hundreds of people, mainly security forces. Last week, dozens of heavily armed BLA fighters invaded the town of Zehri in the Khuzdar district of the province. They briefly took control of government facilities, including a security installation, and robbed a bank before setting several buildings on fire and escaping the area, according to the insurgent group and Pakistani officials. The daring daylight insurgent attack sparked criticism regarding an alleged delay in the response of Pakistani security forces to the BLA strikes. 'Those responsible must explain how terrorists were able to commandeer the area for eight hours,' the English-language DAWN newspaper wrote in a subsequent editorial. The provincial government initiated an investigation into the attack, resulting in the dismissal of over a dozen members of the paramilitary Balochistan Levies force for their alleged failure to resist the insurgents and surrender their weapons. Insurgents allege that the central and provincial Pakistani governments exploit Balochistan’s natural resources, such as gold and copper, while disregarding the poverty-stricken local population. Islamabad rejects the charges as baseless, saying that massive infrastructure development projects are underway in the province, including those funded by China. BLA has also targeted Chinese nationals associated with some of the projects in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-claims-killing-27-baloch-insurgents/7935268.html	2025-01-13T11:35:15-08:00	
Judge clears way for release of special counsel Smith's report on Trump's Jan. 6 case	WASHINGTON — The Justice Department can publicly release its investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump's 2020 election interference case, a federal judge said Monday — the latest ruling in a court dispute over the highly anticipated document days before Trump is set to take office again. But a temporary injunction barring the immediate release of the report remains in effect until Tuesday, and it's unlikely U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon's order will be the last word on the matter. Defense lawyers may seek to challenge it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Cannon had earlier temporarily blocked the department from releasing the entire report on former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump that led to two separate criminal cases. Cannon's latest order on Monday cleared the way for the release of the volume on Trump's 2020 election interference case. She set a hearing for Friday on whether the department can release to lawmakers the volume on Trump's classified documents case. The department has said it will not publicly disclose that volume as long as criminal proceedings against two of Trump's co-defendants remain pending. Smith resigned his position on Friday after transmitting his report to Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Justice Department revealed in a footnote in a court filing over the weekend. The ruling, if it stands, could open the door for the public to learn additional details in the coming days about Trump's frantic but ultimately failed effort to cling to power in the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. But even as Cannon permitted the release of the volume on election interference, she halted the Justice Department from immediately sharing with congressional officials a separate volume related to Trump's hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Lawyers for the Republican president-elect's two co-defendants, Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would prejudice them given that criminal proceedings remain ongoing against them in the form of a Justice Department appeal of Cannon's dismissal of charges. As a compromise, the Justice Department said that it would not make that document public but would instead share it with select congressional officials for their private review. But Cannon halted those plans and instead scheduled a hearing for Friday afternoon. 'All parties agree that Volume II expressly and directly concerns this criminal proceeding,' she wrote. 'All parties also appear to agree that public release of Volume II would be inconsistent with the fair trial rights of Defendants Nauta and De Oliveira and with Department of Justice Policy governing the release of information during the pendency of criminal proceedings.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-clears-way-for-release-of-special-counsel-smith-s-report-on-trump-s-jan-6-case-/7935226.html	2025-01-13T10:42:47-08:00	
Haitian police arrest ex-lawmaker accused of arming gangs to influence elections	PORT-AU-PRINCE — Police in Haiti have arrested a former legislator long accused of arming gangs in the country’s central region and previously sanctioned by the U.S. and Canada. Prophane Victor, an ex-member of Parliament who represented the Petite Riviere community of the Artibonite region, was arrested Sunday in the capital, Port-au-Prince, according to Haiti’s National Police. It wasn’t immediately clear if Victor had an attorney. His arrest marks a rare win for Haitian police in a country where high-ranking politicians accused in killings and gang activity often act with impunity and move about the country freely. Police said in a statement that a former gang leader had accused Victor several times of colluding with gang members operating in Artibonite, especially in the community of Savien. Meanwhile, a U.N. report released last year noted that Victor began arming young men in Petite Riviere to secure his 2016 election win. Those men eventually formed Gran Grif, the largest gang in Artibonite. The report noted that Victor had a falling out with Gran Grif in 2020 'as a result of unfulfilled promises made during the election period.' Since then, officials accused Victor of supporting rival gangs. Canada sanctioned Victor in June 2023 as did the U.S. in September 2024, accusing him of supporting gangs 'that have committed serious human rights abuse.' In October, the Gran Grif gang was accused of killings dozens of people in one of the biggest massacres in Haiti’s recent history. The massacre occurred in the community of Pont-Sonde, located in the Artibonite region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haitian-police-arrest-ex-lawmaker-accused-of-arming-gangs-to-influence-elections-/7935101.html	2025-01-13T09:37:14-08:00	
US designates extreme right-wing 'Terrorgram' network as terrorist group	WASHINGTON — The U.S. on Monday imposed sanctions on an extreme right-wing online network, designating the 'Terrorgram' collective a terrorist group and accusing it of promoting violent white supremacy. The U.S. State Department said in a statement that it had designated the group, which primarily operates on the Telegram social media site, and three of its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. The State Department said the group has motivated and facilitated attacks and attempted attacks by users, including a 2022 shooting outside an LGBTQ bar in Slovakia, a planned attack in 2024 on energy facilities in New Jersey and an August knife attack at a mosque in Turkey. 'The group promotes violent white supremacism, solicits attacks on perceived adversaries, and provides guidance and instructional materials on tactics, methods, and targets for attacks, including on critical infrastructure and government officials,' the State Department said. The action freezes any of the group's U.S. assets and bars Americans from dealing with it. The leaders targeted on Monday with sanctions were based in Brazil, Croatia and South Africa, according to the statement. In September, U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges against two alleged leaders of the group, saying they used Telegram to solicit attacks on Black, Jewish, LGBTQ people and immigrants with the aim of inciting a race war. Britain in April said it would proscribe the Terrorgram collective as a terrorist organization, meaning it would become a criminal offense in the country to belong to or promote the group. U.S. President Joe Biden has railed against white supremacy while in office. In 2021, Biden launched the first-ever U.S. National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, which included resources to identify and prosecute threats and new deterrents to prevent Americans from joining dangerous groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-designates-extreme-right-wing-terrorgram-network-as-terrorist-group/7935044.html	2025-01-13T09:16:35-08:00	
Lebanon's Salam wins enough support to become PM, angering Hezbollah	BEIRUT — Nawaf Salam, the head of the International Court of Justice, won enough support to become Lebanon's next prime minister after a majority of lawmakers backed him for the post on Monday, a big blow to Hezbollah which accused opponents of working to exclude it. The support for Salam underlined the major shift in the power balance among Lebanon's sectarian factions since the Shi'ite group Hezbollah was pummeled in a war with Israel last year, and its Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad was toppled. Senior Hezbollah lawmaker Mohammed Raad, whose Iran-backed group had wanted incumbent Najib Mikati to stay in the post, said Hezbollah's opponents were working for fragmentation and exclusion. He said the group had 'extended its hand' by electing Joseph Aoun as president last week only to find the 'hand cut.' Last week's election of army commander General Aoun, who enjoys the support of the United States and Saudi Arabia, was another sign of shifts in the political landscape, in which Hezbollah had long held decisive sway. Aoun, a Maronite Christian, was holding consultations over the choice of prime minister with parliament's 128 lawmakers on Monday. He is obliged to pick the candidate with the greatest number of votes. Salam had secured the backing of 85 of the lawmakers by Monday afternoon, with the consultations yet to conclude. The prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim according to Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system which parcels out state positions on the basis of religious affiliation. The presidency goes to a Maronite Christian and the speaker of parliament must be a Shiite Muslim. Hezbollah lawmakers attended their meeting with Aoun later than scheduled, delaying their arrival as they saw the momentum building behind Salam, a Hezbollah source said. Hezbollah believed a political understanding had been reached on Mikati's election before the group agreed to elect Aoun last week, the source said. Sunni and Christian allies of Hezbollah were among those who named Salam. Faisal Karami, a Sunni lawmaker aligned with the group, said he had nominated Salam, citing demands for 'change and renewal' and Arab and international support for Lebanon. Aoun's election and the designation of a new premier are steps towards reviving Lebanese government institutions which have been paralyzed for more than two years, with the country having neither a head of state nor a fully empowered cabinet. The new administration faces huge tasks including rebuilding areas leveled by Israeli airstrikes during the war with Hezbollah, and launching long-stalled reforms to revive the economy and address the root causes of the collapse of Lebanon's financial system in 2019. In his former role as commander of the U.S.-backed army, Aoun played a critical role in the implementation of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah. The terms require the Lebanese army to deploy into south Lebanon as Israeli troops and Hezbollah withdraw forces. Raad said Hezbollah would follow the next steps, and 'proceed with calm and wisdom, out of concern for the national interest, and we will see their actions ... to expel the occupier from our land.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-s-salam-wins-enough-support-to-become-pm-angering-hezbollah/7935008.html	2025-01-13T08:25:51-08:00	
Russia says Iran's president will visit this week, sign partnership pact with Putin	Moscow — Russian President Vladimir Putin will host his Iranian counterpart this week for the signing of a broad partnership pact between Moscow and Tehran, the Kremlin said Monday. The agreement on 'comprehensive strategic partnership' between the countries will be signed during Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's visit to Moscow on Friday, the Kremlin said. It added that the leaders will discuss plans for expanding trade and cooperation in transport, logistics and humanitarian spheres along with 'acute issues on the regional and international agenda.' Ukraine and the West have accused Tehran of providing Moscow with hundreds of exploding drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine and helping launch their production in Russia. The Iranian drone deliveries, which Moscow and Tehran have denied, have allowed for a barrage of long-range drone strikes on Ukraine's infrastructure. Iran, in turn, wants sophisticated Russian weapons like long-range air defense systems and fighter jets to help fend off possible attacks by Israel. Pezeshkian will visit Moscow three days before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to broker a peace deal on Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-iran-s-president-will-visit-this-week-sign-partnership-pact-with-putin/7934862.html	2025-01-13T07:05:03-08:00	
At least 40 farmers killed by Islamic militants in northeast Nigeria, official says	Dakar, Senegal — At least 40 farmers were killed in an attack by Islamic militants in northeast Nigeria's Borno state, a government official said Monday. The attack Sunday was suspected to have been carried out by extremists from the Boko Haram group and its breakaway faction that is loyal to the Islamic State group in Borno's Dumba community, said Borno state Gov. Babagana Umara Zulum. He warned civilians to stay within designated 'safe zones' that have been cleared by the army of both extremists and munitions. Zulum also called for an investigation into the attack by the armed forces. 'Let me assure the citizens of Borno that this matter will be thoroughly investigated for further necessary action. Let me use this opportunity to call on the armed forces to track and deal decisively with the perpetrators of this heinous act of violence against our innocent citizens,' he said. Boko Haram, Nigeria's homegrown jihadis, took up arms in 2009 to fight Western education and impose their radical version of Islamic law. The conflict, now Africa's longest struggle with militancy, has spilled into Nigeria's northern neighbors. Some 35,000 civilians have been killed and more than 2 million have been displaced in the northeastern region, according to the U.N. The 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram in the village of Chibok in Borno state — the epicenter of the conflict — captured the attention of the world.	https://www.voanews.com/a/farmers-killed-by-islamic-militants-in-northeast-nigeria-official-says/7934904.html	2025-01-13T07:04:41-08:00

Magnitude 6.9 earthquake rattles southwestern Japan, followed by tsunami warning	Tokyo — A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 has hit southwestern Japan, the country's Meteorological Agency said Monday. Tsunami warnings were issued for Miyazaki Prefecture, where the temblor was centered, in the southwestern island of Kyushu, as well as nearby Kochi Prefecture, shortly after the quake struck at 9:19 p.m. local time, according to the agency. The extent of damage was not immediately clear. Japan is frequently hit by earthquakes because of its location along the 'Ring of Fire,' an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquake-rattles-southwestern-japan-followed-by-tsunami-warning/7934799.html	2025-01-13T05:46:55-08:00	
Taiwan's spy agency says China is working with gangs, shell companies to gain intelligence on Taiwan	TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan's intelligence bureau says China's main spy agency is working with criminal gangs, shell companies and other dubious partners to gain intelligence on Taiwan's defenses, resulting in a major rise in those arrested for alleged espionage on the island. Current and retired Taiwanese military personnel are a special concern, accounting for around half of the 64 alleged spies put on trial last year, it said. That number is up from 16 in 2021 and 10 in 2022. The arrests are in line with China's stepped-up campaign of military intimidation, economic coercion and 'gray area' tactics such as utilizing the internet to promote unification and providing all-expense-paid trips to China to low-level government officials. According to a report released over the weekend by Taiwan's National Security Bureau, Chinese agents have sought to use the Taiwanese underworld to channel funds to those with information to sell. Gangs, many with origins dating to before the 1949 split between the two sides, are sought out, along with loan sharks, shell companies that can be used to launder funds, religious sects that sometimes engage in illegal activity, and non-profit groups, the report said. Some payments are made in cryptocurrency, while old-fashioned methods are also used such as sexual seduction to trap unsuspecting targets and pressure them to reveal secrets. That was the case of a one-star general, Lo Hsien-che, who was caught in such a scheme while stationed in Thailand, the bureau said. Among those arrested last year were 23 people working together in a spy ring, one of whom was sentenced to 20 years in prison, it said. China's main spy agency, the State Security Ministry, runs programs relying on traditional spy craft and cyberattacks, along with military intelligence, while the party's United Front division runs propaganda campaigns. China's ruling Communist Party, which refuses most contact with Taiwan's governing pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, has frequent contacts with the main opposition Nationalist Party. Chinese tactics may have had some effect on local elections, but the DPP appears to be firmly in control and the vast majority of Taiwanese still favor maintaining their de facto independence, backed by strong support from the U.S. China's recruitment of retired military personnel has been facilitated by many having been born in mainland China and backing unification between Taiwan and the mainland. Taiwan's government has enacted time limits on when retired senior officers can visit the mainland and under what circumstances in an attempt to prevent their recruitment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-spy-agency-says-china-is-working-with-gangs-shell-companies-to-gain-intelligence-on-taiwan-/7934787.html	2025-01-13T05:34:31-08:00	
India's Modi inaugurates strategic tunnel in disputed Kashmir	JAMMU, India — India's prime minister marked Monday the opening of a tunnel in the northeast of disputed Kashmir that will grant all-year accessibility to a town that is isolated by heavy snow each winter. The $932 million project includes a second tunnel and a series of bridges and high mountain roads that will link Kashmir with Ladakh, a cold desert region nestled between India, Pakistan and China that has faced territorial disputes for decades. Amid high security, Narendra Modi visited the resort town of Sonamarg where he inaugurated the 6.5-kilometer tunnel. The town denotes the end of the conifer-clad mountains of the Kashmir Valley before Ladakh begins across the rocky Zojila mountain pass. The tunnel, named Z-Morh, will now grant it accessibility for the first time all year round. The second tunnel, about 14 kilometers long, will bypass the challenging Zojila pass and connect Sonamarg with Ladakh and is expected to be completed in 2026. Sonamarg and Ladakh have been plagued with severe snowfalls that close the mountain passes due to massive snowfalls, forcing them to remain cut off from neighboring towns for nearly six months every year. Authorities on Monday deployed police and soldiers in the area and established multiple checkpoints at key intersections as an enhanced security measure for the prime minister's visit. Troops also stationed sharpshooters at several points and carried out drone surveillance to ensure constant vigilance. Modi later at a public meeting, attended by hundreds of people in freezing weather, said the ambitious project would improve road connectivity and boost tourism in the region. The meeting also was attended by some of Modi's Cabinet ministers and Kashmir's chief minister Omar Abdullah. Experts say the tunnel project is important to the military, which will gain significantly improved capabilities to operate in Ladakh while also providing civilians with freedom of movement year-round between the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh. In October, gunmen fatally shot at least seven people working on the tunnel project and injured at least five others. Police blamed insurgents fighting for decades against Indian rule in the region. In 2019, New Delhi stripped Kashmir's special status as a semi-autonomous region with a separate constitution and inherited protections on land and jobs. The federal government also downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir, the first time in the history of India that a region's statehood was downgraded to a federally administered territory. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi's rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels' goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. Indian and Chinese soldiers have been engaged in a military standoff in Ladakh since 2020 even as Beijing and New Delhi agreed in October on patrols in disputed areas. Both countries have stationed tens of thousands of soldiers along their frontier, backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-modi-inaugurates-a-strategic-tunnel-in-disputed-kashmir/7934753.html	2025-01-13T04:52:43-08:00	
Biden administration unveils new rules for AI chip, model exports	— The Biden administration announced Monday new restrictions on the export of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips and proprietary parameters used to govern the interactions of users with AI systems. The rule, which will undergo a 120-day period for public comments, comes in response to what administration officials described as a need to protect national security while also clarifying the rules under which companies in trusted partner countries could access the emerging technology in order to promote innovation. 'Over the coming years, AI will become really ubiquitous in every business application in every industry around the world, with enormous potential for enhanced productivity and societal, healthcare and economic benefits,' Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters. 'That being said, as AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense.' A senior administration official said the new rule will not include any restrictions on chip sales to Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom or the United States. Countries that are under U.S. arms embargoes are already subject to export restrictions on advanced AI chips, but a senior administration official said they will now be under restrictions for the transfer of the most powerful closed weight AI models. The weights in an AI model determine how it processes the inputs from a user and determines what to provide the user as a response, according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. In a closed weight system, those parameters are secret, unlike with an open weight system in which users could see the settings the model is using to make its decisions. The majority of countries — those not included in the close partner or arms embargo lists — will not face licensing requirements for obtaining the equivalent of 1,700 of the most advanced AI chips currently available, nor for any less advanced chips. Companies in the United States and allied countries will not face restrictions in using the most powerful closed weight AI systems, provided they are stored under adequate security, a senior administration official said. 'I think the key point I would underscore is that we identified really some of the closest security allies of the United States that have effectively implemented and have a well-documented record of upholding a robust AI technology protection regime, and generally have technology ecosystems that promote the use of AI and other advanced technologies consistent with our national security and foreign policy interests,' a senior administration official said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-unveils-new-rules-for-ai-chip-model-exports-/7934695.html	2025-01-13T04:00:01-08:00

Mozambique to swear in new parliament after disputed vote	Maputo, Mozambique — Mozambique is set to swear in its new parliament on Monday, following months of deadly protests over an election in October that the opposition said was rigged. Opposition leader Venancio Mondlane has called on his supporters to hold peaceful protests from Monday to Wednesday, when Daniel Chapo is due to be installed as president. Mondlane said he won the presidential vote and that the results were rigged in favor of Chapo's Frelimo party, which has been in power for 50 years. Two opposition parties, Renamo and MDM, announced they would boycott Monday's session, which will swear in new parliamentarians. Renamo won 28 seats in the 250-seat house and the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) took eight. The opening ceremony 'constitutes a social outrage and a lack of respect for the will of Mozambicans' who were deprived of 'free, fair and transparent' elections, Renamo spokesman Marcial Macome told reporters Sunday. The MDM was boycotting to show it aligned itself with demands for 'electoral truth,' its representative said. Frelimo won 171 seats and the Podemos party took 43. Mondlane, who was backed by the Podemos at the vote, claims he won 53 percent of the votes in the presidential election. The official result says he won 24 percent to Chapo's 65 percent. Mondlane returned from more than two months of exile on Thursday last week to push his presidency claims. Thousands of his supporters rallied in the capital to welcome him, sparking clashes with security forces that left at least three dead, according to an election monitor. 'We must declare a national strike... paralyze activities during these three days,' the 50-year-old said in a Facebook post late Saturday. Urging supporters to 'demonstrate our refusal' of the official election result, he called for a 'peaceful mobilization,' adding that 'if the assembly takes the oath, it is a betrayal of the will of the people.' 'Let us demonstrate against the inauguration of those who betrayed the will of the people on Monday and against those who stole the will of the people on Wednesday,' Mondlane said. The post-election unrest has claimed around 300 lives, according to a tally by a local rights group, with security forces accused of using excessive force, including live bullets, against demonstrators. Some police officers have also died, according to the authorities. The unrest has caused major losses to Mozambique's economy, stopping cross-border trade and affecting shipping, mining and industry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-to-swear-in-new-parliament-after-disputed-vote/7934647.html	2025-01-13T02:18:25-08:00	
Exhausted' Frenchman held in Iran since 2022 reveals identity	PARIS — A Frenchman held in Iran since October 2022 on Monday revealed his identity in an audio message broadcast on a French radio station, saying he was becoming increasingly exhausted over his ordeal. Olivier Grondeau, 34, had previously only been identified by his first name and French authorities had not released details of his case. In an audio message aired on France Inter on Monday, Grondeau fully identified himself and warned that he and the other two French detainees held in Iran were 'exhausted.' The other two French nationals currently held in Iran are teacher Cecile Kohler and her partner, Jacques Paris, who were detained in May 2022. They are accused of seeking to stir up labor protests, accusations their families have vehemently denied. 'You, who have the power to influence this matter, hear this truth,' he said in the audio message, apparently addressing the French authorities. 'Cecile's strength, Jacques' strength, Olivier's strength — it is all running out,' he said. 'Your responsibility is called upon to ensure the survival of three human beings,' he said. Grondeau was arrested in Shiraz, in southern Iran, in October 2022, and sentenced to five years in prison for 'conspiracy against the Islamic republic,' his mother Therese Grondeau told France Inter. His family rejects the charges, describing Grondeau as a passionate fan of Persian poetry who was traveling to Iran on a tourist visa as part of a world tour. On Friday, France summoned the Iranian ambassador to protest Tehran's holding of the trio, describing them as 'state hostages.' Their 'situation is intolerable, with undignified detention conditions that, for some, constitute torture under international law,' the French foreign ministry said. The tensions have come after an Italian journalist, Cecilia Sala, arrested and jailed in Iran since December, was freed and returned to Rome earlier this month. Her swift release — in contrast to the prolonged detention of the French nationals — was the result of 'intense work through diplomatic and intelligence channels' by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government, her office said. Foreign ministries whose nationals have been held by Iran are known to sometimes advise families to keep a low profile and not announce the arrest of their loved ones publicly, in the hope the situation can be resolved behind the scenes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exhausted-frenchman-held-in-iran-since-2022-reveals-identity/7934638.html	2025-01-13T02:05:36-08:00	
Thai cabinet approves controversial casino bill	BANGKOK — Thailand's cabinet approved a controversial bill on Monday to legalize gambling in designated 'entertainment complexes' to boost tourism and create jobs. The proposed law would allow casinos to be set up within tourism complexes that would also include theme parks, water parks, hotels and shopping malls. Gambling in Thailand is currently only legal on certain state-run horse races and an official lottery, but illicit betting is widespread. 'The objectives are to increase revenue, support investment in Thailand and solve illegal gambling,' Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra told reporters. The bill will go to the Office of the Council of State for drafting before being debated and voted on by lawmakers in parliament -- a process that will likely take months. Since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, which hammered Thailand's crucial tourism industry, the kingdom has launched numerous strategies to lure more visitors, such as cutting visa requirements for Chinese and Indian travelers. Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat said the government hopes the entertainment complexes will ultimately boost tourist numbers by 5%-10% and create up to 15,000 new jobs. The location for the proposed complexes, and the timetable for their construction, have not been announced. Conservative forces in Buddhist-majority Thailand have long resisted moves to legalize gambling, even as casino complexes have sprung up in neighboring Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime warned in a report last year that Southeast Asia's casinos were 'foundational pieces of the banking architecture used by organized crime' to launder massive volumes of money.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-cabinet-approves-controversial-casino-bill/7934629.html	2025-01-13T01:49:39-08:00	
Forecasters warn of ‘explosive fire growth’ conditions amid deadly California wildfires	Firefighters in southern California are battling to bring multiple major Los Angeles area wildfires under control Monday as forecasters warn of renewed strong winds that could cause 'explosive fire growth.' The new wind threat, with the biggest concern happening Tuesday, is expected to bring sustained winds of 80 kph and gusts up to about 110 kph, the National Weather Service warned. Strong winds and dry conditions in an area that has not received significant rainfall for more than eight months helped fuel the fires that have already killed at least 24 people and caused billions of dollars in damage since they began a week ago. A brief reprieve in the winds in recent days allowed firefighters aided by air drops of water and fire retardant to make some progress in bringing the blazes under control. Of the three major fires still burning in the Los Angeles area, Cal Fire said late Sunday the Palisades Fire was 13% contained and has burned 96 square kilometers. Eight of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire in the Pacific Palisades area, officials said. Sixteen deaths were from the Eaton Fire, located farther inland in North Pasadena and Altadena, which was 27% contained and has burned nearly 60 square kilometers. Another blaze, the Hurst Fire in the Sylmar area, was 89% contained, Cal Fire said, after burning more than three square kilometers. The fires together have destroyed more than 12,000 structures. About 100,000 people remained under evacuation orders late Sunday, with officials saying people would not be allowed back in fire risk areas while the new wind warnings were still in place. Some schools that had canceled classes last week were resuming operations Monday. The National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers were also set to resume home games Monday after canceling games due to the fires. Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned art works, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top public U.S. universities. California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' on Sunday that the wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, 'in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope.' A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground is among the costliest in the country. Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on, with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the blazes as they quickly spread out of control. The governor said he is asking the same questions 'that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?’ Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply overwhelmed, 'Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was really no firefight that could've been more meaningful?' Firefighting crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday he told officials to prepare for the possibility of sending 150 Ukrainian firefighters to help the effort in California. 'The situation there is extremely difficult, and Ukrainians can help Americans save lives,' Zelenskyy said. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/forecasters-warn-of-explosive-fire-growth-conditions-amid-deadly-california-wildfires/7934627.html	2025-01-13T01:41:01-08:00	
South Korea says 300 North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine	Around 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and 2,700 others injured in Russia’s war in Ukraine, South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers in a closed briefing Monday. The National Intelligence Service said it had participated in the interrogation of several North Korean troops who were captured by Ukrainian forces. The briefing came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers during fighting in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces launched a surprise offensive in August. Zelenskyy said late Sunday he would send captured North Koreans back to their country if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un organizes a swap for Ukrainian soldiers being held in Russia. The Ukrainian leader said it is 'only a matter of time' before Ukraine captures more North Korean soldiers, and that Russia’s military 'is dependent on military assistance from North Korea.' Drone attacks Ukraine’s military said Monday it destroyed 78 of the 110 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks targeting regions across the country. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Mykolaiv Governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram that falling drone fragments damaged several houses, but did not hurt anyone. Russian shelling in his region injured one person, Kim said Monday. In Sumy, officials said Russian attacks caused a fire at a residential building and injured one person. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it destroyed six Ukrainian drones over the Voronezh region, as well as one drone over Belgorod and another drone over Bryansk. The ministry also said Monday that a Ukrainian drone attack Saturday targeted the TurkStream gas pipeline that is used to send Russian gas to Turkey and Europe.

Australian counter-terrorism police probe rise in antisemitic hate crimes	SYDNEY — Australian authorities are warning of escalating acts of antisemitism, which are now being investigated by counter-terrorism officers. A synagogue in Sydney, the country’s most populous city, was defaced Saturday with hate symbols and an attempt was made to start a fire. Red swastikas were daubed along the front fence of the synagogue in the latest act of hate thought to be linked to conflicts in the Middle East. Security images released by the police show two people wearing black hooded jackets and dark clothing outside the building. Authorities say the vandalism was an act of 'violence, hatred and racism.' New South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb on Sunday told reporters that every effort was being made to catch those responsible. 'I appeal to anyone out there who knows who has perpetrated these disgusting offenses to come forward and tell police who they are,' Webb said. 'We will continue pursuing them until we find them.' Counter-terrorism police have taken over all the investigations into recent hate attacks on synagogues and other properties in the Australian state of New South Wales. Last Friday, the Allawah synagogue in Sydney was defaced in a separate incident by antisemitic graffiti. Penny Sharpe, the acting premier of New South Wales, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Monday that a specialist counter-terrorism police unit would be in charge of the hate crimes investigations. 'They basically bring all of the intelligence we have about activity that is out there,' Sharpe said. 'They are able to coordinate at the local level and at the broader level and, really, call on and ask the community to also help as we get to the bottom of this and that we make sure that New South Wales is a safe place for everyone.' In a statement released to local media Sunday, the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, a prominent community organization, said the Jewish community remained 'unbowed' by attempts of intimidation. In December, a synagogue in Melbourne, Victoria was firebombed by assailants. Muslim groups also have recorded a surge in Islamophobic abuse since Israel’s war in Gaza began in October 2023. Last year, the government in Canberra set up specialist antisemitic and Islamophobia community envoys in an attempt to diffuse tensions in the Australian community.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-counter-terrorism-police-probe-rise-in-antisemitic-hate-crimes/7934602.html	2025-01-13T00:27:42-08:00	
South Korea plans to overhaul airport structures after fatal Jeju Air crash	Seoul, South Korea — South Korea said it planned to improve the structures housing the antennas that guide landings at its airports this year after December's fatal crash of a Jeju Air plane, which skidded off the runway and burst into flames after hitting such a structure. The country's transport ministry, which has been inspecting safety conditions at airlines and airports since the Boeing jet crashed at the southwestern Muan airport, announced on Monday the move to change the so-called 'localizer' structures. Seven domestic airports, including Muan, were found to have embankments or foundations made of concrete or steel that needed to be changed, the ministry said in a statement. It added that it would prepare measures to improve the structures by this month and it aimed to complete the improvements by the end of 2025. It did not provide details of the planned improvements. Aviation safety experts have criticized the placement of the embankment at Muan airport and said it likely raised the death toll of the crash, which killed 179 of the 181 people on board. The government has also finished its inspection of six domestic airlines flying Boeing 737-800s, and found violations at some operators including exceeding the period of inspection pre- and post-flight, and non-compliance with procedures to resolve plane defects or passenger boarding. The transport ministry declined to comment on whether Jeju Air was among the airlines where violations were found. A Jeju Air spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment. A special safety inspection of the country's major airport facilities will also take place between Jan. 13-21, the ministry statement said. The government also extended the shutdown of Muan airport to Jan. 19, the ministry said in a separate statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-plans-to-overhaul-airport-structures-after-fatal-jeju-air-crash/7934598.html	2025-01-13T00:12:51-08:00	
Philippines files protest over Beijing's 'escalatory actions' in South China Sea	Manila, Philippines — The Philippines on Monday called on Beijing to desist from 'escalatory actions' at a South China Sea shoal and said a protest has been lodged over the presence of Chinese coast guard, militia and navy in its exclusive economic zone. The protest stems from the presence of two coast guard vessels on Jan. 5 and Jan. 10 in and around the disputed Scarborough shoal, one of which was a 165-meter-long boat referred to by the Philippines as 'the monster.' It said a Chinese navy helicopter was also deployed in the area. 'The escalatory actions of these Chinese vessels and aircraft disregard Philippine and international laws,' said the Philippines' national maritime council, an inter-agency group tasked with upholding the country's interests at sea. 'China should direct its vessels to desist from conducting illegal actions that violate Philippines' sovereign rights in its EEZ,' it said in a statement. China's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China says the Scarborough Shoal is its territory and has accused the Philippines of trespassing. Tensions between China and the U.S. ally the Philippines have escalated the past two years, with frequent run-ins between their coast guards in the South China Sea, which China claims sovereignty over almost in its entirety. The statement came just hours after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had a virtual call with U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba where the three leaders discussed China's conduct in the South China Sea. China's expansive claims overlap with the EEZs of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The disputed waterway is a strategic shipping route through which about $3 trillion worth of commerce moves annually. A 2016 ruling of an international arbitral tribunal said Beijing's claims, based on its historic maps, have no basis under international law, a decision China does not recognize.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-files-protest-over-beijing-s-escalatory-actions-in-south-china-sea/7934590.html	2025-01-12T23:44:04-08:00	
China's rare earth exports in 2024 climb as home demand limited	BEIJING — China's exports of rare earth minerals rose 6% in 2024, customs data showed on Monday, as sputtering economic growth limited domestic demand. The world's largest producer of rare earths last year shipped 55,431 metric tons of 17 minerals used in the making of products ranging from electric vehicles to consumer electronics, General Administration of Customs data showed. That was the highest volume since Reuters' records back to 2014, but the total value of the exports slumped 36% to $488.8 million, the data showed, reflecting falling prices last year amid ample supply. The average spot price of praseodymium oxide in China, for example, fell 26% in 2024, following a drop of 37% in 2023, according to data from information provider Shanghai Metals Market (SMM). China exported 3,326 tons of rare earth minerals in December, down from 4,416 tons in November and 3,439 tons in December 2023. Imports China's rare earth imports last month dropped 41.1% from a year earlier to 9,645 tons, producing a 2024 total of 132,931 tons, down 24.4% from 2023. Analysts say the 2024 fall was mainly due to reduced supplies from the United States and Myanmar, the other two major producers of rare earths. An armed group fighting Myanmar's military regime said last October that it had taken control of a mining hub that is a major supplier of rare earth oxides to China, disrupting shipments. Imports from the U.S. and Myanmar slipped by 14.6% and 31.6% year-on-year, respectively, in the first 11 months of the year, China’s customs data showed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-rare-earth-exports-in-2024-climb-as-home-demand-limited/7934585.html	2025-01-12T23:35:24-08:00	
India kicks off Hindu festival touted as the world's largest religious gathering	PRAYAGRAJ, India — Millions of Hindu devotees, mystics and holy men and women from all across India flocked to the northern city of Prayagraj on Monday to kickstart the Maha Kumbh festival, which is being touted as the world's largest religious gathering. Over about the next six weeks, Hindu pilgrims with gather at the confluence of three sacred rivers — the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati — where they will take part in elaborate rituals, hoping to begin a journey to achieve Hindu philosophy's ultimate goal: the release from the cycle of rebirth. Here's what to know about the festival: A religious gathering at the confluence of three sacred rivers Hindus venerate rivers, and none more so than the Ganges and the Yamuna. The faithful believe that a dip in their waters will cleanse them of their past sins and end their process of reincarnation, particularly on auspicious days. The most propitious of these days occur in cycles of 12 years during a festival called the Maha Kumbh Mela, or pitcher festival. The festival is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at the confluence of three sacred rivers that dates to at least medieval times. Hindus believe that the mythical Saraswati river once flowed from the Himalayas through Prayagraj, meeting there with the Ganges and the Yamuna. Bathing takes place every day, but on the most auspicious dates, naked, ash-smeared monks charge toward the holy rivers at dawn. Many pilgrims stay for the entire festival, observing austerity, giving alms and bathing at sunrise every day. 'We feel peaceful here and attain salvation from the cycles of life and death,' said Bhagwat Prasad Tiwari, a pilgrim. The festival has its roots in a Hindu tradition that says the god Vishnu wrested a golden pitcher containing the nectar of immortality from demons. Hindus believe that a few drops fell in the cities of Prayagraj, Nasik, Ujjain and Haridwar — the four places where the Kumbh festival has been held for centuries. The Kumbh rotates among these four pilgrimage sites about every three years on a date prescribed by astrology. This year's festival is the biggest and grandest of them all. A smaller version of the festival, called Ardh Kumbh, or Half Kumbh, was organized in 2019, when 240 million visitors were recorded, with about 50 million taking a ritual bath on the busiest day. Maha Kumb is the world's largest such gathering At least 400 million people — more than the population of the United States — are expected in Prayagraj over the next 45 days, according to officials. That is around 200 times the 2 million pilgrims that arrived in the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage last year. The festival is a big test for Indian authorities to showcase the Hindu religion, tourism and crowd management. A vast ground along the banks of the rivers has been converted into a sprawling tent city equipped with more 3,000 kitchens and 150,000 restrooms. Divided into 25 sections and spreading over 40 square kilometers (15 square miles), the tent city also has housing, roads, electricity and water, communication towers and 11 hospitals. Murals depicting stories from Hindu scriptures are painted on the city walls. Indian Railways has also introduced more than 90 special trains that will make nearly 3,300 trips during the festival to transport devotees, beside regular trains. About 50,000 security personnel — a 50% increase from 2019 — are also stationed in the city to maintain law and order and crowd management. More than 2,500 cameras, some powered by AI, will send crowd movement and density information to four central control rooms, where officials can quickly deploy personnel to avoid stampedes. The festival will boost Modi's support base India's past leaders have capitalized on the festival to strengthen their relationship with the country's Hindus, who make up nearly 80% of India's more than 1.4 billion people. But under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the festival has become an integral part of its advocacy of Hindu nationalism. For Modi and his party, Indian civilization is inseparable from Hinduism, although critics say the party's philosophy is rooted in Hindu supremacy. The Uttar Pradesh state, headed by Adityanath — a powerful Hindu monk and a popular hard-line Hindu politician in Modi's party — has allocated more than $765 million for this year's event. It has also used the festival to boost his and the prime minister's image, with giant billboards and posters all over the city showing them both, alongside slogans touting their government welfare policies. The festival is expected to boost the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's past record of promoting Hindu cultural symbols for its support base. But recent Kumbh gatherings have also been caught in controversies. Modi's government changed the city's Mughal-era name from Allahabad to Prayagraj as part of its Muslim-to-Hindu name-changing effort nationwide ahead of the 2019 festival and the national election that his party won. In 2021, his government refused to call off the festival in Haridwar despite a surge in coronavirus cases, fearing a backlash from religious leaders in the Hindu-majority country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-kicks-off-hindu-festival-touted-as-the-world-s-largest-religious-gathering/7934559.html	2025-01-12T21:08:12-08:00

Malaysia imposes anti-dumping duties on iron, steel imports from 4 countries	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia's trade ministry said it has imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on some flat-rolled products of iron or non-alloy steel exports from China, India, Japan and South Korea. The duties, on products with a width of more than 600 mm, range from 2.52% to 36.80% and were effective from Jan. 11, the ministry said in a statement on Monday. The ministry said the provisional anti-dumping duties will be in effect for up to 120 days, with a final determination to be made by May 10, and that feedback on the preliminary determination could be submitted by Jan. 20. The ministry's decision followed an investigation into the products from China, India, Japan and South Korea that started in August, following a petition by a domestic producer. The ministry said the petitioner had alleged the imports were being sold well below the domestic price in the four countries and had caused material injury to the domestic industry in Malaysia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-imposes-anti-dumping-duties-on-iron-steel-imports-from-4-countries/7934555.html	2025-01-12T20:55:02-08:00	
Japan foreign minister to visit S.Korea to shore up security cooperation	TOKYO — Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya will travel to South Korea on Monday to shore up security cooperation between the East Asian neighbors and their mutual U.S. ally that is meant to counter China's growing regional power. It marks the first time in seven years that a Japanese foreign minister will visit South Korea for a bilateral meeting with their South Korean counterpart, Japan's government said. Iwaya will also meet with South Korea's Acting President Choi Sang-mok, Tokyo said. Iwaya aims to 'reconfirm' the importance of relations and that the two countries will continue to coordinate policies including those on North Korea in the 'light of the current strategic environment,' it said in a press release. Deepening trilateral security cooperation could be more difficult amid the political turmoil in South Korea prompted by the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. The transition to a second Trump administration on Jan. 20 also means that none of the original leaders who established the three-way security cooperation pact in 2023 - U.S. President Joe Biden, Yoon, and former Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida—remain in power. 'The trilateral will move forward. The real question is will the trilateral thrive,' U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said at a press conference in Tokyo on Friday, shortly before he returns to the United States. ‘’It's going to take work to nurture it and develop it,' Emanuel said. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been holed up in his hillside villa in Seoul since parliament voted to impeach and suspend him last month over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3. Presidential security service and military guards there have blocked investigators from arresting him. Iwaya's planned visit comes after the South Korean foreign minister met last week with outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who expressed 'serious concerns' over some of the actions Yoon took over the course of his martial law declaration. Iwaya met Blinken in Tokyo the following day. Iwaya will travel to the Philippines after South Korea to discuss security and economic cooperation and will visit Palau to attend the second inauguration of President Surangel Whipp before returning to Japan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-foreign-minister-to-visit-s-korea-to-shore-up-security-cooperation/7934548.html	2025-01-12T20:28:23-08:00	
Somalia, Ethiopia to restore diplomatic ties amid AU mission agreement	WASHINGTON — Somalia announced that obstacles to Ethiopia's participation in the new African Union mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) have been overcome, and the final stage of the composition and size of Ethiopian forces is expected to be sorted out shortly. Somalia previously threatened to expel Ethiopian troops from the African Union peacekeeping mission unless Ethiopia renounced its controversial memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Somaliland, the breakaway region of Somalia. Under the terms of the MOU, Somaliland would lease about 20 kilometers (12 miles) of its Gulf of Aden coastline to landlocked Ethiopia’s naval forces and in exchange — according to Somaliland officials — Ethiopia would begin a process considering the official recognition of Somaliland’s independence. However, Ali Omar Balcad, Somalia’s state foreign minister told VOA that the obstacles posed by the MOU, which had hindered Ethiopia's participation in AUSSOM, have now been overcome. The minister said the current challenge lies in reallocating the number of troops assigned to AUSSOM, which were previously distributed to other countries. 'A Somali delegation will visit Ethiopia on Jan. 15, to proceed and finalize the technical details for their involvement and the number,' Balcad told VOA. Restoration of diplomatic ties The development comes after a two-day visit by Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud to Addis Ababa, during which he held discussions with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. The leaders agreed to mend diplomatic ties strained by Ethiopia's MOU with Somaliland. 'After in-depth discussions, Somali President Hassan Mohamud and Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed have agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations,' Balcad said in an interview with VOA. 'Somalia’s ambassador to the African Union in Addis Ababa will also serve as Somalia’s new ambassador to Ethiopia. In return, Ethiopia will send a new ambassador to Somalia and assign consular representatives to Hargeisa and Garowe,' Balcad added. The diplomatic relationship between the two nations was damaged last year when Somalia declared the MOU between Ethiopia and Somaliland to be 'null and void' and a violation of its sovereignty. The fallout led to the expulsion of Ethiopia's ambassador to Somalia and the order to close Ethiopian consulates in Hargeisa and Garowe, although both consulates continue to operate. In a joint communique issued Saturday, the two leaders pledged to 'restore and enhance' bilateral relations through full diplomatic representation. Both leaders emphasized that regional stability hinges on strong cooperation built on mutual trust and respect. Turkey played a pivotal role in mediating between the two sides. Last month, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan facilitated a meeting in Ankara between President Mohamud and Prime Minister Ahmed, where both parties reaffirmed their commitment to mutual sovereignty and territorial integrity in what is being called the Ankara Declaration. The Somali minister said the trade, port access and sea routes are set to be key topics at a meeting scheduled for next month in Ankara, building on the discussions from last month's agreement. Egypt and Red Sea tensions Meanwhile, Egypt declared Saturday that it will not accept any military or naval presence in the Red Sea from non-bordering countries. The remarks, made by Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty during a news conference with his Somali and Eritrean counterparts, underscore Egypt's growing concerns over Ethiopia's regional influence. 'We will not allow landlocked countries to set up [a] military presence along the Red Sea. Such moves would affect the security arrangement in the deep waters,' Abdelatty said. Somalia’s foreign minister Balcad told VOA he is aware of Egypt's remarks, emphasizing that Somalia is not directly involved in the Red Sea issue, as it does not share a border with the waterway. The Bab-el-Mandeb strait connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden which runs along Somalia’s coastline. 'We maintain independent relations with Cairo and Addis Ababa, and we don't believe one harms the other,' Balcad said.

Austrian woman kidnapped in Niger's Agadez city, authorities say	Niamey, Niger — An Austrian woman has been kidnapped by gunmen in Niger's Agadez city, residents and the Austrian Foreign Ministry said Sunday. It is the first time a European citizen is known to have been kidnapped in the conflict-hit West African nation since a military junta took power in 2023. The ministry said the Austrian Embassy in Algeria, which is also responsible for Niger, had been informed of the kidnapping of an Austrian woman in Agadez and was in contact with regional authorities on the ground. Residents and local media identified the victim as Eva Gretzmacher and reported she is an aid worker who has lived in Agadez — hundreds of kilometers away from the capital city of Niamey — for more than 20 years. '(She) is well known for her social commitment (and) created a skills center in 2010 that initiated various projects, notably in the fields of education, women’s empowerment, ecology, culture and art,' the online newspaper Air Info Agadez reported. Gretzmacher also supported education programs through her development work and provided assistance to local nongovernment organizations in various sectors, local media said. No group claimed responsibility for her abduction and authorities in Niger did not immediately comment on the incident. Niger has for many years battled a jihadi insurgency linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, a security crisis that analysts say has worsened since the military toppled the country's government in July 2023. Despite their promise to restore peace in hot spots, the junta’s capacity to improve Niger’s security has increasingly been questioned amid increasing attacks. Niger was seen as one of the last democratic countries in Africa’s Sahel region that Western nations could partner with to beat back the jihadi insurgency in the vast expanse below the Sahara Desert. The country has severed decadeslong military ties with the West and turned to Russia as a new security partner.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austrian-woman-kidnapped-in-niger-s-agadez-city-authorities-say/7934475.html	2025-01-12T16:30:11-08:00
