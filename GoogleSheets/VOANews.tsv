Taiwan: China ups efforts to undermine democracy with disinformation	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan’s government says China is redoubling efforts to undermine confidence in the self-governing island’s democracy and close ties with the United States through the spread of disinformation, especially online. The National Security Bureau said the number of pieces of false or biased information distributed by China increased 60% last year, to 2.16 million from 1.33 million in 2023. The brief report issued Friday tallied 'pieces of controversial information,' but did not further define the term. Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, were the main conduits for disinformation, along with platforms that explicitly target young people such as TikTok, the report said. China created 'inauthentic accounts' to distribute its propaganda on YouTube, used technology such as AI to create fake videos and flooded comments sections with pro-China statements, the report said. China has for years used global social media platforms to spread official messages and misinformation even while banning them inside the country. Beijing already has considerable influence with Taiwanese newspapers and other traditional media through their owners' business interests in mainland China. China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force, if necessary, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping renewing a declaration in his New Year's address that unification with Taiwan was inevitable and could not be blocked by outside forces, a likely reference to the U.S., Taiwan’s most important ally. China regularly sends warplanes, ships and balloons into areas controlled by Taiwan and holds military drills to simulate a blockade or invasion of the island. Beijing has also been building up its navy and missile forces to hit key targets and fend off American military support. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te said in his own New Year's address that the island would continue to strengthen its defenses in the face of escalating Chinese threats. Taiwan, he said, was a crucial part of the global 'line of defense of democracy' against authoritarian states such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-china-ups-efforts-to-undermine-democracy-with-disinformation/7924490.html	2025-01-04T11:00:59-08:00	
Malaysia turns away 2 boats with nearly 300 Rohingya refugees	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — Malaysian authorities said Saturday that they have turned away two boats carrying nearly 300 people believed to be Muslim Rohingya refugees who were found to have entered the country illegally. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said that it had information that two more boats were attempting to enter the country after a boatload of 196 Rohingya landed early Friday on a beach on the northeastern resort island of Langkawi. They were all detained by authorities. The agency said authorities had detected the other two boats later Friday off Langkawi. It said the people on the two boats, also believed to be Rohingya, were reported to be exhausted and lacked sufficient food and water supplies. Maritime Enforcement Agency chief Mohamad Rosli Abdullah said in a statement that assistance has been provided to the two boats, including food supplies and drinking water, before they were escorted out of the country to continue their journey. It didn't say where the boats were heading, and no further details were given. There were also no details about where they came from, but many Rohingya living in refugee camps in Bangladesh have been lured by traffickers to leave to seek a better life elsewhere. Bangladesh hosts more than 1 million Rohingya refugees who fled ethnic and religious violence in Myanmar. Malaysia is a popular destination because of its dominant Malay Muslim population. Many Rohingya fled a brutal counterinsurgency campaign in 2017 by Myanmar’s security forces, who were accused of committing mass rapes and killings. While Malaysia has accepted Rohingya in the past on humanitarian grounds, the country has tried to limit numbers because of fears of a mass influx of people arriving on boats. As of the end of November, there were around 111,410 Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers registered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Malaysia. This makes up about 58% of the total refugee population in Malaysia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-turns-away-2-boats-with-nearly-300-rohingya-refugees/7924485.html	2025-01-04T10:48:34-08:00	
Four people shot in new attack to Indigenous land in Brazil	SAO PAULO — Four Indigenous people, including a child, were shot during an attack in southern Brazil late on Friday, federal police and an Indigenous rights organization said on Saturday, as violence escalates in the region. Attackers opened fire against the Indigenous community near the city of Guaira, in the southern Parana state, injuring four people, who were later hospitalized, the police said. The attack was aimed at the Ava Guarani people, who have been the target of previous assaults since Dec. 29, said the Missionary Council for Indigenous Peoples, or CIMI, an organization linked to the Catholic Bishops Conference of Brazil. A 4-year-old child shot in the leg was sent to a nearby hospital in the city of Toledo, alongside two other people, one hit in the leg and the other in the back, said CIMI. The group said a fourth person, shot in the jaw, was sent to a hospital in Cascavel, one of the largest cities in the state. The police said they have started investigations to track down the attackers, adding that federal, state and municipal security forces were deployed to avoid new violence in the region, which has historically faced land conflicts. Two members of the Ava Guarani people were injured in the last days of 2024, said CIMI, with one having been shot in the arm. The Ministry of Indigenous Affairs condemned the acts of violence against the Ava Guarani people, saying it is in talks with the Ministry of Justice and Public Security for the immediate investigation of armed groups acting in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-people-shot-in-new-attack-to-indigenous-land-in-brazil/7924480.html	2025-01-04T10:40:32-08:00	
Pope Francis: Bullying at school prepares students for war, not peace	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis warned that bullying in schools prepares students for war rather than peace, in a speech to Catholic educators gathered at the Vatican on Saturday. Speaking to about 2,000 Italian educators and parents, Francis stressed his message against bullying, asking the audience to pledge to fight against it both at school and at home. The pontiff praised educational efforts at schools to promote peace, noting that 'imagining peace' lays the foundations for 'a more just and fraternal world' through 'every subject taught and through the creativity of children and young people.' 'But if, at school, you wage war among yourselves or engage in bullying, you are preparing for war, not for peace,' he said The pope also called for more dialogue within families, emphasizing that 'it is dialogue that makes us grow.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-bullying-at-school-prepares-students-for-war-not-peace/7924473.html	2025-01-04T10:33:26-08:00	
Prince William saddened by death of former nanny's stepson in New Orleans attack	LONDON — Prince William expressed his shock and sadness Saturday at the news of the death of his former nanny’s stepson in the New Year's truck attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people. London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed Saturday that they are supporting the family of 31-year-old Edward Pettifer, including helping them through the process of returning his body to the United Kingdom. Pettifer, who is from west London, is the final victim to be identified. In a statement on social media, the Prince of Wales said he and his wife, Catherine, were 'shocked and saddened by the tragic death of Ed Pettifer. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Pettifer family and all those innocent people who have been tragically impacted by this horrific attack.' Pettifer was the stepson of Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who was the nanny for William and his brother, Prince Harry, between 1993 and 1999, which included the time after the death of their mother, Princess Diana, in 1997. Legge-Bourke, who is also known as Alexandra Pettifer, was regularly photographed with Diana. British media also reported that King Charles III is said to be deeply saddened by the news and that he has sent his condolences to Pettifer's family. In a statement, Pettifer’s family said they were 'devastated at the tragic news of Ed’s death' and described him as 'a wonderful son, brother, grandson, nephew and a friend to so many.' 'We will all miss him terribly. Our thoughts are with the other families who have lost their family members due to this terrible attack,' the family added. Authorities say 14 people were killed and about 30 were injured in the attack early Wednesday by Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a former U.S. Army soldier who posted several videos on his Facebook account hours before the attack previewing the violence he would unleash and proclaiming his support for the Islamic State militant group. The coroner’s office listed the cause of death for all 14 victims as 'blunt force injuries.' Jabbar, 42, was fatally shot in a firefight with police at the scene of the deadly crash on Bourbon Street, famous worldwide for its festive vibes in New Orleans’ historic French Quarter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7924469.html	2025-01-04T10:26:24-08:00	
Ethiopia evacuates 80,000 after earthquakes, fears of volcanic eruption	Ethiopia’s government said it is evacuating approximately 80,000 people following a series of small-scale earthquakes in the Afar, Oromia and Amhara regions. At least 10 earthquakes were reported in Ethiopia since Friday, and there are signs of possible volcanic activity. The latest earthquakes shook the Awash Fentale district, which stretches between the Afar and Oromia regions, at 3:52 a.m. Saturday. The United States Geological Survey recorded an earthquake measuring a magnitude of 5.8 about 56 kilometers (35 miles) southeast of Ambosa, in the Oromia region, in the early hours of Saturday. Atalay Ayele, head of the Seismology Department and a professor of seismic science at Addis Ababa University, says the epicenter was in the middle of Dofen Mountain, Awash Fentale district, in the Afar region. Just hours later a second tremor, measured at 4.7, was reported about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of Awash in the Afar region. 'The events are increasing in size and frequency from time to time. In particular, this week, data shows that an earthquake measuring up to 5.8 on the Richter scale,' according to a statement issued by the federal government Saturday. The earthquake was felt in the capital, Addis Ababa, and cities such as Adama and Metehara. Residents living in condos and high-rise buildings felt it, too, reports say. As many as two dozen quakes and aftershocks were reported in Awash Fentale district since September, according to residents and officials. In the Afar region, frequent quakes created a natural hot spring water crater that is reportedly widening. No casualties were reported, but the quakes damaged dozens of homes in Afar. Fears of volcanic eruptions Friday’s tremor in Afar resulted in fears of volcanic eruptions after smoke came from vents in the Dofen volcano, signaling potential volcanic activity. 'The government is closely monitoring the events with experts in the field. In addition, it has identified the epicenter of the earthquake and deployed emergency workers from various fields in 12 kebeles [districts] to assess the extent of the damage,' the statement from Ethiopia’s government said. 'It is making great efforts to identify the most vulnerable among the 80,000 citizens living in those kebeles and to evacuate them from the area. It is also monitoring the possible impact of the earthquake on social service institutions, economic institutions, and infrastructure.' The Ethiopian Disaster Risk Management Commission announced in a statement issued on Saturday that over 51,000 residents in the Afar and Oromia regions are at risk due to recurring earthquakes in the past two months. To mitigate the risk, more than 13,000 people have already been relocated to safer areas, the commission said. In the Fentale district of the Oromia region, over 16,000 residents face similar risks, with more than 7,000 of them relocated to secure locations, the statement added. Some residents in the affected towns said they left their homes after the quake. Zumara Mamo is a resident of Abomsa, where the quake was felt. She says the earthquake happened while she was asleep. 'I was sleeping on the floor with my child. Suddenly I felt the Earth beneath me shaking. The shock displaced the glass on my door,' she told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service. According to Zumara, the shock lasted nearly a minute and was greater than the previous shock reported in the area in October. Fentale district in the Oromia region lies less than 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the epicenter of the Saturday morning earthquake near Abomsa town. Abayneh Urgo, who lives in Fentale district, said a strong earthquake shock was felt in his town and now residents are sleeping outside. Efrem Wakjira, who lives near German Square in Addis Ababa, said earthquakes have been frequent this week. 'The shock of the earthquake has been common during the past five days, but Saturday morning was quite strong. It happened at around 4 a.m. local time, and I was awakened from sleeping by the shock.' The government said the earthquake has not yet had a significant impact on major towns and has urged citizens to 'follow and strictly implement the precautionary messages issued by experts.' Ethiopian cities are vulnerable to quakes Ethiopian experts have warned that many buildings in the country, particularly in Addis Ababa, are highly vulnerable to earthquakes. Esayas Gebreyohannes, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Addis Ababa University’s Institute of Technology, said Ethiopia introduced building code standards in 1983 that need updating every 10 to 20 years, with the next update scheduled this year. 'Despite these updates, significant gaps persist in adherence to the standards during building design and construction,' he said. 'Many buildings evaluated at Addis Ababa University reveal design faults due to noncompliance with the standards. Additionally, construction materials and workmanship often fall short of required quality levels. Most buildings in Addis Ababa exhibit these deficiencies, compromising their safety and quality,' Esayas said. 'The recent frequent earthquake[s] is a sign that we are living in an active volcanic area,' professor Ayele told VOA by phone. 'The state should be careful while building infrastructures at those places. The relief agencies should stand by, and the public must also get awareness regarding the shocks,' he said. Government engineers say plans are underway to reinforce major public buildings to withstand high-magnitude earthquakes. Engineer Mesfin Negewo, director general of the Ethiopian Construction Authority, acknowledged growing concerns over the increasing frequency of earthquakes. 'We have observed frequent seismic activity over the past two months, and we are actively assessing the situation,' he said by phone to VOA. He said to address the emerging risks — the government has established task forces to study the situation and monitor incidents closely. 'These teams will present a comprehensive report to authorities,' he said. VOA’s Kennedy Abate and Mesfin Aragie contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-evacuates-80-000-after-earthquakes-fears-of-volcanic-eruption/7924462.html	2025-01-04T10:15:59-08:00	
Market fire in northern China kills at least 8, injures 15	BEIJING — A fire at a food market Saturday in northern China killed at least eight people and injured 15 others, state media said. The fire at the Liguang market in the city of Zhangjiakou, northwest of Beijing, broke out midday Saturday and was mostly extinguished by 2 p.m., Xinhua News Agency reported, citing a government official in the Qiaoxi District, where the market is located. 'The injured have been sent to hospital for treatment and are currently not in life-threatening danger,' the government official said. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Such traditional markets are often tightly packed with shoppers seeking prices lower than at supermarket chains. Fire sources can range from gas bottles to charcoal used to roast meat and discarded cigarettes while aging infrastructure, such as underground gas lines, has also been blamed for fires and explosions. Footage shared online and geolocated by Agence France-Presse showed people outside the market fleeing the blaze while thick smoke billowed skyward. Other videos showed firefighters battling the flames and carrying victims away from the scene. Deadly fires are relatively common in China due to lax building codes and an often-slipshod approach to workplace safety. A blaze in the major city of Chengdu in October left 24 people hospitalized with breathing difficulties, state media reported. In July, a fire at a shopping center in the southwestern city of Zigong killed 16 people. Zhangjiakou, located in Hebei province bordering Beijing, hosted events during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Some information in this report is from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/market-fire-in-northern-china-kills-at-least-8-injures-15/7924445.html	2025-01-04T09:48:32-08:00	
Biden notifies Congress of planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel	WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department has informed Congress of a planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel, U.S. officials say, as the American ally presses forward with its war against Hamas in Gaza. Some of the arms in the package could be sent from current U.S. stocks, but the majority would take a year or several years to deliver, according to two U.S. officials Saturday who spoke on condition of anonymity because the notification to Congress hasn't been formally sent. The sale includes medium-range air-to-air missiles to help Israel defend against airborne threats, 155 mm projectile artillery shells for long-range targeting, Hellfire AGM-114 missiles, 500-pound bombs and more. The weapons package would add to a record of at least $17.9 billion in military aid that the U.S. has provided Israel since the Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, launched the war. The United States, Britain and other Western nations designate Hamas as a terror group. The Biden administration has faced criticism over the mounting number of deaths of Palestinian civilians. There have been demonstrations on college campuses and unsuccessful efforts in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders and some Democrats to block sales of offensive weapons to Israel. The United States paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May over concerns about civilian casualties if the bombs were to be used during an assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The Biden administration has demanded that Israel increase humanitarian aid into the enclave. But in November, citing some limited progress, it declined to limit arms transfers as it threatened to do if the situation did not improve. In recent days, Israel has been conducting airstrikes in Gaza that have killed dozens of people, adding to the tens of thousands of deaths since the war began more than a year ago. The Israeli army said Friday that it had struck dozens of Hamas gathering points and command centers throughout Gaza. Israel’s military says it targets only militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea. The informal notice to Congress isn’t the final notification before a sale. Now the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can review the package. News of the weapons sale was first reported by Axios.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-notifies-congress-of-planned-8-billion-weapons-sale-to-israel/7924437.html	2025-01-04T09:40:58-08:00	
New Orleans attacker had suspected bomb materials at home, officials say	NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA — The man who rammed a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year's revelers in New Orleans had suspected bomb-making materials at his home and reserved the vehicle used in the deadly attack more than six weeks earlier, law enforcement officials told The Associated Press on Friday. Federal authorities searching the home of Shamsud-Din Jabbar in Houston found a workbench in the garage and hazardous materials believed to have been used to make explosive devices, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the search. The officials were not authorized to speak about the ongoing inquiry and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The FBI investigation also revealed that Jabbar purchased a cooler in Vidor, Texas, hours before the attack and gun oil from a store in Sulphur, Louisiana, the officials said. Authorities also determined Jabbar booked his rental of the pickup truck on Nov. 14, suggesting he may have been plotting the attack for more than six weeks. Authorities say 14 people were killed and some 30 were injured in the attack early Wednesday by Jabbar, a former Army soldier who posted several videos on his Facebook hours before the attack previewing the violence he would unleash and proclaiming his support for the Islamic State militant group. The coroner’s office listed the cause of death for all 14 victims as 'blunt force injuries.' Jabbar, 42, was fatally shot in a firefight with police at the scene of the deadly crash on Bourbon Street, famous worldwide for its festive vibes in New Orleans' historic French Quarter. Authorities found crude bombs that had been planted in the neighborhood in an apparent attempt to cause more carnage. Two improvised explosive devices left in coolers several blocks apart were rendered safe at the scene, officials said. Other devices were determined to be nonfunctional. Investigators recovered from Jabbar's rental truck a transmitter intended to trigger the two bombs, the FBI said in a statement Friday. It also said authorities found bomb-making materials at the New Orleans home Jabbar rented prior to the attack. Jabbar tried to burn the house down by setting a small fire in a hallway and placing accelerants to help spread it, the FBI said. The flames burned out before firefighters arrived. Authorities on Friday were still investigating Jabbar's motives and how he carried out the attack. They say he exited the crashed truck wearing a ballistic vest and helmet and fired at police, wounding at least two officers before he was fatally shot by officers returning fire. New Orleans police declined to say Friday how many shots were fired by Jabbar and police or whether any bystanders may have been hit, citing the active investigation. Stella Cziment, who heads the city's civilian-run Office of the Independent Police Monitor, said investigators are working to account for 'every single bullet that was fired' and whether any of them struck bystanders. Bourbon Street was solemn Friday. A day after the crime scene reopened to the public, locals and tourists stopped to pay respects to victims of the attack as the sound of bucket drums echoed. People shed tears while gathering at a growing memorial. Some left flowers and candles while others dropped to their knees to say a quick prayer. 'New Orleans is about having a good time, you know, just trying to live your best life,' said Tony Lightfoot, who works in Baton Rouge and was visiting New Orleans with his son. He said the attacker 'just decided to disrupt all of that.' Thirteen people remained hospitalized. Eight people were in intensive care at University Medical Center New Orleans, spokesperson Carolina Giepert said. The White House said President Joe Biden would travel to New Orleans on Monday to 'grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack.' Police used multiple vehicles and barricades on Friday to block traffic at Bourbon and Canal streets as crowds of pedestrians swelled. Other law enforcement agencies helped city officers provide extra security, said Reese Harper, a spokesperson for the New Orleans Police Department. The first parade of the Carnival season leading up to Mardi Gras was scheduled to take place Monday. New Orleans will also host the Super Bowl on Feb. 9. 'This enhanced safety effort will continue daily, not just during large events,' Harper said in a statement. In a previous effort to protect the French Quarter, the city had installed steel columns known as bollards to restrict vehicle access to Bourbon Street. The posts retracted to allow for deliveries to bars and restaurants, until — gummed up by Mardi Gras beads, beer and other detritus — they stopped working reliably. So, when New Year’s Eve arrived, the bollards were gone. They were being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, New Orleans City Council President Helena Moreno took steps toward launching an investigation of the attack. In a memo to another council member obtained by AP, Moreno said she was initiating the creation of a local and state legislative committee 'dedicated to reviewing the incident and its implications.' 'This committee will play a crucial role in assessing our current policies, enhancing security measures, and ensuring that we are adequately prepared to respond to any future threats,' Moreno wrote. The FBI concluded Jabbar was not aided by anyone else in the attack, which killed an 18-year-old aspiring nurse, a single mother, a father of two and a former Princeton University football star, among others. Thirteen of the 14 victims have been identified by the New Orleans coroner’s office, with the youngest listed as 18 and the oldest 63. Most of the victims were in their 20s. One victim was a British citizen. It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-attacker-had-suspected-bomb-materials-at-home-officials-say/7924423.html	2025-01-04T09:27:12-08:00	
World's oldest person, a Japanese woman, dies at 116	TOKYO — Tomiko Itooka, a Japanese woman who was the world’s oldest person according to Guinness World Records, has died, an Ashiya city official said Saturday. She was 116. Yoshitsugu Nagata, an official in charge of elderly policies, said Itooka died on Dec. 29 at a care home in Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, central Japan. Itooka, who loved bananas and a yogurt-flavored Japanese drink called Calpis, was born on May 23, 1908. She became the oldest person last year following the death of 117-year-old Maria Branyas, according to the Gerontology Research Group. When she was told she was at the top of the World Supercentenarian Rankings List, she simply replied, 'Thank you.' When Itooka celebrated her birthday last year, she received flowers, a cake and a card from the mayor. Born in Osaka, Itooka was a volleyball player in high school, and long had a reputation for a sprightly spirit, Nagata said. She climbed the 3,067-meter (10,062-foot) Mount Ontake twice. She married at 20, and had two daughters and two sons, according to Guinness. Itooka managed the office of her husband’s textile factory during World War II. She lived alone in Nara after her husband died in 1979. She is survived by one son, one daughter and five grandchildren. A funeral service was held with family and friends, according to Nagata. According to the Gerontology Research Group, the world's oldest person is now 116-year-old Brazilian nun Inah Canabarro Lucas, who was born 16 days after Itooka.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-oldest-person-a-japanese-woman-dies-at-116/7924390.html	2025-01-04T08:42:23-08:00	
German leader worried by Musk's support of far-right AfD	BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says he's staying 'cool' against critical personal comments made by Elon Musk but finds it worrying that the U.S. billionaire makes the effort to get involved in a general election by endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD. Scholz was reacting after Musk, a close ally to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, called the chancellor a 'fool' after his coalition government collapsed in November and later backed the AfD in an opinion article he wrote for a major newspaper in Germany. Scholz, head of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, or SPD, said in comments published Saturday by the German magazine Stern that there is 'nothing new' in criticism by 'rich media entrepreneurs who do not appreciate social democratic politics and do not hold back with their opinions.' 'You have to stay cool,' Scholz told Stern. 'I find it much more worrying than such insults that Musk is supporting a party like the AfD, which is in parts right-wing extremist, which preaches rapprochement with [President Vladmir] Putin’s Russia and wants to weaken transatlantic relations,' Scholz said. The AfD is monitored by Germany’s domestic intelligence service on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and has already been recognized as such in some individual German states. Germany will hold an early parliamentary election on Feb. 23 after Scholz’s thee-party coalition collapsed in November in a dispute over how to revitalize the country’s stagnant economy. Musk recently caused uproar after backing the AfD in an opinion article for the Welt am Sonntag, leading to the resignation of the paper’s opinion editor, Eva Marie Kogel, in protest. 'The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country,' Musk wrote in his translated commentary. The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country’s condition. The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-leader-worried-by-musk-s-support-of-far-right-afd/7924363.html	2025-01-04T08:13:40-08:00	
Cameroon says Nigerian militant attack killed government troops	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Villagers in southern Cameroon say armed men crossed the border from Nigeria and killed at least seven government troops and displaced civilians from about 15 villages. Civilians say they believe the attackers are members of a militant group. Villagers in the Akwaya district on Cameroon’s border with Nigeria’s Taraba state say several hundred armed men crossed the Moon River two times this week and launched deadly attacks on their villages. The Moon River lies to the south on Cameroon's border with Nigeria. Villagers say the water level has dropped significantly this dry season, making it easy to cross by foot. The villagers say the first attack was on Thursday, when armed men suspected to be ethnic Fulani from Nigeria entered their villages and started shooting indiscriminately in the air, torching houses and threatening to kill civilians. Cameroon's military says that it fought back and that the attackers retreated after several fighters were killed. Agwa Linus Tarnonge, traditional ruler of Bakinjaw village in Akwaya district, said villagers were surprised that the men returned on Friday, more heavily armed than they were on Thursday. 'In the cause of gun fire exchanges, some of those armed Fulani suffered casualties, and then the remaining ones retreated and came back with an overwhelming population [number of fighters], and with more sophisticated rifles,' Tarnonge told VOA by phone from Akwaya. 'They attacked our [Cameroon] military contingent that is lodged at the chief's palace in Bakinjaw, and killed five military and two gendarmes.' The Cameroon military said it lost five troops during the confrontation. Villagers say two government troops sustained injuries and died while being rushed to a hospital for treatment. Many civilians were injured, and it is too early to determine if some villagers died because of the difficult access to Akwaya, the Cameroon military says. Aka Martin Tyoga, a lawmaker and member of Cameroon's National Assembly from Akwaya, said this week's attacks are the latest in a series of what he called attempts by Nigerian militant groups to seize that area of Cameroon. 'We have asked the people to move away from the border area to the center, where we have the military that has been there since,' Tyoga said. 'We are pleading that the government should send more forces [military] because these people [armed men] come en masse; they came in 300. Their mode of operating is like Boko Haram. They enter the community and just start killing people, burning down houses.' No group has claimed responsibility, but Cameroonian government officials and Akwaya residents believe a Nigerian militant group wants to occupy the area. Cameroonian officials said troops have been deployed to the border with Nigeria around Akwaya for a search-and-rescue operation, but they have not said how many have been deployed. The Cameroonian government says it is working in collaboration with Nigerian authorities to stop the border attacks but gave no details. VOA could not independently verify if Cameroon has contacted Nigerian authorities to either investigate the origin of the armed group or collaborate with forces of the neighboring state to fight the suspected militants. Nigeria has been attempting to stop the proliferation of militant groups in its territory since 2009, when fighting between Nigerian government troops and Boko Haram militants degenerated into an armed conflict and spread to Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Several bombings and deadly attacks have taken place in Nigeria’s Taraba state since 2022 that were claimed by Islamic State West Africa Province or ISWAP. In 2021, Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and Niger said ISWAP was emerging as the terrorist group taking over from Boko Haram, which was weakened by the death of its leader, Aboubakar Shekau, in May of that year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-says-nigerian-militant-attack-killed-government-troops/7924358.html	2025-01-04T07:59:49-08:00	
How Congress will certify Trump's electoral college victory	WASHINGTON — The U.S. congressional joint session to count electoral votes on Monday is expected to be much less eventful than the certification four years ago that was interrupted by a violent mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump who tried to stop the count and overturn the results of an election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. This time, Trump is returning to office after winning the 2024 election that began with Biden as his party's nominee and ended with Vice President Kamala Harris atop the ticket. She will preside over the certification of her own loss, fulfilling the constitutional role in the same way that Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, did after the violence subsided on Jan. 6, 2021. Usually a routine affair, the congressional joint session on Jan. 6 every four years is the final step in reaffirming a presidential election after the Electoral College officially elects the winner in December. The meeting is required by the Constitution and includes several distinct steps. What happens when Congress meets? Under federal law, Congress must meet on Jan. 6 to open sealed certificates from each state that contain a record of their electoral votes. The votes are brought into the chamber in special mahogany boxes that are used for the occasion. Bipartisan representatives of both chambers read the results out loud and do an official count. The vice president, as president of the Senate, presides over the session and declares the winner. The Constitution requires Congress to meet and count the electoral votes. If there is a tie, then the House decides the presidency, with each congressional delegation having one vote. That hasn’t happened since the 1800s and won't happen this time because Trump’s electoral win over Harris was decisive, 312-226. How has it changed since the last time? Congress tightened the rules for the certification after the violence of 2021 and Trump’s attempts to usurp the process. In particular, the revised Electoral Count Act passed in 2022 more explicitly defines the role of the vice president after Trump aggressively pushed Pence to object to the Republican's defeat — an action that would have gone far beyond Pence's ceremonial role. Pence rebuffed Trump and ultimately gaveled down his own defeat. Harris will do the same. The updated law clarifies that the vice president does not have the power to determine the results on Jan. 6. Harris and Pence were not the first vice presidents to be put in the uncomfortable position of presiding over their own defeats. In 2001, Vice President Al Gore presided over the counting of the 2000 presidential election that he narrowly lost to Republican George W. Bush. Gore had to gavel several Democrats’ objections out of order. In 2017, Biden as vice president presided over the count that declared Trump the winner. Biden also shot down objections from House Democrats that did not have any Senate support. How does the session unfold? The presiding officer opens and presents the certificates of the electoral votes in alphabetical order of the states. The appointed 'tellers' from the House and Senate, members of both parties, then read each certificate out loud and record and count the votes. At the end, the presiding officer announces who has won the most votes for president and vice president. What if there's an objection? After a teller reads the certificate from any state, a lawmaker can stand up and object to that state’s vote on any grounds. But the presiding officer will not hear the objection unless it is in writing and signed by one-fifth of each chamber. That threshold is significantly higher than what came before. Previously, a successful objection only required support from one member of the Senate and one member of the House. Lawmakers raised the threshold in the 2022 law to make objections more difficult. If any objection reaches the threshold — something not expected this time — the joint session suspends, and the House and Senate go into separate sessions to consider it. For the objection to be sustained, both chambers must uphold it by a simple majority vote. If they do not agree, the original electoral votes are counted with no changes. In 2021, both the House and Senate rejected challenges to the electoral votes in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Before 2021, the last time that such an objection was considered was 2005, when Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio and Senator Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats, objected to Ohio’s electoral votes, claiming there were voting irregularities. The House and Senate debated the objection and easily rejected it. It was only the second time such a vote had occurred. What happens next? After Congress certifies the vote, the president is inaugurated on the west front of the Capitol on Jan. 20. The joint session is the last official chance for objections, beyond any challenges in court. Harris has conceded and never disputed Trump’s win.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-congress-will-certify-trump-s-electoral-college-victory/7924343.html	2025-01-04T07:37:34-08:00	
Trump climate plans include rolling back vehicle emissions standards	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is promising to reverse Biden administration efforts to fight climate change and says he will grow the U.S. economy by drilling for more oil.

Jimmy Carter's state funeral starts Saturday. Here is what to know	ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Six days of funeral observances for former President Jimmy Carter begin Saturday in Georgia, where he died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. The first events reflect Carter’s climb up the political ladder, from the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as a humanitarian and advocate for democracy. Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens next: Start honors Carter's roots in rural Georgia The proceedings are scheduled to begin at 10:15 a.m. Saturday with the Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus. Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter will serve as pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exits the campus on its way to Plains. James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more than when he was born on October 1, 1924. Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton also grew up in rural settings, but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in his birthplace for his long post-presidency. The motorcade will move through downtown Plains, which spans just a few blocks, passing near the girlhood home of first lady Rosalynn Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also includes the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by Carter's younger brother Billy. The motorcade will then pass by the Methodist church where the Carters married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn. The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the Governor's Mansion and four more in the White House. A stop at Carter's boyhood home The military-run schedule calls for a 10:50 a.m. stop in front of Carter's family farm and boyhood home in Archery, outside Plains, after passing the cemetery where the former president's parents, James Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried. The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park. The National Park Service will ring the old farm bell 39 times to honor the 39th president. Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his father's land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse, and she delivered Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for the family. It was Earl's death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon's nuclear program to take over the family's peanut business after his father's death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate. Lying in repose in Atlanta From Archery, the motorcade will head north to Atlanta and will stop at 3 p.m. outside at the Georgia Capitol, where he served as a state senator from 1963 to 1967 and governor from 1971 to 1975. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens will lead a moment of silence. While former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents — even if they served as governors — are memorialized with national rites run by the federal government. The motorcade then is scheduled to arrive at the Carter Presidential Center at 3:45 p.m., with a private service at 4 p.m. The campus includes Carter’s presidential library and The Carter Center, established by the former president and first lady in 1982. From 7 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday, Carter will lie in repose for the public to pay respects around the clock. The ceremony is expected to include some of The Carter Center's global staff of 3,000, whose work concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election monitoring and fighting disease in the developing world continues to set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish. Jimmy Carter, who delivered its annual reports until 2019, won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential work. His grandson Jason Carter now chairs the board. A return to Washington Carter's remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy. The Carter family then will return to bury its patriarch in Plains after a private hometown funeral at 3:45 p.m. at Maranatha Baptist Church, where Carter, a devout evangelical, taught Sunday School for decades. Carter will be buried afterward in a private graveside service, in a plot visible from the front porch of his home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-s-state-funeral-starts-saturday-here-is-what-to-know/7924279.html	2025-01-04T05:59:40-08:00	
Cybertruck soldier told ex-girlfriend of pain, exhaustion after Afghanistan	WASHINGTON — The highly decorated Special Forces soldier who died by suicide in a Cybertruck explosion on New Year's Day confided to a former girlfriend who had served as an Army nurse that he faced significant pain and exhaustion that she says were key symptoms of traumatic brain injury. Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, 37, was a five-time recipient of the Bronze Star, including one with a V device for valor under fire. He had an exemplary military record that spanned the globe and a baby born last year. But he struggled with the mental and physical toll of his service, which required him to kill and caused him to witness the deaths of fellow soldiers. Livelsberger mostly bore that burden in private but recently sought treatment for depression from the Army, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public. He also found a confidant in the former nurse, who he began dating in 2018. Alicia Arritt, 39, and Livelsberger met through a dating app while both were in Colorado Springs. Arritt had served at Landstul Regional Medical Center in Germany, the largest U.S. military medical facility in Europe, where many of the worst combat injuries from Iraq and Afghanistan were initially treated before being flown to the United States. There she saw and treated traumatic brain injuries, or TBIs, which troops suffered from incoming fire and roadside bombs. Serious but hard to diagnose, such injuries can have lingering effects that might take years to surface. 'I saw a lot of bad injuries. But the personality changes can happen later,' Arritt said. In texts and images he shared with Arritt, Livelsberger raised the curtain a bit on what he was facing. 'Just some concussions,' he said in a text about a deployment to Helmand Province in Afghanistan. He sent her a photo of a graphic tattoo he got on his arm of two skulls pierced by bullets to mark lives he took in Afghanistan. He talked about exhaustion and pain, not being able to sleep and reliving the violence of his deployment. 'My life has been a personal hell for the last year,' he told Arritt during the early days of their dating, according to text messages she provided to The Associated Press. 'It’s refreshing to have such a nice person come along.' On Friday, Las Vegas law enforcement officers released excerpts of messages Livelsberger left behind showing the way Livelsberger killed himself was intentional, meant both as a 'wakeup call' but also to 'cleanse the demons' he was facing from losing fellow soldiers and taking lives. Livelsberger’s death in front of the Trump Hotel using a truck produced by Elon Musk’s Tesla company has raised questions as to whether this was an act of political violence. Officials said Friday that Livelsberger apparently harbored no ill will toward President-elect Donald Trump, and Arritt said she and Livelsberger were Tesla fans. 'I had a Tesla, too, that I rescued from a junkyard in 2019, and we used to work on it together, bond over it,' Arritt said. The pair stopped talking regularly after they broke up in 2021, and she had not heard from him in more than two years when he texted out of the blue on Dec. 28, and again on Dec. 31. The upbeat messages included a video of him driving the Cybertruck and another one of its dancing headlights; the vehicle can sync up its lighting and music. But she also said Livelsberger felt things 'very deeply, and I could see him using symbolism' of both the truck and the hotel. 'He wasn’t impulsive,' Arritt said. 'I don’t see him doing this impulsively, so my suspicion would be that he was probably thinking it out.' Arritt served on active duty from 2003 to 2007 and then was in the Army Reserve until 2011. With Livelsberger, she saw symptoms of TBI as early as 2018. 'He would go through periods of withdrawal, and he struggled with depression and memory loss,' Arritt said. 'I don’t know what drove him to do this, but I think the military didn’t get him help when he needed it.' But Livelsberger was also sweet and kind, she recalled: 'He had a really deep well of inner strength and character, and he just had a lot of integrity.' Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday that it has turned over all Livelsberger's medical records to local law enforcement and encouraged troops facing mental health challenges to seek care through one of the military's support networks. 'If you need help, if you feel that you need to seek any type of mental health treatment, or just to talk to someone — to seek the services that are available, either on base or off,' Singh said. When Livelsberger struggled during the time they were dating, Arritt prodded him to get help. But he would not, saying it could cost him his ability to deploy if he was found medically unfit. 'There was a lot of stigma in his unit; they were, you know, big, strong, Special Forces guys there. There was no weakness allowed, and mental health is weakness is what they saw,' she said. Livelsberger seeking treatment for depression was first reported by CNN.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cybertruck-soldier-told-ex-girlfriend-of-pain-exhaustion-after-afghanistan/7924262.html	2025-01-04T05:40:04-08:00	
Russia shoots down 8 missiles, captures Ukraine settlement, says defense ministry	Russia's defense ministry said on Saturday that Russian forces had taken control of the village of Nadiya in Ukraine's eastern Luhansk region and had shot down eight U.S.-made ATACMS missiles.

South Korea says fatal crash cockpit transcript nearly complete	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean investigators said Saturday they were close to finalizing the transcript of the cockpit voice recorder from a fatal plane crash that left 179 people dead last week. The recording may hold clues to the final moments of Jeju Air flight 2216, which was carrying 181 passengers and crew from Thailand to South Korea on Sunday when it belly-landed before slamming into a concrete barrier at the end of an airport runway. South Korean and U.S. investigators, including from the aircraft's manufacturer Boeing, have been combing the crash site in southwestern Muan since the disaster to establish a cause. 'The transcript of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) is expected to be completed today, and the flight data recorder (FDR) is in the process of being prepared for transport to the United States' for analysis, South Korea's land ministry said in a statement. Investigators also recovered the aircraft engine from the crash site this week, the ministry added. The exact cause of the Boeing 737-800 crash is still unknown, but investigators have pointed to a bird strike, faulty landing gear and the runway barrier as possible issues. Authorities this week carried out search and seizure operations at Muan airport where the flight crashed, a regional aviation office in the southwestern city, and Jeju Air's office in the capital of Seoul, police said. Jeju Air's chief executive Kim E-bae has been banned from leaving the country as the investigation continues, police also said. The pilot warned of a bird strike before pulling out of a first landing and then crashing on a second attempt when the landing gear did not emerge. Dramatic video showed the plane colliding with the concrete barrier at the end of the runway before bursting into flames. Authorities have started lifting the wreckage of the jet, and returning some of the identified victims' bodies and personal belongings recovered from the crash site to grieving families. The plane was largely carrying South Korean holidaymakers back from year-end trips to Bangkok, except for two Thai passengers. Images from local media showed authorities handing over items including smartphones, and dried mango and coconut sourced from Thailand.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-says-fatal-crash-cockpit-transcript-nearly-complete/7924194.html	2025-01-04T01:41:17-08:00	
South Korea investigators ask acting president to clear way for Yoon's arrest	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean investigators again asked the country's acting president on Saturday to order the presidential security service to comply with an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. The security service, along with military troops, on Friday prevented prosecutors from arresting Yoon Suk Yeol in a six-hour standoff inside Yoon's compound. The investigators secured the warrant to arrest Yoon over his brief declaration of martial law last month. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials said on Saturday it had again asked acting President Choi Sang-mok, the nation's finance minister, to order the presidential security service to cooperate with the warrant. A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment. Yoon's Dec. 3 martial declaration stunned South Korea and led to the first arrest warrant to be issued for a sitting president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-investigators-ask-acting-president-to-clear-way-for-yoon-s-arrest/7924192.html	2025-01-04T01:31:27-08:00	
Palestinian health ministry says 1 dead in Israel West Bank raid	RAMALLAH, WEST BANK — The health ministry in the occupied West Bank said one person was killed and nine injured in an Israeli raid on a refugee camp, with the Israeli military saying Saturday it had opened fire at 'terrorists.' An 18-year-old man, Muhammad Medhat Amin Amer, 'was killed by bullets from the (Israeli) occupation in the Balata camp' in the territory's north, the Palestinian health ministry said in a late-night statement, adding that nine people were injured, 'four of whom are in critical condition.' According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, the raid began on Friday night and triggered violent clashes. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that Israeli troops entered the camp from the Awarta checkpoint and 'deployed snipers on the rooftops of surrounding buildings.' In a statement on Saturday, the Israeli military said that during the 'counterterrorism' operation, 'terrorists placed explosives in the area in order to harm (military) soldiers, hurled explosives, Molotov cocktails, and rocks and shot fireworks at the forces.' 'The forces fired toward the terrorists in order to remove the threat. Hits were identified,' the statement said. Violence in the West Bank has intensified since war broke out in the Gaza Strip after Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. Since then, at least 815 Palestinians have been killed in the territory by Israeli troops or settlers, according to the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah. In the same period, Palestinian attacks in the West Bank have killed at least 25 Israelis, according to official Israeli figures. Israel has occupied the West Bank since conquering it in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinian-health-ministry-says-1-dead-in-israel-west-bank-raid/7924180.html	2025-01-04T00:53:37-08:00	
US state of Tennessee refuses to release its new execution manual	NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE — Just days after Tennessee announced it had a new manual for executing death row inmates, the state's top prison officials said they aren't going to release the document to the public. The Tennessee Department of Correction had told The Associated Press to file a public records request to obtain a copy of the latest execution manual, known as a protocol. However, the agency this week denied the AP's request, saying it needs to keep the entire document secret to protect the identities of the executioner and other people involved. The decision to maintain secrecy differs from how the state has handled similar requests in the past, but mirrors efforts across the U.S. to suppress public access surrounding executions, especially after anti-death penalty activists used records to expose problems. Here's what to know: What is an execution protocol? The protocol is typically a detailed set of procedures describing how the state executes death row inmates. Tennessee had been operating under a 2018 protocol that included directions on selecting execution team staff and the training they should undergo. It explained how lethal injection drugs should be procured, stored and administered. It gave instructions on the inmate's housing, diet and visitation in the days leading up to execution. It provided directions on how to choose media witnesses. For lethal injection, the 2018 protocol required a series of three drugs administered in sequence. The new version unveiled last week requires only a single dose of pentobarbital. But that is all that is known about the revised protocol. What reason does Tennessee give for not releasing the new protocol? In an email sent Monday, Tennessee correction spokesperson Kayla Hackney told the AP the 'protocol is not a public record' and cited a Tennessee statute that makes the identities of the people carrying out executions confidential. However, that same statute says the existence of confidential information in a record is not a reason to deny access to it, noting that the confidential information should be redacted. What has Tennessee done in the past? In 2018, Tennessee's correction agency provided a redacted copy of the protocol to an AP reporter over email. In 2007, a previous version of the protocol was treated as a public record and provided to the AP after former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, announced a surprise halt to executions. A reporter's review of that 100-page 'Manual of Execution' found a jumble of conflicting instructions that mixed new lethal-injection instructions with those for electrocution. Why did Tennessee update its protocol? Executions have been on hold in Tennessee since 2022, when the state admitted it had not been following the 2018 protocol. Among other things, the Correction Department was not consistently testing the execution drugs for potency and purity. An independent review of the state's lethal injection practice later found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed since 2018 had been fully tested. Later, the state Attorney General's Office conceded in court that two of the people most responsible for overseeing Tennessee's lethal injection drugs 'incorrectly testified' under oath that officials were testing the chemicals as required. So what's with all the secrecy? Executions in the U.S. have remained at historic lows for years, but the small group of states still carrying out the death penalty have only increased the secrecy surrounding the procedures, particularly over how and where the state secures the drugs used for lethal injections. Many states argue that secrecy is critical to protect the safety of those involved in the execution process. Yet in a 2018 report, the Washington-D.C.-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center found that this argument often led to these states refusing to provide information about the qualifications of their execution teams and some courts have criticized such arguments for lack of evidence that more public disclosure would result in threats against prison officials. Kelley Henry, chief of the federal public defender's habeas unit that represents many of Tennessee's death row inmates, described the state's refusal to release the new protocol, given that background, as 'mystifying.' 'The secrecy, which cloaked the former execution protocol, created a culture of incompetence and lack of accountability,' she said in an email.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-state-of-tennessee-refuses-to-release-its-new-execution-manual/7922881.html	2025-01-03T23:49:36-08:00

Deadly accident has Hawaii officials pleading for end to amateur fireworks shows	honolulu — In recent years, occasions large and small — parties, Super Bowls, mixed martial arts fights, even Thanksgiving — have provided a reason for residents across Hawaii to set off illegal fireworks. The increasingly sophisticated displays, loved by some and loathed by others, are so prevalent that some people consider them part of the state's culture. They have rattled neighborhoods of tightly packed houses, started fires, terrorized pets and knocked a light fixture off the ceiling of an Associated Press reporter's home, where it narrowly missed a child and shattered on the floor. Each New Year's Day, Honolulu officials publish a list of fireworks casualties from the night before, typically a litany of burns, shrapnel wounds or amputations. Sometimes there are deaths. But none of the damage has matched Tuesday night's tragedy, when a lit bundle of mortar-style aerials tipped over and shot into crates of unlit fireworks, causing a rapid-fire series of blasts that killed three women and injured more than 20 people, including children. On Friday, the Honolulu medical examiner's department identified two of the women as Nelie Ibarra, 58, and Jennifer Van, 23. The cause and manner of death for both were listed as pending. The identity of the third was not yet confirmed, the department said in a news release. Another person was killed in an unrelated fireworks explosion on Oahu. Authorities and residents alike are now wondering whether the toll will dissuade people from putting on such shows in the future, or whether it will prompt more effective efforts by police to crack down. 'This incident is a painful reminder of the danger posed by illegal fireworks,' Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi told a news conference. 'They put lives at risk, they drain our first responders and they disrupt our neighborhoods.' Efforts to crack down on contraband fireworks have had limited effect. In 2023, lawmakers created an illegal fireworks task force. Based on the ease with which it seized fireworks, including three shipping containers in its first few months in operation, the state Department of Law Enforcement concluded illegal fireworks are likely smuggled into Hawaii on a daily basis. The task force has seized 227,000 pounds (about 103,000 kilograms) of fireworks in all, according to Governor Josh Green. And yet, the Honolulu Fire Department reported Thursday that there were 30 fireworks-related blazes between Tuesday and Wednesday, a 30% increase from last New Year's celebrations. Representative Gregg Takayama, who sponsored legislation passed last year to tighten fireworks controls, said he remembers setting them off when he was younger and agrees it's a tradition for many. But the ones he played with, including Roman candles, pale in comparison to those on the black market today. 'The kind of aerial fireworks that are being used now are really explosive bombs,' he said. 'And so the danger is magnified.' Charmaine Doran, the vice chair of the neighborhood board in Pearl City, northwest of Honolulu, called the notion that fireworks are part of Hawaii culture a misconception: 'They have been outlawed for all of my life ... and I'm pretty old.' In her neighborhood, the fireworks ramp up after Halloween, exploding in the middle of the night until New Year's. Doran said she can tell if there is a big mixed martial arts fight on TV because the booms begin earlier in the day. Enforcement is complicated because people are reluctant to report their neighbors on a small island where 'we're related to everybody, everybody knows everybody,' Doran said. People fear retribution, she added: 'If I dial 911, they're going to egg my house.' That was the theme of some testimony to the Legislature last January. Beverly Takushi, a Pearl City resident, described once being threatened by a neighbor when she told his brother to stop launching illegal fireworks in a show that lasted from 5:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve until after midnight. 'It was the first time I was threatened not only by the danger of the aerial fireworks to my family and property, but also for my safety from this neighbor who accused me of not respecting his culture,' Takushi said. 'He has since apologized, but this is the reason why no one wants to get involved and report their neighbors setting off bombs and aerials.' Many historians believe fireworks were invented in China more than 2,000 years ago and their use came to signify joy and prosperity, as well as warding off evil. In Hawaii they are celebrated not just by residents of Chinese descent but all across the state's diverse communities. Takushi echoed Takayama's point about the big difference between today's large, professional-grade fireworks and the smaller ones of yesteryear. 'A string of firecrackers at midnight to ward off bad spirits is cultural, not loud explosives that sound like you are in the middle of a war,' Takushi said. Richard Oshiro, secretary of the neighborhood board for Waipahu, known as one of Oahu's hot spots for aerial displays, said he hopes this week's deaths will spur a change of mentality about playing with explosives. He said he tries to report them whenever he can, even though he knows there is not much police can do if 'they can't catch people in the act.' Possession of over 50 pounds (about 23 kilograms) of aerial or other illegal fireworks in Hawaii is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Takayama noted the law now allows photographs and videos of fireworks to be submitted as evidence in court, but said prosecutions still face hurdles. 'We already have laws on the books. We need to find better ways to enforce them,' he said. 'I mean, we constantly hear about people who report on their neighbors using illegal aerials, but nothing is done about it.' The best way to control fireworks is to stop them at Hawaii's ports, Takayama said. Law enforcement has intelligence about which shipments contain illegal fireworks, and U.S. authorities have the power to open suspicious cargo. The task force has made seizures but needs to do more, he said. 'We need to find ways to restrict the amount of fireworks that are coming in, because once they arrive and once they're in the community, it's very difficult to track them down,' Takayama said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-accident-has-hawaii-officials-pleading-for-end-to-amateur-fireworks-shows/7924118.html	2025-01-03T23:47:28-08:00	
Ghana’s citizenship offer attracts some Black Americans	ACCRA, GHANA — Flipping through a family album, Keachia Bowers paused on a photo of her as a baby on her father's lap as he held the 1978 album 'Africa Stand Alone' by the Jamaican reggae band Culture. 'When I was 10 years old, I was supposed to come to Ghana with him,' she said. A day earlier, she had marked 10 years since her father's death. Though he was a Pan-Africanist who dreamed of visiting Ghana, he never made it here. Bowers and her husband, Damon Smith, however, are among the 524 diaspora members, mostly Black Americans, who were granted Ghanaian citizenship in a ceremony in November. Bowers and Smith moved to Ghana from Florida in 2023 after visiting the region several times between them since the '90s. They now run a tour business that caters to Black people who want to visit Ghana or elsewhere in West Africa, or like them have come to consider a permanent move. The November group was the largest one granted citizenship since Ghana launched the 'Year of the Return' program, aimed at attracting the Black diaspora, in 2019. It marked 400 years since the first African slaves arrived in Virginia in 1619. Ghana's Tourism Authority and the Office of Diaspora Affairs have extended the program into 'Beyond the Return,' which fosters the relationship with diasporans. Hundreds have been granted citizenship, including people from Canada, the U.K. and Jamaica. Bowers said moving to Ghana gave her family a certain feeling of ease they didn't have in the U.S. 'When we see Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, all these stories of people being murdered just in their home, living in their home and being murdered at the hands of police brutality, hearing about it creates trauma,' she said. She also worried about her son Tsadik, 14. Tsadik towers over loved ones in the way that lanky teenage boys often do. He is shy but opens up around his younger sister Tselah, 11, and the family's dog, Apollo. 'In America, being a Black male with locs who's very tall for his age, he is treated like a threat,' Bowers said. Americans face few obstacles to living in Ghana, with most people paying an annual residency fee. But Bowers said getting citizenship signified more than simply living in Ghana. 'I didn't need (citizenship) to tell me that I'm African. Anywhere that I go in the world and someone looks at me, I'm melanated,' she said. 'But my ancestors who wanted to return and come back home, those ancestors who never made it back,' she said, 'that passport, for me, is for them.' Between 10 to 15 million people were forcibly taken from Africa to the Americas during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the majority from West and Central Africa. Ghana, then a British colony known as the Gold Coast, was a main point of departure. As memorials to the slave trade become tourist destinations across West Africa, painful reminders of its brutality are easily accessible. From Ghana to Senegal to Benin, one can visit variations of the 'Door of No Return,' haunting doorways that open to the Atlantic Ocean where slaves left Africa, and their families, for the last time. The joy that people feel in finding connections that were broken long ago is palpable. Videos of the recent citizenship ceremony show men and women of all ages waving Ghanaian flags and cheering. Deijha Gordon, 33, was one of them. 'I first visited Ghana in 2015. From then on, I knew this is a place that I wanted to be and a place where I wanted to show other diasporans, African-Americans, that we have a place where we belong,' she said. She moved from Brooklyn to Ghana in 2019 and opened a food truck, Deijha Vu's Jerk Hut, selling Jamaican food. Between bagging to-go orders and speaking to a Black American tourist couple, she explained how she built the business from scratch. Gordon was giddy while recalling the moment she got citizenship. 'It just feels good to have a connection to an African country as an African-American, as a Black American. Because back in America we don't have anything to trace our roots to but Africa. To have that connection here, I feel like I've done something right,' she said. Like Bowers, Gordon has had a stream of people reaching out and asking about the citizenship process. The path is not clearly defined. Citizenship must come from a concession from Ghana's presidency, a process made legal under the 2000 Citizenship Act. It's granted to those residing in Ghana who have told the Office of Diaspora Affairs that they are interested in citizenship. Ghana's government in part describes the program as a benefit to the economy and focuses on investment opportunities for those wishing to relocate. Festus Owooson with the local nonprofit Migration Advocacy Center said that though the government emphasizes the economic angle, the real benefits of citizenship are intangible. 'I don't think (recipients) were crying because they have landed a gold mine, or they've found oil or some kind of business opportunity. But it's something so relieving, which you cannot put value or a price on,' he said. President Nana Akufo-Addo's administration, which launched the 'Year of the Return,' is on its way out. Ghana's main opposition party won the presidential election on Dec. 7. But Owooson said Black Americans and other diaspora citizens are likely to continue receiving citizenship by presidential concession. Citizenship also can pass to the next generation. The children of Bowers and Smith received it automatically after their parents' ceremony. Bowers' father, like her husband and children, was a follower of the Rastafari faith. 'Part of the Rastafarian tradition is to repatriate. We see repatriation as the ultimate experience that you can have on this earth,' she said. She believes that her father is proud of her. 'I really feel like he's smiling, where he is. He wanted to experience this for himself, so he's experiencing it through me.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-s-citizenship-offer-attracts-some-black-americans/7924102.html	2025-01-03T23:46:54-08:00	
Danish-Swedish farmdog joins American Kennel Club's lineup	NEW YORK — Say hello to the latest dog in the American Kennel Club's lineup of recognized breeds. Or you might say 'hej.' The Danish-Swedish farmdog — yep, that's the official name — joined the pack Thursday. The designation makes the breed eligible to compete for many best in show trophies, and it likely augurs more widespread interest in the small, sprightly dogs. The prospect both gladdens and concerns their biggest fans. 'We're excited about it. We're looking forward to it,' said Carey Segebart, one of the people who worked to get Danish-Swedish farmdogs recognized by the AKC. She proudly plans to debut one of her own at a dog show this month near her Iowa home. Still, she thinks increased exposure is 'a double-edged sword' for the fleet, versatile pups. 'We don't want the breed to just explode too quickly,' she said. Called the farmdog or DSF for short, the breed goes back centuries in parts of what are now Denmark, southern Sweden and some other European countries, according to the Danish-Swedish Farmdog Club of America. 'They're interesting, fun little dogs,' said Segebart, who has owned them since 2011 and is the club's incoming president. 'They're essentially up for anything. They succeed at most everything.' In their original homelands, the dogs' main job was rodent patrol, but they also would herd a bit, act as watchdogs and play with farmers' children. Some even performed in circuses, according to the club. After Denmark and Sweden became more urban and suburban in the 20th century, farmdog fanciers set out to secure the breed's place in both nations (where 'hej' translates to the English 'hello'). Kennel clubs there began registering farmdogs in 1987. In the U.S., many of the just about 350 farmdogs nationwide compete in agility, obedience or other canine sports that are open to all dogs, including mixed breeds. But until now, farmdogs couldn't enter the traditional breed-by-breed judging that leads to best in show prizes at events including the prominent Westminster Kennel Club dog show in New York. The entry deadline has passed for February's Westminster show, so farmdogs will have to wait for 2026 there, but they may well appear later this year at two other major, televised shows, the National Dog Show and AKC National Championship. The Danish-Swedish farmdog is the AKC's 202nd breed and 'a wonderful addition to a family that is able to provide it with the exercise and mental stimulation that it needs,' said the club's Gina DiNardo. Too popular for its own good? The AKC is the United States' oldest purebred dog registry and essentially a league for many dog competitions. Registration is voluntary, and requirements for breed recognition include at least 300 pedigreed dogs spread through at least 20 states. Some breeds are in other kennel clubs or none at all. Danish-Swedish farmdog fanciers deliberated for several years before pursuing AKC recognition and the attention that's likely to come with it, Segebart said. The number of farmdog puppy-seekers has grown substantially over the last decade; each of the few breeders receives multiple inquiries a week, and the typical wait for a puppy is a year or more, she said. Farmdog folk fear that their appealing, relatively easy-care breed could quickly become too popular for its own good. They're not the first to worry: Much fur has flown in dogdom over the rise of the French bulldog, which the AKC now ranks as the most popular breed in the country. Some animal rights activists echo those concerns to argue against dog breeding in general. They say purebred popularity trends divert people from adopting shelter animals, fuel puppy mills and prize dogs' appearance over their health. The AKC says it promotes responsibly 'breeding for type and function' to produce dogs with at least somewhat predictable traits, whether as basic as size or as specialized as bomb-sniffing skills. The club says it has given over $35 million since 1995 to its canine health research charity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/danish-swedish-farmdog-joins-american-kennel-club-s-lineup-/7922875.html	2025-01-03T23:46:17-08:00	
Scientists hail impact of Ethiopia's Lucy fossil on understanding humans	washington — On a sunny Sunday morning along the Awash River in the small Ethiopian town of Hadar, a newly minted Ph.D. from the University of Chicago uncovered a fossil-rich site that would redefine human history. Fossil hunting in the area was no accident — elephant, pig, rhino and antelope remains were abundant. Driven by optimism, he says he hoped to uncover something extraordinary: a human ancestor fossil. 'I looked over my right shoulder, I saw a little fragment of bone, and I recognized it as coming from one of the bones in the arm, the bone that allows us to flex and extend our arm,' scientist Donald Johanson recalled. 'I looked at it. I thought at first maybe it was a baboon,' he said. 'It was very tiny. As I examined it more closely, I could see the anatomy was the anatomy of a human ancestor … and as I looked around, I found fragments of a skull, fragments of a jaw, and it was part of a skeleton.' Johanson, along with graduate student Tom Gray, had made one of the most important findings in paleontology, discovering a 3.2 million-year-old human ancestor fossil, about 40% complete. That was 50 years ago. The discovery of Lucy, or 'Dinknesh' as the remains are locally known, changed not just Johanson’s career but it also shed new light on how humans evolved and changed over time, according to Johanson, who became a founding director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. 'She and many of the fossils we found tell us that all humans on the planet came from Africa, that Africa is the homeland for humanity, and that we have a common past, no matter the color of our skin, the shape of our eyes, the texture of our hair. We carry the genes of Africa in all of us,' Johanson told VOA Horn of Africa, reflecting on the 50th anniversary of the discovery of iconic Lucy on Nov. 24, 1974. 'We should be thinking about a common future for the species Homo sapiens that we have become today,' he said. The discovery attracted scientists from around the world to the region, spurring extensive research and inspiring Ethiopian scientists to make significant findings of their own. Among them is Zeresenay Alemseged, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Chicago, who said Lucy is the earliest and most complete human ancestor fossil ever uncovered. The discovery 'literally transformed our knowledge of human evolution,' he said. 'At that point, the earliest humans, meaning apart walking creatures, were considered to have lived 2 million years ago, but with the discovery of Lucy, that number changed by a whopping 1 million years,' Zeresenay said. 'Lucy continues to serve us as a benchmark, as a reference point for discoveries. So, her influence and impact was huge,' he said. While completing his studies in Addis Ababa, Zeresenay was assigned to the National Museum of Ethiopia, home to Lucy's fossil. This opportunity allowed him to study a wealth of discoveries made by scientists from around the globe, including Johanson. In 2000, Zeresenay made his own discovery, a fossil that was over 60% complete, which lived 150,000 years before Lucy. The fossilized remains, called Selam, were from a child who died at the age of 2-1/2 or 3, which Zeresenay said is a very rare occurrence. 'In terms of discovery, most of the fossils that we find come from adult individuals, so in many ways, she represents the earliest and most complete child ever discovered in the history of paleoanthropology,' he told VOA. 'Her contribution to the scientific community is that she fills in a major gap that continues to puzzle us because we don't normally discover juvenile individuals, young individuals, infants, much less a complete skeleton of an infant.' Zeresenay explained that the discoveries of Lucy and Selam have been instrumental in public outreach efforts for Ethiopia. Selam was uncovered in 2000 in Dikika, in the Afar region of the country. 'Even the new motto of the Tourism Commission in Ethiopia — 'The land of Origins' — was coined by me,' he said. 'I, of course, leaned on both Selam and Lucy, but many other discoveries, to show that the country is the land of origins — the cradle of mankind — and also the origin of many things, including the Nile, coffee, et cetera.' The discovery of Selam was made in a dangerous area contested by rival clans of Afar and Issa ethnic groups where land disputes lead to deadly violence among neighboring communities. Zeresenay named his fossil Selam — or 'Peace,' in Amharic, Tigrigna and Arabic — which was proposed by museum visitors who viewed the fossil. He said he hoped there would be peace in the area of the discovery as Ethiopian Afar and Issa communities continue to clash over land disputes. 'If we see so much misery and problems in Africa and other parts of the world, it's really for lack of having a good understanding, a scientific understanding, a technological understanding of what is around us,' Zeresenay said. 'So I would urge our young population to be keen about science and technology.'

Myanmar junta to free 5,864 prisoners under amnesty	Myanmar's military government will release 5,864 prisoners, including 180 foreigners, under an amnesty marking the Southeast Asian nation's independence day, state media said Saturday. Myanmar has been in turmoil since early 2021, when the military overthrew an elected civilian government and violently suppressed pro-democracy protests, sparking a nationwide armed rebellion. The junta has said it will hold elections this year, but the plan has been widely condemned by opposition groups as a sham. Among those still imprisoned by the junta is the country's former leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The 79-year-old is serving a 27-year sentence tied to 14 criminal charges ranging from incitement and election fraud to corruption. She denies all the charges, according to her lawyers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-junta-to-free-5-864-prisoners-under-amnesty/7924153.html	2025-01-03T21:25:03-08:00	
Moldovan PM warns of security crisis after cutoff of Russian gas	Kyiv, ukraine — Moldova faces a security crisis, Prime Minister Dorin Recean said Friday, after its separatist pro-Moscow Transdniestria region, cut off from supplies of Russian gas, closed factories, restricted central heating and imposed rolling power blackouts. Flows of Russian gas via Ukraine to central and eastern Europe were halted on New Year's Day after a transit agreement between the warring countries expired and Kyiv rejected doing further business with Moscow. Recean said government-controlled Moldova would cover its own energy needs with domestic production and imports but noted the separatist Transdniestria region had suffered a painful hit despite its ties with Moscow. 'By jeopardizing the future of the protectorate it has backed for three decades in an effort to destabilize Moldova, Russia is revealing the inevitable outcome for all its allies – betrayal and isolation,' Recean said in a statement. 'We treat this as a security crisis aimed at enabling the return of pro-Russian forces to power in Moldova and weaponizing our territory against Ukraine, with whom we share a 1,200 km border.' The official Telegram news channel of separatist Transdniestria said rolling power cuts had gone into effect on Friday evening. It listed districts where power would be cut for an hour or more between 6 p.m. and 10 p.m. 'As the Ministry of Economic Development notes, this is in connection with the fact that residents at this time are consuming more power than the system can generate,' the channel said. The news channel said a sanatorium, fully heated and with hot water, was sheltering orphans and residents of nursing homes. It accused Moldova's central government of failing to understand or tackle the difficulties facing the region. 'Moldovan authorities are completely out of touch with reality and continue to talk about 'the price of freedom from Russian gas,' ' the channel said. Transdniestria's residents had already lost hot water and central heating, and all factories except food producers have been forced to stop production. The enclave's self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, had earlier said power cuts were inevitable. He said the region had gas reserves to cover 10 days of limited usage in the north and twice as long in the south. Russia denies using gas as a weapon to coerce Moldova and blames Kyiv for refusing to renew the gas transit deal. Dispute over arrears Russian gas giant Gazprom had separately said on December 28 that it would suspend exports to Moldova on January 1 because of what Russia says are unpaid Moldovan debts of $709 million. Moldova disputes that and has put the figure at $8.6 million. The southeast European nation of about 2.5 million people has been in the spotlight since Russia's invasion of neighboring Ukraine at a time of mounting tensions between Moscow and the West. Its pro-European president, Maia Sandu, won a second term in an election last year and has pledged to accelerate reform and consolidate democratization. Moldova plans to hold a parliamentary election this summer. Mainly Russian-speaking Transdniestria, which split from Moldova in the 1990s, received Russian gas via Ukraine. In turn, Moldova used to receive the bulk of its electricity from Transdniestria. But, with Kyiv making clear it would stop gas transit from Russia, the Chisinau government prepared alternative arrangements, with a mixture of domestic production and electricity imports from Romania, Recean said. He said the Moldovan government remained committed to helping the enclave. 'Alternative energy solutions, such as biomass systems, generators, humanitarian aid and essential medical supplies, are ready for delivery should the breakaway leadership accept the support,' the government said in a statement. The head of Moldova's national gas company Moldovagaz, Vadim Ceban, said Transdniestrian authorities had turned down an offer to help purchase gas from European countries because the enclave believes Russian gas supplies could still be resumed. Such purchases would be more costly. Gazprom has long supplied gas to the region without demanding payment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovan-pm-warns-of-security-crisis-after-cutoff-of-russian-gas-/7924132.html	2025-01-03T18:53:25-08:00	
National funeral service, flyover and 39 bells for Carter sendoff	PLAINS, GEORGIA — Mourners are to begin paying their respects to Jimmy Carter on Saturday, kicking off a carefully choreographed six-day farewell for America's longest-lived president. Flags have been flying at half-staff across the country since Carter died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100 in his hometown of Plains, Georgia. Carter's state funeral officially begins on Saturday with Secret Service agents from his current and former protective detail carrying his casket to a hearse for a tour through Plains. The motorcade bearing his remains is to pause at Carter's boyhood family peanut farm while a farm bell rings 39 times in honor of America's 39th president. His body will then be taken to Atlanta for a brief stop at the Georgia Capitol, where Carter served as a state senator before becoming governor, and a moment of silence. From there, Carter will be escorted to the Carter Presidential Center where he will lie in repose from 7 p.m. on Saturday (0000 GMT Sunday) to 6 a.m. (1100 GMT) on Tuesday to allow the public to pay their respects. Carter's remains will be flown on Tuesday morning from a military base in Georgia to Joint Base Andrews outside Washington on a U.S. Air Force plane dubbed Special Air Mission 39. A motorcade will then transport the body of the former commander-in-chief to the U.S. Navy Memorial. Carter, who attended the U.S. Naval Academy, graduating in 1946, and served on submarines, will be transferred from a hearse to a horse-drawn caisson for a funeral procession to the U.S. Capitol. Military pall bearers will carry his flag-draped casket to the rotunda of the Capitol where his body will lie in state until 7 a.m. (1200 GMT) on Thursday, surrounded by a guard of honor of service members. Carter will be the 13th former U.S. president to lie in state in the Capitol. Abraham Lincoln, assassinated in 1865, was the first. A national funeral service is to be held on Thursday at the National Cathedral, an Episcopal church in the nation's capital that also hosted state funerals for former presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush. All four living former presidents — Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama and Donald Trump — are expected to attend. President Joe Biden is to deliver the eulogy for his fellow Democrat, who served in the White House from 1977-81. Biden has declared Thursday to be a national day of mourning, and federal government offices are to be closed for the day. He has also ordered flags to be flown at half-staff for 30 days as is customary, which means that will be the case during Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. That drew the ire of the president-elect, who took to Truth Social to say 'no American can be happy' about having flags at half-staff when he takes office. Following the cathedral service, Carter's remains will be flown aboard Special Air Mission 39 back to Georgia for a private funeral service at the Baptist church in Plains where Carter taught Sunday school. A final motorcade through his hometown will ferry Carter's body to a burial plot at his residence. U.S. Navy jets will conduct a flyover in his honor before he is laid to rest alongside his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn, who died in 2023 at the age of 96.	https://www.voanews.com/a/national-funeral-service-flyover-and-39-bells-for-carter-sendoff/7924128.html	2025-01-03T18:39:40-08:00	
US new car sales hit 5-year high in 2024, helped by hybrids	DETROIT — U.S. new car sales in 2024 continued to rise from their pandemic lows, bolstered by replenished inventories, higher incentives and surging demand for hybrid vehicles, automakers reported on Friday. Sales of new vehicles finished at 15.9 million last year, according to Wards Intelligence, up 2.2% from the prior year, and the highest since 2019. Automakers are projecting strong sales will continue into 2025, although President-elect Donald Trump's proposed automotive policies, such as removing tax credits for EVs, present a wild card. 'We’re carrying significant momentum into 2025,' Rory Harvey, GM's head of global markets, said in a release. The Detroit automaker defended its 2023 crown as the biggest U.S. carmaker by sales, selling 2.7 million vehicles last year, the company said on Friday, up 4.3% from 2023. Most automakers recorded solid sales results last year, as they adjusted to slowing demand for EVs and relied on their core business of gasoline-powered trucks and SUVs. Others capitalized on soaring consumer interest in hybrid vehicles. Sales of traditional hybrids increased 36.7% in 2024 compared with the previous year, Wards reported. 'Hybrids, we're sold out' Toyota notched a 3.7% sales gain year-over-year in the U.S., boosted by steady increases of reliable smaller vehicles such as the Camry and RAV4 SUV, as well as significant gains for hybrid vehicles. Reuters reported last year that the automaker is potentially converting all of its lineup into hybrid-only models. 'For hybrids, we’re sold out — customers want them. We can’t get enough of them,' said David Christ, head of sales and marketing for Toyota in North America. 'Battery electric vehicles, even with the huge incentives we’re spending and the federal government’s incentives, are just not as in demand.' Ford Motor also benefited from an increase in hybrid sales, which helped the automaker's total vehicle sales rise 4.2% in 2024. The Dearborn, Michigan, company's total hybrid sales roughly doubled that of its EVs, with 187,426 hybrids sold and 97,865 EVs. Automakers have axed or changed lofty EV plans laid out when demand seemed much stronger than it turned out to be, but they are still aiming to attract new EV buyers. Ford said on Friday that to support EV sales, which were up 34.8% for the automaker in 2024, it would extend a program where EV buyers receive free chargers and installation at home through the end of March. U.S. sales of electric vehicles are expected to approach 1.3 million, or about 8% of all new vehicles purchased, Cox Automotive said. Buyers' willingness to go electric crept up slightly from 2023, when U.S. drivers bought 1.2 million EVs, making up 7.6% of all sales, Cox said. The Trump administration's plans would likely affect auto sales in 2025 and beyond if the incoming president makes good on plans to roll back President Joe Biden's EV policies, including a $7,500 consumer tax credit on some EVs, as well as increase tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada. 'If you take true demand for the car and you eliminate the $7,500 benefit ... it's really going to change who wants them and how they buy them. So we're preparing for that,' Toyota's Christ said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-new-car-sales-hit-5-year-high-in-2024-helped-by-hybrids/7924097.html	2025-01-03T17:43:55-08:00	
US announces $306 million in new bird flu funding	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden's outgoing administration announced Friday that it will allocate $306 million to bolster the nation's bird flu response before President-elect Donald Trump takes office. The new funding will support national, state and local preparedness and monitoring programs, as well as research into potential medical countermeasures against the H5N1 virus. 'While the risk to humans remains low, we are always preparing for any possible scenario that could arise,' Health Secretary Xavier Becerra said in a statement. 'Preparedness is the key to keeping Americans healthy and our country safe.' The United States has reported 66 human cases of bird flu since the start of 2024, though experts believe the true number could be higher, with cases potentially going undetected among cattle and poultry workers. While the virus has not been found to spread from person to person, the amount of bird flu circulating among animals and humans has alarmed scientists, because it might combine with seasonal influenza and mutate into a more transmissible form — potentially triggering a deadly pandemic. The funding announcement comes amid concern over how the incoming Trump administration will handle the threat. The president-elect told Time magazine recently he would abolish the Office of Pandemic Preparedness and Response Policy established under Biden — though it is not clear if he has the authority to do so, since it was created by Congress. His pick for health secretary, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., is a vocal vaccine skeptic who has pledged to shake up the nation's health agencies and promotes raw milk, thought to be a vector for bird flu. Biden's administration has also faced criticism for what some consider a subpar bird flu response. The Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based think tank, published a report last month citing an array of problems including 'lagging data, incomplete surveillance, sluggish coordination, considerable mistrust, and insufficient planning and stockpiling of vaccines and therapies.' Given these shortcomings, infectious disease epidemiologist Meg Schaeffer of the SAS Institute told AFP: 'In my opinion, avian influenza is going to become either a pandemic or a virus... that will become a very widespread and significant health issue for us in the next one to two years.' She urged raw milk consumers in particular to 'take a pause on that consumption.' Adding to concerns, a virus sample from a critically ill patient in Louisiana has shown signs of mutating to better adapt to human airways, although there is no evidence it has spread beyond that individual, health authorities said last week. Researchers are also closely monitoring the growing number of bird flu infections in cats, which could expose humans through close contact.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-announces-306-million-in-new-bird-flu-funding/7924091.html	2025-01-03T17:31:54-08:00	
Biden's top aide to make China-focused visit to India	washington — President Joe Biden's national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, will make his final visit to India next week to emphasize Washington's partnership with New Delhi, the White House announced Friday. The visit will cap the Biden administration's efforts to maximize ties with Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, in its strategic focus to counter China's influence in the Indo-Pacific. Strengthening ties with India has been a 'real foreign policy priority and area of legacy achievement for the Biden administration,' a senior administration official said on condition of anonymity in a briefing to reporters Friday. Sullivan will visit New Delhi January 5-6 to discuss a range of issues, including civil nuclear partnership, China's overcapacity on semiconductor and biopharma supply chains, strategic technology cooperation and other shared security priorities, a second administration official said. Sullivan's visit comes as tension is brewing between India and China over Beijing's plan to build what it calls the 'world's largest' hydro dam on the Yarlung Zangbo River on the eastern rim of the Tibetan plateau, which could affect millions downstream in India and Bangladesh. Sullivan is expected to discuss the dam along with other regional issues of concern, said the first administration official in response to VOA's question. 'What matters to us is that when it comes to water resources that have to be managed across countries, that those are being handled fairly and in an equitable way,' the official said. Technology initiative A key focus of the visit is the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) – an effort that Biden and Modi announced in May 2022 to bolster their strategic technology partnership and defense-industrial cooperation between their governments, businesses and academic institutions across various domains, from AI to quantum computing, and from semiconductors to space. Sullivan's visit will take place just two weeks before President-elect Donald Trump assumes office January 20. Many expect iCET to continue under his administration. 'There is broad bipartisan support for some of the goals of iCET,' said the second administration official in response to VOA's question. They include 'strengthening the resilience of technology supply chains, working with allies and partners to position ourselves to offset PRC [People Republic of China's] advancements in certain technologies, and efforts to dominate some of the supply chains.' The U.S. strategic partnership with New Delhi is 'based upon a bet that India's economic, technological and military rise is critical to pushing back and containing China's dominance in these fields,' said Aparna Pande, director of the Initiative on the Future of India and South Asia at the Hudson Institute. Irritants have not derailed bilateral ties. Those include India's democratic backsliding, and the case of a former Indian government employee charged in New York last year with murder-for-hire over his role in directing a foiled plot to assassinate a Sikh separatist and Modi critic. Most of Biden's policies on India will likely continue, Pande told VOA, as Trump's desire to 'push back or contain China's rise – economic, technological and military – will help ensure that India is seen as a partner in this endeavor.' During his first administration, Trump had a warm relationship with Modi. Trump attended a 2019 'Howdy Modi' rally in Texas, and Modi reciprocated by hosting a 'Namaste Trump' rally in Ahmedabad in 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-s-top-aide-to-make-china-focused-visit-to-india-/7924089.html	2025-01-03T17:31:51-08:00	
Iranians react to Carter's death with much criticism, little praise	washington — Iranians opposed to their nation's Islamist rulers who seized power during the U.S. presidency of Jimmy Carter have reacted to his death at age 100 with a wave of criticism about his enduring impact on Iran and some supportive views of his post-presidential activities. On the Monday edition of VOA Persian's 'On the Line' live audience call-in show, all 12 audience members whose phone calls, video and voice messages were featured in the program criticized Carter, accusing him of enabling the Islamic Republic's first supreme leader, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, to seize power in 1979. Eleven of the 12 audience members who commented for the Persian-language show were calling from Iran, while the other audience member was in the U.S. Khomeini and his radical Shiite followers toppled the monarchy of Iran's U.S.-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, on Feb. 11, 1979. Pahlavi had fled into exile the previous month and arrived in the United States on Oct. 22, 1979, for cancer treatment that Carter approved. Islamist militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the deposed shah stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran on Nov. 4, 1979, taking 66 Americans hostage. Thirteen were released weeks later but the remaining 53 Americans were held through the rest of Carter's presidency. Iran freed them after 444 days, upon the Jan. 20, 1981, inauguration of Carter's successor, Ronald Reagan. Betrayal The Iranian callers to the VOA Persian show unanimously expressed the view that Carter betrayed the shah by abandoning him as he faced a growing Islamist rebellion and not doing enough to stop Iran from being plunged into a dark era with its people enduring hardship under 45 years of authoritarian Islamist rule. After leaving office, Carter said he tried to balance strategic and humanitarian considerations in his relationship with and treatment of the shah. Prominent U.S.-based Iranian supporters of Iran's exiled crown prince Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, also used the X platform to post sharply critical views of Carter's legacy. Journalist Behnam Amini wrote in Persian: 'The man responsible for the misery of the Iranian nation has died. Soon, the downfall of the regime that he nurtured will come as well.' Also writing in Persian, monarchist Saman Sarraf described Carter as the 'founder of the Islamic Republic' and said: 'With Carter's death, the Islamic regime is on the brink of collapse.' Reza Pahlavi and his mother, exiled queen Farah Pahlavi, have been silent on Carter's death. The exiled crown prince's office did not immediately respond to a VOA request for comment sent Friday. The National Iranian American Council (NIAC), a U.S. nonprofit critical of the Pahlavi dynasty whose mission is to 'advance peace and diplomacy, secure equitable immigration policies and protect the civil rights of all Americans,' sent VOA a different view of Carter's role in Iran's Islamic Revolution. In a Friday statement, NIAC President Jamal Abdi said, 'It is important to understand that the 1979 [Islamic] Revolution was made and led by Iranians, not by the United States. In fact, U.S. support for the shah, despite his brutality toward protesters and torture of political opponents, was one of the triggers for popular protest.' Abdi also wrote that members of the Iranian American community admire Carter's efforts after his presidency to advance Middle East peace and to warn about the direction of the Arab-Israeli conflict. 'President Carter's legacy is multi-layered and complex, and not one that neatly fits the worldviews of his most animated detractors,' Abdi wrote. Exiled Iranian journalist Akbar Ganji, also a critic of the Pahlavi dynasty, offered praise for Carter in a Persian-language post on X, calling him a 'lifelong advocate for human rights around the world' in his post-presidency activities. This article was produced in collaboration with VOA's Persian Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iranians-react-to-carter-s-death-with-much-criticism-little-praise-/7924083.html	2025-01-03T17:18:25-08:00	
Central American troops arrive in Haiti to fight gangs	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — A contingent of security forces from Guatemala and El Salvador arrived in Haiti's capital Friday to reinforce a long-delayed United Nations-backed mission tasked with restoring security amid a bloody conflict with armed gangs. The new arrivals were made up of 75 Guatemalans and eight Salvadorans, a communications officer for the mission said. The president of Haiti's transitional presidential council, Leslie Voltaire, alongside Prime Minister Alix Didier Fils-Aime and U.S. Ambassador Dennis Hankins, welcomed the troops at Port-au-Prince's airport, Haiti's interim government said in a post on social media. 'They have come to reinforce the Multinational Force in the fight against gangsters and guns in the country,' the government said. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arevalo had in September pledged to send 150 military police, three months after initially pledging in a letter to the U.N. an unnumbered contingent alongside personal equipment. El Salvador had in August promised 78 soldiers for medical evacuation operations as well as three helicopters — much needed by Haitian security forces contending with mountainous terrain and highways scattered with gang-controlled checkpoints. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who has garnered broad popularity over a harsh crackdown on organized crime in his home country including the use of mass trials and construction of a 'mega-jail,' has stated that he would be able to 'fix' Haiti and that its gangs must be 'obliterated.' The mission is being led by Kenya, which deployed nearly 400 police in the middle of last year, far short of the 1,000 it had promised. The police were later joined by 24 Jamaican personnel and two senior officers from Belize. However, the mission has failed to prevent gangs from taking new territories and committing several massacres as violence dramatically escalated in the last months of 2024, causing thousands more people to flee their homes. Haiti's national police have meanwhile shed thousands of officers in recent years. Some 10 countries have together pledged over 3,100 troops for Haiti, but few have so far deployed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-american-troops-arrive-in-haiti-to-fight-gangs/7924084.html	2025-01-03T17:15:41-08:00	
Soldier who died in Las Vegas blast meant it to be 'wake-up call' for US	An Army soldier who died in an explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck at the Trump hotel in Las Vegas left a note saying it was a stunt to serve as a 'wake-up call' for the country's ills, investigators said Friday. Matthew Livelsberger, 37, a Green Beret from Colorado Springs, Colorado, also wrote in the note that he needed to 'cleanse my mind' of the lives lost of people he knew and 'the burden of the lives I took.' Livelsberger apparently harbored no ill will toward President-elect Donald Trump, Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department officials said. 'Although this incident is more public and more sensational than usual, it ultimately appears to be a tragic case of suicide involving a heavily decorated combat veteran who was struggling with PTSD and other issues,' Spencer Evans, FBI special agent in charge, said at a news conference. The explosion caused minor injuries to seven people but virtually no damage to the hotel. Authorities said Friday that Livelsberger acted alone. 'Not a terrorist attack' 'This was not a terrorist attack, it was a wake-up call. Americans only pay attention to spectacles and violence. What better way to get my point across than a stunt with fireworks and explosives,' Livelsberger wrote in a letter found by authorities who released only excerpts of it. Investigators identified the Tesla driver — who was burned beyond recognition — as Livelsberger by a tattoo and by comparing DNA from relatives. The cause of death was a self-inflicted gunshot to the head, according to coroner's officials. Pentagon officials have declined to say whether Livelsberger may have been suffering from mental health issues but say they have turned over his medical records to police. Authorities excerpted the messages from two letters Livelsberger wrote using a cellphone note application, said Assistant Sheriff Dori Koren of the Las Vegas police. The letters covered a range of topics including political grievances, domestic issues and societal issues, Koren said. Tesla engineers, meanwhile, helped extract data from the Cybertruck for investigators, including Livelsberger's path between charging stations from Colorado through New Mexico and Arizona and on to Las Vegas, Koren said. 'We still have a large volume of data to go through,' Koren said. 'There's thousands if not millions of videos and photos and documents and web history and all of those things that need to be analyzed.' The new details came as investigators sought to determine Livelsberger's motive, including whether he sought to make a political point with the Tesla and the hotel bearing the president-elect's name. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has recently become a member of Trump's inner circle. Neither Trump nor Musk was in Las Vegas early Wednesday, the day of the explosion. Both had attended Trump's New Year's Eve party at his South Florida estate. Musk spent an estimated $250 million during the presidential campaign to support Trump, who has named Musk, the world's richest man, to co-lead a new effort to find ways to cut the government's size and spending. Truck absorbed blast Investigators suspect Livelsberger may have been planning a more damaging attack, but the steel-sided vehicle absorbed much of the force from the crudely built explosive. Investigators said previously that Livelsberger shot himself inside the Tesla Cybertruck packed with fireworks just before it exploded outside Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas on New Year's Day. 'It's not lost on us that it's in front of the Trump building, that it's a Tesla vehicle, but we don't have information at this point that definitively tells us or suggests it was because of this particular ideology,' the FBI’s Evans said Thursday. A law enforcement official said investigators learned through interviews that he might have had a fight with his wife about relationship issues shortly before he rented the Tesla in Colorado on Saturday and bought the guns. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because of a lack of authorization to discuss the investigation. Livelsberger served in the Green Berets, highly trained special forces who work to counter terrorism abroad and train partners. He had served in the Army since 2006, rising through the ranks with a long career of overseas assignments, deploying twice to Afghanistan and serving in Ukraine, Tajikistan, Georgia and Congo, the Army said. He had recently returned from an overseas assignment in Germany and was on approved leave when he died, according to a U.S. official. He was awarded five Bronze Stars, including one with a valor device for courage under fire, a combat infantry badge and an Army Commendation Medal with valor. The explosion of the truck came hours after Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, 42, rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans' famed French Quarter early on New Year's Day, killing at least 14 people before being shot to death by police.	https://www.voanews.com/a/soldier-who-died-in-las-vegas-blast-meant-it-to-be-wake-up-call-for-us/7924075.html	2025-01-03T16:50:55-08:00	
Biden awards Medal of Honor and Medal of Valor to military heroes, first responders	WASHINGTON — On Feb. 15, 1951, Army Private Bruno R. Orig was returning from a mission when he found his fellow soldiers under attack in what's now known as the Battle of Chipyong-ni. The infantryman provided first aid to his comrades wounded in the Korean War attack and began helping move those men to safety. He then took over a machine gun post and allowed a friendly platoon to pull back without a casualty. When the ground was recaptured later that day, Orig was found dead beside the machine gun, surrounded by enemy combatants he had killed. Orig was among the Medal of Honor recipients recognized Friday by President Joe Biden in one of his last opportunities to officially acknowledge acts of selflessness and personal bravery in times of war. Biden bestowed the medal posthumously to six men and one living recipient at a White House ceremony. In a separate Oval Office ceremony closed to the news media, he awarded the Medal of Valor to eight first responders who put their own lives at risk to save others. These are heroes of different ranks, different positions and even different generations.' Biden said at the Medal of Honor ceremony, Friday evening. 'They are heroes who all went above and beyond the call of duty.' Acknowledging his last days as president, Biden said, 'These are my finals days as commander in chief. It was the greatest honor of my life to be entrusted' to lead America, he said 'and the finest military in the history of the world.' During the Korean War, Private First Class Wataru Nakamura destroyed an enemy machine gun nest and recaptured several bunkers. He exhausted his ammunition but resumed his attack after being rearmed, and he was ultimately killed by an enemy grenade and buried in Los Angeles. Army Corporal Fred B. McGee was recognized for his gallantry and intrepidity near Tang-Wan-Ni, Korea, on June 16, 1952, when he assumed command of his squad, neutralized an enemy machine gun and then sent his squad back while he helped rescue the wounded. The Ohio native died in 2020, according to news reports. Army Private First Class Charles R. Johnson, from Millbrook, New York, was killed on June 12, 1953, after holding off Chinese forces during the Korean War. His actions saved the lives of as many as 10 soldiers. After multiple raids on an entrenched enemy in the area of Sagimak during the Korean War, Army First Lieutenant Richard E. Cavazos stayed behind alone to evacuate five battle casualties to safety. Cavazos served more than three decades in the service, eventually attaining the rank of four-star general. The Texan died in 2018 at age 88. Fort Hood was renamed in honor of him on May 9, 2023. After an armed helicopter crashed during the Vietnam War on June 5, 1966, Army Captain Hugh R. Nelson Jr. from Rocky Mount, North Carolina, pulled two specialists from the aircraft, shielding one of them from enemy gunfire at the loss of his own life. While fighting in Vietnam on May 7, 1970, then-Army Private First Class Kenneth J. David drew enemy fire away from injured comrades and onto himself, becoming wounded by a satchel charge. But David kept fighting and pulled fire away from landing Medevac helicopters, and was evacuated after the last helicopter landed. The Ohioan is still living. On Friday, Biden also awarded eight people the Medal of Valor, which goes to those who have shown exceptional courage in attempting to save human lives. The recipients included the law enforcement officials who responded to a shooter who killed six people on March 27, 2023, at The Covenant School in Nashville, Tennessee. The Nashville Police Department's Sergeant Jeffrey Mathes, Officer Rex Engelbert and detectives Michael Collazo, Ryan Cagle and Zachary Plese rushed to the scene and faced gunfire from the shooter. They cleared out classrooms and ultimately took down the shooter. Biden also recognized Sergeant Tu Tran of the Lincoln, Nebraska, Police Department. On Feb. 22, 2023, Tran swam 9 meters (30 feet) into a frigid pond to rescue a woman from a submerging vehicle. Lieutenant John Vanderstar, a New York City firefighter, received the Medal of Valor for rescuing a mother and child from a burning apartment on Oct. 23, 2022. Separately, New York City firefighter Brendan Gaffney was honored for braving an apartment building fire to save an unconscious child and a pregnant woman.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-awards-medal-of-honor-and-medal-of-valor-to-military-heroes-first-responders-/7924074.html	2025-01-03T16:42:26-08:00	
Winter storms to hit much of US with snow, ice, biting cold	A strong snow and ice storm followed by brutally cold conditions will soon smack the eastern two-thirds of the United States as frigid air escapes the Arctic, plunging as far south as Florida, meteorologists said. Starting Saturday, millions of people are going to be hit by moderate to heavy snow from Kansas City to Washington — including a high chance of at least 8 inches of snow between central Kansas and Indiana — the National Weather Service warned Friday. Dangerous ice particularly lethal to power lines — 'so heavy like paste, it's hard to move,' said private meteorologist Ryan Maue — is likely to set in just south of that in southern Kansas, Missouri, Illinois, Indiana and much of Kentucky and West Virginia. 'It's going to be a mess, a potential disaster,' Maue said. 'This is something we haven't seen in quite a while.' National Weather Service meteorologist Alex Lamers said Friday that the potential for blizzard conditions was increasing, particularly in Kansas and neighboring portions of the Central Plains, and that wind gusts might reach 50 mph at times. As the storm moves away Monday, hundreds of millions of people in the eastern two-thirds of the nation will be plunged into dangerous, bone-chilling air and wind chills all week, government and private forecasters said. Temperatures could be 12 to 25 degrees Fahrenheit (7 to 14 degrees Celsius) colder than normal as the dreaded polar vortex stretches down from the high Arctic, bringing chilly weather, they said. 'This could lead to the coldest January for the U.S. since 2011,' Dan DePodwin, director of forecast operations for AccuWeather, said Friday. 'It’s not just one day of this. It's going to be three to five, in some cases a week or more of temperatures that are well below historical average.' Look out, Ohio Valley The biggest drop below normal is likely to be centered over the Ohio Valley, but significant unusual cold will extend southward all the way to the Gulf Coast, said Danny Barandiaran, a meteorologist at the National Weather Service’s Climate Prediction Center. Forecasts have moderated a bit from last week, when some computer models envisioned the worst cold spell in decades. Now it's unlikely many cold records will break, but it will still have a big impact on the country, Barandiaran said. There should even be a hard freeze in Florida, while areas near the Canadian border will be around zero, Barandiaran said. 'It’s not going to thaw out for a while,' Maue said. Jennifer Francis, a climate scientist at the Woodwell Climate Research Institute, said the initial blasting winds from the north might shock people after a fairly warm last couple of years. 'The wind chills are going to be brutal,' she said. 'There’ll be a lot of whining, but it is winter. ... Just because the globe is warming doesn’t mean these cold snaps are going away.' This nasty weather may be triggered in part by a fast-warming Arctic, serving as a not-so-gentle reminder that climate change gooses weather extremes, even winter ones, said Francis and Judah Cohen, seasonal forecast director at the private firm Atmospheric and Environmental Research. The polar vortex - ultra-cold air spinning like a top 15 to 30 miles high - usually stays penned up above the North Pole. But sometimes it escapes or stretches down to the United States, Europe or Asia. And that's when large numbers of people get intense doses of cold. Cohen and colleagues have published several studies showing an increase in the polar vortex stretching or wandering. Cohen, Francis and others last month published a study that attributed these cold outbreaks partly to changes from an Arctic that’s warming four times faster than the rest of the globe. The change in temperature and loss of Arctic sea ice make the jet stream — the river of air that moves storm fronts — wavier, allowing plunges of cold air to come south and extreme weather to stay put, Francis said. What's about to hit 'is a really good example of these kinds of cases,' Francis said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/winter-storms-to-hit-much-of-us-with-snow-ice-biting-cold/7923866.html	2025-01-03T16:10:36-08:00

Ukraine Defense Contact Group to hold one last meeting	U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin will attend his final meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany next week, the Defense Department said Friday. The group of more than 50 nations, also known as the Ramstein group, includes members of NATO as well as most of the European Union. It was formed by Austin in April 2022, after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine two months earlier, and is designed to coordinate military support for Ukraine’s defense. The meeting, originally scheduled for October, was postponed when U.S. President Joe Biden — who had been scheduled to chair a leaders-level meeting for the group — canceled his trip to deal with the aftermath of Hurricane Milton, according to Politico. The last full meeting of the group was held in September. The meeting will come just over a week before President-elect Donald Trump is sworn into office. The futures of the Ramstein group and any U.S. support to Ukraine are in question, as Trump has been critical of the level of U.S. aid to the country. He also has expressed an interest in ending the fighting swiftly. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that Trump could be important in the outcome of the yearslong war between Ukraine and Russia. 'Trump can be decisive. For us, this is the most important thing,' Zelenskyy said in an interview with Ukrainian television. 'His qualities are indeed there,' Zelenskyy said about Trump. 'He can be decisive in this war. He is capable of stopping [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, or, to put it more fairly, help us stop Putin.' Trump has previously said he would be able to stop the war in Ukraine in one day, but he has never detailed how he would accomplish that. Meanwhile, Agence France-Presse reported, citing local officials, that a Russian drone attack in the suburbs of the capital, Kyiv, early Friday killed one person and wounded four. AFP said Russian forces have escalated their aerial strikes across Ukraine through the first weeks of winter, including a New Year's Day drone attack targeting central Kyiv that killed two. In a statement posted to Facebook and other social media accounts, acting Kyiv regional Governor Mykola Kalashnyk reported a truck driver had been killed when he was hit by debris from a Russian drone that had been shot down. Also Friday, Ukraine’s General Staff of the Armed Forces reported that Russian troops were continuing to push forward in Donetsk Oblast, advancing near the key town of Pokrovsk. Ukraine's General Staff recorded 138 clashes on the battlefield from Thursday to Friday. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-defense-contact-group-to-hold-one-last-meeting/7923847.html	2025-01-03T15:18:25-08:00

Seasonal illnesses in full force in most US states, CDC says	The holidays came with a side of flu for many Americans, with 40 states reporting high or very high levels of illness last week, according to the latest government health data. 'A lot of flu out there,' said Carrie Reed of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Of course, there are a number of bugs that cause fever, cough, sore throat and other flulike symptoms. One is COVID-19. Another is RSV, or respiratory syncytial virus, which is a common cause of coldlike symptoms but can be dangerous for infants and the elderly. Reed said that the most recent CDC hospitalization data and other indicators show that the flu virus is trending higher than the other germs. Several seasonal flu strains are driving cases, with no dominant one, she added. Pediatric hospitals have been busy since November with RSV, but 'influenza has now joined the party,' said Dr. Jason Newland, an infectious-diseases specialist at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. 'Now we're really starting to roll,' he added. 'Our hospitals are busy.' Where flu illnesses are the highest One indicator of flu activity is the percentage of doctor's office visits driven by flulike symptoms. That level last week was about equal to the peak of last winter's respiratory virus season — which occurred at the same time of year. Reed noted that most people avoid medical appointments over the holidays if they can help it, so the data in late December might be skewed by people who came down with sudden illnesses. Last week's flu activity was particularly intense in the South, Southwest and West. The states reporting lesser amounts of suffering were mostly in the northern Great Plains and in New England. So far this season, the CDC estimates, there have been at least 5.3 million flu illnesses, 63,000 hospitalizations and 2,700 deaths, including at least 11 children. It's not clear if this winter respiratory virus season will be any worse than others. So far it seems relatively typical, at least for kids, Newland said. How to protect yourself U.S. health officials recommend that everyone 6 months and older get an annual flu vaccination, and they say it's not too late to get a shot. You should also avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth because germs can spread that way, health officials say. You should also wash your hands with soap and water, clean frequently touched surfaces and avoid close contact with people who are sick. The CDC also has been keeping its eye on a rise of illnesses from norovirus, a nasty stomach bug, with 91 outbreaks reported early in December. Investigators also have been closely watching another kind of influenza virus, the Type A H5N1 version of bird flu. The CDC says 66 human U.S. cases of that were reported last year, but none of them in the last week. The cases are 'fairly sporadic,' and the overall risk to the public remains low, Reed said. Almost all have been traced to direct contact with infected animals, with no proof of spread between people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/seasonal-illnesses-in-full-force-in-most-us-states-cdc-says/7923841.html	2025-01-03T15:05:30-08:00

Myanmar's new cybercrime law will suppress information, say analysts	WASHINGTON — Myanmar's military leaders have enacted a new cybersecurity law that analysts say will provide the junta with extensive control over access to information. The expansive law — which has 16 chapters and 88 articles — includes regulations on Virtual Private Networks, or VPNs, which allow internet users to circumvent website blocks. It penalizes users who access or share media articles and information from banned websites. The military council has said that the law is needed to protect against cyberattacks and cybercrimes that could threaten the country's stability. Among the regulations is a ban on the creation of illegal online gambling sites, which have been linked to organized crime. But an expert with the digital rights group Myanmar Internet Project, who asked to be identified only as U Han, said the law is more focused on suppressing rights than protecting the public. 'All the provisions of the law are designed to suppress rather than protect the public,' Han told VOA Burmese. 'We believe that junta will use this bill as a weapon prepared for this purpose.' The law will harm 'cyber freedom, digital freedom, and the right to use the internet, which are among the most fundamental of our human rights,' said Han. By suppressing these rights, Myanmar 'will be violating other basic human rights, socio-economic rights, such as education, business rights and religious rights,' he said. The law includes penalties for noncompliance, including warnings, fines and suspensions. It has the power to blacklist digital platform service providers who fail to prevent, remove or cease circulation of content deemed by the junta as 'disinformation' or 'rumors' that could damage unity or stability. Digital platform service providers are now required to collect the names and data of their users for up to three years, and to disclose those details to the authorities. The law additionally includes penalties for anyone found to have read, stored or shared articles from media outlets or groups banned or labeled as terrorists by the military council; gives the authorities power to shutter online services for reasons of security of the 'public good'; and allows for action to be taken against Myanmar citizens outside of the country's borders. One of the biggest criticisms from digital rights experts is the regulations around VPN use. Since the junta seized power in a military coup in February 2021, it has sought to control the flow of information. Dozens of journalists have been detained, broadcasting licenses revoked and websites blocked. Because of that, many residents use VPNs to access social media and media websites, or even to study. But under the new law, those users could face up to six months in prison and fines for using banned VPN services. A lawyer based in one of Myanmar's largest cities said the new law will make it harder for the public to access information. The lawyer, who asked not to be identified for security reasons, said that after thoroughly reading the full law, he sees no clear and concise provision. 'It seems that it has been written to be used as needed and that it has been written with the primary focus on those who will use [a] cyber platform,' the lawyer said. Myanmar in May of last year expanded blocks on websites, digital platforms and VPNs. According to Freedom House, the action specifically limited users to being able to access only about 1,500 preapproved websites. 'Internet freedom in Myanmar consequently declined, leaving it tied with China as the worst-surveyed country,' Freedom House said in November. Citing leaked documents, the activist group Justice for Myanmar reported in June that the enhanced censorship system uses technology from a Chinese network security company to block VPNs. The technology allows authorities to create a list of all known VPN domains and IP addresses they want blocked. 'Instead of just attacking the media, which they've done until now, [the junta are] actually attacking the ways that the general public can communicate and can access information,' Oliver Spencer, an expert on free expression in Myanmar, told VOA last year.

Judge sets Trump's sentencing in hush money case for Jan. 10	NEW YORK — In an extraordinary turn, a judge Friday set President-elect Donald Trump's sentencing in his hush money case for Jan. 10 — just 10 days before he's due to return to the White House — but indicated he wouldn't be jailed. The development nevertheless leaves Trump on course to be the first president to take office convicted of felony crimes. Judge Juan M. Merchan, who presided over Trump’s trial, signaled in a written decision that he'd sentence the former and future president to what's known as a conditional discharge, in which a case is closed without jail time, a fine or probation. Merchan rejected Trump’s push to dismiss the verdict and throw out the case on presidential immunity grounds and because of his impending return to the White House. The judge said he found 'no legal impediment to sentencing' Trump and that it was 'incumbent' on him to sentence Trump prior to his swearing in on Jan. 20. 'Only by bringing finality to this matter' will the interests of justice be served, Merchan wrote. Trump was convicted in May of 34 counts of falsifying business records. They involved an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump’s first campaign in 2016. The payout was made to keep her from publicizing claims she’d had sex with the married Trump years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong. After Trump’s Nov. 5 election, Merchan halted proceedings and indefinitely postponed the sentencing so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case. Trump’s lawyers urged Merchan to toss it. They said it would otherwise pose unconstitutional 'disruptions' to the incoming president’s ability to run the country. Prosecutors acknowledged there should be some accommodation for his upcoming presidency, but they insisted the conviction should stand. They suggested various options, such as freezing the case during his term or guaranteeing him a no-jail sentence. They also proposed closing the case while formally noting both his conviction and his undecided appeal — a novel idea drawn from what some state courts do when criminal defendants die while appealing their cases. Merchan ruled that Trump’s current status as president-elect does not afford him the same kind of immunity granted to a sitting president and does not require that the verdict be set aside, and the case dismissed — a notion the judge described as 'drastic' and 'rare.' Doing that 'would undermine the Rule of Law in immeasurable ways,' Merchan wrote. He opined that it wouldn't address the Supreme Court's concerns about presidential immunity, either. Trump takes office Jan. 20 as the first former president to be convicted of a crime and the first convicted criminal to be elected to the office. His conviction left the 78-year-old facing the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his personal attorney for the Daniels’ payment. The lawyer, Michael Cohen, fronted the money. He later recouped it through a series of payments that Trump’s company logged as legal expenses. Trump, by then in the White House, signed most of the checks himself. Prosecutors said the designation was meant to cloak the true purpose of the payments and help cover up a broader effort to keep voters from hearing unflattering claims about the Republican during his first campaign. Trump said that Cohen was legitimately paid for legal services, and that Daniels’ story was suppressed to avoid embarrassing Trump’s family, not to influence the electorate. Trump was a private citizen — campaigning for president, but neither elected nor sworn in — when Cohen paid Daniels in October 2016. He was president when Cohen was reimbursed, and Cohen testified that they discussed the repayment arrangement in the Oval Office. Trump, a Republican, has decried the verdict as the 'rigged, disgraceful' result of a 'witch hunt' pursued by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat. Before Trump’s November election, his lawyers sought to reverse his conviction for a different reason: a U.S. Supreme Court decision in July that gave presidents broad immunity from criminal prosecution. That request was still pending when the election raised new issues. While urging Merchan to nix the conviction, Trump also sought to move the case to federal court, where he could also assert immunity. A federal judge repeatedly said no, but Trump appealed. The hush money case was the only one of Trump’s four criminal indictments to go to trial. Since the election, special counsel Jack Smith has ended his two federal cases. One pertained to Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss; the other alleged he hoarded classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. A separate, state-level election interference case in Georgia is largely on hold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-sets-trump-s-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-for-jan-10/7923804.html	2025-01-03T14:18:56-08:00	
US capital in 'heightened threat environment' after New Year's Day attacks	washington — Law enforcement and security agencies in and around Washington are bringing in reinforcements as they prepare to secure three high-profile events in the nation's capital, following the New Year's Day terror attack in New Orleans and the Cybertruck bombing in front of the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas. The first event will occur Monday, when Congress meets to certify results of the presidential election four years to the day since the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot. The second will be the state funeral for the late President Jimmy Carter, starting with a ceremony and procession on Tuesday before wrapping up on Thursday. The last high-profile event will come Jan. 20, when President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. 'That has never happened before. We have three [National Special Security Events] over a 15-day period,' Matt McCool, U.S. Secret Service Washington Field Office special agent in charge, told reporters Friday. 'But what I will tell you is we're flexible. We're adaptable. We've been working on these events for, in some cases, years,' he said. 'So, we're going to be prepared.' Despite concerns stemming from the New Orleans attack and the Las Vegas bombing, security officials are confident so far that the Washington events will proceed safely. 'We are not tracking any credible or specific threats associated with these events,' said David Sundberg, assistant director in charge at the FBI's Washington Field Office. The law enforcement and security agencies, however, are not taking any chances, acknowledging that the city and the region are operating in a heightened threat environment. The Secret Service said Friday that it was bringing in agents from across the country to boost staffing levels, which were already the highest they have been in three years. Washington's Metropolitan Police Department said it has added to its ranks almost 4,000 officers from departments across the country. The capital's National Guard Bureau confirmed it also has approved requests for additional support, including the provision of 500 guardsmen for the Jan. 6 election certification and liaison officers for the state funeral. An additional request for 7,800 National Guard soldiers and airmen to assist with security for the Trump inauguration is pending. Increased security measures, including barriers and fencing, are already up in parts of Washington and around the Capitol, but more are coming. 'A multitude of seen and unseen security measures will operate in tandem to ensure a comprehensive and seamless security plan comes to fruition,' McCool said, adding that the measures will include the use of aerial drones. 'The Secret Service will use drones as part of our comprehensive security plan,' McCool said. 'Do not be alarmed if you see these assets during the upcoming events or training in the days ahead.' The Metropolitan Police Department said its increased security measures would go into effect starting Sunday, with the deployment of specialized officers around the city to respond to any emergencies. The U.S. Capitol Police, whose 2,400 officers and civilian employees are responsible for protecting the Capitol and members of Congress, also said they were more prepared to handle contingencies than they were four years ago, when rioters upset with the outcome of the 2020 presidential election stormed the Capitol, forcing lawmakers to flee and injuring police officers. About 1,560 people have been charged with federal crimes in the riot. So far, about 979 have pleaded guilty, while another 210 have been convicted. 'Our nation's capital is prepared to ensure that the legislative process will proceed without disruption, and our government will have a peaceful transfer of power,' said Capitol Police Chief J. Thomas Manger, noting that the force has implemented more than 100 recommendations made following the 2021 riot. Officials in Washington are also bracing for potential protests, saying several planned demonstrations have already gotten required permits. 'We are committed to upholding the right to peacefully assemble and protest here in our city,' said Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith. 'We welcome visitors to come and experience what this incredible city has to offer, but those who are intentional on unlawful activity should know that there will be consequences,' Smith said. 'However, as I've stated before, when we have special events, and I want to be very clear, that we will not tolerate any violence, rioting, destruction of property, or any behavior that threatens the safety and security of our city.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-capital-in-heightened-threat-environment-after-new-year-s-day-attacks-/7923765.html	2025-01-03T13:40:06-08:00	
Analysts: South Korea's political turmoil works in China's favor	WASHINGTON — South Korea’s political turmoil is deepening since its martial law debacle, and analysts say China may have an opportunity to increase its leverage over the country. The current political chaos in Seoul is 'working to[ward] Beijing’s advantage,' said Evans Revere, who served as the acting assistant secretary of state for East Asia and Pacific Affairs during the George W. Bush administration. 'China, with its authoritarian approach to governing, is beneficiary' and 'no doubt pleased because China sees the ascendancy of the Democratic Party, known for its sympathetic approach to the PRC, as a positive development,' Revere said. China’s official name is the People’s Republic of China, or PRC. South Korea is embroiled in a deep political crisis with impeachments of the country’s leaders last month. This week, a standoff with security forces outside the Seoul residence of President Yoon Suk Yeol prevented investigators from an anti-corruption agency from detaining him. The main opposition Democratic Party, DP, urged the agency to make another attempt to detain Yoon after expressing regret over the withdrawal of the investigators. The DP made two successive impeachments in two weeks last month. After impeaching Yoon on Dec. 14 over his failed attempt to impose martial law, the DP also succeeded in its push to impeach acting President Han Duk-soo the following week. The fate of Yoon, who was suspended from his duties, rests in the Constitutional Court. If the court rules in favor of impeaching Yoon, the country will hold an election, and Lee Jae-myung, the head of the DP, is considered a strong candidate. 'China would welcome a DP government in Seoul since the new administration would be conciliatory toward Beijing and Pyongyang and more antagonistic toward Washington and Seoul,' said Bruce Klingner, a senior fellow of Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation. 'China could seek to drive wedges between South Korea and the U.S. by adopting a friendlier tone toward Seoul,' Klingner added. Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on Tuesday that 'China noted relevant events' but 'will not comment on the ROK’s domestic affairs,' referring to South Korea by its official name, the Republic of Korea, or ROK. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi told his South Korean counterpart, Cho Tae-yul, in a Dec. 24 phone conversation that 'China adheres to the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.' He said joint efforts on both sides have led to improved bilateral relations. However, Klingner, in his report published just prior to South Korea’s general election last April, said China may find it beneficial to stir up resistance within South Korea to Yoon’s policies. Beijing, using its United Front Work Department, 'manipulates foreign public policy debates' by 'intensifying political differences within target countries, and inflating public support for a politician or party,' the report says. Leaning toward China The DP is 'very pro-China' and would 'reorient the country toward China' if it takes the control of the government,' said Gordan Chang, distinguished senior fellow at the Gatestone Institute and the author of Plan Red: China’s Project to Destroy America. 'It’s clear how South Korea’s policies would change' as demonstrated by the DP’s attempt to have acting president Han approve the amendments to the Act on Testimony and Appraisal a few days after the opposition party voted to impeach Yoon on Dec. 14. The amendment, sponsored by the DP, obligates individuals, including industry leaders, to attend hearings if asked and bans them from withholding information even if doing so would reveal trade secrets that might be sensitive to national security. It would 'force South Korean companies to divulge their trade secrets, which certainly would benefit China' and 'certainly undermine South Korean businesses,' said Chang. 'If South Korea loses its competitive edge, which is what the DP is trying to do, then it would be very easy for it to end South Korea’s democracy.' A nonpartisan U.S. Congressional Research Service report released on Dec. 23 underscores that the DP 'tends to advocate starkly different policies' than Yoon. The report also mentions that Lee has questioned Yoon for having 'a greater willingness than prior ROK leaders to publicly criticize China’s actions.' Yoon on Thursday said in a written message to his supporters rallying outside his residence that he will 'fight until the end' against anti-state forces that put the country in 'danger.' He thanked them for defending South Korea’s 'liberal democracy and constitutional order.' The message, reportedly delivered via a third person to his supporters, was signed by Yoon and made available to South Korean media by his lawyers. Andrew Yeo, the SK-Korea Foundation Chair at the Brookings Institution’s Center for Asia Policy Studies, said, 'The DP may recalibrate Seoul’s position between Beijing and Washington slightly and find itself more reluctant to support policies which are seen as red lines for China, such as supporting Taiwan in a Taiwan Strait crisis.' He continued, 'But the DP also recognizes the importance of the U.S.-ROK alliance, so I anticipate robust U.S.-ROK relations even under a DP government.' Lee on Dec. 23 met with U.S. Ambassador to South Korea Philip Goldberg in Seoul and expressed hope for the alliance to develop further on human rights and environmental issues. Goldberg also met with the ruling PPP. Robert Rapson, who served as charge d’affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, said, 'The U.S. will remain the priority relationship for the next Korean administration, regardless of whether it is progressive or conservative.' He continued that a positive result that can emerge from closer South Korea and China relations 'would be a greater cooperation from China in managing North Korea, especially if [President-elect Donald] Trump seeks to engage with [North Korean leader] Kim Jong Un.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-south-korea-s-political-turmoil-works-in-china-s-favor-/7923757.html	2025-01-03T13:21:07-08:00

Johnson reelected House speaker as Republicans face challenges despite control of Congress, White House	washington — U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson retained the speakership in a first-round ballot Friday, as the 119th Congress came into session. Johnson won 218 votes, just enough to keep his job. Both the House and the Senate enter the new session with Republicans in the majority, the party having taken control from Democrats in the Senate. In that chamber, Senator Mitch McConnell has stepped away from party leadership for the first time in 18 years. Senator John Thune already has been selected to replace him as majority leader. Senate Republicans will hold a 53-47 seat majority, well below the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation. In the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 219-215 majority, Johnson’s position was believed to have been in jeopardy after his deal last month with Democrats to keep the government funded and open. It would have taken as few as two Republicans to vote against Johnson to put his speakership in jeopardy. Democrats nominated Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries for the speakership but fell short by a few votes. President-elect Donald Trump posted his support for Johnson on social media Monday, saying the speaker was 'a good, hard-working, religious man.' But Republican Representatives Chip Roy and Thomas Massie had stated their doubts about Johnson's leadership, and Trump ally and adviser Steve Bannon had called on Republicans to remove Johnson from leadership. 'Mr. Johnson caught a lot of fire from his GOP colleagues. And he has an extraordinarily limited margin for his majority, just a handful of people,' Kevin Kosar, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA via Zoom. Two years ago, at the start of another Congress, Republican Kevin McCarthy faced similar challenges to his bid for the speakership. He was finally elected on the 15th round of voting. Had Johnson or another Republican been unable to garner enough votes for the speakership, the chamber could have been without a leader in time for the official certification of Trump’s electoral victory on January 6. At least temporarily, Republicans' margin in the House will be even tighter after Trump takes office on January 20, because he has picked two House Republicans to join his administration. Traditionally, the first 100 days of a new presidency and Congress are a time for pursuing an ambitious legislative agenda. Trump 'is going to hit tariffs very hard. He's going to focus on the border, and executive orders related to immigration and immigrants, particularly from Mexico and Muslim countries. And then he's going to work on any compromises he can to get through the legislative agenda on things affecting the economy, groceries, as he likes to call it,' Casey Burgat, a professor at George Washington University in Washington, told VOA via Zoom.

M23 rebels edge closer to key town in east DR Congo	GOMA, DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF CONGO — Rwanda-backed M23 rebels moved closer Friday to a key town in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, capturing a nearby area, sources told AFP. The March 23 Movement (M23), a militia supported by neighboring Rwanda and its army, has seized vast swathes of the eastern territory of the DRC since 2021, displacing thousands and triggering a humanitarian crisis. Angola-mediated talks between DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame were abruptly canceled in mid-December over disagreements on the terms of a proposed peace deal. Sources told AFP Friday that the M23 had taken control of the Katale area — the last place the rebels must pass before entering Masisi, the administrative capital of the Masisi territory. 'We have been attacked by the rebels ... the enemy controls Katale,' a security source told AFP on the condition of anonymity. 'We confirm the capture of Katale by the M23 rebels, for the moment the population has fled towards Masisi center,' Thierry Muhindo, the head of a locality comprising Katale, told AFP. Telesphore Mitondeke, Masisi civil society president, told AFP that several deaths in clashes in the area had been reported among the population, although no figures are currently available. 'It is necessary to note the serious human damage ... it is revolting,' he said. Masisi is located around 80 kilometers (50 miles) north of the North Kivu provincial capital Goma. In late December, the rebels were continuing their latest offensive, launched just ahead of a planned summit in the Angolan capital that was supposed to return peace to the region. M23 forces were only around 50 kilometers (31 miles) from the town of Lubero and around 100 kilometers from the key commercial hub of Butembo. For 30 years, the DRC's mineral-rich east has suffered from the ravages of fighting between local and foreign armed groups, dating back to the regional wars of the 1990s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/m23-rebels-edge-closer-to-key-town-in-east-dr-congo-/7923697.html	2025-01-03T12:33:32-08:00	
Hundreds rescued as South Korean firefighters tackle blaze in Seongnam	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Hundreds of people were rescued or evacuated after a fire broke out at a large commercial building in the South Korean city of Seongnam on Friday, fire officials said. More than 260 firefighters and 80 vehicles were deployed to the scene of the blaze, which was extinguished about an hour and a half after it was first reported at around 4:30 p.m., according to the Gyeonggi provincial fire department. Earlier, YTN television reported that a number of people were trapped inside, with footage showing black smoke engulfing a large part of the building. The fire department said emergency workers have so far rescued 240 people, while another 70 managed to exit the eight-story building unaided. About 28 people sustained light injuries, including smoke inhalation, but there were no reports of serious injuries. The department said emergency workers were still searching the site to ensure no one was trapped inside. The department said the fire started at a restaurant on the first floor. The cause wasn’t immediately known. Some material for this report is from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hundreds-rescued-as-south-korean-firefighters-tackle-blaze-in-seongnam/7923672.html	2025-01-03T12:12:35-08:00	
Talks on new 3-party Austrian government collapse as one party leaves	VIENNA — Talks on forming a new three-party government in Austria collapsed Friday as the smallest of the prospective coalition partners pulled the plug on the negotiations. The talks had dragged on since Austria's president tasked conservative Chancellor Karl Nehammer in October with putting together a new government. That decision came after all other parties refused to work with the leader of the far-right Freedom Party, which in September won a national election for the first time. Nehammer has been trying to assemble a coalition of his Austrian People's Party with the center-left Social Democrats and the liberal Neos party. Nehammer's party and the Social Democrats have governed Austria together in the past but have the barest possible majority in the parliament elected in September, with a combined 92 of the 183 seats. That was widely considered too small a cushion, and the two parties sought to bring in Neos. But Neos leader Beate Meinl-Reisinger said she informed Nehammer, Social Democratic leader Andreas Babler and President Alexander Van der Bellen early Friday that her party 'won't continue' talks on becoming a partner in a new government. She pointed to the implications of a 'budget hole' left by the last government as a major source of difficulty, adding that the election showed a desire for change, but the talks appeared to be going backward rather than forward in recent days. The next government in Austria faces the challenge of having to save between 18 to 24 billion euros, according to the EU Commission. In addition, Austria’s economy is in decline with rising unemployment and continuing recession. 'There was a repeated ‘no’ to fundamental reforms this week,' Meinl-Reisinger told reporters in Vienna. Austrian People’s Party general secretary Christian Stocker blamed 'backward-looking forces' among the Social Democrats for prompting the collapse of the talks. Nehammer said in a post on social media Friday evening that he 'regretted' the decision by the Neos party to pull out of the coalition talks. He said that his party continues to be ready to 'assume responsibility,' and to implement reforms, especially in the areas of improving economic competitiveness and implementing a clear asylum and migration policy. 'The constructive forces of the political center are called upon to come along on this path with us now,' Nehammer said. It wasn't immediately clear how the situation could be resolved. The two bigger parties could potentially try to form a government alone or turn to the environmentalist Greens as a prospective third partner. Nehammer's often-tense two-party outgoing coalition with the Greens lost its parliamentary majority in the election, though it remains in office as a caretaker administration. The Freedom Party, which has seen its poll ratings rise since the election, called for Nehammer's resignation. The far-right party won the parliamentary election in September with 29.2% of the vote but both Nehammer and Babler excluded working with far-right leader Herbert Kickl. According to the latest opinion polls published in December, the Freedom Party increased its support to between 35% and 37%. Its general secretary, Michael Schnedlitz, accused the chancellor of refusing to accept his election defeat and said it had long warned against a three-way coalition 'on the German model' — a reference to the quarrelsome government in neighboring Germany that collapsed in November. Germany is holding an early election next month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/talks-on-new-3-party-austrian-government-collapse-as-one-party-leaves-/7923647.html	2025-01-03T12:03:17-08:00	
Montenegro to tackle gun control after mass killing left 12 dead	PODGORICA, Montenegro — A top-level meeting in Montenegro on Friday looked for ways to curb illegal weapons after a gunman fatally shot 12 people in a second such tragedy in less than three years in the small Balkan country. An emergency session of Montenegro's National Security Council is expected to call for a new gun law and urgent actions to confiscate what are believed to be abundant illegal weapons in possession of Montenegro's 620,000 citizens. The Adriatic Sea nation has a deeply rooted gun culture. State television broadcaster RTCG reported that Montenegro is sixth in the world when it comes to the number of illegal weapons per capita. The gunman who killed a dozen people in a shooting rampage in the western town of Cetinje on Wednesday did so with an illegal 9 mm gun. Police have said they found 37 casings at the shooting locations, and more than 80 additional pieces of ammunition in the gunman's possession. The 45-year-old man, identified as Aco Martinović, eventually shot himself in the head and died shortly after. He is believed to have snapped after a bar brawl and went home to get his weapon before launching a bloody rampage at several locations late Wednesday afternoon. Martinović's victims included seven men, three women — among them his sister — and two children, born in 2011 and 2016. Four more people were seriously wounded and remain hospitalized. Police Commissioner Lazar Šćepanović has described Wednesday’s shooting as 'one of the biggest tragedies in the history of Montenegro.' The shooting has fueled concerns about the level of violence in Montenegrin society, which is politically divided. It also raised questions about the readiness of state institutions to tackle the problems, including gun ownership. Hundreds of people throughout Montenegro lit candles in silence Thursday evening in memory of the victims, while also calling for answers as to why the shooting happened. Many were angry at the authorities for not doing more to prevent such tragedies and protests are being planned for the coming days. Mira Škorić, a retiree from Podgorica, said that 'I can’t believe that we failed so much as a society. We failed as people too.' In a separate massacre in August 2022, an attacker killed 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby in Cetinje, which is Montenegro’s historic capital located about 30 kilometers (20 miles) northwest of the capital, Podgorica. The shootings 'require a serious examination of the responsibility and preparedness of the security system,' the Human Rights Action and Women’s Rights Center groups said in a statement. 'What has changed in the security system in Cetinje since 2022?' Police have said that Martinović’s actions weren’t planned and were impossible to predict and prevent, though he had been convicted in the past of violent behavior and illegal weapons possession and had received psychiatric treatment. Vesna Pejović, a Cetinje resident who lost her daughter and two grandchildren in the shooting back in 2022, said police had to do more to protect the citizens after the first killing. 'What kind of state and system is this where children are getting killed? Are we at war?' she asked. 'Where were the police?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/montenegro-to-tackle-gun-control-after-mass-killing-left-12-dead-/7923559.html	2025-01-03T11:14:39-08:00	
US law enforcement warned to watch for New Orleans copycat attacks	The U.S. Homeland Security Department and the FBI are warning federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to be vigilant for potential copycat incidents inspired by the New Year’s Eve truck-ramming attack in New Orleans that killed at least 14 people. In a joint intelligence bulletin released Friday and obtained by VOA and other news organizations, federal authorities warned the nation's 18,000 law-enforcement agencies to be on the lookout for 'potential copycat or retaliatory attacks inspired by this attack and other recent, lethal vehicle-ramming incidents across the globe.' The bulletin said such attacks 'are likely to remain attractive for aspiring attackers given vehicles' ease of acquisition and the low skill threshold necessary to conduct an attack.' The federal bulletin noted that since 2014, the Islamic State terror group has been promoting the use of vehicles in terror attacks, followed by attacks with secondary weapons, as a method to cause mass casualty incidents. The joint bulletin advised law enforcement agencies to look for danger signs, such as fraudulent documents or credit cards used to rent vehicles, or signs of 'pre-operational surveillance,' such as automobiles parked in odd locations or suspicious activity near an event location. The FBI released three photos Friday of the now deceased suspect in the attack, 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, taken from surveillance video about an hour before the deadly Bourbon Street attack. They also released a photograph of a blue ice chest that was found near the scene containing an improvised explosive device. The photos were released along with a statement soliciting information from any member of the public who might have passed Jabbar on the street or saw the cooler like the one in the photo. The White House announced Friday that President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will travel to New Orleans on Monday to visit with families and community members affected by the attack, as well as meet with officials on the ground. In a briefing Thursday with reporters, FBI officials said they believe Jabbar, who was killed at the scene in a shootout with police, acted alone in the New Year’s attack and was inspired by the Islamic State terror group. FBI Deputy Assistant Director Christopher Raia, with the agency’s counterterrorism division, said they concluded Jabbar had no accomplices following hundreds of interviews and reviews of the attacker’s calls, social media accounts and electronic devices. Officials reopened Bourbon Street on Thursday afternoon. The attack occurred on Wednesday at 3:15 a.m. On Tuesday evening, just hours before the attack, Jabbar posted five videos to his Facebook account, apparently addressed to his family and recorded while he was driving, in which he aligned himself with the Islamic State terror group. The FBI said an Islamic State flag also was found in the vehicle after the attack. 'This was an act of terrorism. It was premeditated and an evil act,' Raia said. Jabbar had originally planned to hurt his relatives and friends but worried about how that would be interpreted by the media, Raia said. 'He was 100% inspired by ISIS.' The attack occurred at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon streets in the city's lively French Quarter. The historic tourist destination filled with bars and music is also known for its large New Year's Eve celebrations. After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the truck and shot at responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire, killing the driver, according to police. Two officers were wounded but are in stable condition, the police said. 'This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,' New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters at a news conference Wednesday. Investigators found weapons and an explosive device in the vehicle, the FBI said, along with other explosive devices found in the French Quarter. The vehicle appeared to have been rented, the FBI said. President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones. The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!' he said.

US surgeon general urges cancer warnings for alcoholic drinks	WASHINGTON/LONDON — Alcoholic drinks should carry a warning about cancer risks on their label, the U.S. surgeon general said Friday in a move that could signal a shift toward more aggressive tobacco-style regulation for the sector. U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy said alcohol consumption increases the risk of at least seven types of cancer, including breast, colon and liver cancer, but most U.S. consumers remain unaware of this. Murthy also called for the guidelines on alcohol consumption limits to be reassessed so that people can weigh the cancer risk when deciding whether or how much to drink. U.S. dietary guidelines currently recommend two or fewer drinks per day for men and one drink or less per day for women. 'Alcohol consumption is the third leading preventable cause of cancer in the United States, after tobacco and obesity,' Murthy's office said in a statement accompanying the new report, adding the type of alcohol consumed does not matter. His advisory sent shares in alcohol companies including Diageo, Pernod Ricard, Anheuser-Busch and Heineken down, in some cases over 3%. Alcohol producers and industry associations did not immediately share comments. It is unclear when or if the surgeon general's suggestions will be adopted. U.S. President Joe Biden's administration is entering its final two weeks. Murthy could be succeeded by Janette Nesheiwat, a director of a New York chain of urgent care clinics and President-elect Donald Trump's pick for the role. Trump, whose brother died from alcoholism and who does not drink himself, has long warned about the risks of drinking. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services, has been open about his past struggles with heroin and alcohol, and says that he attends Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. The decision to update the label will ultimately be made by Congress. Small print Murthy's advisory harks back to early U.S. surgeon general action on tobacco, starting with a 1964 report that concluded smoking could cause cancer. The report kicked off decades of increasingly strict regulations, starting with U.S. laws on warning labels one year later and still ongoing today. Alcoholic drinks in the U.S. already carry warnings on their packaging, including that drinking alcohol while pregnant can cause birth defects and that it can impair judgment when operating machinery. These appear in small print on the back of the packaging. This label has not changed since its inception in 1988. Murthy's recommendations call for an update to these existing labels, rather than new cigarette-style warnings that are today displayed prominently on the front of every packet. Analysts, however, pointed out that cigarette warning labels did little to curb smoking and ingrained habits are hard to change. 'Warning labels won't be an immediate deathblow to alcohol makers, but it will compound the long-term threats to the industry,' said Blake Droesch, analyst with eMarketer. In the U.S., among the largest markets for many western producers, companies face growing competition from alternatives like cannabis and the threat of lower volumes as some consumers, especially younger ones, drink less than previous generations. Beer makers especially have, however, enjoyed benefits from a shift toward healthier lifestyles, with low- or no-alcohol products enjoying rapid growth. Heineken's 0.0 version, for example, grew double digits in 16 markets last year. The advisory said alcohol is responsible for 100,000 U.S. cancer cases and 20,000 cancer deaths each year, more than the 13,500 alcohol-associated traffic crash deaths. The new report recommends health care providers should encourage alcohol screening and treatment referrals as needed, and efforts to increase general awareness should be expanded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-surgeon-general-urges-cancer-warnings-for-alcoholic-drinks/7923523.html	2025-01-03T10:34:01-08:00	
Iran summons Italian ambassador over arrest of Iranian wanted by US	DUBAI — Iran's foreign ministry summoned the Italian ambassador on Friday over the detention of an Iranian national wanted by the United States for his alleged role in a deadly drone strike against U.S. forces, Iranian state media reported. The summons came a day after a similar move by Italy over Iran's arrest of Italian reporter Cecilia Sala, who was seized in Tehran on December 19 while working under a journalist visa. An Iranian foreign ministry official 'urged Italy to reject America's hostage policy — which is contrary to international law, particularly human rights — and provide for Mr. [Mohammad] Abedini's release as soon as possible and prevent damage to bilateral ties,' state media reported. On Thursday, the Iranian embassy in Rome said Sala was being given all the humanitarian care necessary, and for the first time, linked her case to that of Abedini. Iran's said on Monday that Sala had been arrested for 'violating the laws of the Islamic Republic.' It gave no further information. Sala was detained three days after Abedini, an Iranian businessman, was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a 2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has denied involvement in the attack. Abedini is currently being held in prison and a court is due to decide this month whether to grant him house arrest while judges consider the U.S. extradition request. In recent years, Iran's security forces have arrested dozens of foreigners and dual nationals, mostly on charges related to espionage and security. Rights groups have accused Iran of trying to extract concessions from other countries through such arrests. Iran denies this.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-summons-italian-ambassador-over-arrest-of-iranian-wanted-by-us-/7923486.html	2025-01-03T10:31:43-08:00	
Cameroon officials say country's military seized weapons from terrorists re-arming Boko Haram	Yaounde — Cameroon’s military says it has seized several hundred weapons and combat uniforms that were being smuggled to a hideout of the Nigeria-based terrorist group Boko Haram. Officials say troops have been deployed in a bid to capture more weapons and prevent Boko Haram from re-arming itself. Moki Edwin Cameroon government officials say long-barreled firearms, military uniforms, over 400 packets of tear gas and more than 100 gallons of oxidizing agents were seized from suspected Boko Haram members this week in Maroua, a northern town near the central African country’s border with Nigeria and Chad. The military says the oxidizing agents are used by Boko Haram terrorists to produce explosives. The governor of Cameroon’s Far North region, Midjiyawa Bakari, says the weapons were being smuggled to Nigeria’s Sambisa forest, a Boko Haram stronghold. Bakari says he is very thankful to the Cameroon military for intercepting war weapons, combat uniforms and acids used to fabricate explosives destined for several Boko Haram groups in Sambisa, a forest which straddles the Nigeria-Cameroon border and is a hideout for members of the terror group. He says Boko Haram is rearming and recruiting members after it was weakened by troops of the Multinational National Joint Task Force of the Lake Chad Basin or MNJTF. MNJTF is made up of 11,000 troops from Nigeria, Niger, Cameroon and Chad. Bakari told Cameroon state TV on Thursday that some of the weapons were smuggled through the Douala seaport. He did not say how the weapons got to Douala but said investigations have been opened to trace the origin of the weapons. Cameroon’s military says some of the combat uniforms seized are similar to those used by its infantry and air force. Boko Haram fighters sometimes disguise themselves as government troops to deceive civilians before attacking communities for supplies, officials say. The government says civilians should help prevent Boko Haram from re-arming and recruiting new members by reporting strangers in all border towns and villages to government troops. Chad’s president, Mahamat Idriss Deby, in his New Year’s message on Tuesday, said several hundred fighters escaped Chad to neighboring countries when his troops launched Operation Haskanite. The operation’s goal is to neutralize Boko Haram fighters who attacked and killed more than 40 Chadian government troops in the Lake Chad Basin in October. Maki Jean Emmanuel is a researcher on conflicts in the Lake Chad Basin and visiting lecturer at the University of N’djamena. He says no country in the Lake Chad basin can single-handedly defeat Boko Haram. Maki says MNJTF should be on alert because Boko Haram is infiltrating many villages where government troops do not have easy access and recruiting new members, especially poor and unemployed youths, is taking place. He says the porous nature of the borders between Cameroon, Nigeria and Chad makes it possible for arms to be smuggled to villages where Boko Haram fighters are hiding. Cameroon says several dozen people caught smuggling the weapons were arrested but has given no details on whether they are Cameroonians, Nigerians or Chadians. Over 40,000 people have been killed and 3 million have fled their homes in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad since 2009, when fighting between Nigerian government troops and Boko Haram militants degenerated into an armed conflict and gradually spread to neighboring countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-officials-say-country-s-military-seized-weapons-from-terrorists-re-arming-boko-haram-/7923381.html	2025-01-03T09:14:45-08:00	
US issues cybersecurity sanctions against China's Integrity Technology	WASHINGTON — The United States on Friday issued fresh cybersecurity sanctions against Integrity Technology Group, a Chinese company involved in computer programming, a posting on the Treasury Department website showed. The Beijing-based company has previously been accused by Western officials of being behind a major Chinese hacking group nicknamed 'Flax Typhoon.' Speaking at a cybersecurity conference last year, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that Integrity Technology posed as an IT firm but also 'collected intelligence and performed reconnaissance for Chinese government security agencies.' At the time, Chinese officials accused the U.S. and its allies of having 'jumped to an unwarranted conclusion and made groundless accusations against China.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-issues-cybersecurity-sanctions-against-china-s-integrity-technology/7923351.html	2025-01-03T08:38:16-08:00	
South Sudan begins mass inoculation campaign with cholera vaccines	Juba, South Sudan — More than 1.1 million doses of an oral cholera vaccine have arrived in South Sudan, as the government launched a program to inoculate more than 80 percent of the population. But the mass vaccination exercise faces numerous challenges, including a lack of access to the areas dealing with the worst cholera outbreaks. Medics in South Sudan will attempt to vaccinate at least 9 million people against cholera, an exercise that targets mostly children and mothers. More than 1.1 million doses of oral cholera vaccine arrived in the capital, Juba, and will be dispatched next week to hot spots areas like the town of Bentiu. The country’s Ministry of Health reported last week that 199 people have died of cholera, with 13,000 more diagnosed so far with the bacteria. Dr. Gabriel Boum Tap is an immunization officer at UNICEF in South Sudan. 'Of course, we had also received some vaccines before; only that they were not enough, because, you know, it’s not like the cholera vaccine is manufactured and is put in one place already,' he said. At least one cholera case has been recorded in 29 of the 79 counties in South Sudan, with Bentiu, Renk and Juba most affected. The first case was reported on September 23 in Renk, northeast of the capital. But as the country prepares to roll out a mass vaccination exercise, the process faces some serious headwinds. Thinjin Khoat is one of the victims of the cholera outbreak. He says he has seen people die of the disease, with many more trooping to local health centers seeking urgent medical attention. 'I was at one of the health facilities, and there was a suspected case of cholera. The patient was a 5-year-old. The patient was vomiting, and in the process, the health workers couldn’t get the vein. The patient is not able to get the oral fluid. ... In that process, the patient died of dehydration,' he said. Cholera is an acute diarrhea infection caused by consuming contaminated food or water. If not treated, it can be fatal within hours. Khoat says accessibility to health care remains a major hindrance to the fight against the disease. 'Some of the community members, they don’t have access, because, you know, in Bentiu here, there is flooding. There are some areas that health workers cannot access because of the flood and also security issues,' he said. According to Doctors Without Borders, or MSF, poor living conditions in South Sudan have created the perfect breeding ground for cholera. Stephanie Ngai is MSF’s project coordinator for cholera response in Bentiu, located in Rubkona County, an area with a large refugee population. 'Here in Rubkona, the explosion on the outbreak very quickly overwhelmed the local systems that are responsible for coordinating the response and scaling up the interventions,' she said. 'Other partners don’t have adequate funding to properly scale up the level needed, which is massive. And the overall response coordination has not been strong enough to manage the response and ensure that the needs are adequately met.' The government says the vaccination exercise is expected to roll out next Monday with support from international partners such as MSF and the World Health Organization. Buok Danhier, the immunization program manager for the Unity State Ministry of Health, says the various entities will split up duties in Rubkona. 'Rubkona has many payams [local districts]. Most of the payams are affected by flooding, and these are the ones that will be taken by WHO — the hard-to-reach areas. WHO and other partners are pledging to cover all those areas that are hard to reach and also very far from town. Bentiu IDP, Rukona and Bentiu town — these areas will be covered by MSF, and the recruitment process is ongoing,' said Danhier. The vaccination exercise will target children 1 year and above. WHO says up to 143,000 people worldwide die from cholera each year out of an estimated 4 million annual cases.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-begins-mass-inoculation-campaign-with-cholera-vaccines-/7923116.html	2025-01-03T08:37:11-08:00

Israeli strikes kill at least 30 people in Central Gaza	Hospital workers say Israeli airstrikes killed at least 30 people in central Gaza late Thursday into Friday, adding to a death toll that reached at least 56 people over the past 24 hours. Staff at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital in Deir al-Balah told the Associated Press that more than a dozen women and children were killed in attacks that hit targets in Central Gaza, including Nuseirat, Zawaida, Maghazi and Deir al Balah. Israeli attacks hit many of the same areas Thursday, bringing the death toll over the past 24 hours to at least 56, according to Palestinian health authorities. On the social media platform X, the Israel Defense Forces, IDF, said Friday that fighter jets and aircraft attacked about 40 Hamas 'terrorist concentration points and command and control complexes' throughout the Gaza Strip in the past 24 hours in a joint operation of the Israeli Air Force and the IDF Southern Command. The IDF said dozens of Hamas terrorists operated from the compounds, some of which were established in spaces that previously were used as schools. 'This is another example of Hamas's cynical and systematic use of civilians and civilian infrastructure in the Gaza Strip for terrorist purposes,' the IDF said. The Israeli military said it took many steps prior to the attacks to prevent harming civilians, 'including the use of precision weapons, aerial observations, and additional intelligence information.' The IDF also reported early Friday it intercepted a drone and shot down a missile, each launched from Yemen. From its X account, the IDF said the drone was intercepted before it crossed into Israeli territory, and that no alerts were activated. The statement said the missile was intercepted and shot down over south-central Israel, with fragments falling the area of Modi'in. No damage was reported, and the incident is under investigation, the statement said. On Wednesday, Israel warned it would intensify its strikes against Hamas if the militant group continued to hold the hostages it took in its October 7, 2023, terror attack and launches rockets at Israel. The latest attacks on Gaza come as an Israeli delegation reportedly is in Doha, to continue negotiations toward a ceasefire deal with Hamas. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Thursday he authorized the delegation from the country's intelligence services and military. The war in Gaza began with Hamas militants’ October 7, 2023, terror attack, killing about 1,200 people and taking about 250 people as hostages. About 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,500 Palestinians and injured more than 108,000, according to the health ministry in the enclave. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The war has leveled wide areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of its 2.3 million people. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-kill-at-least-30-people-in-central-gaza-/7923266.html	2025-01-03T07:21:44-08:00	
Ethiopia defense minister visits Somalia, in sign of detente	Nairobi — Ethiopia's defense minister traveled to Somalia on Thursday, a senior official in Mogadishu said, the first bilateral visit since relations nosedived a year ago over an Ethiopian plan to build a naval base in a breakaway Somali region. Somalia's state minister for foreign affairs, Ali Omar, confirmed Aisha Mohammed Mussa's visit in a message to Reuters but did not say what she was there to discuss. In a post Friday on social media platform X, Ethiopia's foreign affairs ministry said the two countries had 'agreed to collaborate on the #AUSSOM [African Union peacekeeping] mission and strengthen bilateral relations.' Ethiopia has up to 10,000 troops in Somalia to fight Islamist militants from al-Shabab, but Mogadishu has threatened to expel them if Addis Ababa did not renounce an agreement it reached a year ago with the breakaway Somaliland region. The preliminary deal called for Somaliland to lease a stretch of coastline for an Ethiopian naval base and commercial port in exchange for possible recognition of Somaliland's independence. Somaliland has had effective autonomy since 1991, but its independence has not been recognized by any other country. Mogadishu considers it an integral part of its territory and called its deal with Ethiopia an act of aggression. After months of escalating rhetoric and inconclusive international mediation efforts, Somalia and Ethiopia agreed on December 11, after talks in Turkey, to work together to resolve the dispute and begin technical negotiations by the end of February. The Ethiopian troops in Somalia are there as part of an African Union peacekeeping mission and on a bilateral basis. Regional powers fear their withdrawal would severely weaken the fight against al-Shabab, an al-Qaida affiliate that has been waging an insurgency since 2007. The dispute also has raised concerns about wider instability in the Horn of Africa, with Somalia responding to the Somaliland deal by drawing closer to Ethiopia's traditional rivals Egypt and Eritrea.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-defense-minister-visits-somalia-in-sign-of-detente-/7923213.html	2025-01-03T06:46:15-08:00	
Ghana's parliament passes provisional budget, averts government shutdown	Accra — Ghana's parliament has passed a provisional budget that allows the government to spend 68.1 billion Ghanaian cedis ($4.65 billion) through March, the chamber's speaker said, narrowly averting an unprecedented government shutdown. Parliamentary Speaker Alban Bagbin said the parliament had approved the provisional budget in a sitting that stretched deep into Thursday night. John Dramani Mahama is set to take office as the West African country's president next week after winning a December 7 election, staging a political comeback after serving as Ghana's president from 2012 to 2016. Outgoing President Nana Akufo-Addo was due to present his last state of the nation address later on Friday after eight years leading the gold- and oil-exporting nation. A provisional budget is typically passed in November during election years to cover the gap until the president-elect takes office. But the presentation of the provisional budget had dragged this time after an impasse over whether the outgoing New Patriotic Party (NPP) or the incoming National Democratic Congress, NDC, party has a majority of seats in the House. Finance Minister Mohammed Amin Adam told the joint business and finance committees the late passage of the provisional budget would not affect government business. 'It averts a government shutdown and [the] likelihood of worsening Ghana's ongoing debt default saga,' Seth Terkper, a former finance minister, told Reuters. Almost a third of the approved amount is earmarked for payments to energy-sector service providers, according to the provisional budget. Mahama, the president-elect, said last month that Ghana was going to face a critical situation in the energy sector, adding that preliminary estimates showed that arrears exceeded $2.5 billion at a time when the power supply was erratic. Mahama, who contested the election as the main opposition leader, is returning to power amid an economic resurgence from Ghana’s worst crisis in a generation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-s-parliament-passes-provisional-budget-averts-government-shutdown/7923176.html	2025-01-03T06:17:35-08:00	
US blocks Nippon Steel's bid to purchase US Steel	Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden on Friday followed through on his pledge to block Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel, citing concerns the deal could hurt national security. The move, long expected, cuts off a critical lifeline of capital for the beleaguered American icon, which has said it would have to idle key mills without the nearly $3 billion in promised investment from the Japanese firm. It also represents the final chapter in a high-profile national security review, led by the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, CFIUS, which vets investment for national security risks and had until December 23 to approve, extend the timeline or recommend Biden block the deal. The proposed tie-up has faced high-level opposition within the United States since it was announced a year ago, with both Biden and his incoming successor Donald Trump taking aim at it as they sought to woo union voters in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel is headquartered. Trump and Biden both asserted the company should remain American-owned. The merger appeared to be on the fast-track to be blocked after the companies received an August 31 letter from CFIUS, seen by Reuters, arguing the deal could hurt the supply of steel needed for critical transportation, construction and agriculture projects. But Nippon Steel countered that its investments, made by a company from an allied nation, would in fact shore up U.S. Steel's output, and it won a 90-day review extension. That extension gave CFIUS until after the November election to make a decision, fueling hope among supporters that a calmer political climate could help the deal's approval. But hopes were shattered in December when CFIUS set the stage for Biden to block it in a 29-page letter by raising allegedly unresolved national security risks, Reuters exclusively reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-blocks-nippon-steel-s-bid-to-purchase-us-steel-/7923134.html	2025-01-03T05:28:54-08:00	
Russian drone attack kills 1 in Kyiv suburbs	KYIV, UKRAINE — A Russian drone attack towards the Ukrainian capital on Friday killed one person and wounded four in the Kyiv suburbs, local officials said. Moscow's forces have escalated their aerial strikes across Ukraine through the first weeks of winter, including a New Year's Day drone attack targeting central Kyiv that killed two. 'One person killed and four wounded in enemy air attack on Kyiv region,' said Mykola Kalashnyk, the head of the Kyiv region, which surrounds the capital, said on social media on Friday. He said a truck driver had been killed after he was hit by falling debris from a Russian drone that had been shot down. Wreckage also fell on a house, wounding three -- including a 16-year-old boy and his father. The Ukrainian air force said Russia launched 93 drones overnight. It said 60 attack drones and 26 decoy-style drones were downed or 'lost' -- either shot down or disabled by electronic interceptors. Downed drones also fell on two districts of Kyiv, but there were no injuries, the city mayor said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-kills-1-in-kyiv-suburbs/7923007.html	2025-01-03T02:32:56-08:00	
French and German foreign ministers visit Syria	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — The foreign ministers of France and Germany are headed to Damascus on the first official visit to Syria by top diplomats from European Union countries after the fall of former President Bashar Assad, in what the German minister said is a clear signal that a 'new beginning' between Europe and Syria is possible. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot, who began the visit Friday with a meeting with Christian religious leaders in Damascus, said in a statement on the social media platform X that the two countries 'want to promote a peaceful and urgent transition in the service of Syrians and for regional stability.' He and German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock are expected to meet with Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the Islamist former insurgent group that is now the de facto ruling party in Syria. Baerbock said there can be a 'political new beginning between Europe and Syria' only if the new Syrian society gives all people, regardless of ethnic or religious group, 'a place in the political process' as well as rights and protection. She said those rights should not be undermined by an overly long transition to elections or by 'steps toward the Islamification of the justice or education system,' that there should be no acts of revenge against entire groups of the population, and that extremism should have no place. Since Assad’s ouster in a lightning offensive by opposition forces, Damascus has experienced a flurry of visits from Arab and Western countries that had cut off relations with Assad’s government during the country’s nearly 14-year civil war. However, Western countries have so far not lifted sanctions placed on Syria under Assad or removed the designation of HTS as a terrorist group, although the United States lifted a $10 million bounty it had previously placed on al-Sharaa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-and-german-foreign-ministers-visit-syria/7922980.html	2025-01-03T00:43:02-08:00	
Israel army says intercepted missile, drone launched from Yemen	JERUSALEM — Israel's military reported that it shot down a missile and a drone launched from Yemen on Friday, the latest in a series of attacks from the country targeting Israel in recent weeks. 'A missile that was launched from Yemen and crossed into Israeli territory was intercepted,' the military said in a statement posted to its Telegram channel. 'A report was received regarding shrapnel from the interception that fell in the area of Modi'in in central Israel. The details are under review.' Israel's emergency service provider, Magen David Adom, reported that it had treated several people who were injured or experienced panic attacks on their way to shelters after air raid sirens sounded in the center and south of the country. Hours later the military announced that it had also shot down a drone launched from Yemen. The drone was intercepted before it entered Israel, the military added. On Tuesday, Israel also said it had intercepted a missile launched from Yemen. Much of Yemen is controlled by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who have been firing missiles and drones at Israel -- as well as at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden -- in what they say is solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The Houthis have stepped up their attacks since November's ceasefire between Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has also struck Yemen, including targeting Sanaa's international airport at the end of December.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-army-says-intercepted-missile-drone-launched-from-yemen/7922978.html	2025-01-03T00:34:46-08:00	
Republicans face challenges despite control of Congress, White House	WASHINGTON — The 119th U.S. Congress will come into session Friday. After a contentious government funding battle last month, though, Republican Party control of both houses of Congress and presidency faces challenges. The Senate enters the new session as Republicans take the majority from Democrats and Senator Mitch McConnell steps away from party leadership for the first time in 18 years. Republican Senator John Thune has already been selected to lead the Senate as majority leader. Republicans will hold a 53-47 seat majority, well below the 60 votes needed to advance most legislation. In the House, where Republicans hold a narrow 219-215 majority, the focus will be on votes for speaker. Current Speaker Mike Johnson’s position is in jeopardy after his deal last month with Democrats to keep the government funded and open. It would take only as few as two Republicans to vote against Johnson to put his speakership in jeopardy. Democrats are expected to nominate Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries for the speakership but are likely to fall short by a few votes. President-elect Donald Trump posted his support for Johnson on social media Monday, saying the speaker was 'a good, hard-working, religious man.' But Republican representatives Chip Roy and Thomas Massie have already stated their doubts about his leadership and Trump ally and adviser Steve Bannon has called on Republicans to remove Johnson from leadership. 'Mr. Johnson caught a lot of fire from his GOP colleagues. And he has an extraordinarily limited margin for his majority, just a handful of people,' Kevin Kosar, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, told VOA via Zoom. Two years ago, at the start of another Congress, Republican Kevin McCarthy faced similar challenges to his bid for the speakership. He was finally elected on the 15th round of voting. If Johnson, or another Republican, is unable to garner enough votes for the speakership the chamber could be without a leader in time for the official certification of Trump’s electoral victory on Jan. 6. Whoever does lead the House will, at least temporarily, hold an even tighter majority after Trump takes office on Jan. 20, as he has picked two House Republicans to join his administration. Traditionally, the first 100 days of a new presidency and Congress are a time for an ambitious legislative agenda. 'He's going to hit tariffs very hard. He's going to focus on the border, and executive orders related to immigration and immigrants, particularly from Mexico and Muslim countries. And then he's going to work on any compromises he can to get through the legislative agenda on things affecting the economy, groceries, as he likes to call it,' Casey Burgat, a professor at The George Washington University in Washington, told VOA via Zoom.

New Orleans takes first steps forward after terrorist attack	NEW ORLEANS — Less than 48 hours after Wednesday morning's attack on their city's iconic French Quarter neighborhood, New Orleanians are trying to find a way forward. It's something they have had to do countless times in the Crescent City's 307-year history. In the past two decades alone, residents and businesses have come back from a series of disasters including a record-breaking oil spill, the public health catastrophe of being one of the nation's first coronavirus hotspots and, of course, Hurricanes Ida and Katrina. This latest disaster — labeled a terrorist attack by the FBI — hit the city at 3:15 a.m. on New Year's Day when 42-year-old U.S. citizen Shamsud-Din Jabbar plowed a white pickup truck through three blocks of Bourbon Street, killing 14 and seriously injuring many more. As the city mourns, local restaurateur Ralph Brennan believes his fellow residents will react in their unique New Orleans way: with defiance in the face of a challenge and love for their shared home. 'We've been through this before with COVID and Katrina,' he said. One of Brennan's restaurants, Red Fish Grill, was at ground zero of Wednesday’s attack. It was allowed to reopen with the rest of Bourbon Street on Thursday afternoon. 'Every time there is a disaster,' Brennan continued, 'it is our goal to come back as quickly as possible. We want to show the world that New Orleans is safe, and that this tragedy is just a blip in the history of one of the most special cities on the planet.' Processing grief Go to the corner of Canal and Bourbon streets and the first thing you'll notice are reporters, police officers, traffic barriers and caution tape. Look closer, and you'll see a city cautiously determining how to proceed. A jazz trumpeter plays the national anthem nearby. Employees from a neighborhood restaurant hand out free meals to first responders. Visitors pass by on their way to the Sugar Bowl, postponed to Thursday because of the attack. But it's not just downtown. In every corner of New Orleans, residents are wrestling with trauma. Tom Ramsey is a former chef in the city who now supports mass-catering efforts following disasters and along the U.S.-Mexico border. He woke up on Wednesday morning to dozens of missed calls and text messages asking if he was OK. 'I didn't know what they were talking about until I checked the news and saw what happened,' Ramsey said. His first reaction was to contact everyone he knew was in the French Quarter that night. Anything, he said, not to let the news sink in. 'Then, eventually, everyone was accounted for,' Ramsey said. 'I looked at my wife, I put my face in my hands, and I cried — the kind of crying where my chest was heaving, and I was making sounds. I hadn't felt the kind of grief I felt for New Orleans in that moment since I was in New York on 9/11.' Ongoing trauma Mental health experts like Erin Stevens, executive director of Ellie Mental Health Louisiana in New Orleans, said she is worried that residents with so much past trauma may have difficulty dealing with this event. 'When you have already experienced significant trauma, it can cause you to feel new and future stressors more intensely,' she said. I'm especially worried about people who are isolated — who don't have a support system.' However, Stevens says if handled correctly, past trauma can equip you to handle future stressors more effectively, because resilience is something that is built. Some New Orleanians seem to have taken lessons from past challenges. For example, several mental health professionals have decided to help their community by offering free mental health services. And Allison Bullach, a local photographer, is offering free headshots to anyone who gives blood to support the attack's victims. 'I think we just want to find our way to help,' Bullach told VOA, 'and I had read that donating blood for victims was a major need.' 'I'm only one person,' she continued, 'but if I can find a way to encourage three or four or five more people to help, then I should do it.' The show must go on? The past year has been a massive one for New Orleans tourism. In addition to a successful Mardi Gras and Jazz Fest, 2024 visitor numbers were bolstered thanks to a three-day stop by Taylor Swift's Eras Tour. Early 2025 looked to be equally promising. The Sugar Bowl, Super Bowl LIX, and Carnival season culminating in Mardi Gras are all big news for a local economy so heavily reliant on tourism. As a result, the timing of the attack is a worry for Crescent City businesses. 'Of course, it hurts to have to close during one of our busiest times of the year,' said Brennan, owner of Red Fish Grill. 'We understand why it was necessary, but it doesn't mean it doesn't hurt.' 'But where I got really worried,' he added, 'is how this impacts tourism moving forward for Carnival season and the Super Bowl. New Orleans businesses depend on tourism from these big events.' For some businesses, however, every day matters. Coming off a challenging December, that is definitely the case for Tara Francolini, owner of Francolini's, a popular sandwich shop. 'More than anything, I want to give our staff a day to grieve for their city,' she told VOA. 'But the losses we suffered in December were tremendous, and we need ... steady business so we can do basic things like pay our bills and our employees. I'm worried that staying open diminishes the atrocities that the families of the victims are feeling, and it all makes me feel like an awful human being.' Resilience, a loaded word On Wednesday night, less than 24 hours after the attack, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry ate dinner in the French Quarter, steps from Bourbon Street. He posted a photo from outside the restaurant, a message to would-be visitors that this 'resilient city,' as he and so many others call it, was safe and 'open for business.' The word 'resilient' seems to be attached to the city any time there is a disaster. Many residents identify with it, proof that they can bounce back from anything. Increasingly, however, some say the term is allowing leaders off the hook for their failings. One such critic is Andrew Stephens, owner of Sports Drink, a coffee shop in New Orleans' Irish Channel neighborhood. 'They call us resilient after they shirk their responsibilities to the public,' Stephens said, 'It's pandering. I don't want us to be resilient. I want us to be safe.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-takes-first-steps-forward-after-terrorist-attack/7922899.html	2025-01-02T19:23:28-08:00	
Federal courts won't refer US Supreme Court justice Thomas to attorney general over ethics	WASHINGTON — The federal courts will not refer allegations that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas may have violated ethics laws to the Justice Department, the judiciary's policymaking body said Thursday. Thomas has agreed to follow updated requirements on reporting trips and gifts, including clearer guidelines on hospitality from friends, the U.S. Judicial Conference wrote to Democratic senators who had called for an investigation into undisclosed acceptance of luxury trips. Thomas has previously said he wasn't required to disclose the many trips he and his wife took that were paid for by wealthy benefactors like Republican megadonor Harlan Crow because they are close personal friends. The court didn't immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday. The Supreme Court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023 in the face of sustained criticism, though the new code still lacks a means of enforcement. It's unclear whether the law allows the U.S. Judicial Conference to make a criminal referral regarding a Supreme Court justice, U.S. District Judge Robert Conrad wrote. He serves as secretary for the conference, which sets policy for the federal court system and is led by Chief Justice John Roberts. A referral in this case isn't necessary, Conrad said, because two Democratic senators called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to appoint a special counsel over the summer. No such appointment has been publicly made. The group Fix the Court said the financial disclosure law is clear and should apply to justices. 'The Conference's letters further underscore the need for Congress to create a new and transparent mechanism to investigate the justices for ethics violations since the Conference is unwilling to act upon the one method we had presumed existed to do that,' Executive Director Gabe Roth said in a statement. Conrad also sent a similar response to a separate complaint from a conservative legal group, the Center for Renewing America, in regard to Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson's reports on the source of her husband's consulting income. Jackson has since amended her disclosures and agreed to updated reporting requirements, Conrad wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/federal-courts-won-t-refer-us-supreme-court-justice-thomas-to-attorney-general-over-ethics/7922889.html	2025-01-02T18:19:43-08:00	
Standoff in Seoul as South Korea's Yoon resists arrest	SEOUL, South Korea — Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol resisted efforts to detain him Friday, with investigators and police locked in a tense standoff with military forces and members of Yoon's security service, local media reported. In an early morning raid, a team of investigators and detectives, backed by about 3,000 riot police camped nearby, arrived at Yoon's official residence in central Seoul. But nearly four hours after arriving at the compound, there were no signs Yoon had been detained. According to South Korea's Yonhap news agency, a military unit, presumed to be part of the military's Capital Defense Command, was preventing Yoon's arrest. In a statement, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the unit was under the control of the Presidential Security Service. The PSS has obstructed previous court-approved searches at Yoon's residence. Yonhap later reported that the team attempting to detain Yoon had breached the outer barrier controlled by the military forces and was in a standoff with the PSS. The events capped an extraordinary month of political chaos that began on December 3, when Yoon, a conservative ex-prosecutor, declared martial law. The declaration was quickly overturned by lawmakers, who later impeached Yoon, suspending his presidential powers. For Yoon to be removed from office, the impeachment must be confirmed by the country's Constitutional Court, which is currently deliberating the matter. Separately, Yoon is being investigated for insurrection and abuse of power related to the martial law declaration. Yoon ignored three separate summonses to appear for questioning as part of that investigation, leading a Seoul court to issue a detention warrant earlier this week. His legal team says the investigation is illegitimate. In a statement Friday, Yoon's lawyers said the attempt to execute the detention warrant was illegal and vowed legal action to stop it. Once Yoon is detained, authorities will have 48 hours to decide whether to file for a formal arrest warrant or to release him. It would be the first time a sitting South Korean president has been taken into police custody.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-investigators-try-to-detain-impeached-yoon/7922885.html	2025-01-02T18:03:18-08:00

Zelenskyy says Trump could be decisive in stopping war in Ukraine	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Thursday that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump could be 'decisive' in the outcome of the yearslong war between Ukraine and Russia. 'Trump can be decisive. For us, this is the most important thing,' Zelenskyy said in an interview with Ukrainian television. Zelenskyy said Trump had told him he would be one of the first to visit Washington after the presidential inauguration later this month. 'His qualities are indeed there,' Zelenskyy said about Trump. 'He can be decisive in this war. He is capable of stopping [Russian President Vladimir] Putin, or, to put it more fairly, help us stop Putin.' Trump has previously said he would be able to stop the war in Ukraine in one day, but he has never detailed how he would accomplish that. Zelenskyy's comments came as the Ukrainian military said it had carried out a high-precision strike Thursday on a Russian command post in Maryino, in Russia's Kursk region. 'These strikes disrupt the ability of the Russian Federation to conduct terrorism against innocent Ukrainian civilians,' the Ukrainian military said in a statement on Telegram. Russia's military said air defense units had downed four Ukrainian missiles in the region. The regional governor said the strikes had damaged a high-rise apartment building and other buildings in a nearby village. Another post from the Ukrainian military showed a video of what the military said was damage to a Russian base in Ivanivskoye, next to Maryino. A school, pharmacy and apartment building were among the structures damaged in the strike, Kursk regional Governor Alexander Khinshtein said. VOA could not immediately verify the reports. Ukraine launched an incursion into Russia five months ago. Ukrainian forces remain in the Kursk region, but the Russian military says much of the lost territory has been regained. Meanwhile, Russia said it had attacked energy facilities in Ukraine that support Kyiv's military-industrial complex. The Russian Defense Ministry said that over the past 24 hours, it had used its air force, drones, missiles and artillery to target energy facilities, military airfields and Ukrainian military personnel across multiple locations. VOA could not independently verify that report. Russian forces have been advancing quickly on the eastern front of Ukraine. 'They are putting pressure on our boys, who are exhausted, and that is a fact. We will do everything to at least stabilize the front in January,' Zelenskyy said in his Thursday interview. Ukraine's military said Thursday that it had shot down 47 drones Russian forces launched overnight at areas in central and eastern Ukraine. Russia used a total of 72 drones in its attacks, the military said. Ukrainian air defenses shot down drones over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Odessa and Sumy regions. Officials in those areas did not immediately report any major damage. Russia's Defense Ministry said Thursday that its forces had destroyed 13 Ukrainian drones, mostly along the Russia-Ukraine border. Intercepts took place in Bryansk, Belgorod, Kursk, Kaluga and Voronezh, it said. The governors of Bryansk and Kaluga said there were no reports of casualties or damage in their regions. Thursday's attacks came a day after Russian forces killed at least two people in Kyiv. Some information for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-says-trump-could-be-decisive-in-stopping-war-in-ukraine-/7922855.html	2025-01-02T17:29:53-08:00	
Israel continues striking Syrian army positions	Israel bombed Syrian army positions south of the city of Aleppo on Thursday, according to residents, local media and rights groups, marking the latest strikes by Israel against a country whose longtime president was overthrown last month. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights group said the strikes targeted defense and research facilities. Residents reported hearing big explosions in their vicinity. Syrian state television reported the strikes early Friday, local time. It was not immediately clear whether the strikes caused any deaths. Islamist-led rebels overthrew longtime Syrian President Bashar al-Assad last month. Since then, Israel has conducted hundreds of strikes on Syrian military assets. Israel said the strikes were aimed at keeping military weapons away from extremists. Israel’s continued bombardment of Syria comes as the Israeli military said Thursday that its special forces had raided an underground missile production site in Syria in September. Israel said the site was set to manufacture hundreds of precision missiles that Iran-backed Hezbollah would use against Israel. The complex, near the Mediterranean coast, was 'the flagship of Iranian manufacturing efforts in our region,' Israeli Lieutenant Colonel Nadav Shoshani told reporters. 'This facility was designed to manufacture hundreds of strategic missiles per year from start to finish, for Hezbollah to use in their aerial attacks on Israel,' he added. Shoshani said Israel had been observing the plant since construction began in 2017. Israeli forces raided the complex because it was close to being able to produce precision missiles, some with a range of up to 300 kilometers, or 190 miles. 'This ability was becoming active, so we're talking about an immediate threat,' he said. The operation was complex, Shoshani said, and involved dozens of aircraft and about 100 helicopter-borne troops. The troops dismantled the facility after the raid, he added. 'This is one of the most important counteractions we have taken against the Iranian axis's attempts to arm itself in order to harm us, and it demonstrates our determination and audacity to act anywhere to protect ourselves,' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-continues-striking-syrian-army-positions/7922874.html	2025-01-02T17:28:43-08:00	
Carter leaves complex legacy on Korean Peninsula	washington — Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter has a complex legacy on the Korean Peninsula, former U.S. officials say, including the vital role he played in defusing a crisis between the United States and North Korea in 1994. Thomas Hubbard, former U.S. ambassador to South Korea from 2001 to 2004, told VOA Korean by phone Wednesday that Carter’s interventions in North Korea significantly lowered tensions, despite somewhat negative reactions from President Bill Clinton’s administration. 'His initial involvement in the early 1990s when he went to North Korea, met with Kim Il Sung, he opened an opportunity that lowered the chances of war and led to the Agreed Framework,' said Hubbard, referring to Carter’s meeting in June 1994 with late North Korean founder Kim Il Sung. Hubbard was a principal negotiator of the Agreed Framework signed by the U.S. and North Korea in Geneva in October 1994, aimed at ending North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. VOA Korean sought comment from the Permanent Mission of North Korea to the United Nations, but did not receive a response. Carter, who was the 39th U.S. president and served from 1977 to 1981, visited Pyongyang as North Korea’s declaration of withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency created the first major crisis over North Korea’s nuclear weapons program. He crossed the inter-Korean border in the demilitarized zone (DMZ) from the South Korean side with his wife, Rosalynn, and held talks for two days in Pyongyang with the North Korean leader. Carter was the first former U.S. president to visit the isolated country and to meet North Korea’s head of state. Controversial mission At the time, North Korea threatened to expel IAEA inspectors, demonstrating its intent to develop nuclear weapons, and the United States pushed for U.N. sanctions on North Korea. It was speculated that Clinton was planning a preemptive attack on North Korea. After the talks between Carter and Kim, North Korea agreed to freeze its nuclear program in exchange for a resumption of dialogue with the U.S. The breakthrough led to the first nuclear deal between the U.S. and North Korea in 40 years, although the agreement fell through in 2003. Daniel Russel, former assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, said in an email to VOA Korean on Monday, 'It is not hyperbole to say that it felt like the brink of war. We were right at the edge of the cliff.' As a young diplomat, Russel and then-U.S. Ambassador to South Korea James Laney helped prepare Carter for his trip across the DMZ. North Korea warned that sanctions would be treated as 'an act of war' and started the process to withdraw from the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, Russel said. 'The immediate crisis was averted. We had been really close to a war, and Jimmy Carter saved us from that,' he said. Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction during the Obama administration, said Carter’s mission was 'ultimately successful, but the Clinton administration was unhappy because Carter didn’t try to get any constraint on North Korea’s nuclear program as part of a resolution of that immediate conflict.' Hubbard offered a similar view. 'What made it controversial, I think, is that Carter accepted some positions that went beyond the Clinton administration’s positions with North Korea, and then he announced them publicly on CNN before even informing us,' Hubbard said. 'That was quite a shock.' CNN, which closely followed Carter’s visit to Pyongyang, first reported that Carter told the North Koreans the U.S. had stopped pursuing international sanctions against North Korea, which Clinton soon flatly denied. Carter visited North Korea twice more in 2010 and 2011 on private humanitarian missions. While his visit in 2010 secured the release of American teacher Aijalon Mahli Gomes, who had been imprisoned in North Korea for seven months, he failed to meet with Kim Jong Il, who succeeded his father, Kim Il Sung, on either trip. While his post-presidential efforts on the Korean Peninsula are more widely known, Carter’s presidency had another moment of controversy, as his push for the withdrawal of U.S. ground troops from South Korea shook the U.S.-South Korea alliance. Push for human rights When he assumed the presidency, Carter was determined not to overlook the human rights abuses of U.S. allies. He found it problematic that the United States would support a country under a repressive government. To him, South Korea was such a country then. 'One of the big things Carter campaigned on was human rights,' Samore said. 'At the time, South Korea was ruled by a military government, and he wanted to reduce relations with countries that were not democracies.' The former president, who pledged to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea during his presidential campaign, had a war of words with then-South Korean President Park Chung-hee over the issue during his 1979 visit to South Korea, according to diplomatic documents from both countries. According to a declassified document from the White House, Park criticized the planned withdrawal of U.S. Forces Korea, arguing the idea itself had emboldened North Korea. To this, Carter suggested that South Korea should increase defense spending. Joseph DeTrani, former special envoy for the Six-Party Talks with North Korea from 2003 to 2006, told VOA Korean on Monday by phone that one of the factors behind Carter’s decision was the burgeoning U.S. relationship with China, which fought against the U.S. during the 1950-53 Korean War in support of North Korea. 'We were normalizing relations with the People’s Republic of China. There was a sense that war was not going to break out on the Korean Peninsula,' said DeTrani, who also served as director of East Asia operations at the Central Intelligence Agency. 'Those people who follow developments on the Korean Peninsula felt that was not the right decision,' he said. U.S. troop withdrawal from the East Asian ally was ultimately not realized, largely over opposition from the U.S. Congress and the military. 'President Carter was interested in waging peace everywhere, wherever there is conflict. He didn’t believe there was the necessary need for Americans to station so many troops in so many places,' Yawei Liu, senior adviser on China at the Carter Center, told VOA Korean by phone on Monday. Carter died Sunday at his home in Georgia at age 100. The official state funeral for Carter will be held January 9 in Washington. South Korea’s foreign ministry expressed condolences at Carter’s passing. 'He was particularly interested in promoting peace on the Korean Peninsula and actively worked on it,' it said in a statement released Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/carter-leaves-complex-legacy-on-korean-peninsula/7922839.html	2025-01-02T16:54:50-08:00	
China targets US defense companies with new sanctions	In the latest escalation of trade tensions between the world's two largest economies, China on Thursday announced export control measures targeting 28 U.S. companies and added 10 U.S. companies to a list of entities barred from doing business in China. The larger group of companies is made up primarily of firms active in defense contracting and includes Lockheed Martin and five of its subsidiaries; General Dynamics and three of its subsidiaries; three subsidiaries of Raytheon; one subsidiary of Boeing; and more than a dozen other companies. Chinese companies are immediately barred from selling 'dual-use' items — goods that may have a military purpose in addition to civilian applications — to any of the named companies. In an announcement, the Chinese Ministry of Commerce said the sanctions were put in place 'in order to safeguard national security … interests and fulfill international obligations such as non-proliferation.' Negligible impact Experts pointed out that because U.S. defense contractors don't typically do business with the country's major adversaries, the new restrictions would likely have little impact on the companies named by China. 'Short answer is, this won't have much, if any effect, on those companies: They didn't do business with China anyway,' Raymond Kuo, a director and senior political scientist with the RAND Corporation, told VOA. He said that move would also have no noticeable impact on the broader U.S. economy. However, he added, the sanctions do illustrate that China is determined to respond when the U.S. applies sanctions in the other direction, as the Biden administration has done several times in recent months. 'It does show that the Chinese are willing to go kind of tit for tat with the United States,' Kuo said. 'If we increase our levels of trade sanctions — and [President-elect Donald] Trump has threatened 60% tariffs across the board — that they can hit back in a whole variety of ways.' 'Unreliable' entities In a second announcement, the Ministry of Commerce added 10 of the companies from the first announcement, all subsidiaries of Lockheed Martin, General Dynamics and Raytheon, to its list of 'unreliable entities,' a designation that entails a much stricter set of sanctions. The companies are prohibited from importing or exporting goods to and from China and from making new investments there. In addition, executives of the companies are barred from traveling to China, and any work or residency permits they currently have are revoked. The Ministry of Commerce said that all of the companies designated as unreliable have sold arms to Taiwan, the democratically self-governing island that China claims as its own territory. It said the new restrictions were meant to 'safeguard national sovereignty, security and development interests.' The additions to the unreliable entities list come just a week after Beijing, on December 27, announced an earlier round of sanctions targeting U.S. firms and their executives for selling arms to Taiwan. The companies named included subsidiaries of Raytheon and Boeing. In a statement emailed to VOA, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said it was determined that the 28 companies facing export controls 'endanger China's national security.' He also said, 'The Chinese government will continue to unswervingly promote high-level opening up, firmly safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of various business entities, and promote the development of compliant trade.' Follows other sanctions Thursday's announcement follows other recent actions by Beijing cracking down on trade with the U.S., often in response to U.S. sanctions on Chinese businesses. In early December, the Biden administration announced a ban on the sale to Chinese firms of cutting-edge equipment used to make the world's most advanced semiconductors as well as high-bandwidth memory products needed to maximize those chips' efficiency. At the same time, the U.S. added 140 Chinese companies to a list of entities that U.S. firms and individuals are restricted from doing business with. In response, China imposed new restrictions on the sale of 'rare earth' minerals to the United States. China dominates the world market for minerals such as gallium, germanium and antimony, which are key components in various high-tech products from smartphones to missile guidance systems. Little more than a month earlier, the Biden administration had finalized a new set of rules on outbound U.S. investments in China. The rule codified a set of restrictions barring U.S. individuals and firms from investing in certain kinds of business ventures in China. Among the areas affected are the manufacture of advanced semiconductors and microelectronics, technology used in quantum computing, and artificial intelligence systems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-targets-us-defense-companies-with-new-sanctions-/7922841.html	2025-01-02T16:17:13-08:00

Ukraine blocks transit of Russian gas to Europe, prompting price hike	London — European gas prices reached a 15-month high on Thursday after Ukraine blocked the transit of Russian gas across its territory into the European Union. The Russian state-run firm Gazprom is set to lose more than $5 billion a year following the route's closure, which Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called 'one of Moscow's biggest defeats.' Kyiv will lose about $800 million in transit fees from Moscow. Despite the rise in gas prices on Thursday, the impact on Europe will likely be limited, said energy analyst Thomas O'Donnell, a global fellow at the Wilson Center based in Berlin. 'It was all prepared for. It's basically all priced in. Of course, there's winners and losers to a certain point. Certain countries are more dependent on this than others - Slovakia and Hungary, for example, and Austria,' O'Donnell told VOA. 'Austria is pretty well prepared. They have alternative supplies lined up from Germany and Italy and others. And Slovakia will not run out of gas. They will have plenty of gas. It's just that they'll have to pay more, like everybody else has all along,' he added. Moldova was among the countries most reliant on Russian gas supplied via Ukraine. In the breakaway region of Transnistria, which is controlled by Russian forces, residents lost heating and hot water on Wednesday as authorities urged people to dress warmly and use electric heaters. Ukraine war Ukraine's Zelenskyy indicated last month that he would not renew a five-year contract to allow the transit of Russian gas across his country, which expired on December 31, explaining that he would no longer give Moscow 'the opportunity to earn additional billions on our blood.' Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Europe has since managed to wean itself off Moscow's gas supplies far more quickly than Russian President Vladimir Putin anticipated, O'Donnell said. 'He thought this would force all the European countries that get this gas into a situation where they would capitulate — and they would be unwilling to support Ukraine in the war, and unwilling to show their solidarity. He also thought the war would be over in three or four days. But it just didn't work,' O'Donnell said. 'They've lost their entire European market, essentially. The second-largest gas fields in the world in Western Siberia have no outlet now,' he added. 'Putin portrays himself as a great Russian nationalist. Well, this great Russian nationalist just lost one of the biggest businesses Russia ever had.' In 2023, Gazprom recorded a loss of almost $7 billion, its first annual loss since 1999. Slovakia anger Slovakian Prime Minister Robert Fico, who enjoys a close relationship with Putin, has strongly criticized Ukraine's decision. Putin hosted Fico last month in Moscow, where the two leaders reportedly discussed the future of Russia's gas exports. Fico also opposes Western support for Kyiv in its war against Russian invaders. Speaking on Wednesday after Ukraine's termination of the transit deal, the Slovakian leader accused the EU of sacrificing the interests of smaller states. 'We must see that selfish national interests of the big [member states] and meaningless geopolitical goals are beginning to dominate this community ... ignoring the needs of smaller ones,' Fico said in a televised address. 'When the transit of gas through Ukraine is stopped, [it] will have drastic impacts on all of us in the European Union, but not on the Russian Federation.' European dependence In reality, the European Union has drastically cut its dependence on Russian gas since Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Moscow supplied over 40% of the bloc's gas needs in 2021, but that had fallen to about 8% by 2023, according to EU figures. Europe has found new suppliers, said O'Donnell. 'Norway has done all they could to increase their supplies, and that's been extremely helpful. They're now on the scale of what Russia used to be,' he said. 'Number two, the United States zoomed up its supplies to Europe,' he added. 'This was very crucial. In 2023, something like 67% of all [liquefied natural gas] that's exported from the U.S., which is a huge amount, was going to Europe. And that supplied 47% of their LNG. I think in 2024, it looks like it supplied about 37%.' EU-US trade EU officials have indicated that the bloc will seek to strengthen its energy trade with the U.S. under its next president, Donald Trump. 'We are ready to discuss with President-elect Trump how we can further strengthen an already strong relationship, including by discussing our common interests in the energy sector,' EU Commission spokesperson Olof Gill said on December 20. 'And as you all know very well, the EU is committed to phasing out energy imports from Russia and diversifying our sources of supply.' Slovakia's Fico, however, has threatened to cut the transit of European electricity to Ukraine in retaliation for Kyiv's decision to cease transiting Russian gas. Imports of Russian gas through Ukraine made up about 5% of Europe's total supplies in 2024. Some of the gas was sent on to Western Europe through Slovakia — and that largely explains Fico's concerns, said O'Donnell. 'Slovakia was making something like half a billion dollars on transit fees passing the [Russian] gas across their country through their pipeline system onto others — so, redistributing the gas,' he said. 'Security risk' In a post on the social media site X, Zelenskyy said that Fico's relationship with Putin was a big security issue for Europe because 'his key goal is to deal with Russia, and this is what benefits him. Why is this leader so dependent on Moscow? What is being paid to him, and what does he pay with?' Zelenskyy wrote on December 23. Moscow's other supply routes to Europe are limited. The Yamal-Europe pipeline via Belarus was shut down in 2022 following a payment dispute between Russia and Poland and has not reopened. Months later, the Nord Stream pipeline under the Baltic Sea to Germany was blown up. It remains unclear who was responsible. Russia is still able to supply gas to Hungary, Turkey and Serbia through the TurkStream pipeline.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-blocks-transit-of-russian-gas-to-europe-prompting-price-hike-/7922499.html	2025-01-02T13:47:20-08:00	
Ukraine blocks transit of Russian gas to Europe, forcing up prices	Natural gas prices in Europe have risen since Ukraine ended the flow of Russian gas across its territory into the EU.

Amendments to school textbooks by Syria's new authorities draw outcry	WASHINGTON — Amendments to school textbooks by Syria's new authorities have sparked outrage from parents, educators and rights groups. The changes, announced Wednesday, affect first-to-12th-grade schoolbooks in all Syrian schools, with a focus on history, religion and science textbooks. The Education Ministry under the country’s caretaker government announced the decision following the overthrow of former President Bashar al-Assad’s regime in an Islamist-led rebel offensive just weeks ago. The changes include removing all content 'glorifying' the former Syrian regime, its leaders, symbols, and the Baath party, which had ruled Syria since 1963. The ministry’s directive also mandates revisions in subjects such as history, religion and science. For example, any reference to women, love and pre-Islamic gods are to be removed from textbooks. Additionally, the ministry has ordered the removal of an entire unit on human evolution from a science textbook. Fadwa, a mother of two schoolchildren in Damascus who only gave her first name, expressed her disappointment over the revisions. 'You can remove all mentions of Assad and his regime from all books, but you cannot erase history and obscure science — it’s just wrong,' she told VOA via messaging app. 'This is not a political matter, but it concerns the future of our children and country.' Fadwa is deeply concerned about her children’s education, she said, if the amendments are not reversed. The caretaker government, including the Education Ministry, is dominated by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist militant group that led the offensive leading to the ouster of Assad on Dec. 8. HTS, once considered al-Qaida’s Syria branch, formally severed ties with the global terror group in 2016. However, experts note, it continues to uphold a radical Islamist ideology. HTS leaders have pledged to establish an inclusive transitional government that reflects Syria’s religious and ethnic diversity. Observers argue, though, that some of the group’s actions on the ground contradict these claims. 'They say all the good things on television, but the reality is that this group is imposing its ideology on Syrians,' said Youssif Ahmed, a Syrian educator. 'They have no legitimate mandate to make drastic changes on such an important issue as education,' he told VOA. 'These matters require patience and expertise, which I’m not sure these people have. They are in a rush to make these big changes which, if implemented, will have long-term implications for the education process in this country.' Ahmed pointed out as an example the new revisions in which the term 'Ottoman occupation' of Syria has been replaced with 'Ottoman rule.' 'This is not a move to correct a historical error, but it shows their intention to appease their Turkish allies,' he said. Turkey, a key backer of the rebels since the Syrian conflict began in 2011, says it has played a role in supporting the offensive that led to Assad’s overthrow. Turkish officials have said Ankara will help the new rulers in Damascus rebuild Syria’s political and economic structures. While some adjustments such as removing content praising Assad are seen as positive, other revisions raise serious concerns, said Rami Jarrah, a prominent Syrian journalist. 'These amendments require an inclusive framework that ensures representation from all segments of Syrian society in the decision-making process,' he wrote on social media platform X. 'Without this inclusivity, these unilateral changes risk deepening societal divisions and undermining the principles of shared governance and national unity.' In response to growing criticism, Nazir al-Qadri, the caretaker government’s minister of education, said the curricula in all Syrian schools should remain as is until specialized committees are formed to review them. 'We have only directed the deletion of what glorifies the former Assad regime, and we have adopted images of the Syrian Revolution flag instead of the flag of the former regime in all schoolbooks,' Qadri said in a statement on Thursday. 'What has been announced is a modification of some of the incorrect information that the former Assad regime adopted in the Islamic education curriculum, such as explaining some Quranic verses in a wrong way,' he said. 'We have adopted their correct explanation as stated in the interpretation books for all educational levels.' One such revision includes adding the terms 'Jews' and 'Christians' to the explanation of a verse in the Quran, the holy Muslim book, about those who angered God. The Assyrian Monitor for Human Rights, a Christian advocacy group based in Sweden, says such amendments pose a danger to religious coexistence in Syria. 'This action is considered an explicit incitement to religious hatred and the spread of discrimination and exclusion speech,' the group said in a statement on Thursday. 'This interpretation contradicts the principles of religious tolerance and coexistence that have always distinguished the Syrian society.' Joshua Landis, director of the Center for Middle East Studies at the University of Oklahoma, wrote on X that 'the new Syria school textbooks are moving from a nationalist to Islamist interpretation of Syrian history.' This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amendments-to-school-textbooks-by-syria-s-new-authorities-draw-outcry/7922467.html	2025-01-02T12:57:13-08:00	
US appeals court blocks Biden administration effort to restore net neutrality rules	Washington — A U.S. appeals court ruled on Tuesday the Federal Communications Commission did not have legal authority to reinstate landmark net neutrality rules. The decision is a blow to the outgoing Biden administration that had made restoring the open internet rules a priority. President Joe Biden signed a 2021 executive order encouraging the FCC to reinstate the rules. A three-judge panel of the Cincinnati-based 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the FCC lacked authority to reinstate the rules initially implemented in 2015 by the agency under Democratic former President Barack Obama, but then repealed by the commission in 2017 under Republican former President Donald Trump. Net-neutrality rules require internet service providers to treat internet data and users equally rather than restricting access, slowing speeds or blocking content for certain users. The rules also forbid special arrangements in which ISPs give improved network speeds or access to favored users. The court cited the Supreme Court's June decision in a case known as Loper Bright to overturn a 1984 precedent that had given deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they administer, in the latest decision to curb the authority of federal agencies. 'Applying Loper Bright means we can end the FCC’s vacillations,' the court ruled. The decision leaves in place state neutrality rules adopted by California and others but may end more than 20 years of efforts to give federal regulators sweeping oversight over the internet. FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel called on Congress to act after the decision. 'Consumers across the country have told us again and again that they want an internet that is fast, open, and fair. With this decision it is clear that Congress now needs to heed their call, take up the charge for net neutrality, and put open internet principles in federal law,' Rosenworcel said in a statement. The FCC voted in April along party lines to reassume regulatory oversight of broadband internet and reinstate open internet rules. Industry groups filed suit and successfully convinced the court to temporarily block the rules as they considered the case. Incoming FCC Chair Brendan Carr voted against the reinstatement last year. He did not immediately comment on Thursday. Former FCC Chair Ajit Pai said the court ruling should mean the end of efforts to reinstate the rules, and a focus shift to 'what actually matters to American consumers - like improving Internet access and promoting online innovation.' The Trump administration is unlikely to appeal the decision but net-neutrality advocates could seek review by the Supreme Court. The rules would have given the FCC new tools to crack down on Chinese telecom companies and the ability to monitor internet service outages. A group representing companies including Amazon.com AMZN.O, Apple AAPL.O, Alphabet GOOGL.O and Meta Platforms META.O had backed the FCC net-neutrality rules, while USTelecom, an industry group whose members include AT&T T.N and Verizon VZ.N, last year called reinstating net neutrality 'entirely counterproductive, unnecessary, and an anti-consumer regulatory distraction.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-appeals-court-blocks-biden-administration-effort-to-restore-net-neutrality-rules/7922331.html	2025-01-02T11:21:55-08:00	
Russia ramps up disinformation efforts as its grip weakens over post-Assad Syria	The Kremlin is using uncertainty following the ouster of Syrian ruler Bashar al-Assad, and the potential loss of Russia’s military toehold in Syria, to accuse the United States of sowing instability in the country. On Dec. 29, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov signaled that the end of the Assad regime would push Russia to 'make certain adjustments to Russia’s military presence in Syria.' Lavrov said the continued deployment of Russian forces and the future of its bases 'could be the subject of negotiations with the new Syrian leadership.' Particularly of concern to Moscow are the fates of its Tartus naval base and the Hmeimim air base located on Syria's Mediterranean coast. The naval base established by the Soviet Union during the cold war, and the air base in 2015 as a strategic command post, both served as Russia’s military hubs in the Middle East. Amid this backdrop, Russian intelligence is pushing conspiracy theories that the U.S. and allies are planning attacks on those facilities and otherwise seeking to destabilize the country. On Dec. 28, Russia’s Foreign Intelligence Service, or SVR, accused U.S. and British intelligence agencies of 'working out plans to stage a series of terrorist attacks on the Russian military facilities in Syria.' Those plans, the SVR claimed, without evidence, would involve the use of Islamic State, or IS, militants. Russia has long propagated the false narrative that the U.S. sought the ouster of Assad to destabilize the Middle East and control its oil resources. Despite Russia’s claim, the U.S. has worked for years to eradicate the IS threat, including with Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, in Syria’s northeast. The U.S. and SDF defeated IS in its final holdout, Baghuz, near Syria’s Iraqi border, in March 2019. That year, U.S. forces killed IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi during a raid in northwestern Syria. The Kurds oversee prisons housing thousands of IS fighters and their families. Russian forces, by contrast, regularly targeted armed groups who were fighting IS, and did not prioritize fighting IS terrorists during Moscow’s intervention in Syria. On Dec. 19, the U.S. Defense Department announced an additional 1,100 U.S. personnel had been deployed to Syria, bringing the total to 2,000 U.S. troops, to help stabilize the situation in the post-Assad era. At the same time, the United States Central Command, CENTCOM, has announced multiple airstrikes against IS targets to prevent the terrorist group from reestablishing foothold in the country. One U.S. airstrike on Dec. 19 killed IS leader Abu Yusif and other IS operatives 'in an area formerly controlled by the Syrian regime and Russians.' 'As stated before, the United States — working with allies and partners in the region — will not allow ISIS to take advantage of the current situation in Syria and reconstitute,' CENTCOM Commander, General Michael Erik Kurilla said in a Dec. 20 statement. 'ISIS has the intent to break out of detention the over 8,000 ISIS operatives currently being held in facilities in Syria. We will aggressively target these leaders and operatives, including those trying to conduct operations external to Syria,' Kurilla said. With Assad gone, there are signs Russia is doubtful about its ability to maintain military presence in Syria. In recent weeks, Russian cargo planes reportedly carrying military equipment have flown from Syria to eastern Libya, much of which is under the control of Khalifa Haftar, described by France 24 as 'Russia’s man' in the country. Russia also has reportedly shifted military assets to bases in Mali and Sudan, where Moscow maintains a presence of its African Corps — formerly Wagner — troops. Despite efforts to find alternatives, experts say Russia’s potential loss of its bases in Syria could seriously dampen Russia’s ability to project power in the Middle East and throughout Africa. On Dec. 30, Al Jazeera reported that Syria’s new government had set up checkpoints around Hmeimim air base. Syrian security forces alleged Russia was harboring Assad loyalists at the facility. The rebel fighters who ousted Assad and many locals view Russian troops as occupiers, and they want Moscow to withdraw its military presence, Al Jazeera reported. That report described Hmeimim as a 'thorn' in the hearts of the Syrian rebels who had recaptured the country earlier that month, citing the destruction Russian airstrikes had subjected them to up until Assad’s last days in power. As in Syria, Russia previously accused the U.S. and U.K. of supporting Islamic State – Khorasan Province, or ISIS-K, in Afghanistan, despite longtime U.S. efforts to eradicate ISIS-K and its leadership there. That allegation fits into the broader conspiracy theory repeatedly spread by Russia and Iran that the U.S. created Islamic State to destabilize the Middle East and serve the foreign policy goals of the U.S. and Israel. Throughout the decade of the civil war, Russia framed its support for Assad and military presence in Syria, including the deployment of long-range bombers to Hmeimim air base, as a stabilizing force in the country. Contrary to that narrative, Russia indiscriminately attacked civilian targets, particularly hospitals, and allegedly killed tens of thousands of people throughout the course of the Syrian civil war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ramps-up-disinformation-efforts-as-its-grip-weakens-over-post-assad-syria/7922328.html	2025-01-02T11:09:35-08:00	
Man who died in Las Vegas Tesla truck blast was US Army soldier, officials say	LAS VEGAS, Nevada — The person who authorities believe died in the explosion of a Tesla Cybertruck packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters outside President-elect Donald Trump's Las Vegas hotel was an active-duty U.S. Army soldier, three U.S. officials told The Associated Press on Thursday. Two law enforcement officials identified the man inside the futuristic-looking pickup truck as Matthew Livelsberger. The law enforcement officials spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss an ongoing investigation. Three U.S. officials said Livelsberger was an active-duty Army member, who spent time at the base formerly known as Fort Bragg, a massive Army base in North Carolina that is home to Army special forces command. The officials also spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to disclose details of his service. The truck explosion came hours after a driver, 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar, rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans' famed French Quarter early on New Year's Day, killing at least 15 people before being shot to death by police. That crash was being investigated as a terrorist attack and police believe the driver was not acting alone. Jabbar, a U.S. Army veteran, also spent time at Fort Bragg but one official said so far there is no overlap in their assignments there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-who-died-in-las-vegas-tesla-truck-blast-was-us-army-soldier-officials-say/7922125.html	2025-01-02T08:38:42-08:00	
Dinosaur highway' tracks dating back 166 million years discovered in England	LONDON — A worker digging up clay in a southern England limestone quarry noticed unusual bumps that led to the discovery of a 'dinosaur highway' and nearly 200 tracks that date back 166 million years, researchers said Thursday. The extraordinary find made after a team of more than 100 people excavated the Dewars Farm Quarry, in Oxfordshire, in June expands upon previous paleontology work in the area and offers greater insights into the Middle Jurassic period, researchers at the universities of Oxford and Birmingham said. 'These footprints offer an extraordinary window into the lives of dinosaurs, revealing details about their movements, interactions, and the tropical environment they inhabited,' said Kirsty Edgar, a micropaleontology professor at the University of Birmingham. Four of the sets of tracks that make up the so-called highway show paths taken by gigantic, long-necked, herbivores called sauropods, thought to be Cetiosaurus, a dinosaur that grew to nearly 18 meters in length. A fifth set belonged to the Megalosaurus, a ferocious 9-meter predator that left a distinctive triple-claw print and was the first dinosaur to be scientifically named two centuries ago. An area where the tracks cross raises questions about possible interactions between the carnivores and herbivores. 'Scientists have known about and been studying Megalosaurus for longer than any other dinosaur on Earth, and yet these recent discoveries prove there is still new evidence of these animals out there, waiting to be found,' said Emma Nicholls, a vertebrate paleontologist at the Oxford University Museum of Natural History. Nearly 30 years ago, 40 sets of footprints discovered in a limestone quarry in the area were considered one of the world's most scientifically important dinosaur track sites. But that area is mostly inaccessible now and there's limited photographic evidence because it predated the use of digital cameras and drones to record the findings. The group that worked at the site this summer took more than 20,000 digital images and used drones to create 3-D models of the prints. The trove of documentation will aid future studies and could shed light on the size of the dinosaurs, how they walked and the speed at which they moved. 'The preservation is so detailed that we can see how the mud was deformed as the dinosaur's feet squelched in and out,' said Duncan Murdock, an earth scientist at the Oxford museum. 'Along with other fossils like burrows, shells and plants we can bring to life the muddy lagoon environment the dinosaurs walked through.' The findings will be shown at a new exhibit at the museum and also broadcast on the BBC's Digging for Britain program next week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dinosaur-highway-tracks-dating-back-166-million-years-discovered-in-england/7922082.html	2025-01-02T07:59:50-08:00	
Montenegro mourns after gunman kills at least 12 people before shooting himself	CETINJE, Montenegro — Shock and dismay prevailed in Montenegro on Thursday after a gunman fatally shot 12 people, including two children, in a western town before killing himself. At least four others were wounded in the shooting rampage in Cetinje on Wednesday that followed a bar brawl, officials said. This was the second such incident in the town in the past three years. The shooter, identified as 45-year-old Aco Martinovic, killed the owner of the bar, the bar owner's children and his own family members, officials have said. The attacker, who first fled after the rampage, was later located and surrounded by police. He died after shooting himself in the head, Interior Minister Danilo Saranovic said. Residents of Cetinje, a town of some 17,000 people, were stunned and grief-stricken. 'I knew all of these people personally, also the attacker. I think when he did that, he was out of his mind,' said Vesko Milosevic, a retiree from Cetnje. 'What do I know, he went from place to place and killed people. It's a catastrophe.' Vanja Popovic, whose relatives are among the victims, said that 'we are all in shock.' 'How can I feel after this?' Popovic said. 'No one expected it. You can't even ask anyone anything.' Police had dispatched a special unit to search for the attacker in the town, which is located about 30 kilometers (18 miles) northwest of Podgorica, the capital. All roads in and out of the city were blocked for hours as police swarmed the streets. Saranovic said that the shooter had died while being taken to a hospital in the capital and succumbed from the 'severity of his injuries.' Officials have said that the attacker was at the bar throughout the day with other guests when the brawl erupted. He then went home, brought back a weapon and opened fire at around 5:30 p.m. Prosecutor Andrijana Nastic said Thursday that the attacker went to six locations during the shooting rampage, including the last one, where he shot himself. Four men were killed at the bar, Nastic said. The shooter then moved on to another location where he killed four more people, and then two children at a third site. He then went on to kill two more people at two other locations before eventually shooting himself, Nastic said. 'Further investigation will determine the exact circumstances of the events,' she added. The government has declared three days of national mourning starting on Thursday, and all planned New Year's festivities have been canceled throughout the country. Prime Minister Milojko Spajic said that the government may try to impose a total ban on weapons 'because we must ask ourselves after this who should be allowed to have guns in Montenegro.' The small Adriatic Sea nation, which has a population of around 620,000 people, is known for its gun culture and many people traditionally have weapons. In August 2022 in Cetinje, which is Montenegro's historic capital, an attacker killed 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby. Police have said that the suspect in Wednesday's shooting received a suspended sentence in 2005 for violent behavior and had appealed his latest conviction for illegal weapons possession. Montenegrin media have reported that he was known for erratic and violent behavior. 'Instead of holiday joy ... we have been gripped by sadness over the loss of innocent lives,' Montenegro's President Jakov Milatovic said in a post on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/montenegro-mourns-after-gunman-kills-at-least-12-people-before-shooting-himself/7922074.html	2025-01-02T07:56:34-08:00	
Italy summons Iranian ambassador, demands release of journalist	Rome — Italy's foreign ministry summoned the Iranian ambassador on Thursday to demand the immediate release of reporter Cecilia Sala, who was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19 while working under a regular journalistic visa. The ministry said in a statement it had relayed 'serious concern' over Sala's detention and stressed the need for humane treatment and respect for her human rights. Italian media have reported that Sala is in solitary confinement in a freezing cold cell with a neon light left on night and day. Her glasses have been confiscated and she has had hardly any contact with the outside world. The secretary general of the Italian foreign ministry, Riccardo Guariglia, demanded that embassy staff in Tehran should be allowed to visit Sala and provide her with 'the comfort items that she has been denied so far', the ministry said. Iran's official IRNA news agency reported on Monday that Sala had been arrested for 'violating the laws of the Islamic Republic'. It gave no further information. Sala was detained three days after an Iranian businessman, Mohammad Abedini, was arrested at Milan's Malpensa Airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a 2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has denied involvement in the attack, and its foreign ministry was quoted in Iranian media as saying Abedini's arrest violated international law. In recent years, Iran's security forces have arrested dozens of foreigners and dual nationals, mostly on charges related to espionage and security. Rights groups have accused Iran of trying to extract concessions from other countries through such arrests. Iran denies this. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is due to discuss Sala's case with her foreign and justice ministers later on Thursday, her office said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-summons-iranian-ambassador-demands-release-of-journalist/7921945.html	2025-01-02T05:51:23-08:00	
Syrian security forces search for pro-Assad militants in Homs, state media say	Syrian security forces searched Thursday for former soldiers and pro-Assad militants in the city of Homs who have refused to turn in their weapons, state media said. The SANA news agency cited a military official saying the rebels who ousted longtime President Bashar al-Assad had set up centers in Homs for the soldiers and militants to turn in their arms in a process carried out in other parts of Syria. The report said the new Syrian authorities received reports weeks ago that there were remnants of pro-Assad militias in Homs. A few dozen protesters gathered in the Syrian city of Douma on Wednesday to demand answers in the disappearance of four prominent activists who were abducted more than a decade ago. The demonstrators called on Syria’s new rulers — the Islamist-led rebels who seized power last month — to investigate what happened to them. The activists in question are Razan Zaitouneh, her husband, Wael Hamadeh, Samira Khalil and Nazem Hammadi. On December 9, 2013, unidentified gunmen stormed the Violations Documentation Center in Douma, northeast of Damascus, and abducted the four activists. The center was set up in 2011 to monitor human rights violations in Syria. At the time, Douma was held by rebels. There has been no sign of life or proof of death since they were abducted. Zaitouneh was one of Syria’s most prominent human rights activists, in part because she documented abuses by then-President Assad’s government and rebel groups in equal measure. Zaitouneh’s work earned her global recognition, including an International Woman of Courage Award presented by then-U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in 2013. At the Wednesday protest, demonstrators held up photos of the missing activists. 'We are here because we want to know the whole truth about two women and two men who were disappeared from this place 11 years and 22 days ago,' said activist Yassin Al-Haj Saleh, whose wife, Khalil, was among those abducted. 'We are gathering here to remind the world of their case,' he added. 'This is the first opportunity that allows us to be in Douma and in front of the place that they were kidnapped from, to speak up about the case, taking advantage of the political change that took place in the country.' Since the Assad government was ousted last month, protests have occurred across the country, calling for information about the thousands of people who disappeared by force under Assad’s rule. Syria’s transitional government — led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led the ouster of Assad — has been neutral regarding accusations against various armed groups in the enforced disappearance of activists. HTS has also aligned with activists in their efforts to seek truth and justice. 'We are here because we want the truth. The truth about their fate and justice for them, so that we may heal our wounds,' said Alaa al-Merhi, Khalil’s niece. No group has claimed responsibility for the abduction, but signs point to the Army of Islam, the most powerful rebel faction in Douma at the time. The group has long denied involvement. Zaitouneh had received threats from both the government and rebels before she went missing. Friends and activists have said some of the threats can be traced to the Army of Islam. Protesters on Wednesday held banners accusing the Army of Islam of the abduction. 'We have enough evidence to incriminate Jaish al-Islam, and we have the names of suspects we would like to see investigated,' Haj Saleh said, using another name for the group. He said he wanted 'the perpetrators to be tried by the Syrian courts.' The Army of Islam remains an armed faction backed by Turkey. It is excluded from the HTS-led Syrian leadership. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-security-forces-search-for-pro-assad-militants-in-homs-state-media-say/7921841.html	2025-01-02T03:49:25-08:00	
Biden honoring 20 Americans with Presidential Citizens Medal	U.S. President Joe Biden is set to award the nation’s second highest civilian honor to 20 people at a White House ceremony Thursday. The recipients of the Presidential Citizens Medal include Congressman Bennie Thompson and former Congresswoman Elizabeth Cheney, who led a congressional investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob seeking to disrupt the certification of Biden’s 2020 election win over Donald Trump. Trump, who won the 2024 election for a new term starting later this month, has said Thompson and Cheney should be jailed. A White House statement about Thursday’s honorees said Cheney, a Republican, 'raised her voice—and reached across the aisle—to defend our Nation and the ideals we stand for: Freedom. Dignity. And decency.' The statement said Thompson was 'at the forefront of defending the rule of law with unwavering integrity and a steadfast commitment to truth.' Created in 1969, the Presidential Citizens Medal honors citizens 'who have performed exemplary deeds of service for their country or their fellow citizens.' 'President Biden believes these Americans are bonded by their common decency and commitment to serving others,' the White House said. 'The country is better because of their dedication and sacrifice.' Also being honored Thursday are Mary Bonauto and Evan Wolfson, who worked to legalize same-sex marriage in the United States. Frank Butler is another medal recipient, with the White House highlighting his effort to set standards for the use of tourniquets and saying he 'transformed battlefield trauma care for the United States military and saved countless lives.' Mitsuye Endo Tsutsumi is being honored for her successful legal challenge against the imprisonment of Japanese Americans during World War II. Biden is honoring Eleanor Smeal for her work in leading women’s rights protests and fighting for equal pay for women. Medals are being awarded to a former congresswoman, Carolyn McCarthy, and a group of former U.S. senators: Bill Bradley, Chris Dodd, Nancy Kassebaum and Ted Kaufman. Other honorees include Diane Carlson Evans, founder of the Vietnam Women’s Memorial Foundation, war correspondent Joseph Galloway, civil rights advocate Louis Redding and photographer Bobby Sager. Judge Collins Seitz, Fulbright University Vietnam founder Thomas Vallely, breast cancer research advocate Frances Visco and Savannah College of Art and Design founder Paula Wallace are also receiving the Presidential Citizens Medal.

South Korea police search Jeju Air, airport operator over fatal plane crash	SEOUL, South Korea — South Korean police said on Thursday they had raided Jeju Air and the operator of Muan International Airport as part of their investigation into Sunday's crash that killed 179 people in the worst aviation disaster on the country's soil. Jeju Air 7C2216, which departed the Thai capital of Bangkok for Muan in southwestern South Korea, belly-landed and overshot the regional airport's runway, exploding into flames after hitting an embankment. Two crew members, who were sitting in the tail end of the Boeing 737-800, were pulled out alive by rescuers but injured. The conversion of data from the cockpit voice recorder to audio files, which could provide critical information on the final minutes of the flight, was completed on Thursday, Joo Jong-wan, the deputy transport minister for civil aviation, told a media briefing. Police investigators were searching the offices of the airport operator and the transportation ministry aviation authority in the southwestern county of Muan, as the well as office of Jeju Air in Seoul, the South Jeolla provincial police said in a media statement. Investigators planned to seize documents and materials related to the operation and maintenance of the aircraft as well as the operation of airport facilities, a police official told Reuters. Jeju Air was cooperating with the police, a director at the airline, Song Kyeong-hoon, told a media briefing. Questions by air safety experts on what led to the deadly explosion have focused on the embankment, designed to prop up the 'localizer' antenna used to guide landings, which they said is too rigid and too close to the end of the runway. 'This rigid structure proved catastrophic when the skidding aircraft made impact,' said Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California, adding it was concerning that the navigation antenna was mounted on 'such a formidable concrete structure, rather than the standard metal tower/pylon installation.' Joo said the ministry was still unable to provide clear details on Muan airport's upgrade plans that had led to the addition of the structure to support the navigation system. The ministry is conducting a check on localizer equipment at airports throughout the country, Joo said. A probe into the doomed Jeju Air flight is also under way involving South Korean officials and the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the aircraft's maker, Boeing. It remains unanswered why the aircraft did not deploy its landing gear and what led the pilot to apparently rush into a second attempt at landing after telling air traffic control the plane had suffered a bird strike and declaring an emergency. The aircraft's flight data recorder, which sustained some damage, is being taken to the United States for analysis in cooperation with the NTSB. Joo said on Wednesday it may be difficult to release the audio files from the cockpit voice recorder to the public as they will be critical to the ongoing investigation. Investigators from the NTSB, FAA and Boeing are in South Korea to help the probe. South Korea's acting President Choi Sang-mok said in a disaster management meeting immediate action must be taken if a special inspection of all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated in the country finds any issues. 'As there's great public concern about the same aircraft model involved in the accident, the transport ministry and relevant organizations must conduct a thorough inspection of operation maintenance, education, and training,' Choi said. His comments at the start of the meeting were provided by his office. Choi asked that no effort be spared in helping the families of the victims as the remains of those killed are handed over them. He also asked the police to take action against anyone posting 'malicious' messages and fake news on social media related to the disaster.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-police-search-jeju-air-airport-operator-over-fatal-plane-crash/7921782.html	2025-01-02T00:34:13-08:00	
Israeli airstrikes kill at least 10 in southern Gaza	Palestinian medics said an Israeli airstrike Thursday killed at least 10 people and injured 15 others in southern Gaza. The strike hit a tent camp housing displaced families in the al-Mawasi area west of the city of Khan Younis. Those killed included Gaza police chief Mahmoud Salah and his aide, Hussam Shahwan, officials said. Israel warned Wednesday it will intensify its strikes against Hamas if the militant group continues to hold the hostages it took in October 2023 and launches rockets at Israel. 'I want to send a clear message from here to the heads of the terrorists in Gaza: If Hamas does not soon allow the release of the Israeli hostages from Gaza ... and continues firing at Israeli communities, it will face blows of an intensity not seen in Gaza for a long time,' Defense Minister Israel Katz said. The war in Gaza began with Hamas militants attacking southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 people hostage. About 100 hostages are being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 45,500 Palestinians and injured more than 108,000, according to the health ministry in the enclave. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The war has leveled wide areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of its 2.3 million people. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror organization.

South Korea's impeached president resists arrest over martial law bid	SEOUL, South Korea — Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol remained defiantly inside his residence resisting arrest for a third day on Thursday after vowing to 'fight' authorities seeking to question him over his failed martial law bid. The embattled leader issued the bungled declaration on Dec. 3 that led to his impeachment and has left him facing arrest, imprisonment or, at worst, the death penalty. Supporters and opponents of Yoon have since camped outside his presidential residence, while members of his security team have blocked attempted police raids in a dramatic stand-off. Yoon has gone to ground but remained unrepentant as the crisis has rolled on, issuing a defiant message to his base days before an arrest warrant expires on Jan. 6. 'The Republic of Korea is currently in danger due to internal and external forces threatening its sovereignty, and the activities of anti-state elements,' he said in a statement passed around to protesters, his lawyer Yoon Kab-keun confirmed to AFP. 'I vow to fight alongside you to the very end to protect this nation,' he added, saying he watched the hundreds-strong protest on Wednesday evening on a YouTube livestream. Yoon Kab-keun confirmed to AFP that the impeached leader remained inside the presidential compound. 'The president is at the (official presidential) residence,' he said. Opposition lawmakers were quick to condemn Yoon Suk Yeol's defiant message as inflammatory, with Democratic Party spokesperson Jo Seoung-lae calling him 'delusional' and accusing him of trying to incite clashes. The suspended president's legal team has filed for an injunction to block the warrant and described the arrest order on Wednesday as 'an unlawful and invalid act.' - Blocked raids - Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) chief Oh Dong-woon warned that anyone trying to block authorities from arresting Yoon Suk Yeol could face prosecution. Along with the summons, a Seoul court issued a search warrant for his official residence and other locations, a CIO official told AFP. The presidential security service's official stance has been to treat the warrants with due process. It remains unclear how many guards are stationed with him but they have blocked searches of his office and residence. They have cited two articles in South Korea's Criminal Procedure Act that prohibit seizure from locations where official secrets are stored, without consent of the person in charge. South Korean officials have previously failed to execute similar arrest warrants for lawmakers -- in 2000 and 2004 -- due to party members and supporters blocking police for the seven-day period the warrants were valid. However, discussions between prosecutors and police about Yoon Suk Yeol's arrest are taking place in the background of the political crisis that saw the country briefly lurch back to the dark days of military rule. Refused questioning The martial law order, which Yoon Suk Yeol said was aimed at eliminating 'anti-state elements,' only lasted a few hours. Armed troops stormed the national assembly building, scaling fences, smashing windows and landing by helicopter, but the president was quickly forced to make a U-turn after lawmakers rushed to parliament to vote it down. He was then stripped of his presidential duties by parliament and now faces criminal charges of insurrection. Yoon Suk Yeol has since refused summonses for questioning three times and doubled down on claims the opposition was in league with South Korea's communist enemies. Supporters have raced to Seoul to support him in the wake of his refusal, spewing vitriol at police and waving anti-impeachment placards. A constitutional court will rule whether to uphold his impeachment. The turmoil deepened late last week when his replacement, Han Duck-soo, was also impeached by parliament for failing to sign bills for investigations into his predecessor. Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok has been installed as acting president and pledged to do all he can to end the political upheaval. He has since decided to appoint two new judges to the constitutional court, a key demand of the opposition, but was criticized by Yoon Suk Yeol's staff as overstepping his powers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-impeached-president-resists-arrest-over-martial-law-bid/7921762.html	2025-01-01T23:17:30-08:00	
Authorities conduct searches in probe of truck attack that killed at least 15	The FBI said late Wednesday authorities were conducting search warrants in New Orleans, Louisiana, and states outside Louisiana as they investigate the attack in which a driver crashed a pickup truck into a crowd and opened fire, killing at least 15 people and injuring at least 30. Investigators were still working late Wednesday to gather evidence at the scene of the early morning New Year's Day attack on New Orleans' popular Bourbon Street. So far, the FBI has identified the suspect as 42-year-old Shamsud-Din Jabbar. The agency said it was investigating the attack as an act of terrorism, and that authorities do not believe the driver acted alone. 'The killer was an American citizen born in Texas,' U.S. President Joe Biden said Wednesday night. 'He served in the United States Army in active duty for many years. He also served in the Army Reserve until a few years ago.' Hours earlier, the suspect indicated in videos posted on social media that the attack was inspired by the Islamic State terror group. The FBI said an Islamic State flag was found in the vehicle after the attack. Biden said law enforcement and the intelligence community were searching for any potential 'connections, associations or co-conspirators.' 'So many people around the world love New Orleans because of its history, its culture, and above all, its people,' Biden said. 'So, I know while this person committed a terrible assault on the city, the spirit of our New Orleans will never, never, never be defeated. It always will shine forth.' Early morning attack The attack occurred at 3:15 a.m. on Wednesday at the intersection of Canal and Bourbon streets in the city's lively French Quarter. The historic tourist destination filled with bars and music is also known for its large New Year's Eve celebrations. After the vehicle crashed, the driver got out of the car and opened fire on responding officers, police said. Officers returned fire, killing the suspect, according to police. Two officers were wounded but are in stable condition, police said. 'This is not just an act of terrorism. This is evil,' New Orleans Police Superintendent Anne Kirkpatrick told reporters at a press conference earlier Wednesday. Investigators found weapons and a potential explosive device in the vehicle, the FBI said, along with the other potential explosive devices found in the French Quarter. The vehicle appeared to have been rented, the FBI said. 'My heart goes out to the victims and their families who were simply trying to celebrate the holiday. There is no justification for violence of any kind, and we will not tolerate any attack on any of our nation's communities,' Biden said in a statement on the social media platform X. President-elect Donald Trump condemned the attack in a post on his social media platform Truth Social. 'Our hearts are with all the innocent victims and their loved ones,' Trump said. 'The Trump Administration will fully support the City of New Orleans as they investigate and recover from this act of pure evil!' In a statement on X, Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry urged people to stay away from the site of the attack, calling the incident 'a horrific act of violence.' Crowds were also out partying in New Orleans because the city was set to host college football's Sugar Bowl game Wednesday night. Officials confirmed that the game would be postponed until Thursday night. Additionally, New Orleans is set to host the NFL's Super Bowl on February 9. VOA national security correspondent Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.

Islamic State group-inspired New Orleans attack revives familiar fears	WASHINGTON — Even before the shock from the deadly New Year’s Day terror attack in New Orleans could subside, early indications from the investigation pointed to a scenario U.S. law enforcement and security officials have long feared – a plot at least inspired by the Islamic State terror group. The FBI Wednesday confirmed reports the suspect had planted an IS flag in the pickup truck he used to plow into a crowd on Bourbon Street in the early hours of Wednesday morning before he was killed during a shootout with police. Late Wednesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said the FBI found the suspect had taken other actions 'mere hours before the attack' to make his loyalty known. Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old U.S. citizen and former Army reservist, had 'posted videos on social media indicating that it was inspired by ISIS,' Biden said, using another name for the terror group. 'The situation is very fluid,' Biden added. 'The law enforcement and intelligence community are continuing to look for any connections, associations or co-conspirators,' he said. However, that investigation included the execution of search warrants at various locations in New Orleans and other states, an operation by the FBI and other law enforcement officials at a traffic intersection in Houston and questions as to whether there could be any connection to an attempt to blow up a Tesla Cybertruck in front of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas. Regardless of additional conspirators or connections, details of the New Orleans attack itself correspond with tactics long espoused by IS propagandists. 'What we saw fits in with the common pattern we’ve seen from the Islamic State for a while,' said Aaron Zelin, a fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, who specializes in jihadism. 'They’ve been calling for car ramming attacks for years.' 'Every day they put out pushes for supporters, prospective recruits, anyone to do something on their behalf,' Zelin told VOA. One of the first IS-linked attacks using a vehicle as a weapon took place in Nice, France, in 2016. A 31-year-old Tunisian-born Frenchman who was divorced and suffered from depression plowed into a Bastille Day celebration, killing more than 80 people. Months later, a 24-year-old Tunisian man used a truck to drive into crowds at a Christmas market in Berlin, killing 13 people. He, too, posted a video pledging allegiance to IS before carrying out the attack. IS additionally claimed a November 2017 truck ramming attack in New York that killed at least eight people, in which police officials said the attacker followed IS instructions on vehicle attacks 'almost exactly to a T.' Even as the IS terror group retreated from counterterrorism pressure in places like Syria and Afghanistan, its leaders never abandoned the quest to inspire attacks around the world. 'In Afghanistan ... ISIS-Khorasan, continues to harbor intent to conduct external operations and maintains English‑language media releases that aim to globalize the group’s local grievances among Western audiences,' U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas warned in written congressional testimony in October 2023. Even the most recent Homeland Security threat assessment, issued in September, cautioned that IS, with other terror groups such as al-Qaida, 'maintain the enduring intent to conduct or inspire attacks in the Homeland,' rating the threat level as 'high.' The September assessment further warned that IS online media groups also sought to capitalize on the Israel-Hamas conflict in the Middle East 'to inspire more violent action.' FBI Director Christopher Wray has also said repeatedly that the bureau’s domestic terrorism caseload remains high, with about 1,000 IS-related investigations each year spanning all 50 U.S. states. According to data compiled by Seamus Hughes, a senior researcher faculty member at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center, or NCITE, more than 250 individuals have been charged with IS-related activities since 2014. Most of those cases, according to Hughes, have resulted in guilty pleas or convictions; Justice Department prosecutors have only lost one case that went to trial. Meanwhile, the FBI has had success in disrupting IS-linked or inspired terror plots. In October, for example, agents arrested a 27-year-old Afghan national in Oklahoma City, charging him and a juvenile co-conspirator with attempting to carry out a mass shooting on Election Day. IS has so far yet to claim the New Orleans terror attack as its own, but the Washington Institute’s Aaron Zelin said the attack is already generating excitement among IS supporters on social media. Some U.S. counterterrorism officials worry that excitement will play to the terror group’s advantage. 'From their view, it's less important that an attack kills large numbers of people than it simply garners a lot of media attention,' Brett Holmgren, the acting director of the U.S. National Counterterrorism Center told a Washington audience in November. Some counterterrorism officials and experts, however, say they worry the attacks could become deadlier. The NCTC has warned IS has been benefiting from improved finances and even set up an external planning unit in Syria, with a focus on carrying out attacks against the U.S. 'All of last year that there was an uptick in the tempo of Islamic State plots and attacks,' Zelin told VOA. 'We saw five attack plots in the United States last year, whereas in 2023 there were none.' That activity may not be limited to America, with some analysts pointing to deadly IS attacks last year in Kerman, Iran, and Moscow. [[ 'It falls in line to a broader trend that we've seen in the U.S., but also in other parts of the world where, you know, we saw more plots and attacks in Europe, Russia, Turkey, Iran, Central Asia,' Zelin said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-group-inspired-new-orleans-attack-revives-familiar-fears/7921742.html	2025-01-01T22:17:11-08:00	
Parts of UK flooded by rain, wild weather disrupts New Year's events	LONDON — Parts of the United Kingdom were flooded Wednesday as heavy rains and powerful winds continued to disrupt New Year’s celebrations. Several communities in the Manchester area were flooded, with several homes evacuated and cars submerged up to their roofs on roads and in parking lots after nearly a month's worth of rain fell in two days. A major incident was declared and mountain rescue teams were called in to help firefighters respond to swamped properties and stranded vehicles, Greater Manchester Police said. 'There’s still probably likely to be further flooding across the course of the day,' Met Office meteorologist Tom Morgan said. 'We are potentially expecting the flood situation to get worse before it gets better.' Tom Coulthard said the rain started late Tuesday afternoon and poured all night where he lives in Didsbury, south of Manchester, topping river banks and forcing a hotel to be evacuated before dawn. Roads and highways were closed in the area. 'All the local rivers and water courses have sort of filled up and flooded around the area,' said Coulthard, a geography professor at the University of Hull. 'That’s really probably a sign of just how our weather is changing, how climate is shifting.' The deluge and gusts derailed New Year's Eve fireworks celebrations, leading to cancelations in Edinburgh and several other cities. Events planned for New Year's Day, including nippy outdoor swims and a bathtub boat race, were scrapped. London, which was able to launch its massive fireworks display on the River Thames in front of Big Ben, had to postpone the start of its New Year’s Day parade and grounded inflatable floats due to the blustery and soggy conditions. Cheerleaders and members of bands that marched through central London pulled transparent coverings over their bright costumes to take shelter from rain. Warnings that indicate flooding is expected were issued at one point to more than 150 communities across the U.K., with most being in northern England. Later in the day, dozens of those warnings had been lifted. Several trains were canceled because of high water around the tracks and some highways were closed. With temperatures dropping, there were ice warnings until late Thursday morning for Northern Ireland, parts of north Wales, England and Scotland. And a three-day snow warning was issued for the coming weekend for much of England and Scotland.	https://www.voanews.com/a/parts-of-uk-flooded-by-rain-wild-weather-disrupts-new-year-s-events/7921719.html	2025-01-01T20:26:10-08:00

Aspiring nurse, football star, father among dead in New Orleans attack	NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA — An 18-year-old girl dreaming of becoming a nurse, a father of two and a former Princeton football star suffered fatal injuries when the driver of a white pickup truck sped down Bourbon Street, packed with holiday revelers early Wednesday morning. Officials have not yet released the names of the 15 people killed in the New Orleans New Year's Day truck attack, but their families and friends have started sharing their stories. New Orleans Coroner Dr. Dwight McKenna said in a statement late Wednesday that the names of the dead would be released once autopsies were complete and next of kin were informed. About 30 people were injured. Nikyra Dedeaux Zion Parsons of Gulfport, Mississippi, had been celebrating New Year's Eve during his first night on Bourbon Street when a vehicle appeared and plowed into his friend, 18-year-old Nikyra Dedeaux, who he said had dreamed of becoming a nurse. 'A truck hit the corner and comes barreling through, throwing people like in a movie scene, throwing people into the air,' Parsons, 18, told The Associated Press. 'It hit her and flung her like at least 30 feet, and I was just lucky to be alive.' As the crowd scattered in the chaos, he ran through a gruesome aftermath of bleeding and maimed victims, hearing gunshots and explosive sounds. 'Bodies, bodies all up and down the street, everybody screaming and hollering,' Parsons said. 'People crying on the floor, like brain matter all over the ground. It was just insane, like the closest thing to a war zone that I've ever seen.' Dedeaux was a responsible daughter — shorter than all her siblings but the one who helped take care of everyone, Parsons said. Dedeaux had a job at a hospital and was set to start college and begin working toward her goal of becoming a registered nurse. 'She had her mind set — she didn't have everything figured out, but she had the plan laid down,' Parsons said. Reggie Hunter Reggie Hunter, a 37-year-old father of two from Baton Rouge, had just left work and headed to celebrate New Year's with a cousin when the attack happened, another cousin, Shirell Jackson, told Nola.com. Hunter was killed and his cousin was injured, Jackson said. Tiger Bech A former high school and college football player from Louisiana was among those who died in the attack at New Orleans' French Quarter, according to an education official. Tiger Bech, 28, died late Wednesday morning at a New Orleans hospital, according to local media outlets citing Kim Broussard, the athletic director at St. Thomas More Catholic High School in Lafayette. Bech attended the high school, where he played wide receiver, quarterback, punt returner and defensive back, NOLA.com reported. Bech's LinkedIn profile said he had played football at Princeton University before graduating in 2021. Most recently he was working as an investment trader at a New York brokerage firm. Princeton football coach Bob Surace said Wednesday that he had been texting with Bech's father, sharing memories of the player, who was a kick returner and receiver from 2017 to 2019. 'He might be the first Tiger to ever play for us, and that nickname kind of described him as a competitor,' Surace told ESPN. The school's teams are also called the Tigers.

Pakistan secures peace deal in violence-torn district bordering Afghanistan	islamabad — Authorities in northwestern Pakistan announced Wednesday that heavily armed rival Sunni and Shiite Muslim tribes in a conflict-prone district bordering Afghanistan have reached a peace deal following recent deadly clashes. A traditional grand assembly of tribal elders mediated the agreement between the warring sides in the Kurram district of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where years-old land disputes have often led to deadly districtwide sectarian clashes, a provincial government spokesperson said in a late-night statement. 'Both sides have agreed to demolish their bunkers and surrender their heavy weapons to authorities,' Muhammad Ali Saif said in a post on X. He stated that anyone found guilty of violating the pact's terms would be apprehended and punished in line with local traditions. Saif congratulated the nearly 800,000 residents of Kurram on the signing of the pact, assuring them the deal would 'soon restore calm and security' and lead to 'peace and development' in the district. The most recent round of violence erupted in the district on November 21, when gunmen ambushed a convoy of vehicles mainly carrying Shiite community members, killing 52 of them. Although no one claimed responsibility for the massacre, it led to retaliatory attacks by Shiite fighters against the Sunni village where the convoy was ambushed, raising the overall death toll to more than 130. The provincial government’s intervention had led to a ceasefire and peace talks between the warring sides, but the persistent tensions compelled authorities to halt all Pakistan traffic to and from the district, disrupting the local population’s access to food, fuel, medicine, work and trade. Saif said the peace deal would allow the roads to the district to reopen, noting that stranded convoys of passengers and supplies were scheduled to resume their journeys on Saturday. Pakistani authorities have been ferrying essential commodities such as food and medicine to Kurram by helicopter, citing the insecurity of travel in overland convoys. Residents complained, however, that the air missions were insufficient in addressing the district border crisis. They have also been staging street protests to press the government to reopen the road links to help overcome the shortages. Kurram is the only Pakistani district where Shiites, not Sunnis, make up the majority of the population. Pakistan’s bilateral and transit trade with landlocked Afghanistan through the Kurram district's Kharlachi border crossing has also been halted because of recent sectarian tensions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-secures-peace-deal-in-violence-torn-district-bordering-afghanistan-/7921405.html	2025-01-01T15:35:58-08:00	
Gunman kills at least 10 people in shooting rampage in Montenegro	PODGORICA, MONTENEGRO — At least 10 people, including two children, were killed and four others were wounded in a shooting on Wednesday that followed a bar brawl in a western Montenegrin city, officials said. The shooter was on the run. Police identified the attacker as Aco Martinovic, 45. He killed the owner of the bar in the city of Cetinje, the bar owner's children and his own family members, said Interior Minister Danilo Saranovic at a news conference. 'At this moment, we are focused on arresting him,' Saranovic said. Police dispatched special troops to search for the attacker in Cetinje, located about 30 kilometers northwest of the capital, Podgorica. A statement said the man fled the scene armed after opening fire at the bar. President Jakov Milatovic said he was 'shocked and stunned' by the tragedy. 'Instead of holiday joy ... we have been gripped by sadness over the loss of innocent lives,' Milatovic said on the social media platform X. Prime Minister Milojko Spajic went to the hospital where the wounded were being treated and announced three days of mourning. 'This is a terrible tragedy that has affected us all,' Spajic said. 'All police teams are out.' Montenegro, which has about 620,000 people, is known for gun culture, and many people traditionally have weapons. Wednesday's attack was the second shooting rampage over the past three years in Cetinje, Montenegro's historic capital. In August 2022, an attacker also killed 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby in Cetinje. A report by Radio and Television of Montenegro, the country's public service broadcaster, which published Martinovic's photo on its website, said he was known for erratic behavior and had been detained in the past for illegal possession of weapons. The report said he had gone home to get his gun and returned to the bar, where he had opened fire and killed and wounded several people. He then went to another site where he killed the bar owner's children and a woman, the report added. Police appealed to residents to remain calm and stay indoors, ruling out a clash between criminal gangs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunman-kills-at-least-10-people-in-shooting-rampage-in-montenegro-/7921392.html	2025-01-01T14:54:29-08:00	
Tesla truck explodes outside Trump Vegas hotel; 1 killed, 7 injured	las vegas — One person died and seven others were injured Wednesday when a Tesla Cybertruck that appeared to be carrying fireworks caught fire and exploded outside President-elect Donald Trump's Las Vegas hotel, authorities said. Las Vegas Metropolitan Police and Clark County Fire Department officials told a news conference that a person died inside the futuristic-looking pickup truck, and they were working to get the body out. Seven people nearby had minor injuries, and several were taken to a hospital. The fire in the valet area of the Trump International Hotel Las Vegas was reported at 8:40 a.m., a county spokeswoman said in a statement. According to a law enforcement official, the truck was rented via the Turo app and appeared to have a load of fireworks. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. Law enforcement officials have not ruled out terrorism as a possible motive, a person familiar with the matter said. The person spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to publicly discuss details of the investigation. 'I know you have a lot of questions,' Jeremy Schwartz, acting special agent in charge of the FBI's Las Vegas office, told reporters. 'We don't have a lot of answers.' President Joe Biden was briefed on the explosion. The truck explosion came hours after a driver rammed a truck into a crowd in New Orleans' famed French Quarter early on New Year's Day, killing at least 10 people before he was shot to death by police. 'The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,' Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote in a statement on X, adding: 'We've never seen anything like this.' In Las Vegas, witness Ana Bruce, visiting from Brazil, said she heard three explosions. 'The first one where we saw the fire, the second one, I guess, was the battery or something like that, and the third was the big one that smoked the entire area and was the moment when everyone was told to evacuate and stay away,' Bruce said. The 64-story hotel is just off the Las Vegas Strip and across the street from the Fashion Show Las Vegas shopping mall. Eric Trump, a son of the president-elect and executive vice president of the Trump Organization, posted about the fire on the social media platform X. He praised the fire department and local law enforcement 'for their swift response and professionalism.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/tesla-truck-explodes-outside-trump-vegas-hotel-1-killed-7-injured/7921371.html	2025-01-01T14:11:18-08:00	
Palestinian Authority suspends Al Jazeera broadcasts	WASHINGTON — The Palestinian Authority on Wednesday temporarily suspended Al Jazeera broadcasts across the Palestinian territories, according to media reports. A ministerial committee suspended the broadcaster’s operations over what it described as broadcasting 'inciting material and reports that were deceiving and stirring strife' in the territories. The committee included the culture, interior and communications ministries. The Qatari-owned Al Jazeera came under criticism last week by the Palestinian Authority over its coverage of the weeks-long standoff between Palestinian security forces and militant fighters in the Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. Fatah, the political faction that controls the Palestinian Authority, said the broadcaster was fostering division in 'our Arab homeland in general and in Palestine in particular.' It encouraged Palestinians to not cooperate with the network. Last week, Al Jazeera condemned what it described as an 'incitement campaign' initiated by Fatah against Al Jazeera and its reporters over their coverage of clashes between Palestinian security forces and militant fighters in Jenin. 'Al Jazeera has successfully maintained its professionalism throughout its coverage of the unfolding events in Jenin,' Al Jazeera said in the statement. The Palestinian Authority’s decision to suspend Al Jazeera isn’t expected to be implemented in Hamas-run Gaza, where the Ramallah-based Palestinian Authority does not exercise power. Al Jazeera did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. This suspension is the latest of several recent challenges that Al Jazeera has faced in the occupied West Bank and Israel. In September 2024, Israeli soldiers raided Al Jazeera’s Ramallah office in the occupied West Bank and ordered the bureau to shut down operations. And in May 2024, the Israeli government shutdown Al Jazeera in Israel over national security concerns.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinian-authority-suspends-al-jazeera-broadcasts/7921366.html	2025-01-01T14:05:09-08:00	
Protesters in Syria call for justice for disappeared activists	A few dozen protesters gathered in the Syrian city of Douma on Wednesday to demand answers in the disappearance of four prominent activists who were abducted more than a decade ago. The demonstrators called on Syria’s new rulers — the Islamist-led rebels who seized power last month — to investigate what happened to them. The disappeared activists in question are Razan Zaitouneh, her husband, Wael Hamadeh, Samira Khalil and Nazem Hammadi. On Dec. 9, 2013, unidentified gunmen stormed the Violations Documentation Center in Douma, northeast of Damascus, and abducted the four activists. At the time, Douma was held by rebels. There has been no sign of life nor proof of death since they were abducted. Zaitouneh was one of Syria’s most prominent human rights activists, in part because she documented abuses by then-President Bashar al-Assad’s government and rebel groups in equal measure. Her work earned her international recognition, including an International Woman of Courage Award presented by U.S. first lady Michelle Obama in 2013. At the Wednesday protest, demonstrators held up photos of the missing activists. 'We are here because we want to know the whole truth about two women and two men who were disappeared from this place 11 years and 22 days ago,' said activist Yassin Al-Haj Saleh, whose wife, Khalil, was among those abducted. 'We are gathering here to remind the world of their case,' he added. 'This is the first opportunity that allows us to be in Douma and in front of the place that they were kidnapped from, to speak up about the case, taking advantage of the political change that took place in the country.' Since the Assad government was ousted last month, protests have occurred across the Middle Eastern country calling for information about the thousands of people who were forcibly disappeared under Assad’s rule. Syria’s transitional government — led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led the ouster of Assad — has been neutral regarding accusations against various armed groups of forcibly disappearing activists. HTS has also aligned with activists in their efforts to seek truth and justice. 'We are here because we want the truth. The truth about their fate and justice for them, so that we may heal our wounds,' said Alaa al-Merhi, Khalil’s niece. No group has claimed responsibility for the abduction, but signs point to the Army of Islam, the most powerful rebel faction in Douma at the time. The group has long denied involvement. Zaitouneh had received threats from both the government and rebels before she went missing. Friends and activists have said some of the threats can be traced to the Army of Islam. Protesters on Wednesday held banners accusing the Army of Islam of the abduction. 'We have enough evidence to incriminate Jaish al-Islam, and we have the names of suspects we would like to see investigated,' Haj Saleh said. He said he wanted 'the perpetrators to be tried by the Syrian courts.' The Army of Islam remains an armed faction backed by Turkey. It is excluded from the HTS-led Syrian leadership. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protesters-in-syria-call-for-justice-for-disappeared-activists/7921345.html	2025-01-01T13:34:13-08:00	
Power restored to nearly all of Puerto Rico after major blackout	BAYAMON, PUERTO RICO — Power was restored to nearly all electrical customers across Puerto Rico on Wednesday after a sweeping blackout plunged the U.S. territory into darkness on New Year's Eve. By Wednesday afternoon, power was back up for 98% of Puerto Rico's 1.47 million utility customers, said Luma Energy, the private company supplying power to the archipelago. Lights returned to households as well as Puerto Rico's hospitals and water and sewage facilities after the massive outage that exposed the persistent electricity problems plaguing the island. Still, the company warned that customers could still see temporary outages in the coming days. It said full restoration across the island could take up to two days. 'Given the fragile nature of the grid, we will need to manage available generation to customer demand, which will likely require rotating temporary outages,' Juan Saca, president of Luma Energy, said in a statement. The lights went off in Puerto Rico at 5:30 a.m. Tuesday, darkening almost the entire archipelago as people prepared to ring in the New Year. Authorities are still investigating the cause of the outage, but Luma Energy said a preliminary review pointed to a failure in an underground electric line in the south of the territory. Governor-elect Jenniffer Gonzalez-Colon, who is set to take office Thursday, warned that customers might experience interruptions in the coming days, with power plants not yet operating at maximum capacity. 'These days, I urge you to be moderate with your energy consumption to help reduce load shifting, so that more people can have access to electricity and the system can start up without any major setbacks,' Gonzalez-Colon said on the X social media platform. On the campaign trail, Gonzalez-Colon promised to appoint an 'energy czar' to oversee the operation of the power grid, which has long been fragile and faulty due to years of neglect. The island's power lines were ravaged in September 2017 by Hurricane Maria, a Category 4 storm. Unreliable electricity remains frustratingly common, hindering daily life for Puerto Ricans. In June, over 340,000 customers were left without electricity as people reeled from soaring temperatures. In August, at the peak of Hurricane Ernesto, over half of all utility customers lost power. Tens of thousands of people remained without electricity a week after the storm. The New Year's Eve outage came as clients brace for a hike in electricity rates. Last month, Puerto Rico's Energy Bureau approved an increase of 2.2 cents per kilowatt hour for residential customers from January through March, causing electric bills for the average household to jump by nearly $20, the Energy Bureau said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/power-restored-to-nearly-all-of-puerto-rico-after-major-blackout/7921342.html	2025-01-01T13:28:30-08:00	
China-backed election raises fears of 'negative peace' in Myanmar	WASHINGTON — As Myanmar’s military government prepares for elections in 2025, attention turns to neighboring China, which, critics say, is pressuring Southeast Asian nations to treat the vote as a solution to Myanmar’s ongoing political crisis. A military coup in Myanmar in February 2021 overthrew the democratically elected government and triggered a civil war that left thousands of people dead and millions displaced. Myanmar’s neighbors have been seeking a solution to the crisis and recently held meetings in Bangkok, Thailand, to discuss it. China was a participant at a Dec. 19 meeting that included Bangladesh, India, Laos and Thailand. All five countries are neighbors of Myanmar. At the meeting, Chinese Vice Foreign Minister Sun Weidong urged the neighbors’ representatives to support Myanmar’s 'peace and reconciliation,' according to a statement by China’s Foreign Ministry. 'All parties should respect Myanmar’s national conditions and ... prioritize people’s livelihoods,' Sun said. At the Dec. 19 meeting, Than Swe, Myanmar’s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, outlined the junta’s 2025 election roadmap. Opposition groups, including ethnic armed forces and the National Unity Government, or NUG, a parallel government formed after the 2021 coup, rejected the plan, questioning its legitimacy and whether the elections would be free and fair. On Dec. 20, there was a meeting of all representatives of ASEAN countries, except Myanmar because junta political appointees usually have been barred from attending high-level meetings of the bloc since the coup. Thai Foreign Ministry official Bolbongse Vangphaen said the bloc still awaits details of the proposed ballot, which China backs. Myanmar’s military leadership did not respond to VOA's request for comment regarding the Bangkok meetings, controversies surrounding its proposed elections or its preparations for the polls. China maintains close ties with Myanmar's military and the rebel groups near its border. In his recent Christmas and New Year’s messages, Myanmar’s junta leader, Min Aung Hlaing, reiterated and reaffirmed the government’s commitment to 'strengthening the multiparty democratic system and returning to the correct democratic path.' VOA asked the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar for comment on China’s support for the election in Myanmar but has not received a response. However, during a visit to Myanmar’s capital, Naypyidaw, in mid-August by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi, Beijing called for an 'all-inclusive election,' according to the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar newspaper. Skeptics argue that any election carried out by the junta would lead only to a superficial peace that ignores decadeslong political and ethnic grievances. China’s growing sway Experts told VOA that Beijing is urging ASEAN members to deepen their engagement with Myanmar’s military. According to Jason Tower of the United States Institute of Peace, China is pressuring its Southeast Asian neighbors to accept the junta’s election as a quick solution. 'From China’s vantage point, if ASEAN is bringing the regime back in and is having higher-level interactions, it legitimizes what China is doing,' Tower said. Myanmar expert Htet Min Lwin of York University in Canada said Beijing prefers leveraging its influence over that of Western intervention. 'If the resolution goes through ASEAN, where China holds considerable influence, Beijing will likely keep pushing an ASEAN-led path,' he told VOA. Sai Kyi Zin Soe, a regionally based Myanmar political analyst, agreed. 'Some ASEAN member countries will not be able to overcome China’s influence, economically or in terms of security,' he said. 'China’s power doesn’t stop at ASEAN; it also extends to domestic groups, including ethnic armed groups in Myanmar, which are now controlling almost all the border areas with China and are traditionally closely tied to China. Tower, meanwhile, sees 'no viable plan' for a political solution and said Beijing views Myanmar’s generals as 'completely cornered' and open to 'significant concessions' that could jeopardize sovereignty, including allowing Chinese troops to protect investments. 'China has been strong-arming two of the northern ethnic armed organizations into talks with the regime,' Tower said. 'Chinese influence continues to rise, and [Beijing] is exerting that influence on other countries in the region, trying to get those countries to follow along.' He warned the junta 'is bankrupt when it comes to a real solution,' instead relying on 'airstrikes, forced conscription and a sham election to legitimize junta leader Min Aung Hlaing.' Tower predicted ASEAN would eventually realize the military’s steady decline. Mounting battlefield losses The junta’s China-backed electoral push comes amid a series of defeats. 'The military is losing ground at an alarming pace and is desperate,' Tower said. Tower believes that after the fall of two major regional commands, Myanmar’s weakened military has no alternative but to trade away parts of its sovereignty to China. 'It’s making major concessions,' he said, citing China’s proposed joint venture security company. 'For China, this turns Myanmar into a testing ground for its Global Security Initiative and new approaches to secure interests beyond its borders.' In October, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, or the Kokang group, part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance along with the Ta’ang National Liberation Army and the Arakan Army, captured the city of Lashio in northern Shan State. Lashio is considered strategic for the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor, marking the first time in modern Myanmar history that a regional command fell to rebels. On Dec. 20, the Arakan Army seized the junta’s western regional command in Rakhine state, an area rich in natural gas that includes major Chinese projects. Video on social media shows emaciated junta troops surrendering. Tower said it was an 'embarrassment of an army.' 'The bottom line is increasing desperation,' Tower said, adding that this explains why Myanmar’s military is ceding sovereignty to China, including the potential deployment of Chinese private security troops in Rakhine state. Concerns of 'negative peace' Analysts say an election without real dialogue will yield a fragile ceasefire. 'All the neighboring countries, including China, cannot understand that each ethnic group in Myanmar has its own right to rule and sovereignty,' Htet Min Lwin said. Sai Kyi Zin Soe noted, citing World Bank and United Nations data, that 42 million of Myanmar’s 53 million people now live in poverty. He said the humanitarian crisis could push many armed groups to pause fighting but not necessarily resolve the conflict. 'If the international community pushes them, the war may stop, and the election will happen,' Sai Kyi Zin Soe said. 'However, it will not be a solution that benefits Myanmar in the long term. It needs to be understood that only negative peace will prevail.' Tower told VOA there may be opportunities this year for ASEAN to expand its role, but China’s involvement, especially in border areas, could overshadow that. 'If other countries don’t take careful note of Chinese interference,' he said, 'the response in Myanmar tilts more toward where Beijing is headed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-backed-election-raises-fears-of-negative-peace-in-myanmar/7921313.html	2025-01-01T12:43:26-08:00	
Press freedom groups call for Iran to release jailed Italian journalist	WASHINGTON — Press freedom groups and media organizations are calling for Iran to release an Italian journalist who was arrested last month. Cecilia Sala, who works for the daily Italian newspaper Il Foglio, was arrested on Dec. 19 and is being held in Iran's notorious Evin prison. The 29-year-old was reporting in Iran on a journalist visa and was due to return to Italy on Dec. 20. The New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, said Sala's jailing underscores Tehran's harsh suppression of independent journalism in the country. 'Sala's arrest is a powerful reminder of the daily threats faced by those reporting in and about Iran, and she and all those wrongfully detained by Iran should be released immediately,' CPJ CEO Jodie Ginsberg said Tuesday in a statement. Iran ranks seventh among the world's top jailers of journalists. As of Dec. 1, 2024, 16 journalists were jailed in the country, according to CPJ data. Iran confirmed Sala's detention on Monday when the state news outlet IRNA reported that she was being held after 'violating the laws of the Islamic Republic of Iran.' Sala, who also works for the podcast company Chora Media, is being held in solitary confinement, according to media reports. The office of Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said Meloni was 'following the complex affair' closely and pursuing 'all possible avenues of dialogue' to release Sala. Italy's foreign minister said Sala was in good health and that negotiations were under way to bring her home. Paris-based Reporters Without Borders, or RSF, said Sala appeared to have been arbitrarily detained. 'We are also concerned about her conditions of detention as she is held in solitary confinement in Evin prison — infamous for being the cruel place where free voices critical of the regime are detained,' RSF Director General Thibaut Bruttin said Tuesday in a statement. The National Press Club in Washington condemned Sala's solitary confinement. 'Sala's imprisonment is a chilling reminder of the risks journalists face in pursuit of the truth,' President Emily Wilkins said in a statement last week. 'Her detention is an affront to press freedom and a violation of international norms.' Sala's arrest came just a few days after Italy arrested Swiss Iranian businessman Mohammad Abedini Najafabadi, known as Abedini, in Milan at the request of the United States. The businessman is accused of breaking U.S. sanctions laws and providing support to a foreign terrorist organization, which ultimately led to the deaths of three U.S. service members in a drone attack in Jordan, according to the U.S. Justice Department. A U.S. State Department spokesperson told the Italian newspaper La Repubblica that they believe Sala's arrest is likely a response to Najafabadi's arrest. Iran's Foreign Ministry did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/press-freedom-groups-call-for-iran-to-release-jailed-italian-journalist/7921326.html	2025-01-01T12:39:04-08:00	
Israel's former defense chief Gallant quits parliament	JERUSALEM — Former Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, who had often taken an independent line against Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his far-right government allies, said on Wednesday he was resigning from parliament. Gallant was fired from the government in November by Netanyahu, after months of disagreements over the conduct of the war against Hamas in Gaza, but he kept his seat as an elected member of the Knesset. 'Just as it is on the battlefield, so it is in public service. There are moments in which one must stop, assess and choose a direction in order to achieve the goals,' Gallant said in a televised statement. Gallant had often broken ranks with Netanyahu and his coalition allies of far-right and religious parties, including over exemptions granted to ultra-Orthodox Jewish men from serving in the conscript military — a hot button issue. In March 2023, Netanyahu fired Gallant after he urged a halt to a highly contested government plan to cut the Supreme Court's powers. His dismissal triggered mass protests and Netanyahu backtracked. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Gallant and Netanyahu, along with a Hamas leader, for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict, which Israel has contested.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-s-former-defense-chief-gallant-quits-parliament/7921315.html	2025-01-01T12:29:37-08:00	
Pope calls for commitment to protect life by rejecting abortion in New Year message	ROME — Pope Francis ushered in the New Year with a renewed appeal for the faithful to reject abortion, calling for a 'firm commitment' to protect and respect life from conception to natural death. Francis, 88, celebrated a New Year’s Day Mass in St. Peter’s Basilica on Wednesday that was dedicated to Mary, the mother of Jesus. In his homily, he prayed that everyone learns to care for 'every child born of a woman' and to protect 'the precious gift of life: life in the womb, the lives of children, the lives of the suffering, the poor, the elderly, the lonely and the dying.' 'I ask for a firm commitment to respect the dignity of human life from conception to natural death, so that each person may cherish his or her own life and all may look with hope to the future,' he said, using the terminology of the church's opposition to abortion and euthanasia. In recent years, the Argentine Jesuit has been speaking out more emphatically about abortion than he did at the start of his pontificate. After two doctrinaire popes, Francis complained in the first months of his papacy in 2013 that the church had become obsessed by 'small-minded rules' about hot-button issues such as abortion. Francis now regularly refers to procuring an abortion as 'hiring a hitman to solve a problem.' He recently sparked outrage in Belgium when he criticized its abortion law as 'homicidal' and announced he wanted to beatify Belgium's late king who abdicated for a day rather than approve legislation legalizing the procedure. The Vatican recently announced that the beatification process is under way for King Baudouin, who died in 1993. The morning Mass marked the final big event of Francis' busy Christmas schedule. For the pope, who suffers from recurrent respiratory problems, this year's season was even more challenging with the start of the Vatican's big Holy Year, a once-every-quarter-century celebration of the faith that is expected to bring 32 million pilgrims to Rome during 2025. Speaking to pilgrims who gathered in a sun-filled St. Peter's Square, Francis recalled the Jubilee's central message of the need to forgive debts. He again called for world leaders from wealthy countries to eliminate or reduce the debts owed by poorer countries. Francis urged Christian leaders, in particular, 'to provide a good example' by taking the lead to forgive debts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-calls-for-commitment-to-protect-life-by-rejecting-abortion-in-new-year-message/7921229.html	2025-01-01T11:08:34-08:00	
Human rights plummet in Ukraine, Russian-occupied territories	Geneva — U.N. human rights monitors find that almost three years after Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, the human rights situation in the country and areas occupied by Russia is on a downward spiral, as military operations intensify, civilian casualties rise, and torture, summary executions and other gross violations proliferate. 'The human rights situation remains bleak with a still-rising number of civilian casualties, continued executions and torture of prisoners of war, and efforts by Russia to solidify its control of occupied Ukrainian territory,' according to the new report by the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine, HRMMU. The report, released Tuesday by the U.N. Human Rights Office, covers key developments in the human rights situation between Sept. 1 and Nov. 30, 2024. It’s based on information gathered in the course of dozens of field trips and visits to detention centers, as well as interviews with more than 800 victims and witnesses of human rights violations. 'Behind each of the facts and figures in this report are stories of loss and human suffering, showing the devastating impact of the war across Ukraine,' said HRMUU chief Danielle Bell in a statement issued from Kyiv to coincide with the release of the report. She said HRMMU teams documented 574 civilian deaths, and more than 3,000 civilians injured over the three-month period, adding that September marked the highest monthly casualty toll since July 2022. The report attributes the surge in civilian deaths primarily to 'intensified military operations' by Russian armed forces, especially in Kherson, Donetsk and other Russian government-controlled areas of Kharkiv. 'The use of aerial glide bombs and short-range drones contributed to the high number of civilian casualties and harm to communities,' the report says, noting that in mid-November, Russian armed forces began conducting large-scale coordinated aerial attacks against Ukraine’s critical energy infrastructure. 'The attacks disrupted electricity and dependent services such as water, heating, and transportation services in multiple regions,' it says, 'further diminishing Ukraine’s energy capacity as winter approached.' There was no immediate response to the report from Russian or Ukrainian officials. A spokeswoman for the U.N. Human Rights Office tells VOA the office 'sent the report to the Russian Federation in advance of its publication, as per usual practice. We did not receive any comments from them.' Ukrainian POWs subjected to sexual violence The report finds torture, and ill-treatment of Ukrainian prisoners of war in the hands of the Russian Federation, 'has been widespread and systematic.' It says 42 recently released Ukrainian POWs have presented 'credible and detailed accounts' of torture they had experienced, 'including beatings, electric shock, and prolonged solitary confinement' during their captivity. It says the use of sexual violence is prevalent against both women and men, with many being subjected to 'rape, electric shocks and beating to genitals, forced nudity, and threats of rape and castration.' Since the end of August, U.N. monitors have recorded a significant increase in 'credible allegations of executions of Ukrainian POWs,' involving the killing of 62 individuals in 19 incidents. The U.N. human rights office has verified 'the execution of 15 Ukrainian servicemen.' While Russian POWs also have been subjected to torture and ill-treatment by Ukrainian authorities, authors of the report say this has occurred to a much lesser extent and predominantly while prisoners 'were held in transit facilities during the early stages of captivity.' It adds that the Human Rights Office documented the death of one Russian POW at a transit facility in early 2024 caused by torture and is looking into the deaths of two other Russian POWs under similar circumstances. The report also examines the treatment of civilians in territory occupied by the Russian Federation in Ukraine and in Crimea, which it illegally annexed in 2014. Imposing Russian identity Authors of the report accuse Russia of entrenching its control in the occupied territory through the imposition of Russian laws, in violation of its obligations under international humanitarian law, 'resulting in further restrictions to fundamental rights and freedoms, property ownership, and cultural rights.' They cite the example of a new strategy adopted by the Russian authorities in September 'to compel Ukrainian children and youth in occupied territory to demonstrate loyalty to the Russian Federation.' The strategy involves the training of children in military skills as part of their summer recreational activities and the use of propaganda in education. 'Over the 2024 summer, Russian occupying authorities sent children from occupied territory of Ukraine to camps in Crimea and in the Russian Federation, where both girls and boys received military training and participated in activities focused on reinforcement of Russian patriotism and identity,' in violation of International Humanitarian Law and Human Rights Law, they say. The report lambasts the Russian Federation as the occupying authority for restricting religious freedom and for restricting freedom of expression 'to silence criticism of Russian military actions.' The report also finds fault with provisions adopted by the Ukrainian government in the territories they control that 'prohibit the activities of Ukrainian religious organizations affiliated with counterparts in the Russian Federation.' These provisions, the authors say, disproportionately restrict the free expression of one’s religion or belief and 'should be amended to align fully with international human rights law.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-plummet-in-ukraine-russian-occupied-territories/7921152.html	2025-01-01T09:43:45-08:00	
Harry Chandler, Navy medic who survived Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor, dies at 103	HONOLULU — Harry Chandler, a Navy medic who helped pull injured sailors from the oily waters of Pearl Harbor after the 1941 Japanese attack on the naval base, has died. He was 103. Chandler died Monday at a senior living center in Tequesta, Florida, according to Ron Mahaffee, the husband of his granddaughter Kelli Fahey. Chandler had congestive heart failure, but Mahaffee said doctors and nurses noted his advanced age when giving a cause of death. The third Pearl Harbor survivor to die in the past few weeks, Chandler was a hospital corpsman 3rd class on Dec. 7, 1941, when waves of Japanese fighter planes dropped bombs and fired machine guns on battleships in the harbor and plunged the U.S. into World War II. He told The Associated Press in 2023 that he saw the planes approach as he was raising the flag that morning at a mobile hospital in Aiea Heights, which is in the hills overlooking the base. 'I thought they were planes coming in from the states until I saw the bombs dropping,' Chandler said. His first instinct was to take cover and 'get the hell out of here.' 'I was afraid that they’d start strafing,' he said. His unit rode trucks down to attend to the injured. He said in a Pacific Historic Parks oral history interview that he boarded a boat to help pluck wounded sailors from the water. The harbor was covered in oil from exploding ships, so Chandler washed the sailors off after lifting them out. He said he was too focused on his work to be afraid. 'It got so busy you weren't scared. Weren’t scared at all. We were busy. It was after you got scared,' Chandler said. He realized later that he could have been killed, 'But you didn’t think about that while you were busy taking care of people.' The attack killed more than 2,300 U.S. servicemen. Nearly half, or 1,177, were sailors and Marines on board the USS Arizona, which sank nine minutes after it was bombed. Chandler's memories came flowing back when he visited Pearl Harbor for a 2023 ceremony commemorating the 82nd anniversary of the bombing. 'I look out there, and I can still see what’s going on. I can still see what was happening,' Chandler told The Associated Press. Asked what he wanted Americans to know about Pearl Harbor, he said: 'Be prepared.' 'We should have known that was going to happen. The intelligence has to be better,' he said. After the war Chandler worked as a painter and wallpaper hanger and bought an upholstery business with his brother. He also joined the Navy reserves, retiring as a senior chief in 1981. Chandler was born in Holyoke, Massachusetts, and lived for most of his adult life in nearby South Hadley, Mahaffee said. In recent decades he split his time between Massachusetts and Florida. An avid golfer, he shot five hole-in-ones during his lifetime, his grandson-in-law added. Chandler had one biological daughter and adopted two daughters from his second marriage, to Anna Chandler, who died in 2004. He is survived by two daughters, nine grandchildren, 17 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren. Military historian J. Michael Wenger has estimated that there were some 87,000 military personnel on the island of Oahu on the day of the attack. With Chandler’s death, only 15 are still living, according to a tally maintained by Kathleen Farley, the California state chair of the Sons and Daughters of Pearl Harbor Survivors. Bob Fernandez, who served on the USS Curtiss, also died this month, at age 100, and Warren Upton, 105, who served on the USS Utah, died last week.	https://www.voanews.com/a/harry-chandler-navy-medic-who-survived-japan-s-attack-on-pearl-harbor-dies-at-103-/7921016.html	2025-01-01T08:51:33-08:00	
Trump says he plans to attend Jimmy Carter's funeral	PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said Tuesday that he's planning to attend the funeral of former President Jimmy Carter. Asked about it as he walked into a New Year's Eve party at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trump responded, 'I'll be there.' Pressed on whether he'd spoken to members of Carter's family, Trump said he'd rather not say. Funeral services honoring Carter, who died Sunday at 100, will be held in Georgia and Washington, beginning Jan. 4 and concluding Jan. 9. Trump was a frequent and fierce critic of Carter on the campaign trail ahead of November's election, using the rising inflation rates of the 1970s to unfavorably compare President Joe Biden to Carter and his administration. The president-elect was gracious about the former president, though, in posts on his social media site after Carter's death Sunday, writing that the nation 'owed him a debt of gratitude.' 'While I strongly disagreed with him philosophically and politically, I also realized that he truly loved and respected our Country, and all it stands for,' Trump wrote of Carter. 'He worked hard to make America a better place, and for that I give him my highest respect.' Wearing a tuxedo as he entered the festivities, Trump took a few minutes of questions from reporters on various topics. He was asked about the possibility of a ceasefire in Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza but said only, 'We’re going to see what happens.' Of hostages seized more than a year ago by Hamas, the president-elect said, 'I’ll put it this way: They better let the hostages come back soon.' Trump also said he thought 2025 would be a 'great year' and 'we’re going to do fantastically well as a country.' 'There’s a whole light over the whole world, not just our country. They’re a lot of happy people,' Trump said of recent weeks. Asked about his resolutions for the new year, Trump said, 'I just want everybody to be happy, healthy and well.' Trump later took the stage to briefly address the crowd ringing in the new year at Mar-a-Lago and promised 'to do a great job as your president.' Biden, for his part, spent New Year’s Eve celebrating the wedding of his niece Missy Owens in Greenville, Delaware, followed by the reception in Kennett Square, Pennsylvania. Biden and first lady Jill Biden cut short their traditional holiday trip to the U.S. Virgin Islands to attend the ceremony.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-he-is-planning-to-attend-jimmy-carter-s-funeral/7921035.html	2025-01-01T08:10:52-08:00

10 dead, 30 injured after car plows into crowd in New Orleans	NEW ORLEANS — Ten people were killed and 30 injured when a vehicle drove into a crowd on New Orleans' famed Canal and Bourbon Street in the first hours of New Year's Day, according to NOLA Ready, the city’s emergency preparedness agency. New Orleans police earlier said they were responding to a mass casualty incident, including fatalities. NOLA Ready advised people to stay away from the area. It said the injured had been taken to five local hospitals. The incident came toward the end of New Year’s celebrations in New Orleans and hours before the kickoff of the Allstate Sugar Bowl, a college football quarterfinal held in the city's Caesars Superdome, with thousands expected to be in attendance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-30-injured-after-car-plows-into-crowd-in-new-orleans/7920830.html	2025-01-01T04:33:39-08:00	
Deadly Israeli airstrikes hit northern, central Gaza	Palestinian officials said Wednesday that Israeli airstrikes in northern and central Gaza killed at least 15 people. One of the strikes hit a house in the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza, while another hit the Bureij refugee camp in the center of the Gaza Strip. Israel’s military did not immediate comment on the attacks, but earlier Wednesday, it warned people to evacuate the Bureij area, saying militants located there were firing rockets. Israel has repeatedly told people to move from parts of Gaza in what the military says are evacuations necessary for safely carrying out its war against Hamas militants. The United Nations and humanitarian organizations have criticized the Israeli tactic, saying the evacuation orders often give people little time to leave and that they do not have safe places to go in Gaza to escape the airstrikes and Israeli ground operations. The war in Gaza began with Hamas militants attacking southern Israel in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking about 250 people hostage. About 100 hostages are being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 45,500 Palestinians and injured more than 108,000, according to the health ministry in the enclave. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The war has leveled wide areas of Gaza and displaced 90% of its 2.3 million people. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror organization. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-israeli-airstrikes-hit-northern-central-gaza/7920772.html	2025-01-01T02:25:52-08:00	
Russian gas supplies through Ukraine end	Russian gas exports crossing through Ukraine were halted Wednesday with the expiration of a transit agreement. The development will force some European nations to find alternative sources of gas with the interruption of the decades-old route. Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine had already prompted many in the European Union to cut their dependence on Russian gas. 'We stopped the transit of Russian gas. This is a historic event. Russia is losing its markets, it will suffer financial losses. Europe has already made the decision to abandon Russian gas,' Ukraine's energy minister, German Galushchenko, said in a statement. Russian gas giant Gazprom said it lost the 'technical and legal right' to send its gas through Ukraine. Russia is still able to export gas to Turkey and central European nations such as Hungary and Serbia. Moldova’s government, meanwhile, has ordered sharp cuts in energy consumption to deal with its loss of Russian supply. The European Union played down the impact on its member states, saying, 'The European gas infrastructure is flexible enough to provide gas of non-Russian origin' to central and eastern Europe. Some information for this report was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-gas-supplies-through-ukraine-end/7920765.html	2025-01-01T02:00:39-08:00	
Russian drone attack injures 6 in Kyiv	Officials in Ukraine’s capital said Wednesday a Russian drone attack injured at least six people. Serhii Popko, head of Kyiv’s City Military Administration, said on Telegram that the attack damaged multiple buildings and a tram track. In Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said Russia attacked with artillery, rockets and drones, damaging seven houses and a medical center. Officials in the Cherkasy and Mykolaiv regions reported that Ukrainian air defenses shot down several Russian drones overnight. Russia’s defense ministry said Wednesday it destroyed a Ukrainian drone over the Kursk region. In neighboring Bryansk, the regional governor said Russian air defenses destroyed two drones, and that there were no casualties or damage. In a New Year's Eve address to his nation Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said his country would do everything it could in the new year to end the war with Russia. 'And every day in the coming year, I, and all of us, must fight for a Ukraine that is strong enough. Because only such a Ukraine is respected and heard, both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table,' Zelenskyy said. 'May 2025 be our year. The year of Ukraine. We know that peace will not be given to us as a gift, but we will do everything to stop Russia and end the war. This is what each of us wishes for,' he added. In 2024, Ukraine gave up seven times more ground than it did in 2023: about 4,000 square kilometers, mostly in the east, according to data from the Washington-based Institute for the Study of War. At the same time, Ukraine took several hundred square kilometers of Russian territory in Kursk. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022.

Celebrated South African contemporary dancer Dada Masilo dies at 39	JOHANNESBURG — The dance world mourned Tuesday the internationally acclaimed South African dancer and choreographer Dada Masilo, who died in the hospital over the weekend at age 39. Masilo died unexpectedly on Sunday after a brief illness, a spokesperson for her family said in a statement. Born in Soweto, she was described as a sprite-like, energetic dancer and a fearless rule-breaker, who brought African dance motifs to classic European roles in a career that spanned two decades. 'Deeply respectful of European and contemporary music traditions, but unafraid to go bare on stage and voice her own opinions, she effectively changed the shape and appearance of contemporary dance in South Africa,' family spokesperson Bridget van Oerle said in the statement, announcing her death. Among the most recent in a series of acknowledgements of her work, Masilo in September received the Positano Leonide Massine lifetime achievement award for classic and contemporary dance, which praised her as 'powerful and topical.' Her revisited versions of the great classics of romantic ballet drew on African dance to speak of the society in which she lived and of tolerance across borders, the award announcement said. 'A brilliant light has been extinguished,' the Joburg Ballet company said, praising Masilo's 'creative force as a choreographer and her wisdom as a human being.' 'Her groundbreaking work reshaped the world of contemporary dance, and her spirit will continue to inspire generations of artists and audiences,' the University of Johannesburg's arts and culture department said. The U.K.-based Dance Consortium, which toured with Masilo in Britain twice, called her death a 'tragic loss to the dance world.' 'Her fresh perspective, extraordinary presence and stunning creations wowed and inspired audiences and artists across the U.K. and around the world,' it said. 'Extraordinary role model' Masilo was best known for her iconic re-invention of the great ballet classics such as Swan Lake and Giselle, said Lliane Loots, artistic director at the JOMBA! dance center at the University of KwaZulu-Natal. She used her 'remarkable skill as a ballet dancer' to meld this European dance form 'with the rhythms and intentions of her own histories of African dance and of being South African,' Loots said. In 2016, Masilo's Swan Lake was nominated for a New York Bessie Award and the following year her Giselle won Best Performance by the Italian Danza and Danza Award, the family statement said. In 2018, she won the Netherlands’ Prince Claus Next Generation award, where she was described as an 'extraordinary role model for young people and girls.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/celebrated-south-african-contemporary-dancer-dada-masilo-dies-at-39-/7920746.html	2025-01-01T00:20:40-08:00	
Taiwan's president says Beijing remains the obstacle for resuming cross-strait exchanges	Taiwan’s President Lai Ching-te reiterated his administration’s willingness to welcome equal and dignified exchanges with China but said Beijing remains the obstacle for both sides to resume regular exchanges. 'Taiwan hopes to have healthy and orderly exchanges with China under the principle of reciprocal dignity, and [Beijing] can cooperate with Taiwan openly and generously,' Lai said during his first New Year address since becoming president in May 2024. He added that China’s attempt to weaken Taiwan’s democracy would only be 'counterproductive' to conducting cross-strait exchanges and earning Taiwanese people’s trust. Lai said Beijing is blocking civil society exchanges across the Taiwan Strait by restricting Chinese tourists from visiting the island or preventing Chinese students from studying in Taiwan. 'From this, we can see that the real obstacle to cross-strait exchanges is China, not Taiwan,' he told journalists gathering at the presidential office in Taipei. Apart from addressing cross-strait dynamics, Lai warned about the threat that authoritarian countries such as China, Russia, Iran, and North Korea pose to the rules-based international order. 'Authoritarian regimes continue to cooperate and threaten the rule-based international order, seriously affecting peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific and around the globe,' he said, adding that peace and stability across the Taiwan Strait is a 'necessary element' for global security and prosperity. 'Taiwan must be prepared for danger even in times of peace, continue to enhance its defense budget, strengthen its defense capabilities, and showcase the determination to defend itself,' Lai added. Lai’s speech comes as China continues to increase military pressure against Taiwan. Since he took office last May, China has conducted two blockade-style military exercises around Taiwan and increased the frequency of deploying military aircraft and naval vessels to waters and airspaces near the island. China views Taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly vowed to reunify with the island, through force if necessary. During his New Year address on Tuesday, Chinese President Xi Jinping reiterated the message that Beijing’s efforts to reunify with Taipei cannot be stopped. 'No one can ever sever the bond of kinship between us, and no one can ever stop China's reunification, a trend of the times,' Xi said in his 10-minute televised address. Analysts say Lai is trying to create 'a new narrative' about relations between Taiwan and China by highlighting the collective threat that authoritarian countries pose to democracies around the world. 'He is grouping China with other authoritarian regimes and portraying China as a threat to the democratic world, in which Taiwan is a member,' said Zhiqun Zhu, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at Bucknell University in Pennsylvania. 'This new narrative not only aims to highlight and promote Taiwan's separate identity from China but is also geared towards winning international support for Taiwan's de facto independence,' he told VOA in a written response. During his roughly 20-minute speech, the Taiwanese president said the island will continue to defend democracy and its democratic way of life under his leadership. 'Regardless of the threats and challenges to Taiwan, democracy is the only way for us and there is no turning back,' Lai said. 'The safer Taiwan is, the safer the world will be, and the stronger Taiwan is; the stronger the world's democratic defenses will be,' he added. Zhu said Lai’s rhetoric is unlikely to soften Beijing’s pressure and intimidation against Taiwan in 2025. 'He highlighted the importance of strengthening Taiwan’s ability to deter Beijing’s invasion, combating information and cognitive warfare, raising Taiwan’s defense budget, and boosting its military power,' he told VOA. 'This is not music to Beijing’s ears and Beijing’s view that Lai is a diehard separatist is unlikely to change, which means that official contacts between the two sides are unlikely to resume in the near future,' Zhu added. Focus on economic diplomacy in 2025 To highlight Taiwan’s efforts to deepen engagement with like-minded democracies, Lai said Taiwan has redirected investments to democratic countries, including Japan and the United States, in recent years. 'Taiwan's investment in the U.S., Japan, and Europe has risen sharply, significantly surpassing that in China,' he said, adding that the trend shows Taipei’s efforts reduce reliance on a single market. Additionally, Lai said Taiwan will utilize its advantages in the semiconductor and AI sector to strengthen the resilience of the 'democratic supply chain' with democracies around the world. Taiwan needs to 'master advanced technologies and promote diversified development so that Taiwan can continue to lead the advancement of the global democratic supply chain and also ensure the security and stability of the global democratic supply chain,' he added. Experts say these signals show that Taiwan will focus on deepening relations with other democratic countries through economic diplomacy in 2025. 'From his speech, we can see the core of Taiwan’s economic diplomacy is democracy, and based on this principle, Taiwan can use its strength in advanced technologies to deepen relations with like-minded countries,' Hung Chin-fu, a political science professor at National Cheng Kung University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. Hung said as China struggles to boost its sluggish economy and Lai continues to portray Taiwan as part of the democratic world, relations between Beijing and Taipei are not likely to improve in 2025. 'China’s military intimidation against Taiwan will likely continue in 2025 because Beijing needs to use it as a distraction from the ongoing economic downturn the country is experiencing,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-president-says-beijing-remains-the-obstacle-for-resuming-cross-strait-exchanges/7920716.html	2024-12-31T21:40:18-08:00

Tigray leader says region losing gold without benefit	Ethiopia’s prime minister recently touted the country’s mining resources and said the industry could achieve a historic milestone by generating up to $2 billion in gold revenue this year. He made the comment while inaugurating a gold exploration and mining factory in the Gambella Region. On Dec. 10, Abiy Ahmed reported that Ethiopia’s economy is 'one of the fastest-growing economies in Africa and a beacon of opportunity on the continent.' 'Among its many thriving sectors, the gold mining industry stands out as a significant driver of growth, presenting immense potential for both local and international investment,' he said on social media. But officials in Tigray, one of the richest gold mining regions in Ethiopia, say they are losing resources without benefit for their region at a time when Tigray is trying to recover from two years of brutal war between local rebels and the federal government. The interim president of Tigray, Getachew Reda, speaking on Nov 15 said during the three and half months prior (August, September and October) '28.25 quintals of Gold entered into the Federal Government.' 'The government has not received a single penny,' he said. Ethiopia’s Commercial Bank, through its branch in Shire Inda Selasse, the hub of the gold in Tigray, recently bought $132 million worth of gold in just three months, according to branch manager Tekie Giday. The Tigray region’s entire budget for this year is nearly $100 million. Officials in Tigray said the region is struggling with budget shortfalls as it attempts to bring back services discontinued or destroyed during the war. Environmental fears In addition to lack of economic benefits, officials in Tigray reported that gold mining has exposed some of the region’s residents to dangerous chemicals like mercury and cyanide, which are used for extracting gold. Residents living close to the mining fields say the chemicals have been harmful to humans and livestock, with reports of deformed skin on cows and degraded farmland, witnesses and officials said. Some residents in Tigray’s Northwest region have gone to the courts seeking justice, to get judges to act against goldminers, who they accuse of polluting the environment and causing ill health to their children. The president of the High Court of the Northwest, Judge Mengistu Teklay, told VOA that chemicals used by miners are becoming the source of health, security and stability concerns. 'Utilizations of natural resources must be governed by law and order. It shouldn’t benefit the few individuals,' Mengistu said. 'Those individuals who benefit from these resources should not be allowed to bring safety concerns, existential threats, and health concerns to the unbenefited public.' Cyanide and mercury have both been used during the mining process in Tigray, according to multiple interviews conducted by VOA’s Horn of Africa Service. The World Health Organization identifies mercury as one of the top 10 chemicals or chemical groups posing public health concerns. Alarmed by the use of the chemicals, Ethiopia’s Bureau of Innovation and Technology, a government body tasked with overseeing the country’s science and technological development, asked Tigrayan regional government institutions to take action to prevent unsafe use of the chemicals. Gizachew Weldetsadik Beyene is director of the Radiation and Nuclear Safety Department in Tigray’s Bureau of Innovation and Technology. He said a team from the bureau posing as traditional miners traveled to the mining areas and saw what he called a 'sad' situation. 'It is so scary,' Gizachew said, sharing a video of a cow affected by the chemicals, and pictures of women washing the soil using chemicals in search of gold without safety protocols and with their bare hands. 'We’ve seen the damage to animals, to the land, the soil, to people who use running water and suffer, with their skin damaged, the animals which are drinking that water and exposed to dangerous diseases,' Gizachew said. Action taken The Tigray region’s Cabinet this week called for a halt to goldmining. The announcement was made by the deputy president of Tigray’s interim administration, Lieutenant General Tsadkan Gebretinsae. He did not elaborate about when the suspension will start and how the measure will be implemented. Prior to that, the Tigray Communication Affairs Bureau said in a statement that action was taken against people who were using illegal dangerous chemicals to process gold in Tahtay Koraro district near a dam that is a source of potable water for the city of Shire Inda Selasse. No details were given about the actions and the type of chemicals used. A security source who requested anonymity as he is not authorized to speak to the media alleged that foreign companies are working with Ezana Mining Development, a local mining company. The head of Ezana company, Tesfatsion Desta, did not initially respond to VOA calls. After a VOA Tigrigna Service radio report aired, Ezana put out a statement saying it was not asked to comment on the story, which it called 'distorted.' In the statement, Ezana said it worked with foreign companies before the Tigray war. The statement continued that because of insecurity and instability, however, these companies did not come back after the war. The company said the gold factory located in Northwest Tigray’s Asgede district, in the Tabia Lemat area, is free from pollution, waste and environmental distraction. Without naming a specific country, Tigray President Getachew told the region’s diaspora community in a Zoom meeting that he believes more gold than reported is smuggled out of Ethiopia. Getachew said what is happening in Tigray is becoming 'a crime.' 'It is a very serious problem. It is not just robbery. People are losing their animals because of the dangerous chemical used by the miners. There are people who are known to participate in this network from top to bottom among government and security officials.' VOA’s repeated attempts to get comment from the Tigray Bureau of Land and Mining and the Mining Ministry, as well as the National Bank of Ethiopia, were unsuccessful.

Thousands in Serbia turn New Year’s celebration into anti-government protest	BELGRADE, SERBIA — Instead of the traditional boisterous street partying on New Year's Eve, tens of thousands of protesters led by university students gathered overnight in Belgrade and other Serbian cities to demand political reforms and justice in the Balkan country. The protesters have been actively demonstrating following the tragic collapse of a concrete canopy in the northern city of Novi Sad's central train station on Nov. 1, which resulted in 15 deaths. The tragedy has been attributed to corruption and substandard construction practices by the populist Serbian leadership, leading to a widespread public outcry and demands for accountability. Students from various Belgrade universities have organized the protest under the slogan 'There is No New Year — You Still Owe Us for the Old One.' The loud crowd, chanting 'We Want Justice,' went silent at 11:52 p.m. with 15 minutes to honor the victims of the Novi Sad tragedy. Many were holding banners with a red handprint, which has become a symbol of the antigovernment protests, telling the authorities that they have blood on their hands. Earlier, they marched past a state-sponsored concert where the crowd danced to folk music tunes. Police guarded the area where the concert was taking place and set up metal fences while directing the protesting crowd to other streets nearby to avoid contact between the two groups. The antigovernment protesters emphasized that, despite the festive season, their commitment to seeking justice remains unwavering. The student-led movement has garnered support from various societal groups, including professors, farmers and actors, reflecting broader discontent with autocratic President Aleksandar Vucic's leadership. Thousands of people also gathered in Novi Sad and the southern city of Nis for parallel gatherings also led by university students in those cities. In Belgrade, state-sponsored concerts and other New Year’s celebrations were organized in the city center and in a newly built high-rise Belgrade Waterfront neighborhood, which Vucic has claimed is his own project together with the United Arab Emirates investors. Belgrade has become a favorite partying destination for tourists on New Year's Eve, with street partying and huge fireworks. The crowds in Belgrade braved very cold weather and fog to join the students. The New Year's Eve protest comes just more than a week after tens of thousands rallied together with the students in what was one of the biggest gatherings in recent years in the Serbian capital. Serbia's public prosecutor on Monday indicted 13 people, including a former minister, over the collapse of the concrete canopy. The protesters say that is not enough as the indictment does not include charges of possible corrupt deals during a renovation of the Novi Sad train station that was part of a wider deal with Chinese companies. Vucic earlier told pro-government Prva TV that all student demands have been fulfilled.

US chief justice warns of 'dangerous' calls to disregard court rulings	U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts on Tuesday warned about a rising number of threats to the judiciary's independence, including calls for violence against judges and suggestions by elected officials to disregard court rulings they disagree with. Roberts in an annual year-end report on the judiciary released just weeks before Republican President-elect Donald Trump takes office did not directly address what polling suggests has been a decline in public confidence in the judicial system broadly. But Roberts said he felt compelled to highlight several areas of 'illegitimate activity' that went far beyond informed criticism and debate concerning judicial rulings, which he said, 'threaten the independence of judges on which the rule of law depends.' Those areas of threats, he said, include a significant uptick in violent threats and online intimidation directed at judges, disinformation about court cases magnified by social media, and cyberthreats posed by foreign state actors. In the past five years, the U.S. Marshals Service has investigated more than 1,000 serious threats against federal judges, Roberts wrote. In some extreme cases, judicial officers have been issued bulletproof vests, he said. He cited the risks of hackers stealing confidential information and of hostile foreign state actors spreading disinformation online, including by using bots to distort judicial decisions and 'foment discord within our democracy.' Roberts also highlighted what he said were instances in the past few years in which 'elected officials from across the political spectrum have raised the specter of open disregard for federal court rulings.' 'These dangerous suggestions, however sporadic, must be soundly rejected,' Roberts wrote. Roberts, a member of the court's 6-3 conservative majority, did not specify what cases he was referring to, nor did he reference recent Supreme Court rulings that have set off political firestorms. Those include its 2022 decision rolling back abortion rights or its July ruling granting Trump substantial immunity for actions taken in office in the now-dismissed 2020 election subversion criminal case he faced. The abortion ruling prompted protests outside of several justices' homes, and an armed man was charged in 2022 with attempting to assassinate conservative Justice Brett Kavanaugh after being arrested near his home. Roberts' report also did not discuss recent ethics controversies concerning gifts and travel received by members of the Supreme Court that have prompted investigations by Democratic lawmakers and calls for reforms. Roberts acknowledged court rulings can 'provoke strong and passionate reactions' and said criticism was not a threat, and that 'public engagement with the work of the courts results in a better-informed polity and a more robust democracy.' But he said public officials 'regrettably have engaged in recent attempts to intimidate judges — for example, suggesting political bias in the judge's adverse rulings without a credible basis for such allegations.' 'Public officials certainly have a right to criticize the work of the judiciary, but they should be mindful that intemperance in their statements when it comes to judges may prompt dangerous reactions by others,' he wrote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-chief-justice-warns-of-dangerous-calls-to-disregard-court-rulings/7920680.html	2024-12-31T18:43:30-08:00	
US Capitol riot fugitive seeks asylum in Canada	OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA — An American man who fled after being sentenced to prison for his role in the U.S. Capitol riot is now seeking political asylum in Canada, as he waits and hopes for a pardon when Donald Trump returns to the White House. Antony Vo, 32, was sentenced to nine months behind bars and ordered to report to a federal prison on June 14, 2024, but instead he fled to Canada. More than 1,500 people have been charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, assault on Congress, which sought to disrupt certification of President Joe Biden's election victory. Vo, from Indiana, was convicted at a jury trial in Washington of four counts of entering a restricted building and disorderly conduct related to his actions. 'I knew Canada has a history of being welcoming to refugees, from Vietnam War draft dodgers to the people who hid Edward Snowden in Hong Kong,' he told AFP. 'So I packed up my snowboarding gear and drove across the border.' In refugee claim documents, Vo said the riot was 'a peaceful protest' that was 'subverted as part of a domestic regime-change operation to politically assassinate Trump and his supporters.' He added that he was 'persecuted, maltreated,' and subjected to an 'unfair trial' over his political beliefs, and if sent back to the United States would be jailed 'under inhumane conditions.' The assault on the Capitol followed a fiery speech by then-president Trump to tens of thousands of his supporters near the White House, in which he repeated his false claims that he won the 2020 vote. More than 140 police officers were injured during hours of clashes with rioters wielding flagpoles, baseball bats, hockey sticks and other makeshift weapons along with Tasers and canisters of bear spray. Vo insisted that he saw no violence. Images on social media showed Vo and his mother, Annie -- who fled Vietnam in 1991 and was granted asylum in the United States -- smiling inside the Capitol that day. She was arrested in March and is awaiting trial. Vo said he hopes to stay in Canada 'until the situation is safe for me to return' to the United States. 'When Donald Trump takes office, I hope he pardons me and the rest of the January 6 protesters.' Trump has called the rioters patriots and political prisoners and told a CNN town hall that he was 'inclined to pardon many of them.' Several Capitol riot defendants have seized upon Trump's election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris to ask that their trials or sentencing be put on hold. Trump himself, who takes office again in January, was charged with conspiring to overturn the results of the 2020 election. But the case never made it to trial and is now being wound down under the Justice Department's policy of not prosecuting a sitting president. Vo said that he had also tried to seek asylum in Argentina, Mexico, El Salvador, Vietnam, Belarus, and Russia. 'I seriously explored getting paramotoring lessons and then paramotoring from Key West to Cuba to seek asylum there too,' he said in his claim. Vo said that in Canada, 'people have really taken good care of me.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-capitol-riot-fugitive-seeks-asylum-in-canada/7920659.html	2024-12-31T17:20:17-08:00

Ivory Coast asks French troops to leave, latest African country to do so	ABIDJAN, IVORY COAST — Ivory Coast announced on Tuesday that French troops will leave the country after a decadeslong military presence. It is the latest African nation to downscale military ties with its former colonial power. Ivorian President Alassane Ouattara said the pullout would begin in January. France has had as many as 600 troops in Ivory Coast. 'We have decided on the concerted and organized withdrawal of French forces in Ivory Coast,' he said, adding that the military infantry battalion of Port Bouet that is run by the French army will be handed over to Ivorian troops. Outtara's announcement follows that of other leaders across West Africa, where France's military is being asked to leave. Analysts have described the moves as part of the wider structural transformation in the region's engagement with Paris. Several West African nations — including coup-hit Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger — have recently asked the French to leave. Most recently, Senegal and Chad did the same. Chad is considered France's most stable and loyal partner in Africa. The downscaling of military ties comes as France has been making efforts to revive its waning political and military influence on the continent by devising a new military strategy that would sharply reduce its permanent troop presence in Africa. France has now been kicked out of more than 70% of African countries where it had a troop presence since ending its colonial rule. The French remain only in Djibouti, with 1,500 soldiers, and Gabon, with 350 troops. After expelling French troops, military leaders of Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso have moved closer to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel who have been accused of abuses against civilians. The security situation has worsened in those countries, with increasing numbers of extremist attacks and civilian deaths from armed groups and government forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ivory-coast-asks-french-troops-to-leave-latest-african-country-to-do-so/7920403.html	2024-12-31T15:37:31-08:00	
Romania, Bulgaria join borderless Schengen zone	BUCHAREST, ROMANIA — Romania and Bulgaria became full members of the Schengen zone on Wednesday, expanding the borderless area to 29 members and ending a 13-year wait for the two eastern European countries. The expansion, made possible when Austria and other members dropped their objections to the former communist countries joining, officially took place at midnight on Wednesday, marked by ceremonies at various border posts. Romania and Bulgaria, both members of the European Union since 2007, were partially included in the Schengen zone in March, eliminating border checks at ports and airports. But Austria had threatened to veto their full entry over migration concerns, which meant that controls still applied at land border crossings. Vienna backed off its veto threat in December after the three countries reached a deal on a 'border protection package,' clearing the way for Romania and Bulgaria, two of the EU's poorest countries, to join Schengen. Overlap with EU but not identical Created in 1985, the zone will now include 25 of the EU's 27 members, as well as Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, covering a total population of more than 400 million people. Romania and Bulgaria had met the Schengen zone's technical requirements for membership since 2011. But 'member states objected every time' they tried to join, analyst Valentin Naumescu told Agence France-Presse. That became 'a source of frustration exploited by anti-EU parties, which alleged Romania was being treated unfairly,' he said. The resentment came into play in Romania's recent presidential elections, in which far-right candidate Calin Georgescu surged to a surprise first-round win, before the polls were canceled amid claims of Russian interference. Now, 'that feeling of being second-class citizens' should fade, Naumescu said. Nations came to an agreement Leaders on both sides hailed the expansion as 'historic.' Austria had for years complained about hosting a disproportionate number of undocumented migrants as a result of poorly protected external Schengen borders. It dropped its objections to Romania (population 19 million) and Bulgaria (6.5 million) joining Schengen after the three countries signed a border protection agreement in November. The deal provides for the joint deployment of guards to the Bulgarian-Turkish border and temporary controls at land crossings for an initial period of six months. Joining the zone will boost Romania's and Bulgaria's gross domestic product by at least one percentage point, analysts estimate. Truck drivers celebrate the change Lorry drivers, who currently wait up to 20 hours at border crossings, celebrated the news. 'It was a pure waste of time for drivers, who couldn't even stop to rest because they had to move their vehicles every 10 minutes,' said Beniamin Lucescu, head of a Romanian transport federation. Poor road and railroad infrastructure in Bulgaria could limit the positive impact there. The countries' tourism sectors are meanwhile expecting a surge in visitors from the two countries to nearby Greece. 'It's excellent news,' said 46-year-old sales manager Ivailo Kirkov, who owns a house in northern Greece. 'We'd been waiting impatiently.' Greek teacher and tour guide Gueorgui Grantcharov predicted a rush of Romanian and Bulgarian tourists to Greece. With no queues at the border, 'it takes just over four hours to get from Sofia to Thessaloniki,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romania-bulgaria-join-borderless-schengen-zone/7920398.html	2024-12-31T15:24:20-08:00

Kenyan president acknowledges police abuses at protests	NAIROBI, KENYA — Kenyan President William Ruto on Tuesday acknowledged abuses by Kenya's security forces, in the wake of demonstrations against a recent wave of alleged kidnappings that have sparked outrage in the country. Security forces in the East African nation have been accused of carrying out dozens of illegal detentions since youth-led anti-government demonstrations in June and July were harshly repressed. And on Monday, police forcibly detained dozens of protesters and fired tear gas into small peaceful rallies calling for the release of those who had disappeared. 'It cannot be denied that there have been instances of excessive and extrajudicial actions by members of the security services,' Ruto said in his new year's address, without specifying what those actions may have been. 'That said, it is crucial to remember that every freedom has its limits, and that public safety and order must always supersede the desire for unchecked liberty,' he said. Last week, the embattled president had promised to 'stop the abductions,' a vow taken by human rights activists as an admission of guilt. But he also urged parents to take responsibility for their children. The latest disappearances have by and large involved young people who have criticized Ruto online. Two of them had published an image generated using artificial intelligence of the head of state lying in a coffin. 'These are clear signals that our moral fabric is at risk of decay, exacerbated by various factors, including the manipulation of digital technology, particularly social media, to amplify anti-social behavior and erode moral values,' Ruto said in his end-of-year address. A Nairobi court on Monday ruled that the security forces should 'immediately and unconditionally' free five men who were reportedly abducted. Judge Bahati Mwamuye ordered the police to present the five in court on Tuesday or 'explain under oath the circumstances of the matter' or their whereabouts. None of the missing were present in court, where a tearful father asked where his son was. The police inspector general, who was also summoned, sent a representative in his stead. While police have denied involvement in the disappearances, activists have questioned why they do not appear to be investigating them. Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch said its research pointed toward a unit drawn from multiple security agencies. Last week, the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights said it counted seven cases of abductions reported this month. Six of those who disappeared are still missing. In all, 29 of the 82 people reported to have disappeared since June remain unaccounted for, according to the human rights commission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-president-acknowledges-police-abuses-at-protests/7920354.html	2024-12-31T14:15:25-08:00

US oil production rose to record high in October, data show	NEW YORK — U.S. oil production rose 260,000 barrels per day month-over-month to a record 13.46 million bpd in October as demand surged to the highest levels since the pandemic, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed on Tuesday. U.S. oil output has grown rapidly this year as drilling operations became more efficient, even as concerns of oversupply have weighed heavily on prices for the commodity amid weaker-than-expected demand growth, especially in China, the top oil-importing nation. Year-over-year, U.S. oil production rose 2.3% in October, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures prices CLc1 averaged 16% lower during the month, according to Reuters calculations. Still, the pace of growth of U.S. oil output is moderating, analysts said. Annual oil production growth in the U.S. is tracking around 300,000 to 400,000 bpd in 2024, versus nearly a million bpd in 2023, said Alex Hodes, energy analyst at brokerage StoneX. 'There have been a few infrastructure constraints that have kept production somewhat muted, but I would expect that we will see a lot of the same in 2025,' Hodes said. Strong U.S. oil demand in October was the biggest surprise in the EIA's Petroleum Supply Monthly report, UBS analyst Giovanni Staunovo said. Total U.S. oil demand rose by about 700,000 bpd from September to 21.01 million bpd in October, the highest since August 2019, EIA data showed. Demand for distillate fuels, which include diesel and heating oil, rose to 4.06 million bpd in October, the highest in a year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-oil-production-rose-to-record-high-in-october-data-shows/7920350.html	2024-12-31T14:02:31-08:00	
Wind, rain, threat of floods play spoiler for UK New Year's festivities	LONDON — Revelers in the United Kingdom may have to wring themselves out as they ring in the New Year. A storm system bringing high winds, heavy rain, the possibility of snow and the threat of flooding washed out plans Tuesday for several fireworks displays — in some cases more than 24 hours before the stroke of midnight. Edinburgh's famous Hogmanay street party, garden concert and pyrotechnics show from the city's famous castle were snuffed out before festivities got under way Monday. 'We feel like we are stranded,' said Neeraj Krishnan, who planned a trip from London around the fireworks. 'We don't really know what to do for New Year.' The Met Office forecast gusts up to 96 kilometers per hour (60 mph) across England and Wales on New Year's Day, with gusts up to 120 kmh (75 mph) on hilltops and coastal areas. 'It will be a tricky couple of days and a wet and windy spell for many up into the new year,' said Met Office meteorologist Craig Snell. Heavy rain and strong winds lashed parts of Scotland and the north of England, disrupting some journeys by train and car and playing spoiler to many public celebrations. Fireworks in Blackpool in the northwest of England, and Newcastle's Quayside, and Ripon in North Yorkshire, both in the northeast, and at the Sandown Carnival on the Isle of Wight off the south coast were canceled or postponed because of weather. 'Safety always comes first, and the forecast has made it clear that continuing would pose risks to those attending, as well as our event teams,' the Newcastle City Council said. People were urged to stay away from the coast in Scarborough in northeast England, as a combination of winds and a high tide were expected to pound the shore with large waves. Organizers of London events were keeping a close eye on winds as they prepared to welcome 2025 with a blitz of fireworks along the River Thames and a parade Wednesday afternoon through the center of the city featuring 75 acts and 10,000 performers. The fireworks were planned to be launched against the backdrop of the London Eye, the massive Ferris wheel across the river from Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Darryl Fleming, the fireworks display director for London, told Sky News that the direction of the wind forecast was unlikely to disrupt the display. Among events canceled Wednesday were an annual bathtub boat race in Poole, Dorset, on the south coast and a dip in the sea in Lyme Regis in the southwest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wind-rain-threat-of-floods-play-spoiler-for-uk-new-year-s-festivities/7920344.html	2024-12-31T13:58:32-08:00	
Georgians ring in New Year with mass pro-EU rally	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Tens of thousands of pro-Europe demonstrators rallied outside Georgia's parliament Tuesday night to celebrate the New Year, continuing month-long protests against the government. The Black Sea nation has been in the grip of an unprecedented constitutional crisis since the ruling Georgian Dream Party — widely perceived as increasingly repressive — claimed victory in October's parliamentary polls, which the pro-Western opposition denounced as rigged. The government's Nov. 28 decision to suspend EU accession talks for years triggered daily mass protests that continue to this day. On New Year's Eve, tens of thousands gathered outside parliament in central Tbilisi waving EU and Georgian flags — the latest outpouring of popular unity in the face of what critics say is the government's authoritarian pro-Russian tilt. Many demonstrators brought food to share and set up a festive table spanning dozens of meters on Tbilisi's main avenue decorated with Christmas lights, transforming the 34th consecutive day of protests into a New Year celebration. 'Tonight once again proves that the Georgian people will not allow a pro-Russian government to turn our country into a Russian-style despotism,' said one demonstrator, 42-year-old Ilia Darsavelidze. '[Russian President Vladimir] Putin's puppets in Tbilisi are powerless against the will of our entire nation. We will reclaim our rightful place in Europe.' Georgia's outgoing President Salome Zurabishvili — at loggerheads with the ruling party — joined the demonstrators. '2024 was the year of our unity, and 2025 will be the year of our victory,' she told the crowd. Zurabishvili's mandate was meant to end on Dec. 29, when her successor and Georgian Dream loyalist Mikheil Kavelashvili was inaugurated as Georgia's next figurehead president, following a controversial election process. But Zurabishvili refused to step down, saying she remains the country's 'only legitimate leader' until October's election is rerun. She has earlier declared the new parliament and government 'illegitimate,' while opposition parties have refused to enter the new legislature. In the first 10 days of protests, riot police used tear gas and water cannons to disperse demonstrators — some of whom threw fireworks and stones. The Interior Ministry reported more than 400 arrests, while the country's top human rights official, ombudsman Levan Ioseliani, and Amnesty International have accused security forces of 'torturing' those detained. The reported police brutality has drawn growing international condemnation, with Washington and several European countries sanctioning Georgian Dream officials. The foreign ministers of Germany, France and Poland said on Tuesday that Georgian authorities should consider fresh elections as a way out of the country's political crisis. The Georgian Dream Party's government faces accusations of an authoritarian, pro-Russian shift that has undermined Georgia's EU bid, a goal enshrined in the constitution and supported by 80% of the population.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgians-ring-in-new-year-with-mass-pro-eu-rally/7920347.html	2024-12-31T13:56:10-08:00	
Ecuador AG confirms bodies are missing boys as military personnel held	GUAYAQUIL, ECUADOR — Four bodies discovered last week are a group of boys reported missing at the start of the month, Ecuador's attorney general's office said on Tuesday, as a judge ordered detention for 16 military personnel while their alleged role in the disappearance is investigated. The boys, ages 11 to 15, went missing on Dec. 8 from the Las Malvinas neighborhood in the coastal city of Guayaquil. Their families have said they went out to play football. The case has sparked outrage throughout Ecuador, with protesters in the capital Quito and elsewhere demanding answers about what happened to the children. President Daniel Noboa's government has deployed members of the military to patrol streets and assist law enforcement efforts amid a crackdown on crime, which has battered the country over the past several years. Commanders of Ecuador's armed forces said last week the children were detained while allegedly committing a robbery and subsequently taken to a military base before being released. Genetic testing confirmed the identity of the four bodies, found on Dec. 24 in the town of Taura, the attorney general's office said on social media. The confirmation came just after a judge in Guayaquil ordered 16 members of the air force to be detained while prosecutors investigate their alleged participation. The lawyer for the military personnel said he will appeal the ruling. 'Let them go directly to jail where they belong. We want them to be detained [in jail], not in a military base,' said Antonio Arroyo, an uncle of two of the missing boys, after the hearing. Protesters gathered outside the court in support of the children's families. Neither the defense ministry nor Noboa's office have commented on the identifications or the judge's ruling. Both have previously expressed support for the families and the investigation, with Noboa proposing the boys be declared national heroes. The investigation will last 90 days, the attorney general's office said. The personnel under investigation were placed in military custody last week and could face disciplinary action for the way they detained the minors. The youths were apprehended in an 'unforeseen' manner by a patrol that had carried out an operation to support customs officials nearby, air force commander general Celiano Cevallos said on Monday. No official report of the arrests or the alleged robbery was made and the location where the boys were allegedly released is unknown, according to lawyers representing the children's families.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-ag-confirms-bodies-are-missing-boys-as-military-personnel-held-/7920336.html	2024-12-31T13:31:40-08:00	
Macron acknowledges error on early elections in New Year's speech	PARIS — In a rare moment of contrition, French President Emmanuel Macron said on Tuesday he recognized that his decision to call early parliamentary elections in June had created more political instability in the country. The speech caps a tumultuous 2024 for Macron, who shocked the nation halfway through the year by calling early elections, a gamble that backfired when voters delivered a hung parliament with a big increase in far-right lawmakers, diluting Macron's power. 'Lucidity and humility force [me] to recognize that at this stage, this decision has produced more instability than peace, and I fully own up to that,' Macron said in a televised address ahead of New Year's celebrations. 'The dissolution caused more divisions in the Assembly than solutions for the French people,' he said in the clearest mea culpa since the elections. Macron had justified his decision to call early elections in the wake of a bad score at European elections by the need to 'clarify' the political situation. But he lost his workable majority and took two months to name a minority government, which eventually collapsed in December, the first time that happened in France since 1962. As a result, France failed to approve a budget for 2025 before the end-of-year deadline, and Macron had to name his fourth prime minister this year, centrist veteran Francois Bayrou, in December. Choices to make Macron also opened the door to use referendums this year without using the word, saying he would ask the French to decide on 'decisive' issues, without elaborating which ones. 'I want us to act with 2050 in our sights. We will have choices to make for our economy, our democracy, our security, our children,' he said. The French constitution grants powers to the president to initiate referendums. Macron has also used 'citizen conventions' — gatherings of randomly picked citizens without any binding power — in the past to quell revolts such as the yellow vest rebellion on certain issues. On international issues, in which he retains wide diplomatic and military powers, Macron said the European Union should stop being 'naive' when it comes to international trade, as the bloc faces threats of tariffs by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. 'We must say no to trade rules enacted by others and that we are the only ones to still comply with. Say no to everything that makes us more dependent on others without trade-offs and without preparing [for] the future,' he said. He also mentioned the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, and election manipulation in Georgia, Romania and Moldova, as proof that Europe should not take its security for granted. 'That's why Europe should stop delegating its security and defense to other powers,' he said, urging EU partners, who often rely on the U.S. security umbrella, to do more for their own defense.	https://www.voanews.com/a/macron-acknowledges-error-on-early-elections-in-new-year-s-speech/7920332.html	2024-12-31T13:24:03-08:00	
Pentagon chief loses bid to reject 9/11 plea deals	WASHINGTON — A military appeals court has ruled against Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's effort to throw out the plea deals reached for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two other defendants in the 9/11 attacks, a U.S. official said. The decision puts back on track the agreements that would have the three men plead guilty to one of the deadliest attacks on the United States in exchange for being spared the possibility of the death penalty. The attacks by al-Qaida killed nearly 3,000 people on Sept. 11, 2001, and helped spur U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq in what the George W. Bush administration called its war on terror. The military appeals court released its ruling Monday night, according to the U.S. official, who was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Military prosecutors and defense attorneys for Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the attacks, and two co-defendants reached the plea agreements after two years of government-approved negotiations. The deals were announced late last summer. Supporters of the plea agreements see them as a way of resolving the legally troubled case against the men at the U.S. military commission at Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba. Pretrial hearings for Mohammed, Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al-Hawsawi have been underway for more than a decade. Much of the focus of pretrial arguments has been on how torture of the men while in CIA custody in the first years after their detention may taint the overall evidence in the case. Within days of news of the plea deal this summer, Austin issued a brief order saying he was nullifying them. He cited the gravity of the 9/11 attacks in saying that as defense secretary, he should decide on any plea agreements that would spare the defendants the possibility of execution. Defense lawyers said Austin had no legal authority to reject a decision already approved by the Guantanamo court's top authority and said the move amounted to unlawful interference in the case. The military judge hearing the 9/11 case, Air Force Colonel Matthew McCall, had agreed that Austin lacked standing to throw out the plea bargains after they were underway. That had set up the Defense Department's appeal to the military appeals court. Austin now has the option of taking his effort to throw out the plea deals to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The Pentagon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Separately, the Pentagon said it had repatriated one of the longest-held detainees at the Guantanamo military prison, a Tunisian man who U.S. authorities approved for transfer more than a decade ago. Ridah bin Saleh al-Yazidi's return to Tunisia leaves 26 men at Guantanamo. That's down from a peak population of about 700 Muslim men detained abroad and brought to the prison in the years after the September 11 attacks. Al-Yazidi's repatriation leaves 14 men awaiting transfer to other countries after U.S. authorities waived any prosecution and cleared them as security risks. The Biden administration, pressed by rights groups to free remaining Guantanamo detainees held without charge, transferred out three other men this month. The U.S. says it is searching for suitable and stable countries willing to receive the remaining 14. In a statement, the U.S. military said it had worked with authorities in Tunisia for the 'responsible transfer' of al-Yazidi. He had been a prisoner at Guantanamo since 2002, when the U.S. began sending Muslim detainees taken abroad there. Al-Yazidi is the last of a dozen Tunisian men once held at Guantanamo. Of those remaining at Guantanamo, seven — including Mohammed and his 9/11 co-defendants — face active cases. Two others of the 26 total have been convicted and sentenced by the military commission.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pentagon-chief-loses-bid-to-reject-9-11-plea-deals-/7920328.html	2024-12-31T13:10:06-08:00	
Somali security forces fend off Islamic State attack in Puntland	Authorities in the Somali autonomous region of Puntland said eight foreign militants were killed following an attack by Islamic fighters on security forces early Tuesday. Residents said the attack started with a suicide bombing that targeted an area in Dharjale village in the far eastern highlands of Puntland, where security forces and officials were camped. In an audio statement posted on the Telegram channel of the region’s security forces, spokesperson for Puntland security operations Brigadier General Mohamud Mohamed Ahmed confirmed the attack. 'Puntland anti-terrorism forces in the Dharjale, Bari region were attacked by the bloodsucking Daesh terrorist group,' he said. 'The security forces have been following their movements, and they were ready. The bodies of eight foreigners and their weapons have been displayed.' Ahmed said Puntland security forces sustained 'limited casualties.' Residents reported additional casualties among civilians in the village from the shrapnel of the explosion. Photos purported to be of dead militants show severed heads, and burned and mutilated flesh, indicating the use of a massive explosive device. Puntland this month announced that preparations for an offensive against extremist groups in the region have been completed. The region’s leader, Said Abdullahi Deni, urged the public to support the operation, without disclosing when it may start. Witnesses and residents said that Puntland forces moved to the east of Puntland after the preparations concluded. Al-Shabab and Islamic State, or IS, have been operating in Puntland. The operation appears to be focusing on IS. Deni offered amnesty to militants who renounce violence and their membership in the terror groups. U.S. military officials and Somali security experts reported that IS in Somalia increased its membership numbers this year. IS numbers previously were reported to be between 100 and 400 fighters, but Somali security and intelligence experts estimate their current numbers to be 500 to 600 militants, a figure yet to be confirmed by local authorities. A majority of the newcomers are said to be from the Middle East and eastern and northern Africa. IS in Somalia was formed in October 2015 by a group of former al-Shabab fighters led by the cleric Sheikh Abdulkadir Mumin, who reportedly pledged allegiance to the late IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. Mumin appears to have survived a U.S. airstrike on May 31.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-security-forces-fend-off-islamic-state-attack-in-puntland/7920275.html	2024-12-31T12:13:44-08:00

Post-G20 Rio: Promises to address root causes of migration, global displacement	Washington — As G20 leaders convened in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in November, they set an ambitious goal to lift 600 million people out of poverty by 2030, highlighting the urgent need to address poverty and global health care — the root causes of migration and forced displacement. During the summit, experts said the world's 20 largest economies have the capacity to lessen the impact of the root causes through social policies and regional migration agreements. Experts like Paulo Illes, founder of the Center for Immigrant Human Rights and Citizenship, emphasized the importance of recognizing migration issues as legitimate. 'That must always be addressed from a human rights perspective,' Illes told VOA. 'Additionally, G20 leaders should acknowledge that migration also occurs due to structural issues such as poverty, environmental disasters, wars and conflicts.' Euclimar Fuentes, a Venezuelan migrant living in Sao Paulo, Brazil, is an example of how these issues converged. Born in Venezuela, Fuentes remembers a happy childhood there. 'We would go to the beach for breakfast as a family. Culturally, life was beautiful in Venezuela,' she told VOA. Her father’s retirement after years as a police officer gave the family a comfortable life. The situation in Venezuela deteriorated during the COVID-19 pandemic because of a combination of preexisting economic, political and social crises compounded by the global health emergency. 'It’s difficult when a family, a whole community, is left without food, electricity, energy or water. It’s hard to live in a country where you have nothing to eat,' Fuentes said. Her family’s challenges intensified when her son was diagnosed with leukemia in December 2020. 'We tried to treat him there, but it was hard,' she told VOA, adding that many children died in the same circumstances: no resources, no treatment, nothing to eat. 'We didn’t want him to be part of that system [and die],' she said. On December 26, 2020, Fuentes and her family left Venezuela. They considered different countries, including the United States, but because of her son’s illness and the path for humanitarian status, they chose Brazil, which according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees is home to about 61,000 Venezuelans. G20 declaration The G20’s official declaration highlighted the need to address the root causes of displacement, including hunger and poverty. The U.N. estimates that 2.4 billion people worldwide live in poverty, a crisis that has increased migration, Brazilian Development Minister Wellington Dias said. 'But beyond the migration issue,' Dias told VOA, 'Hunger and poverty are not just problems for those who are hungry or living in poverty. It’s a problem for the middle class, for the wealthy, for rich countries and for wealthy individuals.' The declaration included creating the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty, which aims to implement policies such as cash transfers to 500 million people, school meals for 150 million children, and health services for 200 million women and young children. Funding is expected to come from at least 40 nations, 13 global organizations and various nonprofits and foundations, managed through several financial institutions. 'It’s no longer just giving food baskets,' Dias said. 'We are talking about implementing a development plan that must address education, which is a key foundation for eradicating poverty, as well as health, the economy, job creation and infrastructure.' The U.N. noted that food insecurity, migration and displacement are intricately linked to climate change, natural disasters, conflicts and poverty — all major conversations at the G20 summit. The challenges faced during the COVID-19 pandemic further highlighted these connections, with health crises, economic hardship and displacement driving increased migration in the Western Hemisphere, Dias said. Steve Seide, a 22-year-old political science student from Haiti, also embodied the struggles faced by many migrants. He left his homeland in 2023 because of a lack of jobs and increasing security concerns. 'I chose Brazil because I heard of work opportunities and how welcoming Brazilian people are,' he told VOA. Seide’s journey to Brazil was dangerous and expensive. To reach his destination, he crossed without documentation into the Dominican Republic. 'The first time, I did not get in. But I went back to the border,' he said. After spending a month in the Dominican Republic, he eventually secured a humanitarian visa and is on a path to a stable life in Brazil. 'In life, you can’t stop. If you need to get somewhere, you have to fight until the end,' he said. Future response efforts The global response to the pandemic also took center stage at the G20 summit, where the United States spearheaded efforts to secure new contributions toward a $2 billion pandemic fund, pledging up to $667 million by 2026. The goal is to help developing countries prepare for and respond to future pandemics. However, U.S. participation in this initiative is subject to congressional approval. Member countries also agreed to establish 'a governance mechanism that integrates the key players in the global health security and financing ecosystem, with the World Health Organization at the center.' As G20 leaders sought to address the interconnected challenges of migration, poverty and global health, stories like those of Fuentes and Seide underscored the importance of international cooperation and sustainable solutions. 'When you have your home, your piece of land, your family, you don’t think about leaving,' Fuentes said, adding that being separated from her loved ones is still 'very hard.' 'It’s been three years, but it’s still hard. Leaving everything behind, not knowing when you’ll see your loved ones again — it’s a pain that doesn’t go away. … Leaving was the hardest thing we’ve ever done. But sometimes, it’s the only choice you have to protect who you love,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/post-g20-rio-promises-to-address-root-causes-of-migration-global-displacement/7920243.html	2024-12-31T12:06:16-08:00	
Zimbabwe president signs death penalty abolition into law	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa — who has not signed death warrants for those facing capital sentences since he came to power in 2017 — signed the death penalty abolition bill into law Dec. 31, 2024, presidential spokesman George Charamba confirmed to VOA. 'Yes, the president had a personal role he played in moving matters in that direction, and this [is] arising from his own historical experience [as] a prisoner who had been condemned but only survived on the basis of age. But we want to situate this decision as a decision of parliament,' Charamba said. Mnangagwa survived a death sentence during the colonial era in the 1970s, as he was considered underage to face the gallows. Edwin Mushoriwa, an opposition member of parliament, introduced the death abolition bill. And parliament — which is dominated by the ruling ZANU-PF — accepted the idea. 'We are happy [with the] milestone we have actually reached,' Mushoriwa told VOA on Tuesday. 'The reason I had to bring that bill actually [has] to do with the fact that out of the 62 inmates today on the death row, the majority of them come from poor backgrounds. Secondly, [the] death penalty by nature is not part of our culture as Africans, as Zimbabweans. It’s a penalty that was brought during the colonial era. So, we just believe that [the] death penalty is not proper.' Several human rights groups have been calling for Zimbabwe to abolish the death penalty. Parvais Jabbar, executive director of the London-based NGO called the Death Penalty Project, said Zimbabwe has joined two-thirds of the world that no longer uses capital punishment as a lawful sanction. 'In fact, in the African Union alone, there have been a number of countries that have abolished a death penalty in recent years. So, there is clearly an African movement taking place in relation to this issue,' Jabbar said. 'I'm also encouraged by the government’s statements about respect for human rights in abolishing the death penalty, and I hope it will be taken and seen as an opportunity for further reforms in the area of human rights,' Jabbar added. 'This should not be seen as the end but the beginning of wider reforms. I also hope this will provide a stimulus for other countries in the region to also consider abolition — countries like Kenya, and others.' But not everyone is happy with the bill. Vincent Mazilankatha, an artisan miner, said deaths have risen in his area of trade since the bill was first discussed. 'If you just look at how people are killing each other, especially in the mining areas, that's when you see that [the] death penalty was supposed to remain in place. Because before, people were so afraid that if you kill, you're going to be hanged. So, I think it's not good at all,' Mazilankatha said. 'This act was supposed to be there and to remain in place as just [a] deterrent, because before talking about the abolition of [the] death penalty, people were not killing each other like what they are doing now,' he added. 'Imagine a person who has killed someone gets 20 years' imprisonment. And that person is 21 years [old]. When he comes out, [he’s] 41 years [old]. Then life goes on. It's not fair at all.' Amnesty International said Zimbabwe joins 24 countries across sub-Saharan Africa that have abolished the death penalty for all crimes, while two additional countries have abolished it for ordinary crimes only. Zimbabwe’s last-known execution was in 2005, though courts continued to impose death sentences for cases of murder committed under aggravating circumstances.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-president-signs-death-penalty-abolition-into-law/7920263.html	2024-12-31T12:01:54-08:00	
US strikes Houthi-controlled sites in Yemen amid rising regional tensions	The U.S. military said its forces carried out multiple precision strikes in Houthi-controlled territory in Yemen amid escalating tensions in the region. A statement Tuesday from the U.S. Central Command said the strikes hit Yemen’s capital, Sanaa, along with other Houthi-controlled coastal locations. The strikes were carried out by U.S. Navy ships on Monday and Tuesday and targeted a Houthi command and control facility along with sites that produced and stored weapons, including missiles and drones. The facilities targeted in the strikes were used in previous Houthi operations, 'such as attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the southern Red Sea and Gulf of Aden,' according to the U.S. statement. The U.S. Central Command said the strikes are 'a part of CENTCOM's effort to degrade Iran-backed Houthi efforts to threaten regional partners and military and merchant vessels in the region.' A Houthi spokesperson called the strikes 'a blatant violation of the sovereignty of an independent state and a blatant support for Israel.' The Houthis have conducted multiple missile attacks directed at Israel and have carried out more than a year of drone and missile attacks on vessels in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. The Houthis say their campaign is in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza. The United States has designated Hamas and the Houthis as terror groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-strikes-houthi-controlled-sites-in-yemen-amid-rising-regional-tensions/7920087.html	2024-12-31T10:01:16-08:00	
Israeli attacks push Gaza health care system near collapse, UN rights office says	GENEVA — Repeated Israeli attacks on Gaza’s hospitals and nearby operations have brought Gaza’s health care system to its knees, according to a report issued Monday by the U.N. human rights office. The 19-page report finds, 'Israel’s pattern of deadly attacks' on and near hospitals 'has led to the destruction of most hospitals in Gaza,' leading to sustained combat in and around many hospitals and 'pushing the health care system to the brink of total collapse.' 'The situation has deteriorated to a catastrophic level since October 2023, as this already damaged health system has been targeted, resulting in the killing of hundreds of health and medical professionals,' authors of the report assert. The report covers the period from Oct. 7, 2023 — when Hamas militants launched a terror attack on Israel, killing some 1,200 people and taking about 250 hostages — to June 30, 2024. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. During this period, the report documents at least 136 strikes on at least 27 hospitals and 12 other medical facilities, claiming many casualties among medical staff and civilians and causing significant damage, 'if not complete destruction of civilian infrastructure.' 'This report graphically details the destruction of the health care system in Gaza, and the extent of killing of patients, staff, and other civilians in these attacks in blatant disregard for international humanitarian and human rights law,' Volker Türk, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement coinciding with the publication of the report. He said the report raises serious concerns about Israel’s compliance with international law. It points out that medical personnel and hospitals are specifically protected under international humanitarian law, 'provided they do not commit, or are not used to commit, outside their humanitarian function, acts harmful to the enemy.' 'As if the relentless bombing and the dire humanitarian situation in Gaza were not enough, the one sanctuary where Palestinians should have felt safe in fact became a death trap,' Türk said. 'The protection of hospitals during warfare is paramount and must be respected by all sides, at all times.' Israeli response Israel has vigorously refuted these charges. In an 11-page response, Israel’s Permanent Mission in Geneva described this fourth 'thematic report' by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights as one of many examples 'of the inherent obsession of OHCHR with vilifying Israel.' It accused the agency of dismissing 'well-documented evidence of Hamas military activities in health facilities' and of its 'unwillingness to recognize Hamas’s systemic exploitation of Gazan medical facilities for terror purposes.' The Permanent Mission called the methodology employed in OHCHR reports as 'fundamentally flawed.' It criticized the agency’s reliance on 'unreliable sources' and justified its attacks on hospitals on the grounds that these health care centers were being used by Palestinian armed groups. 'There is ample evidence regarding Hamas terror activity in medical facilities,' the Permanent Mission stated. 'Hamas embeds its tunnel system and infrastructure within the premises of medical facilities as a matter of strategy and utilizes them as arms caches and accessible headquarters for its operatives.' The OHCHR reports attacks on hospitals have occurred in each of the areas in which the Israeli military has conducted ground operations starting in November 2023 with an attack on Al-Shifa Medical Complex and other hospitals in Gaza City. The attacks continue to this day. The report notes that 'The appalling destruction wrought by the Israeli military’s attacks on the Kamal Adwan hospital last Friday — leaving the population of North Gaza with almost no access to adequate health care — reflects the pattern of attacks documented in the report.' Reacting to the attack on the Kamal Adwan hospital, the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, or OCHA, expressed alarm Sunday at the ongoing attacks across the Gaza Strip and the airstrike on Kamal Adwan hospital, warning that 'the very means of people’s survival are being dismantled.' According to the World Health Organization, 15 out of Gaza’s 36 hospitals remain 'partially functional,' nine in the south and six in the north. 'The health system is under severe threat,' said Tedros Adhanan Gebgreyesus, WHO director-general, noting that 'hospitals in Gaza have once again become battlegrounds.' The OHCHR report finds the increasingly limited healthcare system is preventing many of those with trauma injuries from receiving timely and possibly life-saving treatment. It says attacks on hospitals in Gaza also are having serious implications for patients with 'initially non-fatal conditions, potentially rendering them fatal.' 'Women, especially pregnant women, are suffering gravely. Many women are giving birth with no or minimal pre- and postnatal care, increasing the risk of preventable maternal and child mortality,' it said. It added that people with chronic diseases, such as kidney failure, hypertension, diabetes, and heart disease, also have lost access to their treatment, 'placing them at risk of worsening health outcomes and death.' Authors of the report say, 'Intentionally directing attacks against hospitals and places where the sick and wounded are treated, provided they are not military objectives … and intentionally launching disproportionate attacks, are also war crimes.' It added that 'Under certain circumstances, the deliberate destruction of health care facilities may amount to a form of collective punishment, which would also constitute a war crime.' Human rights chief Türk is calling for independent, thorough and transparent investigations of all of these incidents, 'and full accountability for all violations of international humanitarian and human rights law which have taken place.' In response to this appeal, Israel’s Permanent Mission in Geneva stated, 'The State of Israel reaffirms its commitment to international law, and remains committed to examining and investigating any exceptional incidents through its established mechanisms.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-attacks-push-gaza-health-care-system-near-collapse-un-rights-office-says/7920026.html	2024-12-31T09:13:20-08:00	
Thousands march in Bangladesh calling for ousted prime minister's prosecution	DHAKA, BANGLADESH — Thousands of people led by students rallied in Bangladesh's capital on Tuesday, calling for the prosecution of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and those responsible for hundreds of deaths in a mass uprising against her government in July. The Anti-Discrimination Student Movement organized the 'March for Unity' at the Central Shaheed Minar, a national monument in Dhaka. Protesters chanted slogans calling for Hasina's trial and the banning of her Awami League party. Hasina fled to India on Aug. 5 after weeks of violence in which authorities say hundreds of people were killed and thousands more injured on orders of her government. The uprising ended the 15-year-rule of the country's longest-serving prime minister, who began a fourth consecutive term in January following an election boycotted by the major opposition parties. Last week, Bangladesh sent a formal request to India to extradite Hasina. She faces many court cases over the deaths of protesters, including some on charges of crimes against humanity. 'Since August 5, we have no more enemies in Bangladesh. Our only enemy is the Awami League,' Hasnat Abdullah, convener of the student movement, said while addressing the crowd. Protesters also urged the interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus to issue a formal proclamation by Jan. 15 detailing the events of the uprising. The student leaders want the proclamation to include two key demands: a new constitution after the 1972 charter, which was enacted under Hasina's father, has been abolished, and a ban on the Awami League party. Hasina's Awami League had ruled Bangladesh for 15 years, since 2009. The Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal has already issued arrest warrants for Hasina and her close aides, and the government has sought help from the international police organization Interpol in seeking her arrest. Speaking from the U.S., Hasina's son, Sajeeb Wazed, has questioned the credibility of the tribunal and called charges against her a 'political witch hunt.' Meanwhile, the interim government has promised to try Hasina and others in her administration for alleged crimes involving the deaths of protesters and has invited the United Nations to help investigate the killings. Hasina also has called for an investigation, saying many deaths may have involved others beyond security agencies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-march-in-bangladesh-calling-for-ousted-prime-minister-s-prosecution/7919904.html	2024-12-31T08:06:36-08:00	
US imposes sanctions on entities in Iran, Russia over election interference	Washington — The United States on Tuesday imposed sanctions on entities in Iran and Russia, accusing them of attempting to interfere in the U.S. election this year. The U.S. Treasury Department in a statement said the entities — a subsidiary of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps and an organization affiliated with Russia's military intelligence agency — aimed to 'stoke socio-political tensions and influence the U.S. electorate during the 2024 U.S. election.' The Cognitive Design Production Center planned influence operations since at least 2023, the Treasury said, while the Moscow-based Center for Geopolitical Expertise (CGE) circulated disinformation about candidates in the election and directed and subsidized the creation of deepfakes. The Treasury said CGE also manipulated a video to produce 'baseless accusations concerning a 2024 vice presidential candidate.' It did not specify which candidate was targeted. Republican Donald Trump was elected president in November, beating Democratic candidate Kamala Harris and capping a remarkable comeback four years after he was voted out of the White House. 'The Governments of Iran and Russia have targeted our election processes and institutions and sought to divide the American people through targeted disinformation campaigns,' Treasury's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence, Bradley Smith said in the statement. 'The United States will remain vigilant against adversaries who would undermine our democracy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-sanctions-on-entities-in-iran-russia-over-election-interference/7919900.html	2024-12-31T08:05:34-08:00	
Chadian opposition says elections should be canceled, calls for new transition	Yaoundé — An uneasy calm hangs over Chad, where the opposition is calling for an immediate end to the country’s transitional government and the cancellation of the Dec. 29 general elections, which the opposition says were highly boycotted. Chad's elections management body has pledged to count the votes and declare the results, saying irregularities cannot influence the outcome. Assane Bairra, vice president of Chad's National Agency for the Management of Elections (ANGE), said vote counting is under way after the central African state’s local, provincial and parliamentary elections on Sunday. The elections were scheduled to end Chad's three-year transition period following the death of longtime President Idriss Deby Itno in April 2021. The late president’s son, Mahamat Idriss Deby, was declared the winner of the presidential election in May. Provisional results for the latest polls are expected by Jan. 15, ANGE said. Assane said ANGE has successfully executed its mission of ending the transitional period by organizing free, fair and transparent elections. The elections body said about 36% of Chad's estimated 8.3 million registered voters took part in Sunday's poll. But opposition parties maintain that turnout was much lower, saying civilians respected opposition calls for a massive boycott. Avocksouma Djona is spokesperson for Chad's Political Actors Consultation Group, or GCAP, a coalition of several dozen political parties. At a press conference on Monday in the capital, N'djamena, said more than 90% of about 8.3 million registered voters adhered to GCAP’s boycott calls. They did so, he said, because civilians learned from Chad's May 6 presidential elections that Deby wants to extend his late father’s long rule. Avocksouma said Chadians are angry because Deby is a dictator who silences all critical voices. In a statement Monday, Succes Masra, president of The Transformers, one of Chad's leading opposition political parties, called for a new transition. It should be marked by truth, dialogue and reconciliation to lay the foundations of a stable and inclusive political system, he said. Masra, who served as prime minister under transitional President Deby, said ongoing tensions in the central African state may degenerate into violence and social strife. Avocksouma said he is certain that despite the massive boycott, ANGE will still proclaim Deby's ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement as the winners of the Dec. 29 elections. Ahead of the vote, opposition parties accused Deby of rigging the elections, a charge Deby denies. Yamingue Betinbaye is a political analyst at the University of N'djamena. He spoke to VOA on Monday via a messaging group. The analyst told VOA that although the opposition has legitimate claims that the boycott was massive and there were irregularities including the stuffing of ballot boxes to rig elections for Deby, it is unlikely that the polls will be annulled as the opposition requests. The Chadian government said calls for the elections to be annulled and for a new transition are intended to cause chaos and sink Chad into violence. The government said civilians should not obey opposition calls to destabilize their country by going out onto the streets to protest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chadian-opposition-says-elections-should-be-canceled-calls-for-new-transition-/7919829.html	2024-12-31T07:03:47-08:00	
Nearly all of Puerto Rico is without power on New Year's Eve	SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico — A blackout hit nearly all of Puerto Rico early Tuesday as the U.S. territory prepared to celebrate New Year's, leaving more than 1.3 million clients in the dark. Officials said it could take up to two days to restore power. The outage hit at dawn, plunging the island into an eerie silence as electrical appliances and air conditioners shut down before those who could afford generators turned them on. 'It had to be on the 31st of December!' exclaimed one man, who only gave his name as Manuel, as he stood outside a grocery store in the capital of San Juan, grumbling about the outage that coincided with his birthday. 'There is no happiness.' Nearly 90% of 1.47 million clients across Puerto Rico were left in the dark, according to Luma Energy, a private company that oversees electricity transmission and distribution. It estimated that power would be restored in 24 to 48 hours, conditions permitting. Luma said in a statement that it appears the outage was caused by a failure of an underground power line, saying it is restoring power 'in the quickest and safest way possible.' A Luma spokesman told The Associated Press that the incident was under investigation. A spokesperson for Genera PR, which oversees power generation, could not be immediately reached for comment. With no idea when power would return, Puerto Ricans began to think ahead. 'I'll go to my balcony. That's where I'll sleep,' Raúl Pacheco said with a resigned shrug, as the 63-year-old diabetic sat on a walker nursing an injured foot. Julio Córdova, a municipal worker who was raking leaves on a nearby sidewalk, said he got dressed by the light of his cellphone and planned to buy candles. 'This affects me because I had plans. It couldn't have been yesterday or tomorrow?' he said as he shook his head. While blackouts are rare in Puerto Rico, the island continues to struggle with chronic power outages blamed on a crumbling power grid that was razed by Hurricane Maria, a powerful category 4 storm that struck the island in September 2017. The system, however, was already in decline prior to the storm given years of lack of maintenance and investment. Some Puerto Ricans took the latest outage in stride. 'They're part of my everyday life,' said Enid Núñez, 49, who said she ate breakfast before work thanks to a small gas stove she bought for such events.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nearly-all-of-puerto-rico-is-without-power-on-new-year-s-eve/7919758.html	2024-12-31T06:58:23-08:00

US, Boeing investigators examine site of deadly South Korean plane crash	Seoul, South Korea — A team of U.S. investigators including representatives from Boeing on Tuesday examined the site of a plane crash that killed 179 people in South Korea while authorities were conducting safety inspections on all Boeing 737-800 aircraft operated by the country's airlines. All but two of the 181 people aboard the Boeing 737-800 operated by South Korean budget airline Jeju Air died in Sunday's crash. Video showed the aircraft, without its landing gear deployed, crash-landed on its belly and overshoot a runaway at South Korea's southern Muan International Airport before it slammed into concrete fence and burst into a flame. The plane was seen having engine trouble, and preliminary examinations also say the pilots received a bird strike warning from the ground control center and issued a distress signal as well. But many experts say the landing gear issue was likely the main cause of the crash. The South Korean government has launched safety inspections on all the 101 Boeing 737-800s in the country. The Transport Ministry said authorities are looking at maintenance and operation records during five days of safety checks that are to run until Friday. The ministry said that a delegation of eight U.S. investigators — one from the Federal Aviation Administration, three from National Transportation Safety Board and four from Boeing — made an on-site visit to the crash site on Tuesday. The results of their examination weren't immediately available. Kim E-bae, Jeju Air's president, told reporters Tuesday that his company will add more maintenance workers and reduce flight operations by 10-15% until March as part of efforts to enhance the safety of aircraft operations. John Hansman, an aviation expert at MIT, said the crash was most likely the result of a problem with the plane's hydraulic control systems. He said that would be consistent with the landing gear and wing flaps not being deployed 'and might indicate a control issue which would explain the rush to get on the ground.' The Boeing 737-800 — an earlier version of 737 than the Max is a widely used plane with a good safety record, according to Najmedin Meshkati, an engineering professor at the University of Southern California who has studied aviation safety. He said the failure of the plane's system for broadcasting location, operating its landing gear and extending the wing flaps to slow down indicate a widespread problem that affected electrical and hydraulic systems. He is confident that investigators will learn what went wrong by analyzing information from the flight data and cockpit voice recorders. 'These are really the two pillars for accident analysis and accident reconstruction,' Meshkati said. Like other aviation experts, Meshkati also questioned the location of a solid wall just a few hundred feet (meters) past the end of the runway, given that planes occasionally do overshoot runways. 'Having such a big concrete barrier over there was really very bad luck for this particular airplane,' he said. South Korean officials have said they will look into whether the Muan airport's localizer — a concrete fence housing a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft safely during landings — should have been made with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact. The crash was the deadliest disaster in South Korea's aviation history in decades. A seven-day national mourning has been declared until Jan. 4. The Transport Ministry said Tuesday that authorities have identified 175 bodies and are conducting DNA tests to identify the remaining five. Bereaved families said that officials told them that the bodies were so badly damaged that officials need time before returning them to relatives. On Tuesday, Park Han Shin, a representative of the families, accused the government of failing to provide freezers on time as promised and said there are worries that the bodies could decompose. 'The last dignities of the victims are seriously hurt. We strongly criticize authorities for failing to keep its promise,' Park said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-boeing-investigators-examine-site-of-deadly-south-korean-plane-crash/7919714.html	2024-12-31T06:03:58-08:00	
Thailand's economy, tourism remain focus for 2025 under younger Shinawatra	BANGKOK — Thailand has seen another year of political controversy, but the economy continues to be the country's focus for 2025. The installation of Paetongtarn Shinawatra as Thailand's 31st prime minister in August means the country is once again led by a member of the Shinawatra family. But questions remain as to what influence her father, Thaksin Shinawatra, will have, and what kind of policies the ruling Pheu Thai Party will implement. The return of the Shinawatra family at the head of government comes after Srettha Thavisin was removed as prime minister role over an ethics violation. This paved the way for the Pheu Thai party to pick Paetongtarn, whom parliament then elected, making her the youngest Thai prime minister in history. 'I can handle the pressure,' she said at the time. But almost immediately, experts questioned how independent she would be. Paetongtarn is the daughter of Thaksin, a highly divisive but influential figure in Thai politics. He founded the Pheu Thai Party and has been prime minister twice. But after charges of corruption, he fled Thailand in 2008 and spent 15 years in self-exile. He returned in 2023. 'How can we be sure that Paetongtarn, as prime minister, answers to the Thai public and not her father?' Napon Jatusripitak, visiting fellow at the ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute in Singapore, told VOA in August. Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a political scientist and professor of international relations at Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok, believes the elder Thaksin's role is clear. 'After 15 years in exile, he is now like an overseeing chairman running the country with his daughter Paetongtarn as chief executive and prime minister,' he told VOA. '2024 was another wasteful year following a much-anticipated election that installed Srettha as prime minister, who got the boot for uncompelling reasons,' Thitinan said. Pheu Thai came to power after Thailand's election winner, the Move Forward Party, was blocked from leading government in 2023. The Move Forward Party was dissolved in August after the Constitutional Court ruled the party's campaign pledges leading up to the election were aimed at toppling the monarchy. It is against the law to criticize the monarchy, which is Thailand's top institution. With Move Forward gone, the new year also will be a challenge for the People's Party, which formed in 2024 as Move Forward's successor. The People's Party has made similar promises as its predecessors, such as the amendment to Thailand's royal defamation law. Political observers will be watching the progression of this newly formed opposition party leading up to Thailand's next elections in 2027. But following nine years of rule by a military government, and the recent political turmoil, the policies of the ruling Pheu Thai Party must now be Thailand's focus, Thitinan said. 'Despite shortcomings behind a heavily doctored government formation, 2025 could see a semblance of stability amid anti-government noises that allow the Thai economy and Thailand's international standing to perk up to a point after years of mismanagement under a military-based regime.' Thailand's economy, the second largest in Southeast Asia, will again be scrutinized. Its annual growth is slower than many of its regional neighbors. Initial forecasts put Thailand with a GDP growth of 3.0% for 2024, but its new revised growth is 2.7%, according to the finance ministry. Some of Thailand's main economic industries, like manufacturing, are struggling with thousands of factories closed in recent years. Kiatanantha Lounkaew, an economics lecturer at the Thammasat University in Bangkok, outlined the economic woes. 'Our economy has been operating with the same structure since the year 2000, and that is why our competitiveness has been eroding. We can't compete in the municipal [foreign direct investments] compared to our regional partners,' he told VOA earlier in 2024. The economic issues have even led to Thaksin weighing in on the subject. The former prime minister laid out a 14-point strategy to fix the country's economy, ranging from reforming the public debt and the agriculture sector, to empowering tourism, launching entertainment complexes and using locally made products. Thitinan said Thailand must look toward digitalization. 'The dial has moved on; they have to be talking about much more digitalization, digital economy, AI, machine learning, education reform,' he told VOA in August. One of the key economic policies has been the launch of the controversial Digital Wallet program, which provides a one-time handout of about $280 in digital money to approximate 50 million citizens to spend locally to stimulate the economy. Although experts have doubted the positive impact the program may have, it's a policy that Paetongtarn has continued from Srettha. 'In terms of policies, the Paetongtarn government feels like a faster-paced version of Srettha's. Both are laser-focused on the economy, but Paetongtarn clearly has the advantage of a bigger team and more resources, thanks to her role as Pheu Thai Party leader and Thaksin's daughter,' Tita Sanglee, associate fellow at the ISEAS Institute, told VOA. 'This seems to have allowed her government to push Pheu Thai's initiatives more actively, things like cash handouts, a three-year debt suspension for farmers, discussions on casino legalization, and efforts to boost tourism and attract foreign investments,' she said. But analysts say Thailand's changing social policies means the country will have a landmark year after parliament already passed the marriage equality legislation, which is set to become law on January 24. 'Even social policies like the marriage equality legislation and the proposal to grant permanent residency, nationality to stateless individuals has clear economic implications. The former reinforces Thailand's position as a leader in the LGBTQ inclusivity, making it more appealing as a destination,' Tita added. Foreign tourism has long been a key pillar of the economy, and the new year is expected to see landmark results. At its peak in 2019, tourism accounted for 11.5% of the country's overall GDP. Thailand welcomed 34 million visitors for 2024, but for 2025 a record-breaking 40 million arrivals is forecast. Relaxing visa entry rules and launching new visa initiatives are aimed at making it easier for international arrivals to visit the country. Whatever the outcome, Thailand's new year directions will be influenced by Thaksin, experts say. Now 75 years old, once an enemy of Thailand's royal and conservative establishments, Thaksin has made his way back into Thailand's politics, albeit unofficially. '2025 could see a reset in motion as Thaksin is allowed to run Thailand from the back with Paetongtarn as figurehead with the royalist establishment's uneasy approval, due to fears of reform-minded People's Party has succeeded the dissolved Move Forward,' Thitinan said. 'Thaksin's involvement in Thailand's foreign relations is something I'd pay close attention to,' said Tita. 'He's got personal ties to many regional leaders, and that could fuel concerns about conflicts of interest. With all the geopolitical turbulence and growing criticism of Thailand's foreign policy, any interference from Thaksin matters.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-s-economy-and-tourism-remain-focus-for-2025-under-younger-shinawatra-/7919623.html	2024-12-31T05:10:46-08:00	
France strikes Islamic State targets in Syria	France said Tuesday it had carried out airstrikes against Islamic State militant positions in Syria. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu said in a post on X that the strikes happened Sunday, but did not specify where in Syria they took place. The French action follows several rounds of U.S. strikes against Islamic State targets in the weeks since rebels ousted Syrian President Bashar al-Assad from power. Islamic State militants took control of large areas of eastern Syria and western Iraq in 2014, drawing an international response that included a U.S.-led coalition aimed at defeating the group. The militants have lost much of the territory they once held, but they are still present in Syria. The Western military strikes come amid questions about Syria’s political and security future following the fall of Assad’s government. The rebels who led the quick advance that ended with Assad leaving the country have announced they would dissolve all rebel groups and incorporate them under the Syrian military. Syria’s new authorities announced Tuesday the selection of Murhaf Abu Qasra as the new defense minister. Qasra was a leading figure in the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that led the rebel push to topple Assad. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-strikes-islamic-state-targets-in-syria-/7919586.html	2024-12-31T04:29:52-08:00	
Moldovans brace for 'no heating, no light' when Russia halts gas supplies	CHISINAU, MOLDOVA — On a frigid morning in Moldova's capital, 39-year-old postal worker Petru Murzin braces for a difficult winter as he fears a looming energy shortage could leave many Moldovans with 'no heating, no light.' His concerns aren't unfounded. On January 1, Russia's state-owned energy giant Gazprom is set to halt gas supplies to the European Union candidate country over an alleged $709 million debt for past supplies, a figure fiercely disputed by Moldova's pro-Western government, that has accused Moscow of weaponizing energy as a political tool to destabilize the country. 'I feel that we've entered a crisis that is quite difficult to resolve … which worries me greatly,' Murzin told The Associated Press in Chisinau. 'Price increases are one thing, but when there is no gas at all, that's something entirely different.' The cessation will stop gas flowing to the Kuciurgan power plant, the country's largest, which is situated in the separatist pro-Russian Transnistria region. The gas-operated plant generates electricity that powers a significant portion of Moldova proper. 'There will be no heating, no light,' Murzin added. 'We are entering a very difficult year.' Transnistria declares state of emergency Transnistria, which broke away after a short war in 1992 and is not recognized by most countries, also declared its own state of emergency earlier in December, fearing the region will not receive gas supplies. A large majority of Transnistria's 470,000 people speak Russian as their first language and some 200,000 are Russian citizens. On December 13, Moldova's parliament voted in favor of imposing a state of emergency in the energy sector, as the looming crisis threatened to leave the former Soviet republic without sufficient energy this winter, sparking fears it could trigger a humanitarian crisis in Transnistria, where the impact of the gas cutoff could be immediately felt. Many observers have predicted that the looming energy shortage could force residents in Transnistria to travel to Moldova to seek basic amenities to get through winter, a season in which temperatures throughout the country regularly drop below subzero degrees Celsius. Cristian Cantir, a Moldovan associate professor of international relations at Oakland University, said that Moscow is likely trying to exploit a 'potential humanitarian crisis in Transnistria to overwhelm Moldova's already-strained resources' to amplify tensions between Chisinau and the region's de facto capital, Tiraspol. 'It could stoke fears among the Moldovan electorate of a violent conflict, and give fodder to pro-Russian parties who will accuse Chisinau of being responsible for increased prices for gas and electricity, which will be a major campaign issue' ahead of the country's parliamentary elections in 2025, he said. Chisinau takes steps The unprecedented situation prompted Chisinau last week to implement a series of energy-saving measures beginning January 1, which include reducing lighting in public and commercial buildings by at least 30%, and energy-intensive businesses operating during off-peak hours. 'We'll probably have to save power until we have a solution,' said Nicoleta Neagu, who is from Moldova but works in Germany. 'I hope we'll look at this seriously and not waste power on not-so-useful things.' After Gazprom announced it would halt gas flows, Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean accused Moscow of using energy 'as a political weapon' and said his government does not recognize the debt cited by the Russian energy giant, which he said has been 'invalidated by an international audit.' 'This decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transnistrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,' he said. For 30-year-old Chisinau resident Iuliana, who did not want to give her surname, power outages would prevent her from doing her online job, which could also be untenable if the heating goes off in the middle of winter in the country of about 2.5 million people. 'We're afraid, but we're happy that there's no snow and the temperatures aren't that low and we can turn on the heating maybe only in the evening if we work at an office,' she said. 'But I work from home and I'll be directly affected.' She also noted that Moldova has faced multiple crises in recent years, 'But regarding power and gas, it's the first time we face this,' she said. 'Energy blackmail' Moldovan President Maia Sandu criticized Russia on Monday for Gazprom's decision and said that the country has gas supplies 'for the heating season' and measures will be taken 'to ensure uninterrupted electricity supply,' adding that plans are also in place to provide humanitarian aid to residents in Transnistria. 'The Kremlin is again using energy blackmail in an attempt to destabilize the situation, to influence the 2025 parliamentary elections and to undermine our European journey,' she said. 'It is important to remain united, show solidarity, and trust in Moldova and its people. And to use energy rationally.' Moldova has repeatedly claimed Russia is conducting a vast 'hybrid war' against the country by meddling in elections, funding anti-government protests, and running vast disinformation campaigns to try to topple the government and derail the country's EU aspirations. The Kuciurgan plant was privatized in 2004 by Transnistrian officials and later sold to a Russian state-owned company, but Chisinau doesn't recognize the privatization. On Monday, Recean asked the justice minister to review nationalization legislation, to potentially recover 'strategic assets that were forcefully taken over.' Citing findings by British and Norwegian audit firms, Moldova claims its debt stands close to $8.6 million, a fraction of that claimed by the Russian energy giant. Gazprom said in a statement Saturday that it reserved the right to take further action, including terminating its contract with Moldovagaz, Moldova's main gas operator, in which the Russian company owns a majority stake. In late 2022, months after Russia fully invaded neighboring Ukraine, Moldova suffered major power outages following Russian strikes on Ukraine, which is interconnected to the Kuciurgan plant. When the war next door started, Moldova was entirely dependent on Moscow for natural gas but has since pushed to diversify and expand its energy sources, and now relies on obtaining gas from other European markets. Murzin, the postal worker, is expecting to see large inflows of people from Transnistria crossing the border once the shortage hits. 'I think cars will line up for several kilometers at the border,' he said. 'Many people will come here, hoping for warmth.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldovans-brace-for-no-heating-no-light-when-russia-halts-gas-supplies-/7919547.html	2024-12-31T03:10:49-08:00	
Cities across globe prepare to welcome 2025 with local traditions	WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND — Cities around the world are readying to ring in the New Year with celebrations highlighting local cultures and traditions, after a year roiled by ongoing conflict and political instability. Countries in the South Pacific Ocean will be the first to welcome 2025, with midnight in New Zealand striking 18 hours before the ball drop in Times Square in New York. In New Zealand's largest city, Auckland, thousands were expected to throng the downtown or climb the city's ring of volcanic peaks for a fireworks vantage point — and a light display recognizing Auckland's Indigenous tribes. It follows a year marked by protests over Maori rights in the nation of 5 million. Two hours later in Australia, more than 1 million people are expected at Sydney Harbor for the traditional fireworks. British pop star Robbie Williams will lead a singalong and Indigenous ceremonies and performances will acknowledge the land's first people. Asia readies for Year of Snake Much of Japan has shut down ahead of the nation's biggest holiday, as temples and homes underwent a thorough cleaning, including swatting floor mats called 'tatami' with big sticks. The coming Year of the Snake in the Asian zodiac is heralded as one of rebirth — alluding to the reptile's shedding skin. Stores in Japan, which observes the zodiac cycle from January 1, have been selling tiny figures of smiling snakes and other snake-themed products. Other places in Asia will start marking the Year of the Snake later, with the Lunar New Year. In South Korea, celebrations were cut back or canceled as the country observes a period of national mourning following the Sunday crash of a Jeju Air flight at Muan that killed 179 people. West's rivals exchange goodwill Chinese state media covered an exchange of New Year's greetings between leader Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin in a reminder of growing closeness between two leaders who face tensions with the West. Xi told Putin that their countries will 'always move forward hand in hand,' the official Xinhua News Agency said Tuesday. China has maintained ties and a robust trade with Russia since the latter's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, helping to offset Western sanctions and attempts to isolate Putin. Midnight Mass, with bubbles Rome's traditional New Year's Eve festivities have an additional draw: the start of Pope Francis' Holy Year, the once every quarter-century celebration projected to bring some 32 million pilgrims to the Eternal City in 2025. On Tuesday, Francis will celebrate a vespers at St. Peter's Basilica, followed by Mass on Wednesday, when he is expected to once again appeal for peace amid wars raging in Ukraine and the Middle East. Meanwhile, in the United States, the Cathedral of Saint Paul in Minnesota will host an 11 p.m. Mass followed by a champagne reception with toasts. January 1 is a day of obligation for Catholics, marking the Solemnity of Mary, and many churches will hold vigil Masses on Tuesday afternoon and evening. Paris to recaptures Olympic spirit Paris will cap a momentous 2024 with its traditional festive countdown and fireworks extravaganza on the famed Champs-Elysees. The Summer Olympics and Paralympic Games hosted in the French capital from July to September transformed the city into a site of joy, fraternity and astonishing sporting achievements, and marked another major milestone in its recovery from deadly Islamist extremist attacks in 2015. London celebration to feature fireworks London is due to ring in the New Year with a pyrotechnic display along the River Thames and a 10,000-performer parade through the city center on Wednesday. The fireworks will explode against the backdrop of the London Eye, the massive Ferris wheel across the river from Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. With a storm bringing bitter weather to other parts of the United Kingdom, however, festivities in Edinburgh, Scotland — including the Hogmanay Street party, garden concert and castle pyrotechnics show — were already canceled. Rio to see 2 million revelers Rio de Janeiro will throw Brazil's main New Year's Eve bash on Copacabana Beach, with 10 ferries offshore bearing 12 minutes of fireworks. Thousands of tourists in six cruise ships will witness the show up close. Rio's City Hall was closely guarding its plans for a display of lights and sounds. More than 2 million people are expected at the Copacabana, hoping to squeeze in to concerts by superstar Brazilian artists such as pop singer Anitta and Grammy-award winner Caetano Veloso. American traditions old and new In New York City, the organization managing Times Square has tested its famous ball drop, and inspected 2025 numerals, lights and thousands of crystals, as part of a tradition going back to 1907. This year's celebration will include musical performances by TLC, Jonas Brothers, Rita Ora, and Sophie Ellis-Bextor. The party, covering multiple blocks around the city's main tourism and theater hub, is expected to draw large crowds despite rain and chilly weather. Meanwhile, Las Vegas, Nevada, will bid farewell to 2024 with old — and some new — traditions. Its annual eight-minute pyrotechnic show will be on in the Las Vegas Strip, with 340,000 people anticipated as fireworks are launched from the rooftops of nine casinos. Nearby, the massive Sphere venue will display for the first time countdowns to midnight in different time zones. Music, football, a midnight run In Pasadena, California, enthusiastic Rose Parade spectators were to camp out on the cold streets and ring in the New Year hoping for prime spots for the iconic southern California tradition. The parade precedes the Rose Bowl football game between the Ohio State Buckeyes and the Oregon Ducks on January 1. Thousands are expected to participate in a midnight 5K race following the parade route. Some 200,000 people will flock to a party in Nashville, Tennessee, featuring a five-hour show by some of country music's biggest stars. At midnight — an hour after New York's — a 5-meter tall music note weighing 181 kilograms will drop as fireworks light the sky. Celebrations will echo around the globe as 2025 arrives in different time zones, with American Samoa among the last to welcome the new year a full 24 hours after New Zealand.

Russia says debris from Ukrainian drone sparks fire in Smolensk region	Russian officials said Tuesday that debris from a destroyed Ukrainian drone fell on an oil facility in the Smolensk region, causing a fire. The Russian defense ministry said it shot down a total of 68 Ukrainian drones overnight, including 10 over Smolensk. Intercepts also took place over the Bryansk, Crimea, Krasnodar, Tver, Rostov, Kursk and Kaluga regions, the ministry said. There were no other reports of damage or casualties from the attacks. Meanwhile, Ukraine's air defenses worked to defend against Russian missile attacks Tuesday in Kyiv. Serhii Popko, head of Kyiv's City Military Administration, said debris from a falling missile landed on a building but did not cause any damage. In the Sumy region in northeastern Ukraine, officials said a missile attack targeted infrastructure sites in the town of Shostka.

Stock market today: Asian shares trade mixed, as Tokyo and Seoul close for New Year holidays	TOKYO — Asian markets shares were mixed on Tuesday, with trading closed in Tokyo and Seoul for New Year holidays. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 in Sydney skidded 0.9% to 8,159.10. Hong Kong's Hang Seng added nearly 0.1% to 20,059.95, while the Shanghai Composite lost 0.7% to 3,383.86 after Chinese manufacturing data seemed to show that Beijing's stimulus measures have not done enough to boost the nation's sluggish economy. China's Purchasing Managers' Index, based on a survey of factory managers, slipped to 50.1 in December from 50.3 the previous month, the National Bureau of Statistics said Tuesday. It was the third straight monthly reading above 50, a level that indicates an expansion of manufacturing activity. Trading is set to resume in Tokyo on January 6, as markets will stay closed for the rest of the week for the New Year holidays. South Korean markets will be closed for New Year's Day and resume trading Thursday. On Monday, U.S. stocks closed broadly lower, with the S&P 500 falling 1.1% to 5,906.94, its third straight decline. Roughly 90% of stocks within the index lost ground. On the second-to-last day of 2024, the benchmark index was still on track for its second straight yearly gain of more than 20%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1% to 42,573.73, and the Nasdaq composite ended 1.2% lower, at 19,486.78. Big Tech companies were the heaviest weights on the market, worsening the slump. Apple and Microsoft fell 1.3%. Their pricey valuations tend to have an outsized impact on the broader market. Elsewhere among tech stocks, Meta Platforms dropped 1.4%, Netflix slipped 0.8% and Amazon fell 1.1%. The S&P 500's technology and communication services sectors have been the market's high flyers, notching gains of 37.1% and 39.9%, respectively, so far this year. Boeing fell 2.3% after one of its jets skidded off a runway in South Korea, killing 179 of the 181 people aboard. South Korea is inspecting all 737-800 aircraft operated by airlines in the country. The disaster was yet another blow for Boeing following a machinists strike, further safety problems with its troubled top-selling aircraft and a plunging stock price. Its shares have declined more than 30% this year. Airlines that fly Boeing jets wavered in the wake of the crash. United Airlines fell 1.4% and Delta Air Lines dropped 0.9%. Markets are nearing the close of a stellar year driven by a growing economy, solid consumer spending and a strong jobs market. Wall Street expects companies within the S&P 500 to report broad earnings growth of more than 9% for the year, according to FactSet. The final figures will be tallied following fourth-quarter reports that start in a few weeks. Investors were encouraged by inflation cooling throughout the year to close to the Federal Reserve's 2% target. That raised hopes that the central bank would deliver a steady stream of interest rate cuts, which would ease borrowing costs and fuel more economic growth. The Fed cut interest rates three times in 2024, but has signaled a more cautious approach heading into 2025 as inflation shows signs of reheating. The latest report on consumer prices showed that inflation edged slightly higher, to 2.7%, in November. President-elect Donald Trump's threats to hike tariffs have added to worries about the potential for inflation to reignite. Companies typically pass along the higher costs from tariffs on goods and raw materials to consumers. Investors have very little corporate and economic news to review this week, which is shortened by the New Year holiday. U.S. markets will be closed on Wednesday. On Thursday, investors will get an updated snapshot of U.S. construction spending for the month of November. On Friday, Wall Street will receive an update on manufacturing for December. In energy trading, benchmark U.S. crude rose 62 cents to $71.61 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, added 59 cents to $74.58 a barrel. In currency trading, the U.S. dollar fell to 156.22 Japanese yen from 156.90 yen. The euro cost $1.0409, little changed from $1.0410.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stock-market-today-asian-shares-trade-mixed-as-tokyo-and-seoul-close-for-new-year-holidays-/7919519.html	2024-12-31T01:18:33-08:00	
Southerners in US clean up after tornadoes sweep region	NEW CANEY, TEXAS — Cleanup was under way Monday after a strong storm system spawned hail, rain, high winds and tornadoes across the southern United States over the weekend, killing at least four people. As of Monday afternoon, more than 30 tornadoes had been confirmed as crews worked through about 50 reports of tornado damage spanning from Texas to South Carolina, said Mark Wiley, an emergency response specialist with the National Weather Service's Southern Region Headquarters. The storms came over a busy holiday travel weekend, causing some treacherous road conditions along with delays or cancellations at some of the busiest U.S. airports. The storms first hit Saturday around the Houston, Texas, area, where the National Weather Service by Monday had confirmed six tornadoes. 'Some of the damage was pretty substantial, some cases leveling homes, some producing quite a bit of roof damage,' said Brian Kyle, lead forecaster with the National Weather Service in Houston. About 50 homes in Montgomery County sustained major damage and 30 were destroyed, county official Jason Smith said. A couple hundred more homes sustained minor or cosmetic damage, he said. Cleanup crews labored over the weekend and were continuing to pick up debris Monday. 'I could hear it roar' Carlos Benitez, 41, was already working to rebuild his auto repair shop in the New Caney area. Benitez said he closed his eyes as the storm blew through and when he opened them, 'everything's down.' Sasha Zamora, 39, lives nearby, and was trying to put her baby to sleep when she realized how serious the storm was. 'Immediately, the wind picked up so fast that things were hitting the window,' she said, recounting how she rushed her children to the center of the house. Though her family and her property came through the storm OK, her neighbor's mobile home flipped over, Zamora said. Officials in Mississippi said two people were killed in storms there, including an 18-year-old who died after a tree fell on her home Saturday night in Natchez in Adams County. About 22,000 Mississippians remained without power Monday afternoon, according to the website PowerOutage.us. In Texas, a 48-year-old woman died in the Liverpool area south of Houston, said Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. She said the woman was found about 30 meters from her home. Dozens of homes and buildings were significantly damaged in Brazoria County, including an elementary school. In North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday in Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on the pickup truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said, 'It was just a freak accident' and he believed Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland, North Carolina, was killed instantly. Maffucci said that the storms were responsible for a number of downed trees and 'quite a few wrecks.' In the Alabama city of Athens, northwest of Huntsville, the storm damaged the downtown area, said city spokeswoman Holly Hollman. Large HVAC units were hurled from the tops of building and the roof was ripped off a bookstore. A full-sized, stripped-down military helicopter was toppled from a pole where it was on display, she added. 'I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar,' she said of the storm. Although somewhat uncommon for the season, weather officials say even December can bring severe weather under the right circumstances, as warm temperatures from the Gulf of Mexico combine with a cold front. 'You can still have the right ingredients that lead to these severe events even in the dead of winter in the Deep South,' said Peter Mullinax, a meteorologist with the National Weather Services' Weather Prediction Center. Still, it's rare for a system to start in Texas and make its way all the way to the Atlantic Coast this time of year, Wiley said. Power outages in Pennsylvania Meanwhile, in western Pennsylvania, high winds overnight Sunday caused power outages early Monday, most of them in Pittsburgh and other parts of Allegheny County. Wind speeds of more than 97 kilometers per hour were reported in Pennsylvania as high winds also blew across Ohio and northern West Virginia. AccuWeather meteorologist Alex DaSilva in State College, Pennsylvania, said a strengthening low-pressure system ushered in the winds that downed trees and utility poles Sunday evening and into the night. Some 60,000 Pennsylvania utility customers were without power Monday morning. That number had dropped to about 13,000 by Monday afternoon, according to PowerOutage.us.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southerners-in-us-clean-up-after-tornadoes-sweep-region-/7919508.html	2024-12-31T01:04:13-08:00	
South Korean court issues detention warrant for Yoon	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A South Korean court has approved a detention warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, who faces insurrection charges over his attempt to impose martial law in December. The Seoul Western District Court issued the warrant on Tuesday, marking the first time a sitting South Korean president has faced arrest, according to local media. Yoon was impeached in mid-December, suspending his presidential powers while the Constitutional Court reviews the case. In addition to impeachment, Yoon is being investigated for insurrection and abuse of power by a joint government investigation team. Yoon ignored three separate summonses to appear for questioning as part of that investigation, leading the court to issue Tuesday's warrant. Once Yoon is taken into custody, authorities will have 48 hours to decide whether to file for an arrest warrant or to release him, reported the Yonhap news agency. In a statement, Yoon's lawyers called the warrant 'illegal' and said they would file an injunction at the country's Constitutional Court to stop it. Yoon's legal team has refused to cooperate with the investigation, arguing that the impeachment trial should take priority over any criminal proceedings. The arrest warrant is valid until next Monday. But it is not clear when any arrest attempt will be made or how aggressive authorities will be in attempting to execute the warrant. The Presidential Security Service has so far prevented investigators from entering the presidential office compound or Yoon's official residence for court-approved searches, citing security and military considerations. Political pressure, however, is building for Yoon to comply with investigators. In an editorial Tuesday, the Chosun Ilbo, an influential conservative daily, said Yoon has 'no legal means' to block the enforcement of an arrest warrant. 'Blocking its execution would itself violate the law and could lead to a physical confrontation,' read the editorial, which urged Yoon to face the investigation 'with dignity.' Meanwhile, the acting head of South Korea's ruling conservative People Power Party on Tuesday called the detention warrant 'extremely regrettable.' South Korean presidents are generally immune from prosecution while in office, except for cases involving rebellion or treason. Yoon declared martial law on December 3 — the first such decree since South Korea became a democracy in the 1980s — but lawmakers overturned the order within hours. Yoon has said the declaration was necessary to send a 'strong message' to his rivals, whom he accused of being North Korea sympathizers obstructing his agenda. His opponents accuse Yoon of attempting to restore South Korea's military dictatorship, and say it is necessary to formally remove him from office as soon as possible. The path forward, however, remains uncertain. The Constitutional Court has 180 days to rule on Yoon's removal, but with three judicial seats vacant, all six remaining justices must unanimously agree to uphold the impeachment. Efforts to appoint new judges have stalled, with the opposition threatening to impeach successive acting presidents who refuse to approve them, fueling fears of a prolonged political deadlock that has already hurt South Korea's economy. Last week, the value of the South Korean won hit a 16-year low against the U.S. dollar, raising concerns about higher energy import costs and increased consumer prices.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-court-issues-detention-warrant-for-yoon/7919499.html	2024-12-30T23:54:54-08:00	
US repatriates Tunisian detainee from Guantanamo Bay	The United States announced late Monday the repatriation of a Tunisian man who had been held at the U.S. military detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba since 2002. Ridah Bin Saleh al-Yazidi was one of the first to be held at the facility, which at one point housed hundreds of detainees following the September 11, 2001, al-Qaida terror attacks on the United States. Yazidi was captured by Pakistani authorities in late 2001. He was among a group of about 30 fighters who had crossed the border from Afghanistan's Tora Bora region, according to Pentagon files. The Pentagon assessment said most of the group was identified as al-Qaida operatives or bodyguards of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden. Yazidi was never charged with a crime and cleared for transfer from Guantanamo in 2009, but there was no agreement in place for him to be sent to Tunisia or another country. The Pentagon said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin told Congress in January 2024 that officials had 'completed the requirements for responsible transfer' in consultation with Tunisia. The repatriation leaves 26 detainees at Guantanamo, of whom 14 have been cleared for transfer. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-repatriates-tunisian-detainee-from-guantanamo-bay/7919488.html	2024-12-30T23:01:59-08:00	
Influential people who died in 2024	It was a life that took him from peanut farming to the presidency. While former President Jimmy Carter 's time in the White House lasted only one term, the decades afterward were defined by humanitarian work that affected people all around the world. Founding the Carter Center with his wife, Rosalynn, he became a global champion for democracy, human rights and public health. And he still took time to teach Sunday school at Maranatha Baptist Church in Georgia. Carter was the nation's longest-lived president when he died Sunday at age 100. But he was just one of many noteworthy people who died in 2024. Alexey Navalny, who died in prison in February, was a fierce political foe of Russian President Vladimir Putin, crusading against corruption and staging protests against the Kremlin. He had been jailed since 2021 when he returned to Russia to face certain arrest after recovering in Germany from nerve agent poisoning he blamed on the Kremlin. Other political figures who died this year include: Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi; former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney; former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh; Vietnamese politician Nguyen Phu Trong; U.S. Representative Sheila Jackson Lee; former Soviet Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov; pundit Lou Dobbs; Greek politician Vasso Papandreou; former U.S. Senators Joe Lieberman, Jim Inhofe, Tim Johnson and Jim Sasser; Namibian President Hage Geingob; and former Lebanese Prime Minister Salim Hoss. The year also brought the deaths of several rights activists, including the Reverends Cecil L. 'Chip' Murray and James Lawson Jr.; Dexter Scott King; Hydeia Broadbent; and David Mixner. Business leaders who died this year include Indian industrialist Ratan Tata; Home Depot co-founder Bernard 'Bernie' Marcus; financier Jacob Rothschild; and Daiso retail chain founder Hirotake Yano. O.J. Simpson's 'trial of the century' over the 1994 killings of his ex-wife and her friend exposed divisions over race and law enforcement and brought an intersection of sports, crime, entertainment and class that was hard to turn away from. His death in April ended a life that had become defined by scrutiny of the killings. Other noteworthy sports figures who died include basketball players Jerry West and Dikembe Mutombo; baseball players Willie Mays and Fernando Valenzuela; and gymnastics coach Bela Karolyi. The music industry lost a titan in producer Quincy Jones, who died in November. His many contributions included producing Michael Jackson's 'Thriller' album and working with hundreds of other musicians over a long and storied career. Other artists and entertainers who died this year include: actors James Earl Jones, Chita Rivera, Donald Sutherland, Gena Rowlands, Louis Gossett Jr., Shelley Duvall, Kris Kristofferson, Linda Lavin, Sandra Milo, Anouk Aimee, Carl Weathers, Joyce Randolph, Maggie Smith, Tony Todd, Shannen Doherty and Song Jae-lim; musicians Sergio Mendes, Toby Keith, Phil Lesh, Melanie, Dickey Betts, Françoise Hardy, Fatman Scoop, Duane Eddy and Frankie Beverly; filmmakers Roger Corman and Morgan Spurlock; authors Faith Ringgold, Nikki Giovanni and N.

Trinidad and Tobago declares state of emergency over gang violence	PORT OF SPAIN, TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO — Trinidad and Tobago on Monday declared a state of emergency due to a spike in murders by criminal groups, a move that grants police the ability to conduct searches and arrests without a warrant over the next two days. 'The circumstances warranting the declaration of the public emergency are based on the advice of the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service to the National Security Council of heightened criminal activity which endangers the public safety,' Prime Minister Keith Rowley's office said in a statement. Attorney General Stuart Young said the country recorded 61 murders in December, bringing the year's total up to 623 homicides, an increase from 577 homicides recorded in 2023 and 599 in 2022. Young, speaking at a press conference in the capital Port of Spain, said the public emergency would not include a curfew or restrict people's movements, to minimize the economic impact of the declaration. The authorization for police to carry out searches and arrests without a warrant may be extended up to seven days by a judge, Young said. At the same press conference, Minister of National Security Fitzgerald Hinds called the spike in violent murders 'an epidemic' for the country of 1.4 million residents, with 551 shootings recorded this year, as of December 26. Recent incidents of violence included a man shot and killed after leaving a police station in Port of Spain on Saturday, and a shooting in Laventille, Trinidad, on Sunday that killed five. A state of emergency had previously been declared for the same reason in 2011, but the application was limited to 'hotspots' of crime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7919436.html	2024-12-30T19:27:04-08:00	
Jimmy Carter made eradicating Guinea worm disease his mission	JARWENG, SOUTH SUDAN — Nobel Prize-winning peacemaker Jimmy Carter spent nearly four decades waging war to eliminate an ancient parasite plaguing the world's poorest people. Rarely fatal but searingly painful and debilitating, Guinea worm disease infects people who drink water tainted with larvae that grow inside the body into worms up to 3 feet long. The noodle-thin parasites then burrow their way out, breaking through the skin in burning blisters. Carter made eradicating Guinea worm a top mission of The Carter Center, the nonprofit he and his wife, Rosalynn Carter, founded after leaving the White House. The former president rallied public health experts, billionaire donors, African heads of state and thousands of volunteer villagers to work toward eliminating a human disease for only the second time in history. 'It'd be the most exciting and gratifying accomplishment of my life,' Carter told The Associated Press in 2016. Even after entering home hospice care in February 2023, aides said Carter kept asking for Guinea worm updates. Carter died Sunday at age 100. Thanks to the Carters' efforts, the worms that afflicted an estimated 3.5 million people in 20 African and Asian countries when the center launched its campaign in 1986 are on the brink of extinction. Only 14 human cases were reported across four African nations in 2023, according to The Carter Center. The World Health Organization's target for eradication is 2030. Carter Center leaders hope to achieve it sooner. That meant recently returning to Jarweng, in a remote area of South Sudan in northeastern Africa. The village of 500 people hadn't seen Guinea worm infections since 2014 until Nyingong Aguek and her two sons drank swampy water while traveling in 2022. A fourth person also got infected. 'Having the worm pulled out is more painful than giving birth,' said Aguek, pointing to scars where four worms emerged from her left leg. The center's staff and volunteers walked house to house distributing water filters and teaching people to inspect dogs, which can also carry the parasite. 'If someone's hurt, The Carter Center will help,' said villager Mathew Manyiel, listening to a training session while checking his dog for symptoms. An audacious plan In the mid-1980s, global health agencies were otherwise occupied, and heads of state largely overlooked the illness afflicting millions of their citizens. Carter was still defining the center's mission when public health experts who had served in his administration approached him with a plan to eliminate the disease. Only a few years had passed since the WHO declared in 1979 that smallpox was the first human disease to be eradicated worldwide. Guinea worm, the experts told Carter, could become the second. 'President Carter, with a political background, was able to do far more in global health than we could do alone,' said Dr. William Foege, who led the U.S. Centers for Disease Control's smallpox eradication program and the CDC itself before becoming The Carter Center's first executive director. Those who worked closely with Carter suspect Guinea worm's toll on poor African farmers resonated with the former president, who lived as a boy in a Georgia farmhouse without electricity or running water. 'Nobody was doing anything about it, and it was such a spectacularly awful disease,' said Dr. Donald Hopkins, an architect of the campaign who led the center's health programs until 2015. 'He could sympathize with all of these farmers being too crippled from Guinea worm disease to work.' Changing behaviors There's no vaccine that prevents Guinea worm infections or medicine that gets rid of the parasites. Treatment has changed little since ancient Greece. Emerging worms are gently wound around a stick as they're slowly pulled through the skin. Removing an entire worm without breaking it can take weeks. So instead of scientific breakthroughs, this campaign has relied on persuading millions of people to change basic behaviors. Workers from the center and host governments trained volunteers to teach neighbors to filter water through cloth screens, removing tiny fleas that carry the larvae. Villagers learned to watch for and report new cases — often for rewards of $100 or more. Infected people and dogs had to be prevented from tainting water sources. The goal was to break the worm's life cycle — and therefore eliminate the parasite itself — in each endemic community, eventually exterminating Guinea worm altogether. The campaign became a model for confronting a broader range of neglected tropical diseases afflicting impoverished people with limited access to clean water, sanitation and health care. Expanding its public health mission, the center has supplied training, equipment and medicines that helped 22 countries eliminate at least one disease within their borders. Mali became the latest in May 2023 when the WHO confirmed it had ended trachoma, a blinding eye infection. Haiti and the Dominican Republic are working to eliminate malaria and mosquito-borne lymphatic filariasis by 2030. Countries in Africa and the Americas are pursuing an end to river blindness by 2035. A personal mission Having a former U.S. president lead the charge brought big advantages to a nonprofit that relied on private donors to fund its initiatives. Carter's fundraising enabled the center to pour $500 million into fighting Guinea worm. He persuaded manufacturers to donate larvicide as well as nylon cloth and specially made drinking straws to filter water. His visits to afflicted villages often attracted news coverage, raising awareness globally. 'He went to so many of the localities where people were afflicted,' said Dr. William Brieger, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins University who spent 25 years in Africa. 'The kind of attention that was drawn to him for getting on the ground and highlighting the plight of individual people who were suffering, I think that made an important difference.' Carter first saw the disease up close in 1988 while visiting a village in Ghana where nearly 350 people had worms poking through their skin. He approached a young woman who appeared to be cradling a baby in her arm. 'But there was no baby,' Carter wrote in his 2014 book 'A Call to Action.' 'Instead, she was holding her right breast, which was almost a foot long and had a worm emerging from the nipple.' Carter used his status to sway other leaders to play larger roles. Some heads of state got competitive, spurred by the center's charts and newsletters that showed which countries were making progress and which lagged behind. Worms in a war zone In 1995, Carter intervened when a civil war in southern Sudan made it too dangerous for workers to reach hundreds of hotspots. The ceasefire he negotiated enabled the center and others to distribute 200,000 water filters and discover more endemic villages. Carter's efforts not only stopped transmissions in much of what became South Sudan but also built trust across communities that resulted in a 'significant peace dividend,' said Makoy Samuel Yibi, the young nation's Guinea worm eradication director. Pakistan in 1993 became the first endemic country to eliminate human cases. India soon followed. By 1997, the disease was no longer found in Asia. By 2003, cases reported worldwide were down to 32,000 — a 99% decline in less than two decades. Some setbacks frustrated Carter. Visiting a hospital packed with suffering children and adults amid a 2007 resurgence in Ghana, Carter suggested publicly that the disease should perhaps be renamed 'Ghana worm.' 'Ghana was deeply embarrassed,' Hopkins said. Ghana ended transmission within three more years. Even more inspiring: Nigeria, which once had the most cases in the world, reached zero infections in 2009. 'That was a thunderclap,' Hopkins said. 'It was important throughout Africa, throughout the global campaign.' To the last worm Even after being diagnosed with brain cancer, Carter remained focused: 'I'd like the last Guinea worm to die before I do,' he told reporters in 2015. Despite dwindling cases, total success has proven elusive. Historic flooding and years of civil war have displaced millions of people who lack clean drinking water across central Africa. Of the 13 total cases reported in 2023, nine occurred in Chad, where infections in dogs have made the worms harder to eliminate. 'These are the most challenging places on planet Earth to operate in,' said Adam Weiss, who has directed the campaign since 2018. 'You need eyes and ears on the ground every single day.' The campaign still relies on about 30,000 volunteers spread among roughly 9,000 villages. Staying vigilant can be difficult now that cases are so rare, Weiss said. 'I would still like to think we will beat the timeline,' Weiss said of the 2030 eradication goal. 'The Carter Center is committed to this, obviously, no matter what.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-made-eradicating-guinea-worm-disease-his-mission-/7919423.html	2024-12-30T18:48:07-08:00	
South Korean court issues arrest warrant for Yoon	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A South Korean court has approved an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, who faces insurrection charges over his attempt to impose martial law earlier this month. The Seoul Western District Court issued the warrant on Tuesday, marking the first time a sitting South Korean president has faced arrest, according to local media. Yoon was impeached in mid-December, suspending his presidential powers while the Constitutional Court reviews the case. In addition to impeachment, Yoon is being investigated for insurrection and abuse of power by a joint government investigation team. Authorities sought the arrest warrant after Yoon ignored three summonses for questioning. Yoon’s legal team has refused to cooperate with the investigation, arguing that the impeachment trial should take priority over any criminal proceedings. It is not clear when any arrest attempt will be made or how aggressive authorities will be in attempting to execute the warrant. The Presidential Security Service has so far prevented investigators from entering the presidential office compound or Yoon’s official residence for court-approved searches, citing security and military considerations. South Korean presidents are generally immune from prosecution while in office, except for cases involving rebellion or treason. Yoon declared martial law on December 3 – the first such decree since South Korea became a democracy in the 1980s – but lawmakers overturned the order within hours. Yoon has said the martial law declaration was necessary to send a 'strong message' to his rivals, whom he accused of being North Korea sympathizers obstructing his agenda. The impeachment process is also filled with uncertainty. The Constitutional Court has 180 days to rule on Yoon’s removal, but with three judicial seats vacant, all six remaining justices must unanimously agree to uphold the impeachment. Efforts to appoint new judges have stalled, with the opposition threatening to impeach successive acting presidents who refuse to approve them, fueling fears of a prolonged political deadlock that has already hurt South Korea's economy. Last week, the value of the South Korean won hit a 16-year low against the U.S. dollar, raising concerns about higher energy import costs and increased consumer prices.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-court-issues-arrest-warrant-for-yoon-/7919426.html	2024-12-30T18:26:41-08:00	
Judge denies sentencing delay for former US Senator Bob Menendez	NEW YORK — Former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez, a Democrat from New Jersey, will be sentenced on corruption charges as scheduled at the end of January, and his wife's trial will be moved from January to February, a judge said Monday. U.S. District Judge Sidney H. Stein in Manhattan rejected Menendez's request to delay his sentencing for his conviction on bribery and other charges until his wife finishes her trial on similar charges, possibly sometime in March. The Democrat's lawyers last week requested a new sentencing date on the grounds that the jury chosen to hear the case against his wife, Nadine Menendez, would be tainted if jurors heard about the outcome of the former senator's sentencing during the trial. Menendez, 70, was convicted in July of 16 corruption charges brought by prosecutors who asserted that he used his power in the Senate over a five-year stretch through 2022 to do favors that benefitted three New Jersey businessmen who paid him with gold bars, hundreds of thousands of dollars in cash, and a Mercedes-Benz convertible. Two of the businessmen were convicted along with Menendez while a third pleaded guilty, cooperated with the government, and testified against him. Nadine Menendez has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Originally set to stand trial with her husband, her trial was put off after a breast cancer diagnosis led to surgery. Stein on Monday moved her January 21 trial to February 5. Her husband, as scheduled, will be sentenced on January 29.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-denies-sentencing-delay-for-former-us-senator-bob-menendez/7919421.html	2024-12-30T18:00:41-08:00	
Serbian court convicts parents of teen who fatally shot 10 at Belgrade school	BELGRADE, Serbia — A court in Serbia on Monday convicted the parents of a teenage boy who last year shot dead nine pupils and a school guard and wounded six more people in a school in central Belgrade. The Higher Court in Belgrade sentenced Vladimir Kecmanovic, father of the boy, to 14 years, six months in prison for 'grave acts against public safety' and for child neglect. The mother, Miljana Kecmanovic, was sentenced to three years in prison for child neglect but was acquitted on charges of illegal possession of weapons. The shooter, identified as Kosta Kecmanovic, was 13 years old when he committed the crime and therefore too young to face a trial, according to Serbian law. His parents were detained soon after the shooting and charged for failing to keep the weapons out of reach of their son. The massacre at the Vladislav Ribnikar primary school in central Belgrade on May 3, 2023, shocked the Balkan nation, which was used to crises but had not dealt with a mass school shooting. The couple's lawyer, Irina Borovic, said the verdict came as no surprise 'because public pressure was enormous, and the expectations were huge.' Borovic said she would appeal the verdicts. Ninela Radicevic, who lost her daughter in the shooting, said, 'We are not satisfied because no one was held responsible for the murder of nine children' and the school guard. The boy used his father's guns to shoot fellow pupils and others. He walked into the school and first opened fire in a hall before heading into a classroom, where he continued shooting. Elementary schools in Serbia enroll students 7 to 15 years old. Police have said that the teenager called them after the shooting and calmly said what he had done. He has been held in a specialized institution since the shooting and testified at his parents' trial. The proceedings were closed to the public except for the reading of the verdicts. Also convicted and sentenced to 15 months in prison for false testimony was a shooting instructor who worked at a range where the boy practiced. The school shooting was followed the next day by another mass killing in villages outside Belgrade. Uros Blazic, 21, took an automatic rifle and opened fire at multiple locations, killing nine people and wounding 12. He was sentenced earlier this month to 20 years in prison. The back-to-back shootings triggered a wave of street protests and a crackdown on widespread illegal gun ownership.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbian-court-convicts-parents-of-teen-who-fatally-shot-10-at-belgrade-school/7919416.html	2024-12-30T17:31:58-08:00	
Times Square ball takes final test for New Year's Eve	NEW YORK — The crystal-covered ball that descends down a pole in Times Square to ring in the new year was taken for a test run Monday, as New York City officials laid out their plans for the iconic New Year's Eve event. Officials flipped a switch to light up the dazzling geodesic sphere — weighing almost 6 tons (5.4 metric tons) and featuring 2,688 crystal triangles — which then successfully ran up and down a 139-foot (42-meter) pole atop the One Times Square skyscraper. Monday's rehearsal was just one of many pre-ball drop promotional events: On Sunday, fistfuls of confetti were flung toward crowds in the square in anticipation of the 3,000 pounds (1,360 kilograms) of brightly colored paper that will fill the air at midnight on New Year's Eve. Some of those pieces will include wishes written by people ahead of 2025. 'This is the crossroads of the entire planet right here in New York City,' New York City Mayor Eric Adams said earlier Monday as he and law enforcement leaders discussed their plans for security at the celebration. 'People tune in at different locations and celebrate as we do the countdown for the New Year.' Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch said that although there were 'no specific credible threats' to the Times Square celebrations, 'the public can expect to see a tremendous amount of police resources deployed throughout the area and across the city.' Plans range from 'dedicated pickpocket teams' patrolling the square to sealing off all mailboxes and vending machines in the area. A New Year's Eve ball has dropped in Times Square for nearly 120 years, with the exception of 1942 and 1943 when nightly 'dimouts' occurred during World War II to protect the city from attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/times-square-ball-takes-final-test-for-new-year-s-eve-/7919403.html	2024-12-30T17:24:19-08:00

California to require insurers to boost home coverage in wildfire-prone areas	SACRAMENTO, California — Insurance companies that stopped providing home coverage to hundreds of thousands of Californians in recent years as wildfires became more destructive will have to again provide policies in fire-prone areas if they want to keep doing business in California under a state regulation announced Monday. The rule will require home insurers to offer coverage in high-risk areas, something the state has never done, Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara's office said in a statement. Insurers will have to start increasing their coverage by 5% every two years until they hit the equivalent of 85% of their market share. That means if an insurer writes 20 out of every 100 state policies, it would need to write 17 in a high-risk area, Lara's office said. Major insurers like State Farm and Allstate have stopped writing new policies in California because of fears of massive losses from wildfires and other natural disasters. In exchange for increasing coverage, the state will let insurance companies pass on the costs of reinsurance to California consumers. Insurance companies typically buy reinsurance to avoid huge payouts in case of natural disasters or catastrophic loss. California is the only state that doesn't already allow the cost of reinsurance to be borne by policyholders, according to Lara's office. Opponents of the rule say that could hike premiums by 40% and doesn't require new policies to be written at a fast enough pace. The state did not provide a cost analysis for potential impact on consumers. 'This plan is of the insurance industry, by the insurance industry, and for the industry,' Jamie Court, president of Consumer Watchdog, said in a statement. The requirement is under review by the Office of Administrative Law before it takes effect within 30 days. 'Californians deserve a reliable insurance market that doesn't retreat from communities most vulnerable to wildfires and climate change,' Lara said in a statement. 'This is a historic moment for California.' Earlier rule The new rule is part of Lara's effort to persuade insurers to continue doing business in the nation's most populous state. He unveiled another rule earlier this month to let insurers consider climate change when setting their prices. Insurance companies had said that because they couldn't consider climate change in their rates, many chose to either pause or restrict new business in the state. The new rule to include climate change in rates will take effect later this week. The ultimate goal of the new rules is to get homeowners out of the California Fair Access to Insurance Requirements (FAIR) Plan, which often serves as the last resort when insurance companies stop providing coverage for those living in areas threatened by wildfires, Lara's office said. The plan could help a homeowner fulfill insurance requirements imposed by mortgage companies, but it is mainly designed as a temporary safety net with basic coverage until policyholders find a more permanent option. The number of people on California's FAIR plan more than doubled between 2020 and this year, reaching nearly 452,000 policies. Wildfires have always been part of life in California, where it rains for only a few months out of the year. But as the climate has gotten hotter and dryer, it has made those fires much larger and more intense. Of the top 20 most destructive wildfires in state history, 14 have occurred since 2015, according to the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection. The 2018 fire in Paradise, California, killed 85 people and destroyed about 11,000 homes, and some residents have struggled to find home insurance since. Steve Crowder, the town's mayor, lost his house and business. Since then, his family has rebuilt their home but struggled to find insurance. The Crowders were forced to enroll in FAIR Plan earlier this month. Despite paying roughly $5,000, the mayor said his home is insured for roughly $100,000 less than its value and the house's contents are only half-covered. 'You couldn't rebuild what you got for what it's insured for,' he said. His constituents face similar problems. With policies skyrocketing from roughly $1,200 annually before the Camp Fire to $5,000 now — or even up to $20,000 a year for large homes — some have abandoned attempts to find coverage. In the years after the Camp Fire, Crowder said the town has successfully brought back some insurers after enacting new ordinances with high standards to keep structures safe, such as rules regarding clearances, vegetation and fences. While the mayor welcomed the state's new rules, he said he and his constituents are skeptical things will improve. 'Anything that will help get insurance in California, period, is helpful,' he said, but added: 'Let's wait and make sure it happens before we get excited.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-to-require-insurers-to-boost-home-coverage-in-wildfire-prone-areas/7919396.html	2024-12-30T16:44:07-08:00	
French prime minister unveils recovery plan for cyclone-devastated Mayotte	Paris — French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou arrived Monday in the Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte to unveil a recovery plan three weeks after Cyclone Chido brought devastation. Bayrou, recently appointed prime minister, also updated the death toll to 39 but urged caution, saying the final number could range from 'a few dozen to a few hundred.' Days after the cyclone, Mayotte's prefect, François-Xavier Bieuville, had warned of the possibility of 'several hundred or even a few thousand' deaths. Bayrou's visit follows that of French President Emmanuel Macron as some Mayotte residents have alleged that the French government had long neglected them. The prime minister said a draft emergency law aiming to rebuild Mayotte within two years will be submitted to parliament in January. And he said local authorities agreed to ban the rebuilding of informal settlements, home to an unknown number of migrants from African nations in the region who hope to make their way to Europe. Many of the makeshift homes were torn apart by the storm. Bayrou outlined plans to restore electricity to all homes by late January, supported by 200 workers and emergency generators. Water production is expected to reach pre-cyclone levels by January 6, with upgrades to the distribution network set for completion by mid-2025. He also announced the deployment of 200 Starlink antennas for emergency communications. Education also faces disruption, with many schools destroyed. Classes will resume January 13, with special provisions for exam students. Temporary schooling in mainland France is also being considered. In Mozambique, also hit by Cyclone Chido, the National Institute of Risk and Disaster Management said Sunday that 94 people had been killed. Malawi's presidential office said the death toll there had risen to 13.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-prime-minister-unveils-recovery-plan-for-cyclone-devastated-mayotte-/7919385.html	2024-12-30T16:35:21-08:00	
Four UK Post Office scandal victims recognized in honors list	LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM — King Charles III announced awards for actors Stephen Fry and Carey Mulligan, as well as victims of Britain's Post Office scandal in the country's traditional New Year Honours on Tuesday. London Mayor Sadiq Khan joined U.K. television icon and writer Fry, 67, and former England football manager Gareth Southgate in being knighted in the latest list. Fry, best known for playing his idol Oscar Wilde in the 1997 movie Wilde and the hit British television comedy Blackadder was recognized for services to mental health awareness, the environment and to charity. Fry, who has a form of bipolar disorder, has spoken openly about his struggles with manic depression. He told the PA news agency that he felt 'startled and enchanted' after receiving the letter informing him of his knighthood. 'When you are recognized, it does make you feel a bit 'crikey,' but I think the most emotional thing is that when I think of my childhood, and my dreadful unhappiness and misery and stupidity, and everything that led to so many failures as a child,' Fry added. Khan, one Britain's most high-profile Asian-origin politicians, was honored for political and public service. The 54-year-old has led the U.K. capital since 2016 and earlier this year became the first London mayor to win a third term. Four victims of the Horizon IT scandal, in which hundreds of subpostmasters were wrongly convicted of fraud, theft and false accounting because of faulty software, were also honored. Lee Castleton, Jo Hamilton, Christopher Head and Seema Misra were recognized with an Order of the British Empire (OBE) for their work campaigning for justice. The previous Conservative government unveiled legislation in March to exonerate those wrongly prosecuted and compensate them after a TV drama renewed focus on their plight. More than 1,200 people received honors in the latest list, which was decided by an honors committee. The king or other leading members of the royal family hand out the awards at ceremonies during the year. 'Each and every day, ordinary people go out and do extraordinary things for their communities,' said Prime Minister Keir Starmer. 'The New Year Honours List celebrates more of these unsung heroes, and I thank them for their incredible contribution,' he added. Mulligan received an award as a Commander of the British Empire (CBE) while Nobel Prize-winning novelist Kazuo Ishiguro was made a Companion of Honor for services to literature. Southgate was knighted for services to football after leading England to the finals of the past two European Championships, as well as to the 2018 World Cup semifinal. His eight-year reign ended without a major trophy after England's 2-1 defeat to Spain in July's European final. Also honored were several British athletes who competed in the Paris Olympics this summer, including 800-meter gold medalist Keely Hodgkinson and two-time Olympic mountain bike champion Tom Pidcock. The king also personally honored two of his medical staff after he was diagnosed with cancer in February. His general practitioner, Douglas Glass, who was also attending Queen Elizabeth II at her death in Balmoral in September 2022, and his consultant physician, Richard Leach, were both awarded with levels of the Royal Victorian Order.	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-uk-post-office-scandal-victims-recognized-in-honors-list/7919383.html	2024-12-30T16:29:28-08:00	
Militancy surge in Pakistan kills 1,600 civilians, security forces	islamabad — A new report on Monday said escalating terrorist bombings and gun attacks in Pakistan resulted in the deaths of more than 1,600 civilians and security personnel in 2024. An independent think tank based in Islamabad released its annual report amid a wave of deadly violence in the country, primarily affecting the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan provinces bordering Afghanistan. Pakistan asserts that outlawed transnational groups have orchestrated violence from Afghan sanctuaries, with their activities intensifying since the Taliban’s August 2021 takeover of the neighboring country. The Center for Research and Security Studies (CRSS) stated in its Monday report that 60% of the overall casualties in 2024 were among civilians. It noted that the Pakistani military, intelligence, police and other law enforcement agencies 'suffered the highest number of terror attacks and fatalities in a decade.' According to the report, 685 security personnel have been killed since January 1, the most since Pakistan lost nearly 800 security personnel in militant attacks and counterterrorism operations in 2014. The resurgence of militancy is attributed to two key groups: Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) and the Baloch Liberation Army (BLA). Both organizations, designated as international terrorist organizations by the United Nations and the United States, routinely claim attacks staged against security forces and other targets. TTP is active mainly in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, while BLA and its allied ethnic Baloch separatist groups conduct insurgent attacks in Balochistan. While the Pakistani government did not immediately respond to the report, an army spokesman addressed a live televised news conference on Friday, revealing that '383 brave officers and soldiers were martyred' during counterterrorism operations across Pakistan in 2024. He did not, however, provide further details. The Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Counter Terrorism Department released a statement Monday reporting that militant attacks and security operations against insurgents resulted in the deaths of nearly 150 provincial police force members, with an additional 230 sustaining injuries. CRSS has documented approximately 250 fatalities among Pakistani security forces, including troops, in Balochistan alone. Remaining fatalities were attributed to Punjab and Sindh provinces, as well as other regions. The nonprofit think tank stated that its report was based on open-source data and official statements. It routinely publishes reports highlighting the security situation in Pakistan and says on its website that the organization is working to promote research and nonpartisan analysis. The Taliban government has denied allegations that Afghan soil is being utilized by individuals permitted to threaten neighboring countries, including Pakistan. Last week, Taliban authorities announced that Pakistani jets had struck several locations within the eastern Afghan border province of Paktika, claiming the strikes resulted in nearly 50 fatalities. The statement identified victims as 'refugees' from Pakistan. While Islamabad has refrained from publicly responding to the alleged airstrikes, Pakistani security officials instantly provided anonymous confirmation of the cross-border bombardment, stating that the strikes targeted TTP hideouts, resulting in the elimination of over two dozen key militants and training infrastructure. The Taliban’s Defense Ministry on Saturday issued a statement claiming that its border forces retaliated by striking several targets on the Pakistani side of the border. Independent examination of both Pakistani and Afghan claims remains inconclusive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militancy-surge-in-pakistan-kills-1-600-civilians-security-forces-/7919142.html	2024-12-30T16:05:05-08:00

Mali court jails dissident over remarks about Burkina junta	Bamako, Mali — A Malian court jailed a political figure Monday for making critical remarks about the military rulers of neighboring Burkina Faso, a legal source and his family said. Issa Kaou N'Djim, who previously supported Malian junta leader Assimi Goita before distancing himself, made the comments during a program aired on local television station Joliba TV News. N'Djim was sentenced by a court in the capital, Bamako, to two years in prison, one of which was suspended. He was also ordered to pay a fine of 1 million CFA francs ($1,600) by the national anti-cybercrime office, the legal source said. Mali authorities closed Joliba TV News in November because of the remarks and handed the private television station a six-month ban earlier this month. N'Djim's jailing follows the disappearance Saturday morning of another opposition figure, Ibrahim Naby Togola, who was due to hold a news briefing that day. According to a statement from his political party, Togola was abducted by 'unidentified armed individuals,' then taken to an unknown destination in a black vehicle with tinted windows. The 'Call of February 20, 2023 to save Mali ' opposition platform, which Togola belonged to, called for his 'immediate and unconditional release.' Mali and Burkina Faso have been ruled by military regimes since coups in 2020 and 2022, respectively, and are both embroiled in political and security crises. The military-led governments have taken repressive measures against the press, suspending a number of foreign media outlets and imprisoning or silencing journalists or critics. Together with fellow junta-led Niger, they formed the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) confederation. N'Djim previously was one of the vice presidents of the National Transitional Council (CNT), the legislative body of Mali 's military rulers. He later said he favored a rapid end to the so-called transitional period intended to return power to elected civilians. In December 2021, N'Djim was handed a six-month suspended prison sentence for 'undermining the credit of the state,' following comments deemed 'subversive' on social media. He was dismissed from the CNT and prevented from leaving the country several times.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-court-jails-dissident-over-remarks-about-burkina-junta/7919123.html	2024-12-30T15:26:37-08:00

December border arrests remain down, ending Biden's term at lowest level	SAN DIEGO — Arrests for illegally crossing the border from Mexico in December are little changed from a month earlier, a U.S. official said Monday, hovering near the lowest levels since July 2020 and indicating that an anticipated surge ahead of Donald Trump's inauguration as president hasn't happened. There were about 44,000 arrests during December as of Monday morning, suggesting the month will end close to the 46,612 arrests made in November, according to a senior U.S. Customs and Border Protection official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the count is preliminary and has not been made public. December will mark the sixth straight month that arrests for illegal crossings were less than the monthly average in 2019, the official said. It also signals that the final full month of President Joe Biden's presidency will be at or near the lowest during his four years in office. Asked to comment on the latest numbers, the Homeland Security Department released a statement by Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, that said 'swift and effective implementation' of asylum restrictions in June resulted in another month below the 2019 average. 'This sustained success is the result of strong border enforcement, extensive engagement with our foreign partners, and the delivery of safe and lawful pathways that continue to provide humanitarian relief under our laws,' Mayorkas said. Arrests fell by about half from an all-time high of 250,000 in December 2023 after Mexican officials increased enforcement within their own borders and by about half again after Biden introduced severe asylum limits. Texas' Rio Grande Valley was the second-busiest corridor for illegal crossings in December, up from fifth in November, likely a reflection of tactical decisions by smuggling organizations and Mexican law enforcement, the official said. San Diego remained the busiest corridor for illegal crossings. El Paso, Texas, was third and Tucson, Arizona, was fourth. For the second straight month, those allowed to enter the country through official border crossings are expected to exceed arrests for illegal crossings, reflecting the Biden administration's approach to create and expand legal pathways while severely restricting asylum for those who cross the border illegally. Most legal entries are done through an online appointment system called CBP One, which grants 1,450 slots a day. Trump has focused on launching mass deportations after taking office Jan. 20 but he and his aides have also emphasized border measures, touting a possible return of a policy to make asylum-seekers wait in Mexico for court hearings in U.S. immigration courts. Trump said in September that he planned to end CBP One appointments.	https://www.voanews.com/a/december-border-arrests-remain-down-ending-biden-s-term-at-lowest-level-/7919120.html	2024-12-30T15:22:38-08:00	
Losing your kids to doom scrolling? Greece is building government app for that	ATHENS, GREECE — Greece announced plans on Monday to enhance parental oversight of mobile devices in 2025 through a government-operated app that will help get digital age verification and browsing controls. Dimitris Papastergiou, the minister of digital governance, said the Kids Wallet app, due to launch in March, was aimed at safeguarding children under the age of 15 from the risks of excessive and inappropriate internet use. The app will be run by a widely used government services platform and operate in conjunction with an existing smartphone app for adults to carry digital identification documents. 'It's a big change,' Papastergiou told reporters, adding that the app would integrate advanced algorithms to monitor usage and apply strict authentication processes. 'The Kids Wallet application will do two main things: It will make parental control much easier, and it will be our official national tool for verifying the age of users,' he said. A survey published this month by Greek research organization KMOP found that 76.6% of children ages 9-12 have access to the internet via personal devices, 58.6% use social media daily, and 22.8% have encountered inappropriate content. Many lack awareness of basic safety tools such as the block and report buttons, authors of the study said. Papastergiou said the government was hoping to have the children's app preinstalled on smartphones sold in Greece by the end of 2025. While facing criticism from some digital rights and religious groups, government-controlled apps and online services — many introduced during the pandemic — are generally popular in Greece, as they are seen as a way of bypassing historically slow bureaucratic procedures. The planned online child protection measures would go further than regulations already in place in several European countries by introducing more direct government involvement. They will also help hold social media platforms more accountable for enforcing age controls, Papastergiou said. 'What's the elephant in the room? Clearly, it's how we define and verify a person's age,' he said. 'When you have an [online] age check, you might have a 14-year-old claiming they are 18. Or you could have someone who actually is a genuine 20-year-old. … Now we can address that.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/losing-your-kids-to-doom-scrolling-greece-is-building-a-government-app-for-that/7919111.html	2024-12-30T15:03:53-08:00	
Hotel fire in popular Bangkok tourist area kills 3 foreigners	Bangkok — A fire broke out at a hotel near Bangkok's Khao San Road, a popular tourist destination, killing three foreigners and injuring several other people, Thai police said Monday. The three who died in the fire Sunday night were all foreign tourists, Police Colonel Sanong Saengmanee told The Associated Press. One was found dead at the scene and the other two died after being transported to the hospital. Police later identified the dead as a Brazilian woman, a Ukrainian man and an American man. Five people were hospitalized, including a Japanese woman in critical condition. The others were identified as a Japanese man, two Germans and a Thai electrician. The fire erupted on the 5th floor of the six-story Ember Hotel, police said. Khao San Road is a popular backpacker street in the Thai capital that's also known for its lively nightlife. The flames were eventually contained, and the cause of the blaze is under investigation. Seventy-five people were staying at the hotel at the time of the fire. Sreekanth Kolamala, a 37-year-old Indian national who lives in Singapore and was in Thailand on vacation, witnessed the rescue operation and said that firefighters 'broke the glass over there to try to pull people out.' Sanga Ruangwattanakul, the president of the Khao San Road Business Association, stood outside The Ember Hotel on Monday, looking at the damage. He said 20,000 people were expected at a New Year's Eve countdown event Tuesday night. 'Now everybody’s scared about what happened and they’re scared it will affect the event tomorrow. But definitely there’s no worry because we already had a meeting with the police station and we have over 150 police and district staff to cover on Khao San Road for security,' he said. Bangkok Governor Chadchart Sittipunt also emphasized the importance of safety following the incident, especially as New Year's Eve approaches, with fireworks and other celebrations planned across the city.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hotel-fire-in-popular-bangkok-tourist-area-kills-3-foreigners/7919114.html	2024-12-30T15:00:13-08:00	
In Carter's hometown, a long-anticipated goodbye begins	PLAINS, GEORGIA — In Jimmy Carter's tiny hometown of Plains, Georgia on Monday, the former U.S. president's death was only beginning to sink in, even if friends and neighbors have been bracing for it since he went into hospice care nearly two years ago. Those in the rural hamlet — a half block of buildings nestled in the shadow of massive agricultural silos — said the centenarian's death was sad, but in the same breath they recounted fond memories of time spent with the former U.S. leader and global humanitarian. Carter's commitment to Plains, where he was born 100 years ago and died Sunday at the modest home he had shared with his wife Rosalynn, is made clear by its residents — most knew him personally or have a family member who did. 'It'll always be Jimmy Carter's hometown,' Kelly Kight, who was born and raised in Plains, population approximately 600, told AFP as she placed commemorative bows near her flower shop on the main strip. She said that more than an occasion for mourning, it was a day for remembrance of the Nobel Peace Prize laureate and his humanitarian work in particular. Electric leaf blowers and tree trimmers provided a background chorus for the town, accustomed to gussying up quickly since it was first thrust into the national spotlight as Carter ran for president nearly 50 years ago and most recently when he began hospice care. 'When he entered hospice, it kind of became a waiting game for all of the hometown people here in the community,' said Kight, whose family owned a peanut warehouse across from the Carter's and whose father grew up alongside the Carter children. Carter, who had an unlikely political ascent from peanut farmer to the Oval Office, is almost omnipresent in Plains — his boyhood home, high school and the former train depot which served as his 1976 presidential campaign headquarters are now museums under the National Park Service. The town's main drag is festooned with an enormous banner heralding Carter as the 39th president, while a goofy peanut statue with Carter's trademark grin sits near his church, Maranatha Baptist. There, he welcomed visitors from around the world as he taught Sunday school into his 90s. ‘A very fine gentleman’ Carter's death has long been anticipated — he was last seen in public looking very frail at his wife's funeral in November 2023, after 77 years of marriage. His funeral schedule will include a stop at his boyhood farm, before his remains are taken onward to Atlanta and Washington, then returned to his hometown for interment. Kimberly Franklin, who also grew up in Plains, was leaving the Dollar General grocery store Monday, where she would sometimes encounter the Carters shopping like everyday people. 'I am very sad,' the residential nurse, 56, told AFP, adding that Carter was just 'an awesome guy.' Like most in Plains, she had a deeply personal memory of Carter, a profoundly religious Baptist who attended her baptism. Several blocks away, Plains resident Johnny Jones sat in a rocking chair on his porch, across from the high school Carter attended and in clear view of downtown. He was waiting for the bustle to begin. Jones watched as the town came to a standstill for Rosalynn Carter's funeral and as swarms of journalists descended on Plains when Jimmy Carter announced his hospice care. Jones recounted with a twinkle in his eye that the media waited two weeks for Carter to die, then turned around and left. 'I thought he was a very fine gentleman,' said Jones, an 85-year-old military retiree who liked Carter. 'He did a lot for Plains.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-carter-s-hometown-a-long-anticipated-goodbye-begins-/7919087.html	2024-12-30T14:42:04-08:00	
Scores of Ukrainian and Russian prisoners head back home after swap	KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine and Russia carried out a new exchange of prisoners of war on Monday, with the two sides bringing home a combined total of more than 300 former captives. Kyiv brought home 189 former captives, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Russia's Defense Ministry said, while the Russian ministry said 150 Russian servicemen were returning home. The Russian ministry said the captives had been released in Belarus, Moscow's close ally in the 34-month-old war with Ukraine, and would be transferred to Russia. Reuters Television footage in Ukraine showed waiting spouses and some servicemen, many wrapped in blue and yellow national flags, weeping openly as they were reunited well after dark outside a building. A child's incredulous voice resounded over a mobile telephone: 'Dad, is that you?' 'My son is 5 years old now. The last time I saw him, he was 2 years old,' said Serhii, who was captured by Russian forces at the Azovstal steel mill in the southern port of Mariupol, which withstood a siege for nearly three months in 2022. 'That's why my son probably didn't recognize me. I used to have a beard and hair. I lost 20 kg' [44 pounds]. For some former captives, the return to freedom involved adjustment. 'Even now, I'm holding my hands behind my back. It has become a habit of mine,' said journalist Roman Borshch, 29. 'Now, I have to get used to being a free person again.' Video posted by the Russian Defense Ministry showed smiling servicemen on a bus, some calling their families. 'We'll soon be home. How are the children? How is our boy?' one man said. 'I am overwhelmed by emotion,' said another. 'I still can't quite believe that this has happened, that I am back home, that the ministry made such efforts, that we are remembered and valued.' Zelenskyy thanked United Arab Emirates authorities and other partners for facilitating the swap. The UAE acknowledged it helped arrange the exchange. 'The return of our people from Russian captivity is always very good news for each of us. And today is one of such days: our team managed to bring 189 Ukrainians home,' Zelenskyy said on Telegram. There was no immediate explanation for why more Ukrainians than Russians were listed as released. The freed Ukrainians included civilians who had been in Russian captivity. Zelenskyy said the returning Ukrainians included soldiers, sergeants and officers from front-line areas, and two civilians who had been captured in Mariupol. Denys Prokopenko, commander of the 12th Special Forces Azov Brigade that defended the Azovstal mill, said 11 of his men were among those returning. Prokopenko was brought home in an earlier swap. The Ukrainian body overseeing prisoner swaps said it was the 59th exchange between the two sides since Russia's February 2022 invasion of its smaller neighbor. The swap brought to 3,956 the number of Ukrainian detainees brought home. It said those brought home this year included Ukrainian nationals serving what it described as 'so-called sentences' imposed by Russian courts for various offenses. In the last swap in October, also carried out with assistance from the United Arab Emirates, Russia and Ukraine each brought home 95 detainees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/scores-of-ukrainian-and-russian-prisoners-head-back-home-after-swap-/7919089.html	2024-12-30T14:40:59-08:00	
US Treasury: Chinese hackers remotely accessed workstations, documents	WASHINGTON — Chinese hackers remotely accessed several U.S. Treasury Department workstations and unclassified documents after compromising a third-party software service provider, the agency said Monday. The department did not provide details on how many workstations had been accessed or what sort of documents the hackers may have obtained, but it said in a letter to lawmakers revealing the breach that 'at this time there is no evidence indicating the threat actor has continued access to Treasury information.' 'Treasury takes very seriously all threats against our systems, and the data it holds,' the department said. 'Over the last four years, Treasury has significantly bolstered its cyber defense, and we will continue to work with both private and public sector partners to protect our financial system from threat actors.' The department said it learned of the problem on Dec. 8 when a third-party software service provider, BeyondTrust, flagged that hackers had stolen a key used by the vendor that helped it override the system and gain remote access to several employee workstations. The compromised service has since been taken offline, and there's no evidence that the hackers still have access to department information, Aditi Hardikar, an assistant Treasury secretary, said in the letter Monday to leaders of the Senate Banking Committee. The department said it was working with the FBI and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, and that the hack had been attributed to Chinese culprits. It did not elaborate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-chinese-hackers-remotely-accessed-workstations-documents-/7919093.html	2024-12-30T14:39:25-08:00	
US agency takes steps to protect Nevada mountains from energy development	The Biden administration on Monday took steps to protect the Ruby Mountains in northeast Nevada from oil, gas and geothermal development for 20 years. The Interior Department said it had approved an application by the U.S. Forest Service to withdraw 264,442 acres of federal lands in the Ruby Mountains from mineral and geothermal leasing. The application's approval removes the lands from development for up to two years and kicks off a 90-day period for the public to comment on the proposed 20-year withdrawal. The proposal comes three weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, who has vowed to step up domestic oil and gas production, succeeds President Joe Biden, a Democrat who has sought to conserve large amounts of public land. The lands would remain open to mining claims, the Interior Department said. 'The Ruby Mountains are cherished by local communities for their scenic value, cultural heritage, numerous wildlife and benefit to the local economy through a thriving outdoor recreation industry,' Interior Secretary Deb Haaland said in a statement. 'Today, we are taking an important and sensible step to pause new oil and gas leasing to ensure that we have the science and public input necessary to inform proposed protections of the Ruby Mountains area for future generations.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agency-takes-steps-to-protect-nevada-mountains-from-energy-development/7919099.html	2024-12-30T14:37:15-08:00	
Finland discovers anchor ‘dragging track’ amid suspicions of Russian subsea sabotage	LONDON — Finnish authorities have discovered anchor drag marks running for several kilometers across the Baltic seabed as they probe the recent severing of important power and internet cables. 'With the underwater operations, we have been able to identify the dragging track at the seabed from the beginning to the end,' said Detective Chief Inspector Sami Paila of Finland's National Bureau of Investigation in a Sunday press release. 'The track is dozens of kilometers in length. For the time being, the possible location where the anchor came off has not been established.' The announcement marks the latest in a series of similar incidents in recent months and comes as NATO warns of a growing threat of unconventional Russian attacks in the region. The underwater Estlink 2 power cable linking Finland and Estonia was damaged last Wednesday, along with several data cables. Estonia’s power supply was significantly reduced because of the damage. On Thursday, Finnish police and coast guard officers boarded the Eagle S, a Cook Islands-registered tanker carrying Russian oil from the port of Ust-Luga before sailing it into Finnish territorial waters. The vessel is currently being held off the town of Porvoo, 40 kilometers east of Helsinki. Its crew is being detained on suspicion of 'aggravated criminal mischief.' Russian officials have said nothing about the Finnish accusations or impounding of the Eagle S. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Pesokov said Friday, 'I can't say anything for sure. This is a highly specific issue, which is hardly the prerogative of the presidential administration.' Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Friday it was too early to determine whether the damage was deliberate. 'Four cables have been broken,' Stubb told reporters in Helsinki. 'We were able to get the situation under control and locate the ship in question, bring it to Finnish waters and begin a criminal proceeding. There has been substantial damage through the cables.' Finland suspects the Eagle S is part of Russia’s so-called 'shadow fleet' of aging vessels used to evade Western sanctions on its oil exports, imposed in the wake of Moscow’s February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The damage to the Estlink 2 cable is the latest in a series of similar incidents in the Baltic Sea. In November, a Chinese bulk carrier, the Yi Peng 3, was suspected of severing two fiber-optic data cables in Swedish waters with its anchor. China refused to allow a Swedish prosecutor to board the vessel, which has since departed the Baltic. Last year, the Balticconnector gas pipeline linking Estonia and Finland was damaged. Ten months later, China said a Hong Kong-registered vessel had caused the damage in a storm. Finland was skeptical of the admission. Estonia has called for international maritime laws to be updated to protect infrastructure. 'The situation that is now at the Baltic Sea, where the anchors have been dropping several times in a row — it can’t be by accident,' Estonian Justice Minister Liisa Pakosta told Reuters. 'These kinds of situations are not typical, not only for our region, but also for other regions in the world. So, [given] the technological developments that we have, we think that it is a good idea to look over international law to make these investigations more smooth.' NATO said Friday it would boost its presence in the Baltic Sea. The alliance staged maritime drills in the Baltic earlier last month as a show of force amid escalating tensions with Moscow. However, formulating a response to unconventional — also known as hybrid — attacks is complex, said Charly Salonius-Pasternak, an analyst with the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. 'If there begins to be clear attribution by states against other state actors, then just taking it on the chin and being resilient in the long run is going to be probably deeply unsatisfying,' he told VOA. '[But] if you attribute it or you blame someone, will you intensify the circle? And what are you going to do about it? Because you clearly cannot use the same ‘retributionary tools,’ as it were, against Russia and China. At least not yet, I think.' Estonian authorities said it could take until August to repair the damage to the Estlink 2 cable. The Estonian navy and Swedish coast guards have stepped up surveillance patrols in the area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-discovers-anchor-dragging-track-amid-suspicions-of-russian-subsea-sabotage/7919073.html	2024-12-30T14:12:23-08:00

Venezuela fines TikTok $10 million over viral challenge deaths	Caracas, Venezuela — Venezuela's highest court Monday fined TikTok $10 million in connection with viral challenges that authorities say left three adolescents dead from intoxication by chemical substances. Supreme Tribunal of Justice Judge Tania D'Amelio said that the popular video-sharing app had been negligent in failing to implement 'necessary and adequate measures' to stop the spread of content encouraging the challenges. TikTok, which is owned by China's ByteDance, was ordered to open an office in the South American country and given eight days to pay the fine or face 'appropriate' measures. Venezuela would use the money to 'create a TikTok victims fund, intended to compensate for the psychological, emotional and physical damages to users, especially if these users are children and adolescents,' D'Amelio said. The company told the court that it 'understands the seriousness of the matter,' she said. According to Venezuelan authorities, three adolescents died and 200 were intoxicated in schools across the country after ingesting chemical substances as part of social media 'challenges.' TikTok's huge global success has been partly built on the success of its challenges — a call that invites users to create videos featuring dances, jokes or games that sometimes go viral. The app has been accused of putting users in danger with the spread of hazardous challenge videos. TikTok's official policy prohibits videos promoting self-harm and suicide. In November, President Nicolas Maduro threatened 'severe measures' against TikTok if it did not remove content related to what he called 'criminal challenges.' Parliament is considering laws regulating social networks, which Maduro said after his disputed reelection in July was being used to promote 'hate,' 'fascism' and 'division.' He has accused Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of social media platform X, of orchestrating 'attacks against Venezuela.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-fines-tiktok-10-million-over-viral-challenge-deaths-/7919020.html	2024-12-30T13:16:50-08:00

VOA Mandarin: Outlook for US-China relations in the New Year	As former President Donald Trump is set to return to the White House, Reuters reported on Dec. 24 that China will issue a record 3 trillion yuan in government bonds next year in an effort to rescue its crisis-stricken economy and mitigate the impact of potential significant tariff hikes by Trump. This marks the latest sign of China’s concern that bilateral relations may quickly plunge to a new low during Trump's second term. For a long time, a basic assumption about U.S.-China relations has been that even when relations deteriorate, they won’t fall too far. Looking ahead to the new year, Trump is set to bring an unusually hard-line, hawkish team on China into the White House.

Biden declares day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter	Washington — President Joe Biden has declared Jan. 9 a national day of mourning for former President Jimmy Carter and announced Monday that all federal government offices would be closed that day as a show of respect for the 39th U.S. president, who died Sunday at the age of 100. 'I call on the American people to assemble on that day in their respective places of worship, there to pay homage to the memory of President James Earl Carter, Jr.,' Biden said in a formal declaration issued late Sunday. 'I invite the people of the world who share our grief to join us in this solemn observance.' Biden inadvertently revealed, in March of last year at a national Democratic party event, that Carter – also a Democrat – had asked him to deliver his eulogy. In his statement late Sunday, Biden described Carter as 'a man of character, courage, and compassion, whose lifetime of service defined him as one of the most influential statesmen in our history.' He continued: 'He embodied the very best of America: A humble servant of God and the people. A heroic champion of global peace and human rights, and an honorable leader whose moral clarity and hopeful vision lifted our nation and changed our world.' The solemn event Jan. 9 in the nation’s capital will draw all the living American presidents and a host of dignitaries. Biden also ordered the U.S. flag to be flown at half-staff for 30 days from the date of Carter’s death at public buildings, military posts and overseas U.S. government buildings. Biden has bestowed upon Carter a state funeral, which is a three-stage, multi-day event coordinated by the U.S. military that includes observances in the capital, plus ceremonies in the home state of the deceased. Carter has repeatedly expressed his wish to be buried in his front yard in the small town of Plains, Georgia beside his wife of 77 years, Rosalynn. She died in 2023. Carter was in hospice care for two years before his own death, and his death at 100 made him the longest-living former president in U.S. history. In Washington, services are likely to be held at the imposing Washington National Cathedral, which has played host to several previous state funerals, including that of former presidents Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford and George H. W. Bush. Carter’s funeral is likely to be attended by all four living American presidents — that list includes Bill Clinton, Barack Obama, former and future President Donald Trump, and Biden. Biden, at 82, is now the eldest statesman of that group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-declares-day-of-mourning-for-former-president-jimmy-carter/7919000.html	2024-12-30T12:45:26-08:00

Syria’s election timetable sparks debate	WASHINGTON — Syrians and legal experts have been reacting to comments by Syria’s de facto leader that new elections following the ouster of Bashar al-Assad's regime could take four years and drafting a new constitution up to three years. In an interview with the Saudi news channel al-Arabiya, Ahmad al-Sharaa, also known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, stated on Sunday that holding elections in Syria requires sufficient time to lay the groundwork for a comprehensive political process. His remarks ignited a debate among Syrians and legal experts who believe he and his group, Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), could exploit the transition period to consolidate their control over the country, or that the proposed timeline is realistic given Syria’s fragmented state after more than a decade of conflict. HTS, formerly al-Qaida’s branch in Syria, led the 11-day rebel offensive that toppled the Assad regime on Dec. 8. HTS has controlled an enclave in the country’s northwestern province of Idlib in recent years. Anwar al-Bunni, co-founder and executive director of the Syrian Center for Legal Studies and Research, described the proposed timetable for a new constitution and elections as logical. 'We cannot talk about a new constitution and elections while Syrians are scattered all over the world,' he told VOA, referring to those Syrians who have been displaced due to the country’s 13-year conflict. According to the United Nations, over 14 million Syrians have left their homes since 2011, with 7.2 million internally displaced, while nearly 5.5 million are refugees in neighboring countries and elsewhere. Bunni said Syrian refugees should return home to secure decent shelter and basic services, enabling them to contemplate and discuss their political future. 'A 3- to 5-year period is realistic before Syrians are fully prepared to vote and participate in politics,' he said. 'We need an independent election commission and political parties, and for that to happen, you need a great deal of preparation.' Ammar Abdulhamid, a Syrian American activist who serves as a parliamentarian and director of policy at the World Liberty Congress, agreed that a 4-year wait before holding elections was not unreasonable, 'as long as the transitional government is sufficiently diverse, and the interim governance structure remains responsive to criticism while respecting basic human rights. 'However, if this 4-year period is used to fill key positions and institutions with Islamist loyalists to HTS and Al-Sharaa, we may be looking at a planned takeover of governance — a shift from one form of sectarian authoritarianism, justified in the name of protecting minorities, to another, justified by claims of majority entitlement,' Abdulhamid wrote on X, adding that 'the composition of the upcoming transitional government will be a key indicator of where things are headed.' HTS has appointed a caretaker government composed of loyalists to manage affairs until March 1, 2025, the new government’s own deadline for initiating a transitional process. In his al-Arabiya interview, al-Sharaa said a national dialogue conference, tentatively scheduled to be held in January, will determine the structure of the transitional government. Bunni said there must be a legal framework for the country to function in the transitional period, noting the need for a provisional constitution. Other experts argue that establishing a participatory system of governance for all Syrians should begin by including all stakeholders in the transitional process. 'Syrians are not naive,' said Bassam Alahmad, executive director of Syrians for Truth and Justice. 'They know where HTS comes from, and they would want to ensure that they have a say during this crucial time.' He told VOA he didn’t believe Syrians were as overly concerned about the 4-year timetable. Instead, their focus was on what might unfold during that period. 'If the HTS has the intention and political will to establish an inclusive system that allows all Syrians, including Kurds and other groups, to actively participate in their country’s affairs now and in the future, I don’t think people would mind if the process took a couple years,' Alahmad said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-election-timetable-sparks-debate/7918897.html	2024-12-30T11:52:36-08:00	
Jimmy Carter's passing met with mixed reactions in China, Taiwan	Taipei, Taiwan — The passing of former United States President Jimmy Carter was met with mixed reactions in China and Taiwan. Chinese President Xi Jinping praised him for helping to establish diplomatic ties between Beijing and Washington while some in Taiwan remain critical of his decision to sever official ties with the island to this day. In a message to U.S. President Joe Biden, Xi expressed his 'deep condolences' and described Carter as 'the driving force behind the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States.' Former President Carter 'made important contributions to the development of China-U.S. relations and the friendly exchanges and cooperation between the two countries,' China’s state-run broadcaster CCTV cited Xi as saying. 'China-U.S. ties are among the most import bilateral relationships in the world,' Xi said, adding that Beijing is willing to work with Washington to advance bilateral relations. During Carter’s time in office between 1977 and 1981, the U.S. established formal diplomatic relations with China, advancing the groundwork laid by former U.S. President Richard Nixon and Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in the 1970s. In 1979, his administration recognized the People’s Republic of China (PRC) as the sole legal government of China and acknowledged Beijing’s position that Taiwan is a part of China. He also agreed to sever official ties with Taiwan, charting a new course in what would later become one of the world’s most complicated and consequential relationships. Much like Xi, many Chinese commentators and internet users praised Carter’s contribution to normalizing U.S.-China relations. Hu Xijin, the former editor-in-chief of China’s state-run tabloid Global Times, said Carter helped to lay the foundation of the 'friendly and cooperative relationship' between China and the U.S. by acknowledging China’s position on Taiwan. While 'his starting point is to safeguard the interests of the United States, during his term, China and the United States of America's common interests have been highlighted and highlighted,' he wrote in a statement on the Chinese social media platform Weibo. Other Chinese internet users also characterized Carter as being more friendly to China than other U.S. leaders. 'Of all the living former U.S. presidents, he is one of the friendlier to China,' Chinese netizen 'Sheng Yuan Ran Dong' from Heilongjiang province wrote on Weibo. 'He was a good pacifist. He opened the floodgates of history by establishing diplomatic relations between China and the U.S. His good qualities are truly worth highlighting,' Chinese internet user 'Abu from the magic forest' from Jiangxi Province wrote on Weibo. Lu Chao, the director of Liaoning University’s Institute of American and East Asian Studies, said Carter not only facilitated the establishment of U.S.-China relations, he also maintained very good relations with then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping. 'Former President Carter made the right choice that was in line with the trend of global development, the fundamental interests of the United States, and the interests of China. It is still praised by Chinese and American people,' he told VOA. Mixed reactions in Taiwan While reactions from China to Carter’s passing were largely positive, perceptions about the former U.S. president’s complicated legacy in Taiwan were mixed. In a short post on social media platform X, Taiwan’s Presidential Office extended 'sincere condolences' to Carter’s family and the American people. Meanwhile, Taiwan’s main opposition party Kuomintang (KMT), said on X that while Carter will be remembered in Taiwan 'for his decision to derecognize the Republic of China' — Taiwan’s official name — they 'admire his advocacy worldwide for affordable housing, conflict resolution, refugees, and other causes.' In contrast to the moderate official response, some Taiwanese internet users criticized the former U.S. president for allowing China to become a major threat to Taiwan. While 'the U.S. is now Taiwan’s strong ally, [Carter and Kissinger] are the ones who made China so difficult to deal with. From the two of them to the Obama era, Washington’s pro-China approach allowed China to build economic growth for decades and that’s the reason why the Chinese Communist Party can keep bullying Taiwan,' Taiwanese internet user Pbtato Hsieh wrote in a Facebook post. After the Carter administration severed ties with Taiwan in 1979, the U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), later the same year, which allows Washington to maintain close unofficial ties with Taipei while requiring the U.S. to 'provide Taiwan with arms of a defensive character' to 'a sufficient self-defense capacity.' The TRA also reaffirmed the United States commitment to preserving the human rights of the people of Taiwan. At the time the legislation was signed into law by then President Carter, Taiwan was under martial law and under the control of one single party, the KMT, which was led by Chiang Ching-kuo. Taiwan continued under martial law until 1989 and held its first direct presidential elections in 1996. While Carter signed the TRA into law, some Taiwanese analysts say the former president shouldn’t be credited for providing the architecture that upholds the unofficial relations between Taiwan and the U.S. today. 'It was because the government in Taiwan under Chiang Kai-shek and some grassroots Taiwanese American organizations maintained good relations with members of the U.S. Congress, so the Congress passed a piece of legislation that was more favorable toward Taiwan,' Chen Fang-yu, a political scientist at Soochow University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. 'The Taiwan Relations Act was not directly related to Carter,' he added. Despite his complicated legacy of handling Washington’s relations with Taiwan, other experts say Carter’s decision to sign the TRA into law still helped to build the 'first blocks of today’s U.S.-Taiwan relationship.' 'The de facto relationship that the U.S. and Taiwan have today began with him,' said Lev Nachman, a political scientist at National Taiwan University. 'I don't think he was the one who sat down and wrote the TRA, but he most certainly is the one who saw through the process of creating this new relationship with Taiwan after the recognition switch,' he told VOA by phone.

Over 13,000 Mozambicans flee to Malawi amid post-election violence	NSANJE, MALAWI — Thousands of Mozambicans have fled to Malawi to escape violence triggered by the disputed October presidential election. The latest statistics show that Malawi has received about 13,000 refugees from Mozambique in recent weeks, many of them women and children. Authorities say that the number is expected to rise. Sofia Jimu, the traditional leader of the Tengani area in Mozambique, is among those who fled to Malawi. She said a lack of food is the main challenge at the evacuation center where she is staying, adding that three children collapsed because of hunger in just one day. However, she said, the following day she was given 150 bags of maize flour and four bags of beans to distribute to people at the center. The political tension in Mozambique escalated after the Constitutional Council confirmed Daniel Chapo, presidential candidate for the ruling Frelimo Party, as the winner of the Oct. 9 election. Runner-up Venancio Mondlane, presidential candidate for the opposition Podemos party, disputes the results. Plataforma Decide, a monitoring group in Mozambique, says more than 200 people have been killed since post-election protests started in October. Dominic Mwandira, the commissioner for Nsanje district in Malawi, told VOA on Sunday that the biggest challenge is a lack of resources to take care of the asylum-seekers currently staying in makeshift camps near the border. 'In terms of food and then nonfood items, tents, issues of water, they are several,' he said. 'But we are happy that partners have started coming in, the government is coming in to support these people.' He said organizations offering help include the Malawi Red Cross Society and Plan International. Jane Mweziwina, a program area manager for Plan International in Malawi, told reporters they are working to ensure new arrivals are protected. 'You know women, people with disabilities and children are always vulnerable when they are in a crisis like this. So, our advice to the leadership is that they take special consideration for these special groups of people in terms of accommodation, security, even in terms of food,' she said. Malawi authorities say plans are under way to relocate asylum-seekers to a more spacious center. In the meantime, Malawi’s Department for Refugees and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in Malawi are conducting a joint assessment to identify the needs of asylum-seekers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-13-000-mozambicans-flee-to-malawi-amid-post-election-violence/7918832.html	2024-12-30T10:44:33-08:00	
Five years on, WHO urges China to share COVID origins data	Geneva — The World Health Organization on Monday implored China to share data and access to help understand how COVID-19 began, five years on from the start of the pandemic that upended the planet. COVID-19 killed millions of people, shredded economies and crippled health systems. 'We continue to call on China to share data and access so we can understand the origins of COVID-19. This is a moral and scientific imperative,' the WHO said in a statement. 'Without transparency, sharing, and cooperation among countries, the world cannot adequately prevent and prepare for future epidemics and pandemics.' The WHO recounted how on Dec. 31, 2019, its country office in China picked up a media statement from the health authorities in Wuhan concerning cases of 'viral pneumonia' in the city. 'In the weeks, months and years that unfolded after that, COVID-19 came to shape our lives and our world,' the U.N. health agency said. 'As we mark this milestone, let's take a moment to honor the lives changed and lost, recognize those who are suffering from COVID-19 and Long COVID, express gratitude to the health workers who sacrificed so much to care for us, and commit to learning from COVID-19 to build a healthier tomorrow.' Earlier this month, the WHO's Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus addressed the issue of whether the world was better prepared for the next pandemic than it was for COVID-19. 'The answer is yes, and no,' he told a press conference. 'If the next pandemic arrived today, the world would still face some of the same weaknesses and vulnerabilities that gave COVID-19 a foothold five years ago. 'But the world has also learnt many of the painful lessons the pandemic taught us and has taken significant steps to strengthen its defenses against future epidemics and pandemics.' In December 2021, spooked by the devastation caused by COVID, countries decided to start drafting an accord on pandemic prevention, preparedness and response. The WHO's 194 member states negotiating the treaty have agreed on most of what it should include but are stuck on the practicalities. A key fault-line lies between Western nations with major pharmaceutical industry sectors and poorer countries wary of being sidelined when the next pandemic strikes. While the outstanding issues are few, they include the heart of the agreement: the obligation to quickly share emerging pathogens, and then the pandemic-fighting benefits derived from them such as vaccines. The deadline for the negotiations is May 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/five-years-on-who-urges-china-to-share-covid-origins-data/7918778.html	2024-12-30T10:08:32-08:00	
India rocket launches space docking mission	NEW DELHI — India launched a rocket Monday carrying two small spacecraft to test docking in space, a critical step for the country's dreams of a space station and a manned moon mission. The mission is 'vital for India's future space ambitions,' Jitendra Singh, the country's science and technology minister, said in a statement ahead of the launch, which was broadcast live by the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced plans last year to send a man to the moon by 2040. The PSLV-C60 rocket, which blasted off Monday evening at the Sriharikota launch site with shooting flames as it soared into the night sky, included two 220-kilogram (485-pound) satellites. ISRO has dubbed the mission SpaDeX, or Space Docking Experiment. 'PSLV-C60 successfully launches SpaDeX and 24 payloads,' it said in a statement. The mission is intended to 'develop and demonstrate the technology needed for rendezvous, docking, and undocking of two small spacecraft,' it added. The technology is 'essential' for India's moon plans, it added, calling it a 'key technology for future human spaceflight and satellite servicing missions.' It will involve a 'precision rendezvous,' maneuvering satellites orbiting Earth at speeds of 28,800 kilometers per hour (17,895 miles per hour). Their relative velocities will be reduced to 0.036 kph (0.22 mph) to 'merge to form a single unit in Space,' ISRO said. The world's most populous nation has a comparatively low-budget aerospace program that is rapidly closing in on the milestones set by global space powers. 'Through this mission, India is marching towards becoming the fourth country in the world to have space docking technology,' ISRO added, after Russia, the United States and China. India has flexed its spacefaring ambitions in the last decade with its space program growing considerably in size and momentum, matching the achievements of established powers at a much cheaper price tag. In August 2023, it became just the fourth nation to land an unmanned craft on the moon after Russia, the United States and China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-rocket-launches-space-docking-mission/7918747.html	2024-12-30T09:52:50-08:00

Argentine judge charges 5 people over death of former One Direction star Liam Payne	BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — An Argentine judge confirmed charges against five people in connection with the death of Liam Payne, a former member of musical group One Direction, and ordered preventive prison for two of them for having supplied him with drugs. A judicial officer confirmed Monday the judge's decision and said that one of the two people ordered to be put under preventive prison — a form of pre-trial detention — was an employee of the hotel in Buenos Aires where Payne stayed until he died after falling from the balcony of his room in October. The officer said the other person was a waiter Payne met in a restaurant. The officer, who requested not to be identified as a condition to talk about the ruling, said that both face charges for supplying drugs and they need to present themselves before the judge. The judge also charged three other people with manslaughter, including a businessman who was with Payne in Argentina and two managers of the hotel. The official said that they were not ordered to be held under preventive prison. In November, prosecutors filed initial charges against three people, but they didn't reveal their names. Payne fell from his room's balcony on the third floor of his hotel in the upscale neighborhood of Palermo in the Argentine capital. His autopsy said he died from multiple injuries and external bleeding. Prosecutors also said that Payne's toxicological exams showed that his body had 'traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescribed antidepressant' in the moments before his death. Payne's autopsy showed his injuries were caused neither by self-harm nor by physical intervention of others. The document also said that he did not have the reflex of protecting himself in the fall, which suggests he might have been unconscious. Prosecutors in Argentina also ruled out the possibility that Payne died by suicide. One Direction was among the most successful boy bands of recent times. It announced an indefinite hiatus in 2016 and Payne — like his former bandmates Zayn Malik, Harry Styles, Niall Horan, and Louis Tomlinson — pursued a solo career.	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentine-judge-charges-5-people-over-death-of-former-one-direction-star-liam-payne-/7918726.html	2024-12-30T09:34:29-08:00	
State funeral to be held for former President Jimmy Carter	Atlanta, GA. — VOA Correspondent Kane Farabaugh conducted numerous interviews with Jimmy Carter on issues ranging from his time in the White House to his post-presidential career as a promoter of global health and democracy. Highlights of those interviews are contained in this report. A state funeral will be held January 9 for former U.S. President Jimmy Carter who died Sunday at the age of 100. U.S. President Joe Biden scheduled the state funeral for Carter to be held the same day as National Day of Mourning. Biden has also directed flags at public buildings to be displayed at half-staff for 30 days in honor of Carter. Carter was a peanut farmer and a Georgia state governor before becoming president. When he took the oath of office as president of the United States on January 20, 1977, he promised a 'government as good as its people.' He presided over four turbulent years. Rising inflation and growing unemployment marred the domestic priorities of his administration. He scored victories in foreign policy with a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel and the Panama Canal treaty. However, a hostage crisis in Iran dominated his final years in the White House and contributed to his defeat in the 1980 general election. But Carter liked to say the end of his presidency in 1981 was the beginning of a new life, traveling the world 'fighting disease, building hope, and waging peace.' 'It has turned out to open up for me and my wife, Rosalynn, a new arena of excitement and unpredictability and adventure and challenge and gratification,' he told VOA. As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than 80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. 'I look upon the Carter Center work as an extension of what I tried to do as president. You know, we brought peace between Israel and Egypt. We opened up a humongous relationship with Latin America with the Panama Canal treaty,' he said. 'So what I have done since then has been kind of an extension. But I do not think there is any doubt that when I won the Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, it was because of the work of the Carter Center. So, I would be perfectly satisfied to have a legacy based on peace and human rights. I mean, who would not?' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres praised Carter’s 'commitment to international peace and human rights. 'President Carter will be remembered for his solidarity with the vulnerable, his abiding grace, and his unrelenting faith in the common good and our common humanity,' Guterres said in a statement. 'His legacy as a peacemaker, human rights champion and humanitarian will endure.' The White House released a statement from President Biden and first lady Jill Biden on Sunday. It said, 'Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.' President-elect Donald Trump posted on Truth Social: 'The challenges Jimmy faced as President came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude.' Carter's journey to the White House began in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he was born October 1, 1924. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, where he helped develop the post-World War II nuclear submarine fleet, Carter returned to his hometown in 1953 to run the family peanut-farming business. He entered politics in the 1960s, serving two terms as a Georgia legislator before becoming the state's 76th governor from 1971 to 1975. In the 1976 presidential election, Carter, a Democrat, ran against Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency after Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Carter narrowly defeated Ford to become president. The high point of Carter's presidency came in 1978. Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland to negotiate a peace treaty. 'When I became president, there had been four wars between Arabs and Israelis in the previous 25 years, with the Egyptians in the leadership supported by the Soviet Union,' he said. 'They were the only country that could really challenge Israel militarily. And we had success in getting a treaty between Israel and Egypt … not a word of which has ever been violated.' Carter also negotiated a treaty turning control of the Panama Canal over to the Panamanian government and normalized diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. But in 1979 the primary focus for Carter's administration turned to Iran, where a revolution led by religious clerics toppled the government of the U.S.-backed shah, who eventually fled to the United States, where he received treatment for cancer. On November 4, 1979, militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the deposed shah stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage; 13 were released weeks later. Five months into the crisis, in April 1980, Carter authorized a complex military operation to free the remaining hostages. Dubbed Operation Eagle Claw, the plan called for several helicopters and military aircraft to stage at a site in the Iranian desert. Carter, who approved the plan, explained to VOA that the helicopters carrying members of the U.S. military's elite Delta Force were to fly from there to the U.S. embassy in Tehran, free the hostages and return to the waiting aircraft that would fly them out of Iran. 'The minimum number of helicopters required would be six very large helicopters. So I decided to send eight. One of the helicopters, in an inexplicable way, turned around and went back to the aircraft carrier. Another one went down in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. The third one developed a hydraulic leak and ran into one of the C-130 airplanes,' he said. The aborted mission ended in failure. Eight U.S. military members and one Iranian civilian died as a result of the crash. Walter Mondale, Carter’s vice president, told VOA that day was the lowest point of their administration. 'When that rescue mission failed and lives were lost. I mean, that was just ... we were just morose that day and for some time after that,' Mondale said. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of the operation. The failure of the mission damaged Carter's credibility with the American public. The incident occurred seven months before the 1980 presidential election and contributed to Carter's defeat to challenger Ronald Reagan. 'The exact anniversary of the hostages being taken was Election Day,' Carter said. 'Of course, the news media were completely obsessed with the anniversary of the hostages being taken and the fact that I had not been able to get them out. That was the number one issue that caused me to fail.' The hostages were freed the day Reagan became president. In 1981, Carter returned to Plains, unsure about the direction of his post-presidential life. His plans for a library and museum were initially modest. 'I envisioned it to be a tiny thing, where I would have an office and some nice buildings in Atlanta. And that anyone in the world that had an ongoing conflict or potential conflict could come to me and I would help them mediate the dispute and stop a war,' he said. The Carter Center, under his direction, monitored more then 80 troubled elections and mediated disputes ranging from a nuclear standoff with North Korea in 1994, to a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan in 1999. The center is also a leader in promoting health and fighting disease in the poorest parts of the planet. In one of many interviews with Voice of America, Carter reflected on his life in and out of the White House. He said the greatest part of his legacy wasn't his accomplishments as president or the Nobel Peace Prize, but the eradication of Guinea worm disease. 'There's only been one disease in the history of humankind, ever eradicated, and that was smallpox,' he said, 'So Guinea worm is going to soon be the second disease in history, to be wiped off the face of the Earth.' Thanks to Carter’s efforts, only 13 cases of Guinea worm were recorded in 2022. Carter led an active life until the age of 99, surviving brain cancer in 2015. Declining health and the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic kept him confined to his hometown of Plains in his final years. Jimmy Carter last appeared in public during funeral services for his wife, Rosalynn, in November 2023. In one of his last public media appearances, Carter shared with VOA his hopes for the Carter Center’s future. 'I would like to see the United States in the future strive to be the number one champion in the world of peace and human rights and environmental quality, and I would say treating everyone equal,' he said. 'If we could do that, we would have a real superpower in the country I love very much.' Jimmy Carter lived the longest of any occupant of the White House, and his 77-year marriage to wife Rosalynn is the longest of any president and first lady. Although his final resting place will be on the grounds of his home in Plains, Georgia, the work and the words of Carter live on in the pages of the dozens of books he authored throughout his life. It includes his memoirs, a fiction novel, controversial examinations of the Middle East, and a collection of his favorite poems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/state-funeral-to-be-held-for-former-president-jimmy-carter/7918676.html	2024-12-30T09:26:02-08:00	
Appeals court upholds $5 million award in sexual abuse verdict against president-elect Trump	New York — A federal appeals court on Monday upheld a jury's finding in a civil case that Donald Trump sexually abused a columnist in an upscale department store dressing room in the mid-1990s. The 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a written opinion upholding the $5 million award that the Manhattan jury granted to E. Jean Carroll for defamation and sexual abuse. The longtime magazine columnist had testified at a 2023 trial that Trump turned a friendly encounter in spring 1996 into a violent attack after they playfully entered the store's dressing room. Trump skipped the trial after repeatedly denying the attack ever happened. But he briefly testified at a follow-up defamation trial earlier this year that resulted in an $83.3 million award. The second trial resulted from comments then-President Trump made in 2019 after Carroll first made the accusations publicly in a memoir. In its ruling, a three-judge panel of the appeals court rejected claims by Trump's lawyers that trial Judge Lewis A. Kaplan had made multiple decisions that spoiled the trial, including his decision to allow two other women who had accused Trump of sexually abusing them to testify. The judge also had allowed the jury to view the infamous 'Access Hollywood' tape in which Trump boasted in 2005 about grabbing women's genitals because when someone is a star, 'you can do anything.' 'We conclude that Mr. Trump has not demonstrated that the district court erred in any of the challenged rulings,' the 2nd Circuit said. 'Further, he has not carried his burden to show that any claimed error or combination of claimed errors affected his substantial rights as required to warrant a new trial.' In September, both Carroll, 81, and Trump, 78, attended oral arguments by the 2nd Circuit. Steven Cheung, a Trump spokesperson, said in a statement that Trump was elected by voters who delivered 'an overwhelming mandate, and they demand an immediate end to the political weaponization of our justice system and a swift dismissal of all of the Witch Hunts, including the Democrat-funded Carroll Hoax, which will continue to be appealed.' Roberta Kaplan, a lawyer who represented Carroll during the trial and is not related to the judge, said in a statement: 'Both E. Jean Carroll and I are gratified by today's decision. We thank the Second Circuit for its careful consideration of the parties' arguments.' The first jury found in May 2023 that Trump sexually abused Carroll and defamed her with comments he made in October 2022. That jury awarded Carroll $5 million. In January, a second jury awarded Carroll an additional $83.3 million in damages for comments Trump had made about her while he was president, finding that they were defamatory. That jury had been instructed by the judge to accept the first jury's finding that Trump had sexually abused Carroll. Trump testified for under three minutes at the second trial and was not permitted to challenge conclusions reached by the May 2023 jury. Still, he was animated in the courtroom throughout the two-week trial, and jurors could hear him grumbling about the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/appeals-court-upholds-5-million-award-in-sexual-abuse-verdict-against-president-elect-trump-/7918643.html	2024-12-30T08:59:53-08:00	
Trump endorses Johnson to stay on as House Speaker after government funding turmoil	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump is endorsing House Speaker Mike Johnson as he prepares to fight to keep his role leading Republicans in Congress. Trump said Monday in a post on his social media network that Johnson 'is a good, hard working, religious man' and said the Louisiana Republican 'will do the right thing, and we will continue to WIN.' 'Mike has my Complete & Total Endorsement,' Trump wrote. Johnson's continued leadership seemed in jeopardy after a fight over a federal funding plan put the government at risk for a pre-Christmas shutdown. Though a deal was reached, the dispute showed the limits of Johnson's influence and exposed cracks in his party's support. The speaker's first two funding plans collapsed as Trump, who does not take the oath of office until Jan. 20, interceded with calls to suspend or lift the government debt ceiling. Johnson, who has worked hard to stay close to Trump, convinced the president-elect that he would meet his demands to raise the debt limit in 2025. Trump had remained quiet about Johnson's fate before a Jan. 3 leadership vote for over a week, even as some Republicans have said they would not support Johnson for the role.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-endorses-johnson-to-stay-on-as-house-speaker-after-government-funding-turmoil/7918609.html	2024-12-30T08:13:39-08:00	
Kenya grapples with protests despite political unity efforts	Nairobi — In 2024, protests by young Kenyans sent shock waves through the country’s political scene, forcing the government to drop proposed taxes and fire several ministers. The youth movement highlighted the challenges Kenya faces as the government tries to increase revenues from citizens who are grappling with the high cost of living and are angry about corruption and what they see as attempts to stifle dissent. As the year comes to an end, President William Ruto’s government and a large section of Kenyan youth are still at odds over the direction the country is taking. The discontent erupted in June as parliament considered a bill that would increase taxes on certain food items and other sectors in the economy to help repay foreign loans and fund development programs. Lawmakers passed the bill, leading protesters storming the parliament buildings and burning a section of it. Ruto, seeing the public anger, declined to sign the bill into law. Nairobi has also witnessed protests against alleged police brutality. Rights groups say Kenyan security forces killed at least 65 people during protests or while in detention during 2024. On Monday, hundreds of protesters took to the streets of Nairobi to demand the release of Kenyans allegedly abducted from their homes and other places. According to human rights groups, at least 10 young critics of the government were kidnapped by unknown men in the last few weeks. The police have denied their officers were behind the abductions. Speaking in Homa Bay County on Friday, President Ruto said his government will end the mistreatment of youth. He called on parents to discipline their children. 'These children are blessings that are given to us. Every parent should take care of their children, let's work for our children. We, the government, will do our part, and we will end the abductions so that the Kenyan youth can live in peace,' he said. Boniface Mwangi is a Kenyan activist. He says Kenyan youths are united against the political elite who have made life difficult for them. 'The Gen Z movement, they came together, they were united and they had one goal to reject the finance bill which succeeded and they went a set further to demand for political reforms and change of cabinet and some of it happened and that forced the political elite to come together. So for the first time you have Uhuru Kenyatta, Raila Odinga and Ruto in the same camp,' he said. Since the protests, President Ruto has formed what he calls a broad-based government. He appointed some politicians allied with former President Uhuru Kenyatta and his 2022 election main challenger, Raila Odinga, to the office. 'We started as divided people and are closing the year with a broad-based government. We have brought many Kenyans together,' said Ruto. Political observers say this move is designed to better manage the opposition to his administration. Martin Andati, a political analyst, says such political maneuvers will do little to ease the public's anger toward the Ruto administration. 'The guys in power behave like nothing happened, but the truth is that the dynamics have completely shifted,' he said. 'The old political class, inclusive of President William Ruto, Raila Odinga, and the likes of Kalonzo, are still stuck in a time up; they are still thinking along tribal chieftains and political kingpins; they are going back to 2007 when these youths are in 2027 already.' Political observers predict a tough political fight ahead, as the Kenyan government and political parties have to constitute a new electoral commission. The current one technically exists, but all the commissioners’ terms have expired. Some are concerned that youthful activists will start petitions to recall members of parliament, a move that, if successful, may lead to the fall of the government and an early election before 2027.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-grapples-with-protests-despite-political-unity-efforts-/7918553.html	2024-12-30T07:58:21-08:00

German government seeks to downplay Musk's backing of far-right party ahead of general election	Berlin — The German government on Monday sought to downplay efforts by tech entrepreneur Elon Musk to get involved in the country's general election campaign by again endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany, or AfD, party. Musk caused uproar over the weekend after backing the AfD in an opinion piece in a major newspaper, leading to the resignation of the paper's opinion editor in protest. 'Freedom of expression also includes the greatest nonsense,' government spokesperson Christiane Hoffmann said, adding that she wouldn't comment further on Musk's statements. She did, however, say that 'it is indeed the case that Elon Musk is trying to influence the federal election through his statement.' In that context, Hoffmann also pointed out that the AfD is being monitored by Germany's domestic intelligence service on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and that it has already been recognized as such in some individual German states. Germany is to vote in an early election on Feb. 23 after Chancellor Olaf Scholz's three-party governing coalition collapsed last month in a dispute over how to revitalize the country's stagnant economy. Musk's guest opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag published in German over the weekend, was the second time this month he had supported Alternative for Germany, or AfD. 'The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country,' Musk wrote in his translated commentary. He went on to say the far-right party 'can lead the country into a future where economic prosperity, cultural integrity and technological innovation are not just wishes, but reality.' The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country's condition. The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party. An ally of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, the technology billionaire challenged in his opinion piece the party's public image. 'The portrayal of the AfD as right-wing extremist is clearly false, considering that Alice Weidel, the party's leader, has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka! Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!' Musk's commentary has led to a debate in German media over the boundaries of free speech, with the paper's own opinion editor announcing her resignation, pointedly on Musk's social media platform, X. 'I always enjoyed leading the opinion section of WELT and WAMS. Today an article by Elon Musk appeared in Welt am Sonntag.

Politician among protesters arrested in Kenya while calling for end to alleged abductions	Nairobi — An opposition politician and several other protesters were arrested in Kenya on Monday during street demonstrations calling for an end to alleged abductions, that recently targeted young government critics. Senator Okiya Omtatah had joined hundreds of protesters who sat down on the streets of the capital, Nairobi while chanting that police should free seven people abducted this month. Police hurled tear gas canisters at the protesters and when Omtatah and several others did not disperse and held on to a long chain, they were arrested. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights on Thursday raised concern over a growing number of alleged kidnappings of government critics, saying that the total number of such cases stands at 82 since the anti-government protests in June. President William Ruto on Saturday said the government would stop the abductions so that young people live in peace. Rights groups allege the country's police force is behind such kidnappings, but police have denied involvement and have said that they are investigating the disappearances. Senator Omtatah on Monday filed a case at the High Court in Nairobi seeking to compel the government to free seven youths, accusing the police of abducting them. 'If they have committed a crime, let them be prosecuted and presented in court to defend themselves,' he said. Young protesters said they were in solidarity with those abducted while going about their daily lives. 'We are existing at a time where we have to live in fear,' a protester, Orpah Thabiti said. Four social media users went missing after they shared AI-generated images of President Ruto that were deemed offensive by government supporters. The rights commission had warned that Kenya was heading back to the 'dark days' of the disappearance of government critics. The abduction and torture of the opposition were common under the administration of the late President Daniel Moi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/politician-among-protesters-arrested-in-kenya-while-calling-for-an-end-to-alleged-abductions-/7918432.html	2024-12-30T06:12:15-08:00	
China unveils new assault ship and futuristic fighter jets	Taipei, Taiwan — Days after unveiling the latest breakthroughs in its military modernization, the Chinese navy has set afloat a new amphibious assault ship that could launch fighter jets, and videos have been circulating online showing what seems to be China's new generation of stealth fighter jets. On Sunday, China's first Type 076 amphibious assault ship, the Sichuan, left the dockyard in Shanghai after the People's Liberation Army Navy, or PLA Navy, launched it into the water at a ceremony last Friday. The ship, which has a full load displacement of more than 40,000 tons, features a double island superstructure, a full-length flight deck, and an electromagnetic catapult system, which allows it to launch fixed-wing aircraft or helicopters. In addition to the catapult system, the Sichuan has arresting technology that allows fighter jets to land on its deck. With its large displacement, the vessel 'can carry more weapons and equipment, has longer range and stronger combat capabilities,' Chinese military expert Zhang Junshe told Chinese state-run Global Times. Zhang added that the Sichuan 'has outstanding capabilities in air superiority and land assault missions' because the electromagnetic catapult system offers higher launch efficiency and faster launch speed. The PLA Navy said the Sichuan is a 'key asset' for enhancing the Chinese Navy's long-range operational capabilities and facilitating its ongoing transformation. Other analysts say Beijing wants to project military power 'beyond its shores' through the launch of the Sichuan. The launch is intended 'to intimidate neighbors or ensure the PLA has the capability to land a large invasion force on Taiwan,' Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former Pentagon official, said in a written response to VOA. In combat scenarios, experts say the Sichuan could be paired up with China's aircraft carrier groups. 'The Chinese military could use the Sichuan to deploy drones during the first wave of attack and then deploy larger fighter jets from its aircraft carriers later,' Su Tzu-yun, a military expert at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research, told VOA by phone. Chinese military analyst Song Zhongping said the Sichuan could be used in the South China Sea, East China Sea, or a potential military conflict against Taiwan. 'If [China] takes military actions against Taiwan, [Beijing] will use whatever weapons it possesses, including the Type 075 amphibious assault ship and the Type 076 amphibious assault ship,' he told VOA. Since its establishment in 1949, the People's Republic of China has never ruled Taiwan, but it views the democratically governed island as its own territory and has vowed to bring Taiwan under its control, even by force. The launch of the Sichuan reflects China's ongoing efforts to rapidly expand the number of its naval vessels in recent years. 'The Chinese have been producing ships at an unprecedented rate and you can't say the same of the United States' shipbuilding rate,' said Collin Koh, a maritime security expert at Singapore's S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies. In terms of numbers, the PLA navy has a bigger fleet than the U.S. Navy, and its capabilities are confined in one theater, he adds. 'A growing PLA Navy that is operationally more focused on the theater is likely going to have a certain advantage over the U.S. Navy that is still considered having to bear with various global responsibilities other than this part of the world,' Koh told VOA by phone. A new generation of fighter jets In addition to the launch of the new amphibious assault ship, several videos and images of two seemingly new Chinese stealth fighter jets flying in broad daylight were circulating online last Friday. The images and videos of the two fighter jets posted online have a triangular, tailless design typical to stealth fighter jets. The larger fighter jet, accompanied by China's J-20 stealth fighter jet, seems to have three air intakes for its engines, while the smaller fighter jet bears a more conventional layout. The Chinese government has yet to comment on the unnamed fighter jets featured in the videos, but analysts say their advanced designs show China is rapidly catching up with the U.S. and its Western allies. 'Apart from trying to become a sea power, these seemingly new fighter jets show China also wants to eventually replace the U.S. as the leading air power in the world,' Su in Taiwan told VOA. In his view, because the U.S. and its Western allies still control access to advanced semiconductor chips used in next-generation fighter jets, Washington needs to maintain strict export control of advanced semiconductor ships to China to stay ahead of the curve in the military aircraft arms race. 'Imposing strict export control on advanced semiconductor ships will become the key geopolitical chokepoint that Washington can leverage against Beijing in the global arms race,' Su said.

Iran confirms arrest of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala	Dubai — Iran confirmed the arrest of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala for 'violating the laws of the Islamic Republic,' Iran's official IRNA news agency reported on Monday. Sala, 29, who works for the newspaper Il Foglio and the podcast company Chora Media, was detained in Tehran on Dec. 19, according to the Italian foreign ministry. Italy's Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani on Saturday declined to say whether the case might be linked to the arrest of an Iranian in Italy this month at the request of the United States. The case of the Italian journalist being held in Iran is 'complicated,' but Rome hopes to bring Sala home quickly, Tajani said. 'Italian national Cecilia Sala traveled to Iran on Dec. 13 with a journalist visa and was detained on Dec. 19... for violating the laws of the Islamic Republic,' a statement by Iran's Culture Ministry said, according to IRNA. Chora Media said Sala had left Rome for Iran on Dec. 12 with a valid journalist visa and had conducted several interviews and produced three episodes of her 'Stories' podcast. She had been due to fly back to Rome on Dec. 20. Sala has been in contact by phone with her family and the Italian embassy in Tehran was notified of her detention, the statement said. In recent years, Iran's security forces have arrested dozens of foreigners and dual nationals, mostly on charges related to espionage and security. Rights groups have accused Iran of trying to extract concessions from other countries through such arrests. Iran denies taking prisoners to gain diplomatic leverage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-confirms-arrest-of-italian-journalist-cecilia-sala-/7918304.html	2024-12-30T04:44:53-08:00	
WHO chief calls for end to attacks on Gaza hospitals	World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said Monday the health system in the Gaza Strip is 'under severe threat' as he called for an end to Israeli attacks on hospitals. 'People in Gaza need access to health care. Humanitarians need access to provide health aid. Ceasefire!' Tedros said in a statement. Tedros also called for the immediate release of Hussam Abu Safiya, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza, who was detained by Israeli forces along with more than 200 Palestinians last week. At the time, the Israeli military said the hospital was being used by militants and that Safiya was being questioned as a suspected Hamas member. The hospital, located in the Beit Lahiya area, was one of the last functioning hospitals in northern Gaza. 'Kamal Adwan Hospital in northern Gaza is out of service — following the raid, forced patient and staff evacuation and the detention of its director, Dr. Hussam Abu Safiya two days ago. His whereabouts are unknown,' Tedros said. The WHO chief also said the agency’s partners were able to carry out deliveries of medical supplies, food and water to the Indonesian Hospital in northern Gaza. The conflict in Gaza began with the October 2023 attack on southern Israel, during which Hamas militants killed about 1,200 people and took 250 hostages. About 100 hostages are still being held in Gaza, with one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,500 people and injured 108,000 others, according to the Gaza health ministry. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group.

Taliban say they will close all NGOs employing Afghan women	The Taliban say they will close all national and foreign nongovernmental groups in Afghanistan employing women. It comes two years after they told NGOs to suspend the employment of Afghan women, allegedly because they didn’t wear the Islamic headscarf correctly. In a letter published on X Sunday night, the Economy Ministry warned that failure to comply with the latest order would lead to NGOs losing their license to operate in Afghanistan. The ministry said it was responsible for the registration, coordination, leadership and supervision of all activities carried out by national and foreign organizations. The government was once again ordering the stoppage of all female work in institutions not controlled by the Taliban, according to the letter. 'In case of lack of cooperation, all activities of that institution will be canceled and the activity license of that institution, granted by the ministry, will also be canceled.' It’s the Taliban’s latest attempt to control or intervene in NGO activity. Earlier this month, the U.N. Security Council heard that an increasing proportion of female Afghan humanitarian workers were prevented from doing their work even though relief work remains essential. According to Tom Fletcher, a senior U.N. official, the proportion of humanitarian organizations reporting that their female or male staff were stopped by the Taliban’s morality police has also increased. The Taliban deny they are stopping aid agencies from carrying out their work or interfering with their activities. They have already barred women from many jobs and most public spaces, and also excluded them from education beyond sixth grade. In another development, the Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada has ordered that buildings should not have windows looking into places where a woman might sit or stand. According to a four-clause decree posted on X late Saturday, the order applies to new buildings as well as existing ones. Windows should not overlook or look into areas like yards or kitchens. Where a window looks into such a space then the person responsible for that property must find a way to obscure this view to 'remove harm,' by installing a wall, fence or screen. Municipalities and other authorities must supervise the construction of new buildings to avoid installing windows that look into or over residential properties, the decree added. A spokesman for the Ministry of Urban Development and Housing was not immediately available for comment on Akhundzada’s instructions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-say-they-will-close-all-ngos-employing-afghan-women/7918279.html	2024-12-30T03:46:07-08:00	
Ukraine says it shot down 21 of 43 Russian drones	Ukraine's military said Monday it shot down 21 drones that Russian forces used in attacks overnight targeting multiple areas across northern and eastern Ukraine. The Ukrainian air force said Russia launched a total of 43 drones, and that its air defenses shot down drones over the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Odesa and Poltava regions. Odesa Governor Oleh Kiper said on Telegram that falling drone debris damaged five residential buildings but did not hurt anyone. Kharkiv Governor Oleh Syniehubov reported a building fire caused by a drone attack, as well as a drone hit near a highway. He added there were no casualties in his region. Russia's defense ministry said Monday it intercepted a drone over the Belgorod region located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Regional officials in Kursk also said Russian air defenses shot down a Ukrainian missile early Monday.

Linda Lavin, Tony-winning Broadway actress who starred in sitcom 'Alice,' dies at 87	NEW YORK — Linda Lavin, a Tony Award-winning stage actress who became a working class icon as a paper-hat wearing waitress on the TV sitcom 'Alice,' has died. She was 87. Lavin died in Los Angeles on Sunday of complications from recently discovered lung cancer, her representative, Bill Veloric, told The Associated Press in an email. A success on Broadway, Lavin tried her luck in Hollywood in the mid-1970s. She was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore,' the Martin Scorsese-directed film that won Ellen Burstyn an Oscar for playing the title waitress. The title was shortened to 'Alice' and Lavin became a role model for working moms as Alice Hyatt, a widowed mother with a 12-year-old son working in a roadside diner outside Phoenix. The show, with Lavin singing the theme song 'There's a New Girl in Town,' ran from 1976 to 1985. The show turned 'Kiss my grits' into a catchphrase and co-starred Polly Holliday as waitress Flo and Vic Tayback as the gruff owner and head chef of Mel's Diner. The series bounced around the CBS schedule during its first two seasons but became a hit leading into 'All in the Family' on Sunday nights in October 1977. It was among primetime's top 10 series in four of the next five seasons. Variety magazine listed it among the all-time best workplace comedies. Lavin soon went on to win a Tony for best actress in a play for Neil Simon's 'Broadway Bound' in 1987. She was working as recently as this month promoting a new Netflix series in which she appears, 'No Good Deed,' and filming a forthcoming Hulu series, 'Mid-Century Modern,' according to Deadline, which first reported her death. Lavin grew up in Portland, Maine, and moved to New York City after graduating from the College of William and Mary. She sang in nightclubs and in ensembles of shows. Iconic producer and director Hal Prince gave Lavin her first big break while directing the Broadway musical 'It's a Bird ... It's a Plane ... It's Superman.' She went on to earn a Tony nomination in Simon's 'Last of the Red Hot Lovers' in 1969 before winning 18 years later for another Simon play, 'Broadway Bound.' In the mid 1970s, Lavin moved to Los Angeles. She had a recurring role on 'Barney Miller' and in 1976 was chosen to star in a new CBS sitcom based on Ellen Burstyn's Oscar-winning waitress comedy-drama, 'Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore.' Back on Broadway, Lavin later starred Paul Rudnick's comedy 'The New Century,' had a concert show called 'Songs & Confessions of a One-Time Waitress' and earned a Tony nomination in Donald Margulies' 'Collected Stories.' Michael Kuchwara of the AP gave Lavin a rave in 'Collected Stories,' writing that she 'gives one of those complete, nuanced performances, capturing the woman's intellectual vigor, her wry sense of humor and her increasing physical frailty with astonishing fidelity. And Lavin's sense of timing is superb, whether delivering a joke or acerbically dissecting the work of her protegee.' Lavin basked in a burst of renewed attention in her 70s, earning a Tony nomination for Nicky Silver's 'The Lyons.' She also starred in 'Other Desert Cities' and a revival of 'Follies' before they transferred to Broadway. The AP again raved about Lavin in 'The Lyons,' calling her 'an absolute wonder to behold as Rita Lyons, a nag of a mother with a collection of firm beliefs and eye rolls, a matriarch who is both suffocating and keeping everyone at arm's length.' She also appeared in the film 'Wanderlust' with Jennifer Aniston and Paul Rudd, and released her first CD, 'Possibilities.' She played Jennifer Lopez's grandmother in 'The Back-Up Plan.' When asked for guidance from up-and-coming actresses, Lavin stressed one thing. 'I say that what happened for me was that work brings work. As long as it wasn't morally reprehensible to me, I did it,' she told the AP in 2011. She and Steve Bakunas, an artist, musician and her third husband, converted an old automotive garage into the 50-seat Red Barn Studio Theatre in Wilmington, North Carolina. It opened in 2007 and their productions include 'Doubt' by John Patrick Shanley, 'Glengarry Glen Ross' by David Mamet, 'Rabbit Hole' by David Lindsay-Abaire and 'The Tale of the Allergist's Wife' by Charles Busch, in which Lavin also starred on Broadway, earning a Tony nomination. She returned to TV in 2013 in 'Sean Saves the World,' starring 'Will & Grace's' Sean Hayes, a show which lasted a season. Lavin also made appearances on 'Mom' and '9JKL.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/linda-lavin-tony-winning-broadway-actress-who-starred-in-sitcom-alice-dies-at-87-/7918230.html	2024-12-30T01:39:28-08:00	
Sports teams honor late former US President Jimmy Carter	Sports teams in former U.S. President Jimmy Carter's home state of Georgia expressed their condolences Sunday, honoring a former leader who also served as the state's governor and had an extensive record as an athlete and sports fan. The Atlanta Falcons football team held a moment of silence before their game Sunday night. The team's owner, Arthur Blank, called Carter 'a great American, a proud Georgian and an inspirational global humanitarian.' The Atlanta Hawks basketball team said Carter 'represented all the best of Georgia.' 'From his rural upbringing that he never strayed from, to his passion for Atlanta sports, Carter was proud of his home state and left a legacy for Georgians to be proud of, too,' the team said in a statement. Carter was most known for being a fan of the Atlanta Braves baseball team, whose games he and his wife, Rosalynn, attended for decades. The team celebrated his 100th birthday in October, and on Sunday it said Carter 'served both his country and home state with honor his entire life.' 'While the world knew him as a remarkable humanitarian and peacemaker, we knew him as a dedicated Braves fan and we will miss having him in the stands cheering on his Braves,' the team said in a statement. Carter was in attendance in 1974 when Braves player Hank Aaron set the Major League Baseball record for most career home runs. In 1995, Carter threw out the ceremonial first pitch before the sixth game of the World Series, which the Braves won to capture their first championship since moving to Atlanta, Georgia, in 1966. As an athlete himself, Carter was fond of playing softball, including during his time as president. While in the White House, Carter was also part of a boom in running in the United States that saw recreational running rapidly expand during the 1970s. His competitive running career included time on the U.S. Naval Academy cross-country team. Carter also enjoyed playing tennis and watching car racing, and he participated in the presidential tradition of welcoming championship sports teams to the White House.

South Korea mourns as investigators probe cause of deadly plane crash	South Korea was in mourning Monday as investigators worked to determine the cause of a plane crash in Muan that killed 179 of the 181 people on board. Acting President Choi Sang-mok appeared Monday at a memorial in Muan, about 290 kilometers south of Seoul, where he laid a flower and bowed in respect to the victims. A senior official at South Korea's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport told reporters that officials planned to conduct a special investigation of all the Boeing 737-800 planes operating in the country. The crashed plane's flight data recorder will be sent to a facility in Seoul later this week for analysis, officials said, with personnel from the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board taking part in the probe. Some passengers still unidentified Sunday's crash in which the plane skidded off the runway, slammed into a concrete fence and burst into flames was one of South Korea's deadliest aviation disasters. As of early Monday, authorities were still trying to identify some of the victims. Two people, both crew members, were pulled out of the wreckage alive. 'Only the tail part retains a little bit of shape, and the rest of [it] looks almost impossible to recognize,' Muan fire chief Lee Jung-hyun told reporters as he described what was left of the plane. Lee added that investigators are examining bird strikes and weather conditions as possible factors in the incident. President Joe Biden said the United States was ready to offer any assistance needed in the wake of the disaster. 'As close allies, the American people share deep bonds of friendship with the South Korean people and our thoughts and prayers are with those impacted by this tragedy. The United States stands ready to provide any necessary assistance,' Biden said in a statement released by the White House. A spokesperson for United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a statement released Sunday, 'The Secretary-General is deeply saddened by the news of a plane crash in Muan county in the Republic of Korea, which has claimed the lives of 179 people. 'He extends his heartfelt condolences to the families of the victims and expresses his solidarity with the people and Government of the Republic of Korea during this difficult time,' the statement said. Boeing 'ready to support' Sunday's crash was the worst aviation disaster involving a South Korean airline since 1997, when a Korean Air jet went down in Guam, killing more than 200 people. Jeju Air issued an apology following the crash and promised to do its 'utmost to manage the aftermath of the accident.' Boeing said it was in touch with Jeju Air and was 'ready to support them.' 'We extend our deepest condolences to the families who lost loved ones, and our thoughts remain with the passengers and crew,' the company said in a statement. Transport ministry officials said two Thai nationals were on board and the rest were believed to be South Koreans. Officials in Thailand reported no issues with the plane when it left Bangkok.

Stock market today: Asian shares mixed after Wall Street slips, led by tech giants	Asian shares were mixed on Monday after stocks fell broadly on Friday as Wall Street closed out a holiday-shortened week on a down note. U.S. futures were lower while oil prices were little changed. In Asia, South Korea's Kospi added 0.6% to 2,418.80. But shares of Jeju Air Co. lost 8.8% after one of the company's jets skidded off a runway, slammed into a concrete fence, and burst into flames Sunday in South Korea as its landing gear failed to deploy. 179 people died in the crash. Political turmoil continued as South Korean law enforcement officials requested a court warrant on Monday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. They are investigating whether his martial law decree on December 3 amounted to rebellion. Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index lost 0.9% to 39,914.21 as the dollar gained against the Japanese yen, trading at 157.83 yen, up from 157.75 yen. The Tokyo market will wrap up trading for 2024 with a year-end ceremony as Japan begins its New Year holidays, the biggest festival of the year. The Hang Seng in Hong Kong shed 0.3% to 20,030.63 while the Shanghai Composite index was up 0.3% at 3,408.72. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dipped 0.9% to 8,191.50. On Friday, the S&P 500 fell 1.1% to 5,970.84. Roughly 90% of stocks in the benchmark index lost ground, but it managed to hold onto a modest gain of 0.7% for the week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.8% to 42,992.21. The tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 1.5%, to 19,722.03. The losses were made worse by sharp declines for the Big Tech stocks known as the 'Magnificent 7,' which can heavily influence the direction of the market because of their large size. A wide range of retailers also fell. Amazon fell 1.5% and Best Buy slipped 1.5%. The sector is being closely watched for clues on how it performed during the holiday shopping season. The S&P 500 gained nearly 3% over a 3-day stretch before breaking for the Christmas holiday. On Thursday, the index posted a small decline. Despite Friday's drop, the market is moving closer to another standout annual finish. The S&P 500 is on track for a gain of around 25% in 2024. That would mark a second consecutive yearly gain of more than 20%, the first time that has happened since 1997-1998. The gains have been driven partly by upbeat economic data showing that consumers continued spending and the labor market remained strong. Inflation, while still high, has also been steadily easing. A report on Friday showed that sales and inventory estimates for the wholesales trade industry fell 0.2% in November, following a slight gain in October. That weaker-than-expected report follows an update on the labor market Thursday that showed unemployment benefits held steady last week. The stream of upbeat economic data and easing inflation helped prompt a reversal in the Federal Reserve's interest rate policy this year. Expectations for interest rate cuts also helped drive market gains. The central bank recently delivered its third cut to interest rates in 2024. Even though inflation has come closer to the central bank's target of 2%, it remains stubbornly above that mark and worries about it heating up again have tempered the forecast for more interest rate cuts. Inflation concerns have added to uncertainties heading into 2025, which include the labor market's path ahead and shifting economic policies under incoming President Donald Trump. Worries have risen that Trump's preference for tariffs and other policies could lead to higher inflation, a bigger U.S. government debt, and difficulties for global trade. In other dealings early Monday, U.S. benchmark crude oil picked up 1 cent to $70.61 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, lost 1 cent to $73.78 per barrel. The euro fell to $1.0427 from $1.0433.	https://www.voanews.com/a/stock-market-today-asian-shares-mixed-after-wall-street-slips-led-by-tech-giants-/7918180.html	2024-12-29T22:49:12-08:00	
Authorities find bodies of 15 men in clandestine graves in Mexico	TAPACHULA, MEXICO — Eleven clandestine graves with the bodies of 15 men were located in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, where a dispute between the Sinaloa and Jalisco Nueva Generacion drug cartels is taking place, local authorities said Sunday. Chiapas Governor Eduardo Ramirez Aguilar said on his social media channels that the findings came as the result of a raid in the city of La Concordia, near Mexico's border with Guatemala. He said four people connected to the case had been arrested with weapons and drugs. The state prosecutor's office said in a statement that the raid took place in two different properties. The first site had three bodies in three graves and in the second, eight graves with 12 bodies. 'It is worth mentioning that for these operations technological tools such as drones and geo-radars were used, in addition to aerial overflight, ground search, field forensics, back-excavation and drills,' it said. Chiapas Prosecutor General Jorge Luis Llaven Abarca said last week that another clandestine grave with charred bodies was found in Emiliano Zapata, neighboring La Concordia, but did not give more details because of the poor state of the bodies for identification. The dispute over drug routes, migrant trafficking and weapons has left more than 10,000 people displaced in recent years, including Mexicans fleeing to Guatemala, according to reports from humanitarian organizations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/authorities-find-bodies-of-15-men-in-clandestine-graves-in-mexico-/7918175.html	2024-12-29T22:21:26-08:00	
Storm system spawns tornadoes across US, leading to 4 deaths	Officials assessed the damage on Sunday after a strong storm system moved across the southern United States over the weekend, spawning tornadoes and killing at least four people. There were at least 45 reports of tornado damage across Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, said Brian Hurley, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's Weather Prediction Center. Crews will do damage surveys to confirm tornadoes. The storms during busy holiday travels caused some treacherous road conditions along with delays or cancellations at some of the busiest U.S. airports. As of Sunday afternoon, there were over 600 flight delays affecting Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in the southern state of Georgia, according to flight tracker FlightAware. 'It's not unheard of, but it is fairly uncommon to have a severe weather outbreak of this magnitude this late in the year,' said Frank Pereira, a meteorologist with the Weather Prediction Center. In the area of Houston, Texas, National Weather Service storm survey crews confirmed that at least five tornadoes hit north and south of the city on Saturday. At least one person died. The 48-year-old woman was found about 30 meters from her home in the Liverpool area south of Houston, said Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. She said the exact cause of death wasn't immediately known. Four other people in Brazoria County had injuries that weren't considered critical, said Polston, adding that at least 40 homes and buildings were significantly damaged. In Montgomery County, north of Houston, about 30 homes were destroyed and about 50 others sustained major damage, county official Jason Smith said. In the state of North Carolina, a 70-year-old man was killed Sunday in Statesville, just north of Charlotte, when a tree landed on the pickup truck he was driving. Highway Patrol Trooper DJ Maffucci said 'it was just a freak accident' and he believed Matthew Teeple, of Cleveland, North Carolina, was killed instantly. 'It's very sad, just terrible timing,' Maffucci said, adding that the storms were responsible for a number of downed trees and 'quite a few wrecks.' Two people were killed in storms in Mississippi, officials said. An 18-year-old died after a tree fell on her home Saturday night in Natchez in Adams County, said Emergency Management spokesperson Neifa Hardy. Two other people in the home were injured. Another person died in Lowndes County and at least eight more were injured across the state, officials said. The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. Storm damage also was reported in the northern Alabama city of Athens, northwest of Huntsville. Holly Hollman, spokeswoman for the city, said most of the damage from the early Sunday morning storms occurred downtown. She said it hurled large HVAC units from the tops of building and ripped the roof off a bookstore. A full-sized, stripped-down military helicopter was toppled from a pole where it was on display, she added. 'I stepped out on my porch and I could hear it roar,' she said of the storm. 'I think we are extremely lucky that we got hit late at night. If it had hit during the busy hours, I think we might have had some injuries and possibly some fatalities.' As of Sunday afternoon, more than 40,000 people were still without power in Mississippi, according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Texas, Alabama, North Carolina and Georgia each had about 10,000 customers without power, it said. The storms closed some roads in western North Carolina, a region broadly devastated by Hurricane Helene this fall. That included part of U.S. 441, also known as the Great Smoky Mountains Expressway, which closed north of Bryson City due to high winds. In Bumpus Cove, Tennessee, Justin Fromkin, president of Raising Hope Disaster Relief, worked Sunday to save what he could from the organization's supply tent — filled with clothes and food — after about 152 millimeters of rain fell. He's spent the past few months delivering aid to areas in western North Carolina and eastern Tennessee that are still reeling from Helene. The ground in some parts of the mountains is still unstable from Helene, Fromkin said, and Sunday's downpour adds to the problem.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-system-spawns-tornadoes-across-us-leading-to-4-deaths-/7918166.html	2024-12-29T21:41:42-08:00	
Netanyahu 'in good condition' after prostate surgery, says hospital	JERUSALEM — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu successfully underwent prostate removal surgery on Sunday and is in good condition, according to the hospital treating him. The surgery took place while Israel remains at war against Hamas militants in the Gaza Strip, more than 14 months after an unprecedented attack by Palestinian militants on Israel on October 7 last year. 'The prime minister has awakened from anesthesia and is in good condition. He has been transferred to the recovery unit and will remain under observation in the coming days,' the Hadassah Medical Centre said in a statement. On Saturday, Netanyahu's office announced that he had been diagnosed with a urinary tract infection caused by a benign prostate enlargement. Earlier, in March, Netanyahu underwent a hernia surgery, and in July last year, doctors implanted a pacemaker after a medical scare.	https://www.voanews.com/a/netanyahu-in-good-condition-after-prostate-surgery-says-hospital/7918162.html	2024-12-29T20:56:53-08:00	
Waves pound coasts of Ecuador and Peru, closing ports, killing 2	LIMA, PERU — Big waves of up to four meters are pummeling the coasts of Ecuador and Peru, leaving scores of ports closed and at least two people dead, authorities said Sunday. Ecuador's secretary for risk management, Jorge Carillo, told a media conference that an 'extreme event' was occurring and warned that similar phenomena could be expected in the future. He said that 'unfortunately, we have two deaths, both recorded' in Ecuador's southwestern Manta region. In neighboring Peru, almost all ports were closed because of the constant battering of waves, the head of the naval Oceanographic Department, Enrique Varea, told the broadcaster Canal N. He forecast that the big waves 'will continue in coming days,' but expected them to calm somewhat from Monday, and to return more to normal in the first days of January. Climate change 'is behind these sorts of anomalous waves,' the head of the Civil Defense unit in Peru's Callao region, Larry Linch, told AFP. Images shown on local media showed jetties and public squares submerged in some parts of Peru, sending residents fleeing to higher ground. The waves, according to the Peruvian navy, are being generated off the U.S. coast by winds along the ocean's surface. Many beaches along the central and northern stretches of the country were closed to prevent risk to human life, authorities said. Many fishing boats were damaged, while those that were spared were still unable to work in the dangerous conditions. 'We need help from authorities. Here, we've lost some 100 boats,' one fisherman told TV Peru. 'I'm 70 years old and I've never seen such unusual and strong waves,' he said. Thirty-one fishermen stranded in the swell were rescued Saturday afternoon by the navy, while one told local radio that around 180 more remained at sea. Big waves were also seen crashing into the central Chilean coast in Vina del Mar, sparking warnings from authorities. Callao, which sits adjacent to the capital Lima and is home to Peru's largest port, has closed several beaches and barred tourist and fishing boats from venturing out. 'There is a major problem,' La Cruz district mayor Roberto Carrillo Zavala told AFP after surveying damage via helicopter with Peru's Minister of Defense Walter Astudillo Chavez. 'The most affected have been the fishermen,' Zavala said. 'We hope nothing more happens, as this would significantly impact the economy.' The phenomenon began on Christmas and will last until January 1, according to Peru's National Emergency Operations Center.	https://www.voanews.com/a/waves-pound-coasts-of-ecuador-and-peru-closing-ports-killing-2-/7918145.html	2024-12-29T20:22:23-08:00	
South Korea joint investigation unit requests arrest warrant for Yoon over martial law	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's joint investigation unit has requested an arrest warrant for suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol over his short-lived imposition of martial law earlier this month, an official said on Monday. Yoon has failed to respond to multiple summons for questioning by police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials who are jointly investigating whether his December 3 martial-law declaration amounted to insurrection. A court will decide whether to issue an arrest warrant following the request. Yoon Kab-keun, a lawyer for the suspended president, did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comment. Yoon was suspended from presidential powers after being impeached by parliament earlier this month over his decision to briefly impose martial law. A Constitutional Court trial is ongoing into whether to reinstate Yoon or remove him permanently from office. It has 180 days to reach a decision. On December 27, the court held its first preparatory hearing where a request by Yoon's lawyers for a postponement in proceedings to better prepare was denied. The court said it would move swiftly. The next hearing is due on Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-joint-investigation-unit-requests-arrest-warrant-for-yoon-over-martial-law-/7918130.html	2024-12-29T18:48:07-08:00	
Finland finds drag marks on Baltic seabed after cable damage	OSLO, NORWAY — Finnish police said on Sunday they had found tracks that drag on for dozens of kilometers along the bottom of the Baltic Sea where a tanker carrying Russian oil is suspected of breaking a power line and four telecoms cables with its anchor. The Cook Islands-registered Eagle S was boarded by Finnish police and coast guard officials on Thursday and sailed into Finnish waters where the crew of the impounded tanker is being questioned. Baltic Sea nations have been on high alert after a string of outages of power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. NATO said on Friday it would boost its presence in the region. A break in the 658 megawatt (MW) Estlink 2 power cable between Finland and Estonia occurred at midday on Wednesday, leaving only the 358 MW Estlink 1 linking the two countries, grid operators said. They said Estlink 2 might not be back in service before August. Finnish police suspect the Eagle S caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed. Investigators have identified a 'dragging track' but have yet to find a missing anchor, Sami Paila, tactical leader and detective chief inspector of Finland's National Bureau of Investigation, said in a statement. 'The track is dozens of kilometers in length,' Paila said. Photos taken of the Eagle S on Friday showed the vessel missing its port side anchor. Finland's customs service believes the ship is part of a 'shadow fleet' of aging tankers being used to evade sanctions on exports of Russian oil. The Kremlin said on Friday that Finland's seizure of the ship was of little concern to it. Russia has denied involvement in any of the previous Baltic infrastructure damage incidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-finds-drag-marks-on-baltic-seabed-after-cable-damage-/7918122.html	2024-12-29T17:55:08-08:00

World leaders react to former US President Jimmy Carter's death	World leaders and U.S. politicians reacted to news that former U.S. President Jimmy Carter, who as president brokered peace between Israel and Egypt and later received the Nobel Peace Prize for his humanitarian work, has died at age 100. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden 'Today, America and the world lost an extraordinary leader, statesman and humanitarian. Over six decades, we had the honor of calling Jimmy Carter a dear friend. But, what’s extraordinary about Jimmy Carter, though, is that millions of people throughout America and the world who never met him thought of him as a dear friend as well.' President-elect Donald Trump 'The challenges Jimmy faced as president came at a pivotal time for our country and he did everything in his power to improve the lives of all Americans. For that, we all owe him a debt of gratitude. Melania and I are thinking warmly of the Carter Family and their loved ones during this difficult time. We urge everyone to keep them in their hearts and prayers.' President Barack Obama 'Elected in the shadow of Watergate, Jimmy Carter promised voters that he would always tell the truth. And he did – advocating for the public good, consequences be damned. He believed some things were more important than reelection – things like integrity, respect, and compassion. Because Jimmy Carter believed, as deeply as he believed anything, that we are all created in God’s image. ... Maranatha Baptist Church will be a little quieter on Sundays, but President Carter will never be far away – buried alongside Rosalynn next to a willow tree down the road, his memory calling all of us to heed our better angels. Michelle and I send our thoughts and prayers to the Carter family, and everyone who loved and learned from this remarkable man.' President George W. Bush 'Laura and I send our heartfelt condolences to Jack, Chip, Jeff, Amy, and the entire Carter family. James Earl Carter, Jr., was a man of deeply held convictions. He was loyal to his family, his community, and his country. President Carter dignified the office. And his efforts to leave behind a better world didn’t end with the presidency. His work with Habitat for Humanity and the Carter Center set an example of service that will inspire Americans for generations.' Former US President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 'From his commitment to civil rights as a state senator and governor of Georgia; to his efforts as President to protect our natural resources in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, make energy conservation a national priority, return the Panama Canal to Panama, and secure peace between Egypt and Israel at Camp David; to his post-Presidential efforts at the Carter Center supporting honest elections, advancing peace, combating disease, and promoting democracy; to his and Rosalynn’s devotion and hard work at Habitat for Humanity -- he worked tirelessly for a better, fairer world.' French President Emmanuel Macron 'Throughout his life, Jimmy Carter has been a steadfast advocate for the rights of the most vulnerable and has tirelessly fought for peace. France sends its heartfelt thoughts to his family and to the American people.' Vice President Kamala Harris 'Throughout his life, President Carter was strengthened by the love and support of his partner of 77 years, First Lady Rosalynn Carter, whose life President Biden and I had the opportunity to celebrate in Georgia last year. After leaving office, President Carter continued his fight for peace, democracy, and human dignity through the Carter Center. I had the privilege of knowing President Carter for years. I will always remember his kindness, wisdom, and profound grace. His life and legacy continue to inspire me — and will inspire generations to come. Our world is a better place because of President Carter.' Vice President-elect JD Vance 'Jimmy Carter dedicated his life to serving this country. Our thoughts and prayers go out to his loved ones. May he Rest in Peace.' Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer 'Today, we mourn the loss of one of our most humble and devoted public servants, President Jimmy Carter. President Carter personified the true meaning of leadership through service, through compassion, and through integrity. From his legacy as president, to his dedication to improving human rights across the globe, and his tireless efforts alongside his wife Rosalynn, in building a better world through Habitat for Humanity, he inspired millions with his unwavering commitment to justice and equality.' British Prime Minister Keir Starmer 'I was very sorry to hear of President Carter's passing and I would like to pay tribute to his decades of selfless public service. His presidency will be remembered for the historic Camp David Accords between Israel and Egypt, and it was that lifelong dedication to peace that saw him receive the Nobel Peace prize. Motivated by his strong faith and values, President Carter redefined the post-presidency with a remarkable commitment to social justice and human rights at home and abroad.' US Senator Mitch McConnell 'Elaine and I join the Senate and the nation in mourning the passing of our 39th president, Jimmy Carter. 'President Carter served during times of tension and uncertainty, both at home and abroad. But his calm spirit and deep faith seemed unshakeable. Jimmy Carter served as our commander-in-chief for four years, but he served as the beloved, unassuming Sunday school teacher at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, Georgia for forty. And his humble devotion leaves us little doubt which of those two important roles he prized the most.' US House Speaker Mike Johnson 'Today, the thoughts of Americans and the prayers of Congress are lifted up on behalf of the Carter family. President Carter’s story was one of humble beginnings, and his life is a testament to the boundless opportunities available in this great nation. Because of his work in brokering the Camp David Accords and his advocacy with Habitat for Humanity, the world is a more peaceful place, and more Americans have a place to call home. No one can deny that President Carter led an extraordinary life of service to his country. May he rest in peace.' US Representative Mike Turner 'I am deeply saddened to learn about the death of President Jimmy Carter. President Carter was a man of integrity who was guided by his faith. I join all Americans in saluting President Carter for his lifetime of service, first as a naval officer, then as a senator in the Georgia State Senate, then as Governor of Georgia, and, finally, as President of the United States. I would like to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Carter family.' US Senator Mark Warner 'President Carter will be remembered by what he built and left behind for us – a model of service late into life, a tireless devotion to family and philanthropy, and a more peaceful world to call home.' US Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin 'Jimmy Carter proved that excellence in public service can extend beyond the White House. His life was an inspiration to those of us who aspire to lead a life of service.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-leaders-react-to-former-us-president-jimmy-carter-s-death/7918097.html	2024-12-29T16:24:58-08:00

Key moments in the life of Jimmy Carter	Jimmy Carter's 1977-1981 presidency included successes like the Camp David peace accords, but also enough controversy for U.S. voters to see him as weak — and send him packing after only one term. Carter's legacy, however, was largely built on his post-presidency, the longest in U.S. history. Here are a few key moments in the life of Carter, who died Sunday at the age of 100. The Panama Canal During his first year in office, Carter went back on a campaign promise and decided to hand back management of the Panama Canal — which had been in U.S. military control since its construction at the start of the 20th century. 'Fairness, and not force, should lie at the heart of our dealings with the nations of the world,' he said at the signing of the canal treaties with Panamanian leader Omar Torrijos on September 7, 1977. Carter was ridiculed for the move, which gave Panama control over the canal linking the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans at the end of 1999. History, however, has looked upon the deal as a deft bit of diplomacy. Giving Panama a meatier role in the canal's management in the run-up to the transfer allowed for stability and broke with America's image as an overbearing imperialist power in Latin America. Morality in politics Upon his arrival in the Oval Office, Carter looked to distance himself from the realpolitik practiced by his predecessors — a vestige of the Cold War — and placed human rights at the heart of his agenda. 'Our principal goal is to help shape a world which is more responsive to the desire of people everywhere for economic well-being, social justice, political self-determination and basic human rights,' he said in a 1978 speech at the U.S. Naval Academy. In concrete terms, Carter notably signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights in 1977. It was eventually ratified by the United States in 1992 after being blocked for years by the Senate. Camp David Accords In September 1978, Carter invited Israeli Premier Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to Camp David, the presidential retreat outside Washington. After 13 days of secret negotiations under Carter's mediation, two accords were signed that ultimately led to a peace treaty the following year. The diplomatic triumph was cited when Carter was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. Crisis of confidence In the summer of 1979, the economy rocked by inflation and his approval rating in free fall, Carter addressed the American people in a nationwide televised speech on July 15. In that half-hour, he responded to his critics on his lack of leadership, instead laying the blame on a national 'crisis of confidence.' 'The erosion of our confidence in the future is threatening to destroy the social and the political fabric of America,' he said. The speech was poorly received and would come back to haunt him. Five cabinet members resigned that week. Iran hostage crisis The hostage crisis — more than 50 Americans were held for 444 days at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran from November 1979 to January 1981 — was the death knell for Carter's presidency. A failed military rescue mission in April 1980 all but extinguished his chances of reelection later that year. Operation Eagle Claw was thwarted by sandstorms and mechanical problems — eventually, the mission was aborted. In the subsequent withdrawal, two American aircraft collided, killing eight servicemen. In the following days, then secretary of state Cyrus Vance resigned, and the mission's failure symbolized Carter's inability to resolve the crisis. The hostages were eventually freed on the same day that Republican Ronald Reagan took office, after thumping Carter at the polls in November 1980. The Carter Center Carter remained extremely active into his 90s despite his retirement from political life. In 1982, he founded the Carter Center, which has focused on conflict resolution, promoting democracy and human rights, and fighting disease. Carter — often viewed as America's most successful former president — traveled extensively, supervising elections from Haiti to East Timor, and tackling thorny global problems as a mediator. The Elders Carter was also a member of The Elders, a group of former world leaders founded by Nelson Mandela in 2007 to promote peace and human rights. Fellow Nobel peace laureates South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu (who died in 2021), former Liberian President Ellen Sirleaf Johnson and the late U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan also belonged to the group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/key-moments-in-the-life-of-jimmy-carter/7917840.html	2024-12-29T15:02:21-08:00

Israeli hospital says Netanyahu has undergone successful prostate surgery	Tel Aviv, Israel — Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underwent successful surgery Sunday to have his prostate removed, hospital officials said, a procedure that came as he manages multiple crises including the war in Gaza and his trial for alleged corruption. Netanyahu, who has had a series of health issues in recent years, has gone to great lengths to bolster a public image of himself as a healthy, energetic leader. During his trial this month, he boasted about working 18-hour days, accompanied by a cigar. But as Israel's longest-serving leader, such a grueling workload over a total of 17 years in power could take a toll on his well-being. Netanyahu, 75, is among older world leaders including U.S. President Joe Biden, 82, President-elect Donald Trump, 78, Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, 79, and Pope Francis, 88, who have come under scrutiny for their age and health issues. Netanyahu's latest condition is common in older men, but the procedure has had some fallout. The judges overseeing his trial accepted a request Sunday from his lawyer to call off three days of testimony scheduled this week. The lawyer, Amit Hadad, had argued that Netanyahu would be fully sedated for the procedure and hospitalized for 'a number of days.' Jerusalem's Hadassah Medical Center announced late Sunday that the procedure had been 'completed successfully.' Justice Minister Yariv Levin, a close ally, served as acting prime minister during the operation. Netanyahu is expected to remain hospitalized for several days. With so much at stake, Netanyahu’s health in wartime is a concern for both Israelis and the wider world. A turbulent time in the region As Israel’s leader, Netanyahu is at the center of major global events that are shifting the Middle East. With the dizzying pace of the past 14 months, being incapacitated for even a few hours can be risky. Netanyahu will be in the hospital at a time when international mediators are pushing Israel and Hamas to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and as fighting between Israel and Yemen’s Iran-backed Houthi rebels intensifies. Prostate issues are common and, in many cases, easily treatable. Still, the procedure puts a dent in Netanyahu’s image of vigor at a time when he would want to project strength more than ever, both to an Israeli audience navigating constant threats as well as to Israel’s enemies looking to expose its weaknesses. Previous health issues, include a heart condition Netanyahu insists he is in excellent health. His office releases footage of him touring war zones in full protective gear flanked by military officers, or meeting with defense officials on windswept hilltops in youthful dark shades and puffer jackets. But that image was shattered last year when Netanyahu’s doctors revealed that he had a heart condition, a problem that he had apparently long known about but concealed from the public. A week after a fainting spell, Netanyahu was fitted with a pacemaker to control his heartbeat. Only then did staff at the Sheba Medical Center reveal that Netanyahu has for years experienced a condition that can cause irregular heartbeats. The revelation came as Netanyahu was dealing with massive anti-government protests. The news about a chronic heart problem stoked further anger and distrust during extreme political polarization in Israel. Last year, Netanyahu was rushed to the hospital for what doctors said likely was dehydration. He stayed overnight, prompting his weekly Cabinet meeting to be delayed. Earlier this year, Netanyahu underwent hernia surgery, during which he was under full anesthesia and unconscious. Levin served as acting prime minister during the operation. Recovery can be quick According to Netanyahu’s office, the Israeli leader was diagnosed with a urinary tract infection Wednesday stemming from a benign enlargement of his prostate. The infection was treated successfully with antibiotics, but doctors said the surgery was needed in any case. Complications from prostate enlargement are common in men in their 70s and 80s, Dr. Shay Golan, head of the oncology urology service at Israel’s Rabin Medical Center, told Israeli Army Radio. Golan spoke in general terms and was not involved in Netanyahu’s care or treatment. He said an enlarged prostate can block proper emptying of the bladder, leading to a build-up of urine that can lead to an infection or other complications. After medicinal treatment, doctors can recommend a procedure to remove the prostate to prevent future blockages, Golan said. In Netanyahu’s case, because the prostate is not cancerous, Golan said doctors were likely performing an endoscopic surgery, carried out by inserting small instruments into a body cavity, rather than making surgical cuts in the abdomen to reach the prostate. The procedure lasts about an hour, Golan said, and recovery is quick. He said that aside from catheter use for one to three days after the procedure, patients can return to normal activity without significant limitations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-hospital-says-netanyahu-has-undergone-successful-prostate-surgery/7917792.html	2024-12-29T13:40:36-08:00

Former US President Jimmy Carter dies at 100	Atlanta, Georgia — VOA Correspondent Kane Farabaugh conducted numerous interviews with Jimmy Carter on issues ranging from his time in the White House to his post-presidential career as a promoter of global health and democracy. Highlights of those interviews are contained in this report. Former President Jimmy Carter, a peanut farmer and Georgia state governor before becoming president, has died at the age of 100. When Carter took the oath of office as president of the United States on January 20, 1977, he promised a 'government as good as its people.' He presided over four turbulent years. Rising inflation and growing unemployment marred the domestic priorities of his administration. He scored victories in foreign policy with a peace agreement between Egypt and Israel and the Panama Canal treaty. However, a hostage crisis in Iran dominated his final years in the White House and contributed to his defeat in the 1980 general election. But Carter liked to say the end of his presidency in 1981 was the beginning of a new life, traveling the world 'fighting disease, building hope, and waging peace.' 'It has turned out to open up for me and my wife, Rosalynn, a new arena of excitement and unpredictability and adventure and challenge and gratification,' he told VOA. As the head of the Carter Center, the Carters traveled to more than 80 countries monitoring troubled elections, mediating disputes, and fighting diseases. This active post-White House life eventually led to the Nobel Peace Prize in 2002. 'I look upon the Carter Center work as an extension of what I tried to do as president. You know, we brought peace between Israel and Egypt. We opened up a humongous relationship with Latin America with the Panama Canal treaty,' he said. 'So what I have done since then has been kind of an extension. But I do not think there is any doubt that when I won the Nobel Peace Prize, for instance, it was because of the work of the Carter Center. So, I would be perfectly satisfied to have a legacy based on peace and human rights. I mean, who would not?' Carter's journey to the White House began in the small town of Plains, Georgia, where he was born October 1, 1924. After serving as an officer in the U.S. Navy, where he helped develop the post-World War II nuclear submarine fleet, Carter returned to his hometown in 1953 to run the family peanut-farming business. He entered politics in the 1960s, serving two terms as a Georgia legislator before becoming the state's 76th governor from 1971 to 1975. In the 1976 presidential election, Carter, a Democrat, ran against Republican incumbent Gerald Ford, who assumed the presidency after Richard Nixon resigned in the wake of the Watergate scandal. Carter narrowly defeated Ford to become president. The high point of Carter's presidency came in 1978. Carter brought Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin to the Camp David presidential retreat in rural Maryland to negotiate a peace treaty. 'When I became president, there had been four wars between Arabs and Israelis in the previous 25 years, with the Egyptians in the leadership supported by the Soviet Union,' he said. 'They were the only country that could really challenge Israel militarily. And we had success in getting a treaty between Israel and Egypt … not a word of which has ever been violated.' Carter also negotiated a treaty turning control of the Panama Canal over to the Panamanian government and normalized diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China. But in 1979 the primary focus for Carter's administration turned to Iran, where a revolution led by religious clerics toppled the government of the U.S. backed shah, who eventually fled to the United States, where he received treatment for cancer. On November 4, 1979, militants angry with the U.S. for harboring the deposed shah, stormed the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, taking 66 Americans hostage, 13 were released weeks later. Five months into the crisis, in April 1980, Carter authorized a complex military operation to free the remaining hostages. Dubbed Operation Eagle Claw, the plan called for several helicopters and military aircraft to stage at a site in the Iranian desert. Carter, who approved the plan, explained to VOA that the helicopters carrying members of the U.S. military's elite Delta Force, were to fly from there to the U.S. embassy in Tehran, free the hostages and return to the waiting aircraft that would fly them out of Iran. 'The minimum number of helicopters required would be six very large helicopters. So I decided to send eight. One of the helicopters, in an inexplicable way, turned around and went back to the aircraft carrier. Another one went down in a sandstorm in the Iranian desert. The third one developed a hydraulic leak and ran into one of the C-130 airplanes,' he said. The aborted mission ended in failure. Eight U.S. military members and one Iranian civilian died as a result of the crash. Walter Mondale, Carter’s vice president, told VOA that day was the lowest point of their administration. 'When that rescue mission failed and lives were lost. I mean, that was just ... we were just morose that day and for some time after that,' Mondale said. Secretary of State Cyrus Vance resigned in protest of the operation. The failure of the mission damaged Carter's credibility with the American public. The incident occurred seven months before the 1980 presidential election and contributed to Carter's defeat to challenger Ronald Reagan. 'The exact anniversary of the hostages being taken was Election Day,' Carter said. 'Of course, the news media were completely obsessed with the anniversary of the hostages being taken and the fact that I had not been able to get them out. That was the number one issue that caused me to fail.' The hostages were freed the day Reagan became president. In 1981, Carter returned to Plains, unsure about the direction of his post-presidential life. His plans for a library and museum were initially modest. 'I envisioned it to be a tiny thing, where I would have an office and some nice buildings in Atlanta. And that anyone in the world that had an ongoing conflict or potential conflict could come to me and I would help them mediate the dispute and stop a war,' he said. The Carter Center, under his direction, monitored more then 80 troubled elections and mediated disputes ranging from a nuclear standoff with North Korea in 1994, to a peace agreement between Uganda and Sudan in 1999. The center is also a leader in promoting health and fighting disease in the poorest parts of the planet. In one of many interviews with Voice of America, Carter reflected on his life in and out of the White House. He said the greatest part of his legacy wasn't his accomplishments as president or the Nobel Peace Prize, but the eradication of Guinea worm disease. 'There's only been one disease in the history of humankind, ever eradicated, and that was smallpox,' he said, 'So Guinea worm is going to soon be the second disease in history, to be wiped off the face of the earth.' Thanks to Carter’s efforts, there were only 13 cases of Guinea worm recorded in 2022. Carter led an active life until the age of 99, surviving brain cancer in 2015. Declining health and the 2020 global coronavirus pandemic kept him confined to his hometown of Plains in his final years. Jimmy Carter last appeared in public during funeral services for his wife, Rosalynn, in November 2023. In one of his last public media appearances, Carter shared with VOA his hopes for the Carter Center’s future. 'I would like to see the United States in the future strive to be the number one champion in the world of peace and human rights and environmental quality, and I would say treating everyone equal,' he said. 'If we could do that, we would have a real superpower in the country I love very much.' Jimmy Carter lived the longest of any occupant of the White House, and his 76-year marriage to wife Rosalynn is the longest of any president and first lady. Though his final resting place will be on the grounds of his home in Plains, Georgia, the work and the words of Carter live on in the pages of the dozens of books he authored throughout his life. It includes his memoirs, a fiction novel, controversial examinations of the Middle East, and a collection of his favorite poems.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-president-jimmy-carter-dies-at-100/7917788.html	2024-12-29T13:26:32-08:00	
Syria's de facto leader: Holding elections may take up to 4 years	Cairo — Holding elections in Syria could take up to four years, Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said in remarks broadcast Sunday, the first time he has commented on a possible electoral timetable since Bashar al-Assad was ousted this month. Drafting a new constitution could take up to three years, Sharaa said in an interview with the Saudi state-owned broadcaster Al Arabiya. He also said it would take about a year for Syrians to see drastic changes. The comment from Sharaa, who leads the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that ousted Assad on Dec. 8, comes as the new government in Damascus has been seeking to reassure its neighbors that it has moved away from its roots in Islamist militancy. The group's lightning campaign ended a 13-year civil war but has left a host of questions about the future of a multi-ethnic country where foreign states including Turkey and Russia have strong and potentially competing interests. While Western powers largely welcomed the end of the Assad family rule in Syria, it remains unclear whether the group will impose strict Islamic rule or show flexibility and move towards democracy. Sharaa said HTS, formerly known as the Nusra Front, would be dissolved at a national dialog conference. When asked about dissolving the group, Sharaa said: 'Of course. A country cannot be run by the mentality of groups and militias.' The group was once affiliated with Islamic State and al-Qaida but has since renounced both and sought to reposition itself as a force for moderation. It has repeatedly vowed to protect minority groups, who fear the new rulers could seek to impose an Islamist government and has warned of attempts to incite sectarian strife. According to Sharaa, the national dialog conference would include wide participation by Syrian society with votes on issues such as dissolving the parliament and the constitution. On the situation in northeastern Syria, Sharaa said there are talks with all parties to resolve remaining disputes including with the U.S.-allied Kurdish Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). 'We reject Syria becoming a platform for the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) to launch attacks against Turkey,' he said. He said arms should only be under the control of the state, adding that the ministry of defense would welcome those capable of joining the army. In the interview, Sharaa said Syria shared strategic interests with Russia, a close Assad ally during the long civil war which has military bases in the country, reiterating conciliatory signals his government has made previously. Sharaa said this month that Syria's relations with Russia should serve common interests. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said the status of Russia's military bases would be the subject of negotiations with the new leadership in Damascus. 'It is a question not only of maintaining our bases or strongholds, but also of the conditions of their operation, maintenance and provision, and interaction with the local side,' he said in an interview with Russian news agency RIA published Sunday. Sharaa also said he hoped the administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump would lift sanctions imposed on Syria. Senior U.S. diplomats who visited Damascus this month said Sharaa came across as pragmatic and that Washington has decided to remove a $10 million bounty on the HTS leader's head. In response to a question about neighboring states' concerns over Islamist groups, he said: 'We will not work on exporting the revolution. We want to manage the phase with the mentality of the state and not revolution,' he said, reiterating that they are keen on establishing strategic relations with all regional states.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-de-facto-leader-holding-elections-may-take-up-to-4-years/7917780.html	2024-12-29T13:17:26-08:00	
Flights temporarily halted at Halifax airport after airplane landing incident	HALIFAX, Nova Scotia — The Transportation Safety Board of Canada is investigating an incident involving a plane at the Halifax Stanfield International Airport, which one passenger described as a rough landing that sparked flames. Nikki Valentine, who was on the PAL Airlines flight, said passengers felt a 'massive rumble' upon landing Saturday night. 'The cabin tilted, we saw sparks and then flames and then smoke started getting sucked into the cabin,' Valentine said Sunday. Airport spokesperson Tiffany Chase said an Air Canada Express flight operated by PAL Airlines, arriving from St. John’s, Newfoundland, experienced an incident upon landing at approximately 9:30 p.m. Air Canada spokesperson Peter Fitzpatrick said the Bombardier Q400 plane experienced a 'suspected landing gear issue' after arrival and was unable to reach the terminal. Fitzpatrick said the crew and 73 passengers were off-loaded by bus and nobody on board was injured. Valentine said she is 'especially thankful the pilot was able to get ahold of the situation very fast.' The incident temporarily halted flight activity at the airport. As of Sunday afternoon, Valentine and other passengers were still without the bags they were instructed to leave on the plane. Valentine said she contacted Air Canada, who told her that it could be up to three more days before their bags are returned as the investigation into the incident continues. 'A lot of people have things like house keys or wallets they needed and couldn’t get,' she said. 'It’s all proper procedure, and I’d rather the inconvenience (of missing bags) than if anything bad had happened, of course, but it’s still tough.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/flights-temporarily-halted-at-halifax-airport-after-airplane-landing-incident-/7917781.html	2024-12-29T13:13:52-08:00

Sonic 3' and 'Mufasa' battle for No. 1 at holiday box office	Two family films dominated the holiday box office this week, with 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' winning the three-day weekend over 'Mufasa' by a blue hair. Paramount's Sonic movie earned $38 million, while 'Mufasa' brought in $37.1 million from theaters in the U.S. and Canada, according to studio estimates Sunday. On a normal weekend counting Friday, Saturday and Sunday ticket purchases, the winner would be somewhat clear. But when the Christmas holiday falls on a Wednesday as it did this year, the studios look at two sets of numbers: The five-day earnings and the three-day weekend earnings. With the five-day tally, The Walt Disney Co.'s 'Mufasa' had the edge, bringing in $63.8 million. It all adds up to a rather robust theatrical landscape, helped by the continued success of 'Wicked' and 'Moana 2,' which are on their sixth and fifth weekends, respectively. The vampire horror 'Nosferatu' also debuted triumphantly. Robert Eggers’ modern reimagining of a 1922 silent film starring Nicholas Hoult and Lily-Rose Depp rose to the top of a starry batch of Christmas Day newcomers, which included the Bob Dylan biopic 'A Complete Unknown,' with Timothée Chalamet; the erotic drama 'Babygirl' with Nicole Kidman; and 'The Fire Inside,' about boxer Claressa Shields. 'Nosferatu' landed in third place with $21.2 million from the weekend and $40.3 million from its first five days. Not accounting for inflation, it had the best Christmas Day opening ever for a genre film, with $11.6 million (besting 'The Faculty's' $4.4 million in 1998). Focus Features released the R-rated film in 2,992 theaters. It was a gamble to open 'Nosferatu' on Christmas, when family films or all-ages blockbusters tend to be prioritized. But it paid off, attracting the coveted 18 to 34-year-old demographic to theaters. 'It was a risky move, but we knew that we had such a great film,' said Lisa Bunnell, who leads distribution for Focus Features. 'A lot of people thought we were insane. But I think the more that people thought we were crazy, the more we all felt like it was the right thing to do.' The response to the unconventional counterprogramming was gratifying. The sarcophagus-inspired popcorn buckets are even reselling for over $100. 'People keep talking about ‘how do we get people back into the movies?’ I think the only way you can get people to go back is to shake it up,' Bunnell said. 'You don’t just spoon feed them the same things over and over again.' The Bob Dylan movie, directed by James Mangold, also got off to a bright start with $11.6 million over the weekend and $23.2 million since Christmas. The 5-day total is a record for Searchlight Pictures since Disney acquired the company in early 2019. It's been well received by both critics (96% on Rotten Tomatoes) and audiences (A on CinemaScore) and will likely get more of a boost from the awards race. 'Babygirl,' an A24 release from filmmaker Halina Reijn, played on 2115 screens, earning $4.4 million over the weekend and $7.2 million since Christmas. The film stars Kidman as a married, buttoned-up CEO who begins an affair with a young intern at the company, played by Harris Dickinson. Kidman won the best acting prize for her performance at the Venice Film Festival. 'The Fire Inside,' from Amazon MGM Studios, meanwhile got a bit lost in the mix despite strong reviews. It has earned a total of $4.3 million, with $2 million coming from weekend shows where it played in 2006 theaters. Thanksgiving releases continued to perform well through the Christmas timeframe. Fourth place went to 'Wicked,' which earned another $19.5 million, bringing its domestic total to $424.2 million. On Tuesday, the lavish movie musical will also be available to rent or purchase at home. It’s a move that has drawn some critics who believe making it available at home after only 40 days in theaters will cannibalize profits. 'Moana 2' rounded out the top five films this weekend with $18.2 million. The Disney movie has made $882.5 million globally and is closing in on $400 million domestically. Christmas Day itself was massive for the industry, with $61 million in ticket sales. Thursday was nearly as big, with $50 million. 'Every day was like Saturday at the box office because of the way the holidays lined up,' said Paul Dergarabedian, Comscore's senior media analyst. Comscore is projecting that the year will net out with about $8.75 billion in domestic box office receipts. That's down about 3.3% from last year, which cracked $9 billion, and the pre-pandemic normal of $11 billion. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore, are: 1. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $38 million. 2. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $37.1 million. 3. 'Nosferatu,' $21.2 million. 4. 'Wicked,' $19.5 million. 5. 'Moana 2,' $18.2 million. 6. 'A Complete Unknown,' $11.6 million. 7. 'Babygirl,' $4.4 million. 8. 'Gladiator II,' $4.2 million. 9. 'Homestead,' $3.2 million. 10. 'The Fire Inside,' $2 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sonic-3-and-mufasa-battle-for-no-1-at-holiday-box-office/7917744.html	2024-12-29T11:20:20-08:00	
Tourist killed in shark attack in Egypt's Marsa Alam resort	Cairo — One tourist was killed and another was injured in a shark attack in Egypt's Marsa Alam resort, the environment ministry said in a statement on Sunday without giving the nationalities of those involved. There are sharks in the Red Sea but encounters with them are relatively rare. The ministry said the attack occurred in deep water outside the designated swimming zone near the jetties in northern Marsa Alam, adding that swimming out from the jetties was prohibited and the jetties would be closed for two days from Monday. Marsa Alam is an Egyptian coastal town known for its coral reefs, marine life and beaches. The last similar incident was in June 2023 when a tiger shark killed a Russian national in Hurghada, another coastal city on the Red Sea north of Marsa Alam. Last month a tourist boat capsized in the same area, leaving four dead and seven missing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tourist-killed-in-shark-attack-in-egypt-s-marsa-alam-resort-/7917705.html	2024-12-29T10:19:32-08:00	
Croatia holds presidential election with incumbent NATO, EU critic favored	ZAGREB — Croatia’s left-leaning president, an outspoken critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, is running for reelection in the Adriatic Sea state, but is unlikely to get an outright majority in the first round of voting Sunday. President Zoran Milanović, who is often compared to Donald Trump for his combative style of communication with political opponents, faces seven other contenders, including Dragan Primorac, the candidate of the ruling Croatian Democratic Union. The two are expected to face off in the second round on Jan. 12 if no contender gets more than 50% of the vote, according to pre-election polls. The most popular politician in Croatia, 58-year-old Milanović had served as prime minister in the past. Populist in style, Milanovic has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenković and continuous sparring between the two has lately marked Croatia’s political scene. 'Since the election silence is still on, I just want to call on people to get out and vote. To support me,' Milanović said after he voted Sunday. He predicted there would be a second round in two weeks. Plenković, the prime minister, has sought to portray the vote as one about Croatia’s future in the EU and NATO. He has labeled Milanović 'pro-Russian' and a threat to Croatia’s international standing. 'The difference between him and Milanović is quite simple: Milanović is leading us East, Primorac is leading us West,' he said. Though the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme commander of the military. Milanović has criticized the NATO and European Union support for Ukraine and has often insisted that Croatia should not take sides. He has said Croatia should stay away from global disputes, though it is a member of both NATO and the EU. Milanović has also blocked Croatia’s participation in a NATO-led training mission for Ukraine, declaring that 'no Croatian soldier will take part in somebody else’s war.' His main rival in the election, Primorac, has stated that 'Croatia’s place is in the West, not the East.' His presidency bid, however, has been marred by a high-level corruption case that landed Croatia’s health minister in jail last month and which featured prominently in pre-election debates. During the election campaign, Primorac has sought to portray himself as a unifier and Milanović as divisive. 'Today is an extremely important day,' Primorac said after casting his ballot. 'Croatia is going forward into the future. Croatia needs unity, Croatia needs its global positioning, and above all Croatia needs peaceful life.' Trailing a distant third in the pre-election polls is Marija Selak Raspudić, a conservative independent candidate. She has focused her election campaign on the economic troubles of ordinary citizens, corruption and issues such as population decline in the country of some 3.8 million. Sunday’s presidential election is Croatia’s third vote this year, following a snap parliamentary election in April and the European Parliament balloting in June.	https://www.voanews.com/a/croatia-holds-presidential-election-with-incumbent-nato-eu-critic-favored-/7917676.html	2024-12-29T09:50:57-08:00	
Will New Year's Eve be loud or quiet? What are the top 2025 resolutions?	New york — If you're planning on ringing in the new year quietly at home, you're not alone. A majority of U.S adults intend to celebrate New Year’s Eve at home, according to a new poll by The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. 'As I’ve gotten older over the last few years, it’s like if I don’t make it to midnight, it’s not a big deal, you know?' says Carla Woods, 70, from Vinton, Iowa. Nearly 2 in 10 will be celebrating at a friend or family member’s home, and just 5% plan to go out to celebrate at a bar, restaurant or organized event, the poll found. But many U.S. adults will celebrate the new year in a different way — by making a resolution. More than half say they'll make at least one resolution for 2025. There's some optimism about the year ahead, although more than half aren't expecting a positive change. About 4 in 10 say 2025 will be a better year for them personally. About one-third don’t expect much of a difference between 2024 and 2025, and about one-quarter think 2025 will be a worse year than 2024. Relaxed New Year's Eve plans for many Kourtney Kershaw, a 32-year-old bartender in Chicago, often fields questions from customers and friends about upcoming events for New Year's Eve. She said this year is trending toward low-key. 'A majority of who I’ve spoken to in my age range, they want to go out, but they don’t know what they’re going to do because they haven’t found anything or things are just really expensive,' she said. 'Party packages or an entry fee are like a turnoff, especially with the climate of the world and how much things cost.' As expected, younger people are more interested in ringing in the new year at a bar or organized event — about 1 in 10 U.S. adults under 30 say they plan to do that. But about 3 in 10 older adults — 60 and above — say they won’t celebrate the beginning of 2025 at all. Anthony Tremblay, 35, from Pittsburgh, doesn't usually go out to toast the arrival of the new year, but this year he's got something special cooked up: He and his wife will be traveling through Ireland. 'I don’t do anything too crazy for New Year’s, usually. So this is definitely a change,' he said. 'I wanted to do something unique this year, so I did.' Woods will be working New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. She answers calls on The Iowa Warmline, a confidential, noncrisis listening line for people struggling with mental health or substance use issues. 'Holidays are really hard for people, so I don’t mind working,' she said. 'I’m passionate about it because I have mental health issues in the family and so being able to help people is rewarding to me.' Younger Americans are more likely to make a resolution Every New Year's also triggers the eternal debate about resolutions. A majority of U.S. adults say they intend to make a New Year’s resolution of some type, but millennials and Gen Z are especially likely to be on board — about two-thirds expect to do so, compared to about half of older adults. Women are also more likely than men to say they will set a goal for 2025. Tremblay hopes to lose some weight and focus more on self-care — more sleep, meditation and breathing exercises. 'It’s probably a good year to focus on mental health,' he said. Many others agree. About 3 in 10 adults choose resolutions involving exercise or eating healthier. About one-quarter said they'll make a resolution involving losing weight and a similar number said they'll resolve to make changes about priorities of money or mental health. Woods' resolutions are to stay social and active. As a mental health counselor, she knows those are key to a happy 2025 and beyond: 'Probably one of my biggest resolutions is trying to make sure I stay social, try to get out at least once a week — get out and either have coffee or do something with a friend. That’s not only for the physical but also for the mental health part.' Kershaw, the bartender, says weight loss and better health are the top resolutions she hears people make. 'Mental health is the new one, but I think it’s high up there as well as with regular health,' she said. She prefers more goal-oriented resolutions and, this time, it's to do more traveling and see more of the world: 'I don’t know if that’s really a resolution, but that’s a goal that I’m setting.' And how will she welcome the arrival of 2025? Usually, she takes the night off and stays home watching movies with plenty of snacks, but this year Kershaw has a different plan, maybe one of the most Chicago things you can do. This die-hard sports fan will be at Wrigley Field on Tuesday watching the Chicago Blackhawks take on the St. Louis Blues. 'Hockey’s my favorite sport. So I will be watching hockey and bringing in the new year,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/will-new-year-s-eve-be-loud-or-quiet-what-are-the-top-2025-resolutions-ap-norc-poll-has-answers-/7917658.html	2024-12-29T09:14:47-08:00	
Syria's Jewish community can visit one of world's oldest synagogues again	JOBAR, Syria — In this Damascus suburb, the handful of remaining Jews in Syria can again make pilgrimages to one of the world’s oldest synagogues where people from throughout the region once came to pray. Syria’s 13-year civil war left the synagogue partially destroyed. Walls and roofs have collapsed. Some artifacts are missing. A marble sign in Arabic at the gate says it was first built 720 years before Christ. Since insurgents overthrew President Bashar al-Assad in early December, people have been able to safely visit the widely destroyed Jobar suburb that was pounded for years by government forces while in the hands of opposition fighters. Syria was once home to one of the world's largest Jewish communities. Those numbers have shrunk dramatically, especially after the state of Israel was created in 1948. Today, only nine Jews live in Syria, according to the head of the community, almost all older men and women. The community believes that no Syrian Jews will remain in the country in a few years. One of the people visiting the Jobar Synagogue, also known as Eliyahu Hanavi synagogue, on Thursday was gray-haired Bakhour Chamntoub, the head of the community in Syria. 'This synagogue means a lot to us,' the 74-year-old told The Associated Press during his first visit in 15 years. Chamntoub had heard the synagogue was damaged, but he did not expect to see that part of it had been reduced to a pile of debris. 'I am frankly disturbed,' he said. Chamntoub said Jewish people from around the world have been calling him to say they are ready to help rebuild. He had refused to leave Syria during the war, while all 12 of his siblings left. He said he was happy in Syria and surrounded by people who respect him. Chamntoub said he had been one of the few Jews who openly spoke about his faith, adding that he never faced discrimination. He said other Jews preferred not to speak openly for safety reasons amid the animosity in Syria toward archenemy Israel and fears of being labeled spies or collaborators. The Jewish community in Syria dates to the prophet Elijah’s Damascus sojourn nearly 3,000 years ago. After 1099, when Christian armies conquered Jerusalem in the First Crusade and massacred the city’s Muslim and Jewish inhabitants, some 50,000 Jews reportedly fled to Damascus, making up nearly a third of residents. Another wave of Jews later arrived from Europe, fleeing the Spanish Inquisition that began in 1492. The community in Syria numbered about 100,000 at the start of the 20th century. In the years surrounding Israel's creation, Syrian Jews faced increased tensions and restrictions. Many emigrated to Israel, the United States and other countries. Under the Assad family's 54-year dynasty, Jews in Syria enjoyed freedom in performing religious duties, but community members were prevented from traveling outside the country to prevent them from going to Israel until the early 1990s. Once travel restrictions were lifted after Arab-Israeli peace talks started, many more left. Before Syria’s conflict began in 2011, Chamntoub and other remaining community members came on Saturdays to Jobar for prayers. He recalled Torahs written on gazelle leather, chandeliers, tapestries and carpets. All are gone, likely stolen by looters. Barakat Hazroumi, a Muslim born and raised near the synagogue, recounted how worshipers on Saturdays asked him to turn on the lights or light a candle since Jews are not allowed to do physical labor on the Sabbath. 'It was a beautiful religious place,' Hazroumi said of the synagogue, which at some point during the war was protected by rebels. It and the whole destroyed suburb 'needs to be reconstructed from scratch.' Assad’s forces recaptured Jobar from rebels in 2018 but imposed tight security, preventing many people from reaching the area. The new rulers of Syria, led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, have said they will allow members of all religions to perform their religious duties freely. There have been some sectarian attacks but mostly against members of Assad's minority Alawite sect. After visiting the synagogue, Chamntoub returned to his home in old Damascus, close to the private Jewish school known as Maimonides that was founded in 1944 but has been closed for decades. Posters in Hebrew remain on the walls. The area is known as the Jewish quarter. Many old homes have doors and windows closed with pieces of metal and a sign in Arabic saying: 'The real estate is closed by the state's Higher Committee for the Affairs of Jews.' As the Jewish community has shrunk, it has also struggled to find kosher food. Chamntoub receives packages of meat from siblings in the U.S. at least once a year via people traveling to Syria. In the past, he went to the chicken market with a Jewish friend who would slaughter them, but the man now can hardly walk. Chamntoub mostly eats vegetarian dishes. Almost every morning, he cooks for himself and a Jewish woman in the area with no remaining relatives in Syria. The woman, 88-year-old Firdos Mallakh, sat on a couch Thursday under two blankets. When asked to greet an AP journalist with 'Shabbat Shalom,' she replied it was not yet time. 'Today is Thursday and tomorrow is Friday,' she said. Chamntoub, who makes a living as a landlord, asked Mallakh why she had not turned on the gas heater. Mallakh said she did not want to waste gas. Chamntoub hopes that with the fall of Assad, Syrians will enjoy more freedoms, economic and otherwise. In the past, he said, authorities prevented him from giving interviews without permission from the security agencies. 'I am a Jew, and I am proud of it,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7917656.html	2024-12-29T09:01:01-08:00

3 die off northern France coast in Channel crossing attempt	Paris — At least three migrants died early Sunday while attempting to cross the English Channel to Britain from northern France, authorities said. The deaths were confirmed after an early morning rescue operation involving French emergency services and the navy's 'Dauphin' helicopter. Around 50 people were stranded in the water and on the beach near Sangatte at around 6 a.m., according to the regional prefecture. Rescuers assisted 45 individuals, including four who were transported to hospitals. Three unconscious people were pulled from the water but could not be revived, despite efforts by medical teams. An investigation has been opened by prosecutors in Boulogne-sur-Mer. Jacques Billant, the prefect of Pas-de-Calais, said an overcrowded boat may have contributed to the tragedy. 'There were more people attempting to board than the boat could hold,' he said during a press conference Sunday. Sunday's tragedy comes during a spike in Channel crossing attempts as 2024 draws to a close. Officials have noted a significant increase in attempted crossings over the past days. 'Since Dec. 24, 23 maritime incidents have been thwarted by internal security forces, saving over 1,000 lives,' said Billant. 'But crossing attempts continue, despite extremely dangerous sea conditions. The water is icy, so survival time in the water is very short.' This year has been one of the deadliest for migrants attempting the perilous journey between France and England, one of the world's busiest shipping lanes, with at least 76 deaths reported by officials. Billant blamed human traffickers for putting lives at risk. 'These are low-quality boats put into the water solely for profit by these criminal networks, which have no regard for the lives of these children, women and men,' he said. In November, a French court convicted 18 people in a migrant-smuggling trial that shed light on the lucrative but often deadly clandestine business of transporting people across the English Channel. Despite French and British efforts to stop it, the route remains a major smuggling corridor for people fleeing conflict or poverty. Migrants favor the U.K. for reasons of language, family ties or perceived easier access to asylum and work.	https://www.voanews.com/a/die-off-northern-france-coast-in-channel-crossing-attempt-/7917566.html	2024-12-29T07:00:18-08:00	
Tornadoes in Texas, Mississippi kill 2 and injure 6 as severe weather system moves east	Houston, Texas — A strong storm system threatened to whip up tornadoes in parts of the U.S. Southeast on Sunday, a day after severe weather claimed at least two lives as twisters touched down in Texas and Mississippi. The National Weather Service's severe storm tracker indicated the system was moving east through Alabama into Georgia shortly before 4 a.m. The agency issued severe thunder storm warnings with the possibility of tornadoes in western Georgia, the northwestern tip of Florida and elsewhere. On Saturday, one person died in the Liverpool area, located south of Houston, Texas. Four people suffered injuries that were not considered critical, according to Madison Polston of the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. There were 'multiple touchdown points' in the county between Liverpool, Hillcrest Village and Alvin. Officials knew of around 10 damaged homes but were working to determine the extent of the damage, Polston said. In Mississippi, one person died in Adams County and two people were injured in Franklin County, according to the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency. The National Weather Service said two tornadoes hit around Bude and the city of Brandon, ripping roofs from several buildings. It appeared at least six tornadoes touched down in the Houston area, though more may be discovered when crews go out to survey the damage. There was damage in the area from both tornadoes and straight-line winds, according to Josh Lichter, meteorologist with the National Weather Service. North of Houston, mobile homes were damaged or destroyed in Katy and Porter Heights, where the doors of a fire station were blown in, the weather service said. Storm damage has been reported in the northern Alabama town of Athens, just northwest of Huntsville. A National Weather Service survey team was expected to begin assessing damage Sunday morning, said meteorologist Chelly Amin. Also Sunday, the National Weather Service issued severe thunderstorm warnings across portions of the Deep South as the line of storms barreled east through Alabama, Georgia and into South Carolina. Wind gusts of 60 mph (97 kph) were expected in the Spartanburg, South Carolina, area. Damage to trees and powerlines was expected in a number of counties, while a tornada watch was in effect for some parts of the state. At 9 a.m. Sunday ET, nearly 65,000 customers were without power in Mississippi, down from 93,000 around 1 a.m., according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. Some 54,000 customers were without power in Georgia; 36,000, Alabama; 20,000, Louisiana; and 13,000, Texas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tornadoes-in-texas-mississippi-kill-2-and-injure-6-as-severe-weather-system-moves-east-/7917548.html	2024-12-29T06:36:28-08:00	
Azerbaijan's president says crashed jetliner was shot down by Russia unintentionally	Azerbaijan's President Ilham Aliyev said Sunday that the Azerbaijani airliner that crashed last week was shot down by Russia, albeit unintentionally, and criticized Moscow for trying to 'hush up' the issue for days. 'We can say with complete clarity that the plane was shot down by Russia. [...] We are not saying that it was done intentionally, but it was done,' he told Azerbaijani state television. Aliyev said that the airliner, which crashed Wednesday in Kazakhstan, was hit by fire from the ground over Russia and 'rendered uncontrollable by electronic warfare.' Aliyev accused Russia of trying to 'hush up' the issue for several days, saying he was 'upset and surprised' by versions of events put forward by Russian officials. 'Unfortunately, for the first three days we heard nothing from Russia except delirious versions,' he said. The crash killed 38 of 67 people on board. The Kremlin said that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, where the plane attempted to land, to deflect a Ukrainian drone strike. Aliyev said Azerbaijan made three demands to Russia in connection with the crash. 'First, the Russian side must apologize to Azerbaijan. Second, it must admit its guilt. Third, punish the guilty, bring them to criminal responsibility and pay compensation to the Azerbaijani state, the injured passengers and crew members,' he said. Aliyev noted that the first demand was 'already fulfilled' when Russian President Vladimir Putin apologized to him on Saturday. Putin called the crash a 'tragic incident' though stopped short of acknowledging Moscow's responsibility. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told Russian state media on Sunday that Putin had spoken to Aliyev over the phone again, but did not provide details of the conversation. The Kremlin also said a joint investigation by Russia, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan has begun at the crash site near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan. The plane was flying from Azerbaijan's capital, Baku, to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan, hundreds of kilometers (miles) across the Caspian Sea from its intended destination, and crashed while making an attempt to land. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia's civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. The crash is the second deadly civil aviation accident linked to fighting in Ukraine. Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was downed with a Russian surface-to-air missile, killing all 298 people aboard, as it flew over the area in eastern Ukraine controlled by Moscow-backed separatists in 2014. Russia has denied responsibility, but a Dutch court in 2022 convicted two Russians and a pro-Russia Ukrainian man for their role in downing the plane with an air defense system brought into Ukraine from a Russian military base.	https://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijan-s-president-says-crashed-jetliner-was-shot-down-by-russia-unintentionally-/7917504.html	2024-12-29T05:29:46-08:00	
Gaza captors tortured hostages, including minors, Israeli report says	JERUSALEM — Hostages held in Gaza were subjected to torture, including sexual and psychological abuse, starvation, burns and medical neglect, according to a new report by the Israeli Health Ministry that will be submitted to the United Nations this week. The report is based on interviews with the medical and welfare teams which treated more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages, most of whom were released in late November 2023, in a brief truce between Israel and Hamas. Eight hostages were rescued by the Israeli military. The hostages include more than 30 children and teenagers, a few of whom were found to have been bound, beaten or branded with a heated object, according to the report addressed to the U.N. Special Rapporteur on Torture and published late on Saturday. Women reported sexual assault by the captors, including at gunpoint. Men were beaten, starved, branded, held bound in isolation and denied access to a bathroom, the report said. Some were denied treatment for injuries and medical conditions. The report did not identify any of the hostages by name or age, to protect their privacy, but some of the descriptions matched those provided by hostages and staff that treated them in interviews with Reuters and other media and a U.N. report. Hamas has repeatedly denied abuse of the 251 hostages abducted from Israel during its October 7, 2023, assault. About half of the 100 hostages still held in Gaza are believed by Israeli authorities to still be alive. A fresh bid to secure a Gaza ceasefire including a hostage deal has gained momentum in recent weeks, although no breakthrough has been reported as yet. The war began with Hamas' October 2023 attack, in which 1,200 people were killed, most of them civilians, according to Israeli authorities. Israel's subsequent campaign against Hamas has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, most of them civilians, according to Palestinian health officials, displaced nearly all of Gaza's population and reduced much of its territory to rubble. Israeli authorities are investigating allegations of abuse against Palestinian detainees arrested during the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-captors-tortured-hostages-including-minors-israeli-report-says-/7917461.html	2024-12-29T03:16:45-08:00	
North Korea's Kim vows toughest anti-US policy before Trump takes office	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un said he will implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy, less than a month before Donald Trump takes office as U.S. president, the country's state media reported Sunday. Trump's return to the White House raises prospects for high-profile diplomacy with North Korea. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Many experts however say a quick resumption of Kim-Trump summitry is unlikely as Trump would first focus on conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East. North Korea's support for Russia's war against Ukraine also poses a challenge to efforts to revive diplomacy, experts say. During a five-day plenary meeting of the ruling Workers' Party that ended Friday, Kim called the U.S. 'the most reactionary state that regards anti-communism as its invariable state policy.' Kim said that the U.S.-South Korea-Japan security partnership is expanding into 'a nuclear military bloc for aggression.' 'This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how,' Kim said, according to the official Korean Central News Agency. It said Kim's speech 'clarified the strategy for the toughest anti-U.S. counteraction to be launched aggressively' by North Korea for its long-term national interests and security. KCNA didn't elaborate on the anti-U.S. strategy. But it said Kim set forth tasks to bolster military capability through defense technology advancements and stressed the need to improve the mental toughness of North Korean soldiers. The previous meetings between Trump and Kim had not only put an end to their exchanges of fiery rhetoric and threats of destruction, but they developed personal connections. Trump once famously said he and Kim 'fell in love.' But their talks eventually collapsed in 2019, as they wrangled over U.S.-led sanctions on the North. North Korea has since sharply increased the pace of its weapons testing activities to build more reliable nuclear missiles targeting the U.S. and its allies. The U.S. and South Korea have responded by expanding their military bilateral drills and also trilateral ones involving Japan, drawing strong rebukes from the North, which views such U.S.-led exercises as invasion rehearsals. Further complicating efforts to get North Korea to rid itself of nuclear weapons is its deepening military cooperation with Russia. According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war against Ukraine. There are concerns that Russia could give North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, including help to build more powerful nuclear missiles. Russia and China, locked in separate disputes with the U.S., have repeatedly blocked U.S.-led pushes to levy more U.N. sanctions on North Korea despite its repeated missile tests in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions. Last month, Kim said that his past negotiations with the United States only confirmed Washington's 'unchangeable' hostility toward his country and described his nuclear buildup as the only way to counter external threats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-vows-toughest-anti-us-policy-before-trump-takes-office/7917450.html	2024-12-29T02:19:11-08:00	
New Georgian president sworn in; predecessor says he is not legitimate leader	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Mikheil Kavelashvili, a hard-line critic of the West, was sworn in as president of Georgia on Sunday amid a political crisis after the government froze European Union application talks in a move that sparked major protests. Outgoing President Salome Zourabichvili, a pro-EU opponent of the ruling party, said in a defiant speech to supporters outside the presidential palace that she was leaving the residence but that Kavelashvili had no legitimacy as president, which is a mostly ceremonial position. She said: 'I will come out of here and be with you.' 'I am taking legitimacy with me, I am taking the flag with me, I am taking your trust with me,' she added, before walking out of the palace to mingle with her supporters. Zourabichvili says that Kavelashvili was not duly picked, as the lawmakers who chose him were elected in an October parliamentary election that she says was marked by fraud. Georgia's opposition parties support her. The Georgian Dream ruling party and the country's election commission say that the October election was free and fair. The ruling party says Kavelashvili is the duly elected president. The presidential standoff is seen as a watershed moment in Georgia, a mountainous country of 3.7 million that had until recently been regarded as among the most democratic and pro-Western of the former Soviet states. Kavelashvili is a loyalist of Bidzina Ivanishvili, a reclusive billionaire ex-prime minister who is widely seen as Georgia’s de facto leader. On Friday, the U.S. imposed sanctions on Ivanishvili, saying he was spearheading Georgia’s current anti-Western and pro-Russian turn. Protesters hold up red cards Kavelashvili, a former professional soccer player who briefly played as a striker for Manchester City, has repeatedly accused Western intelligence agencies of plotting to drive Georgia into war with neighboring Russia. 'The Georgian people have always understood that peace is the main prerequisite for survival and development,' he said after being sworn in on Sunday. Protesters outside parliament held up red cards in a mocking reference to Kavelashvili's athletic career. Georgian Dream got almost 54% of the official vote in October's election. Local and international election monitors have said the vote was marked by violations that could have affected the results. Western countries have called for an investigation. Zourabichvili is backed by the country’s four main pro-EU opposition parties, which have boycotted parliament since the election. They say she will remain the legitimate until fresh elections are held. The confrontation comes amid a month of protests sparked by Georgian Dream's suspension of EU accession talks until 2028, abruptly halting a longstanding national goal of joining the bloc that is written into the country’s constitution. The move touched off widespread anger among Georgians, who polls show are firmly pro-EU, and prompted a police crackdown, with over 400 people, including senior opposition leaders, detained. Zourabichvili has accused Georgian Dream of deliberately sinking Georgia’s EU hopes and instead moving toward Russia, from which Georgia gained independence in 1991. Opposition supporters say that under Zourabichvili, who was elected with Georgian Dream’s support in 2018 before breaking with the party in recent years, the presidency was the only institution in the country not ultimately under the control of ruling party founder Ivanishvili. They say that with the installation of Kavelashvili, Ivanishvili will have total control over Georgia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-georgian-president-sworn-in-predecessor-says-he-is-not-legitimate-leader-/7917441.html	2024-12-29T01:38:33-08:00	
India shows no willingness to extradite Sheikh Hasina to Bangladesh	India has shown no sign of complying with Bangladesh’s formal request to extradite former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from New Delhi. Hasina fled to India during the massive student-led protests of her regime earlier this year. The Bangladesh foreign affairs adviser Md. Touhid Hossain told local reporters earlier this week that the country’s interim government had informed India of their request to send Hasina back for a 'judicial process.' India confirmed receiving the request. 'At this time, we have no comment to offer on this matter,' said Randhir Jaiswal, spokesperson for India’s Ministry of External Affairs, on Tuesday. Foreign policy experts in India have hinted that Hasina may not be sent back to Bangladesh so easily. Pinak Ranjan Chakravarty, former Indian high commissioner to Bangladesh, told VOA via WhatsApp that when Hasina was sent to India by the military for her own safety, there were no legal cases against her. This would complicate extradition, he said, because it is a judicial process that requires solid evidence of a crime. 'Moreover, the bilateral extradition treaty has political exception clauses as well as clauses for fair treatment and safety. Unless these conditions are fulfilled, extradition could be denied,' Chakravarty added. Officials belonging to Bangladesh’s acting government said that Hasina committed several major crimes during her 15-year regime to hold onto power. Bangladeshi student activist Nahid Islam, who serves as an adviser to the interim government, told VOA by phone that it is impossible to ensure proper democracy in the country until Hasina goes to trial. Islam went on to recount the events of the July-August protests, where peaceful student demonstrations turned deadly after a violent crackdown from security forces, acting on Hasina’s orders. 'More than 1,000 students and other protesters, and children, were killed during the July-August uprising. Hasina is the main accused in these cases,' he said. 'She must undergo trial in Bangladesh and be held answerable for her actions.' The Dhaka-based International Crime Tribunal, a court of justice that investigates and prosecutes domestic war crimes, has issued arrest warrants against Hasina and her associates. She has been accused of orchestrating a genocide during the 2024 protests, alongside other 'crimes against humanity' throughout her 15-year reign. Student leader Islam said that besides the crimes during the protests this year, Hasina is also responsible for several illegal acts during her regime. 'She led the government that orchestrated thousands of enforced disappearances and extrajudicial killings. She is also accused of a massive level of malpractice during her regime,' Islam told VOA.' Islam said the interim government will ensure justice for all the victims of the student protest mass killings, and other crimes spanning Hasina’s regime. 'We believe it is our responsibility.' Zafar Sobhan, editor at the Bangladeshi English-language daily Dhaka Tribune, said the country’s demand for Hasina’s extradition is not only justified but should be uncontroversial and agreeable to anyone who 'cares about justice.' 'Sheikh Hasina is credibly accused of extremely grave crimes. Apart from being accused in the killings of hundreds during the mass uprising against her misrule in July and August, and of other serious cases of abuse of power, extrajudicial killing, disappearances, as well as massive corruption and looting of the public exchequer during her rule,' Sobhan told VOA by email. Sobhan said Hasina must stand trial to send the message that no one is above the law, even when in power. 'Rulers need to know that there will be accountability for their misdeeds, otherwise Bangladesh will continue to suffer misrule,' he said. Sheikh Hasina, who has been staying around New Delhi reportedly at a residence provided by the Indian government, has not made any comment after Bangladesh sought her extradition from India. But a senior leader of Hasina’s Awami League party said that the charges against the ousted PM were 'baseless.' 'The allegations of human rights violations, including enforced disappearance and extrajudicial killings, and other so-called malpractices during the regime of [former] Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina are nothing but baseless propaganda. Since August 5 a long time has passed by but they have not been able to raise or prove any specific allegations against her or her government,' Sofioul Alam Chowdhury Nadel, organizing secretary of Hasina’s party, told VOA by text over WhatsApp. Former Bangladeshi diplomat Khalilur Rahman said that it is irrefutable that Hasina committed 'heinous crimes' that the world watched unfold in real time. He added that Bangladesh will hold her accountable, as they are obligated to follow the directions of the tribunal. 'We hope the Indian government will cooperate. Care should be taken to observe the extradition treaty between our two countries,' Rahman told VOA by text over WhatsApp. He is the senior representative of the Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus, who leads Bangladesh’s interim government. Student leader Islam added that the interim government would take recourse through all legal and diplomatic means to bring Hasina back to Bangladesh to face trial. 'India should cooperate in the process of the democratic transition in Bangladesh by extraditing Sheikh Hasina for trial in our country. That way we ... the two countries ... can bolster our diplomatic relationship,' Islam said. 'India will side with fascism, and stand against democratization in Bangladesh, if it does not extradite Hasina,' he added. Jon Danilowicz, a retired U.S. diplomat who has served in Bangladesh, said that it is worthwhile for Bangladesh to pursue the request even if India refuses to extradite Hasina. 'This will serve as a constant reminder that Bangladesh will continue to seek justice. For its part, India will need to choose whether it stands with the Bangladeshi people or with the deposed dictator. Similarly, Bangladesh should press India to return Hasina’s henchmen who have also sought refuge across the border,' Danilowicz told VOA. 'India’s unwillingness to return these fugitives will be much more difficult to defend as it tries to position itself as a great power,' Danilowicz said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-shows-no-willingness-to-extradite-sheikh-hasina-to-bangladesh/7917429.html	2024-12-29T00:37:07-08:00	
AI technology helps level playing field for students with disabilities	For Makenzie Gilkison, spelling is such a struggle that a word like rhinoceros might come out as 'rineanswsaurs' or sarcastic as 'srkastik.' The 14-year-old from suburban Indianapolis can sound out words, but her dyslexia makes the process so draining that she often struggles with comprehension. 'I just assumed I was stupid,' she recalled of her early grade school years. But assistive technology powered by artificial intelligence has helped her keep up with classmates. Last year, Makenzie was named to the National Junior Honor Society. She credits a customized AI-powered chatbot, a word prediction program and other tools that can read for her. 'I would have just probably given up if I didn't have them,' she said. New tech; countless possibilities Artificial intelligence holds the promise of helping countless students with a range of visual, speech, language and hearing impairments to execute tasks that come easily to others. Schools everywhere have been wrestling with how and where to incorporate AI, but many are fast-tracking applications for students with disabilities. Getting the latest technology into the hands of students with disabilities is a priority for the U.S. Education Department, which has told schools they must consider whether students need tools like text-to-speech and alternative communication devices. New rules from the Department of Justice also will require schools and other government entities to make apps and online content accessible to those with disabilities. There is concern about how to ensure students using it — including those with disabilities — are still learning. Students can use artificial intelligence to summarize jumbled thoughts into an outline, summarize complicated passages, or even translate Shakespeare into common English. And computer-generated voices that can read passages for visually impaired and dyslexic students are becoming less robotic and more natural. 'I'm seeing that a lot of students are kind of exploring on their own, almost feeling like they've found a cheat code in a video game,' said Alexis Reid, an educational therapist in the Boston area who works with students with learning disabilities. But in her view, it is far from cheating: 'We're meeting students where they are.' Programs fortify classroom lessons Ben Snyder, a 14-year-old freshman from Larchmont, New York, who was recently diagnosed with a learning disability, has been increasingly using AI to help with homework. 'Sometimes in math, my teachers will explain a problem to me, but it just makes absolutely no sense,' he said. 'So if I plug that problem into AI, it'll give me multiple different ways of explaining how to do that.' He likes a program called Question AI. Earlier in the day, he asked the program to help him write an outline for a book report — a task he completed in 15 minutes that otherwise would have taken him an hour and a half because of his struggles with writing and organization. But he does think using AI to write the whole report crosses a line. 'That's just cheating,' Ben said. Schools weigh pros, cons Schools have been trying to balance the technology's benefits against the risk that it will do too much. If a special education plan sets reading growth as a goal, the student needs to improve that skill. AI can't do it for them, said Mary Lawson, general counsel at the Council of the Great City Schools. But the technology can help level the playing field for students with disabilities, said Paul Sanft, director of a Minnesota-based center where families can try out different assistive technology tools and borrow devices. 'There are definitely going to be people who use some of these tools in nefarious ways. That's always going to happen,' Sanft said. 'But I don't think that's the biggest concern with people with disabilities, who are just trying to do something that they couldn't do before.' Another risk is that AI will track students into less rigorous courses of study. And, because it is so good at identifying patterns, AI might be able to figure out a student has a disability. Having that disclosed by AI and not the student or their family could create ethical dilemmas, said Luis Perez, the disability and digital inclusion lead at CAST, formerly the Center for Applied Specialized Technology. Schools are using the technology to help students who struggle academically, even if they do not qualify for special education services. In Iowa, a new law requires students deemed not proficient — about a quarter of them — to get an individualized reading plan. As part of that effort, the state's education department spent $3 million on an AI-driven personalized tutoring program. When students struggle, a digital avatar intervenes. Educators anticipate more tools The U.S. National Science Foundation is funding AI research and development. One firm is developing tools to help children with speech and language difficulties. Called the National AI Institute for Exceptional Education, it is headquartered at the University of Buffalo, which did pioneering work on handwriting recognition that helped the U.S. Postal Service save hundreds of millions of dollars by automating processing. 'We are able to solve the postal application with very high accuracy. When it comes to children's handwriting, we fail very badly,' said Venu Govindaraju, the director of the institute. He sees it as an area that needs more work, along with speech-to-text technology, which isn't as good at understanding children's voices, particularly if there is a speech impediment. Sorting through the sheer number of programs developed by education technology companies can be a time-consuming challenge for schools. Richard Culatta, CEO of the International Society for Technology in Education, said the nonprofit launched an effort this fall to make it easier for districts to vet what they are buying and ensure it is accessible. Mother sees potential Makenzie wishes some of the tools were easier to use. Sometimes a feature will inexplicably be turned off, and she will be without it for a week while the tech team investigates. The challenges can be so cumbersome that some students resist the technology entirely. But Makenzie's mother, Nadine Gilkison, who works as a technology integration supervisor at Franklin Township Community School Corporation in Indiana, said she sees more promise than downside. In September, her district rolled out chatbots to help special education students in high school. She said teachers, who sometimes struggled to provide students the help they needed, became emotional when they heard about the program. Until now, students were reliant on someone to help them, unable to move ahead on their own. 'Now we don't need to wait anymore,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ai-technology-helps-level-playing-field-for-students-with-disabilities/7916766.html	2024-12-28T23:22:58-08:00	
What is the Native American Church and why is peyote sacred to members?	The Native American Church is considered the most widespread religious movement among the Indigenous people of North America. It holds sacred the peyote cactus, which grows naturally only in some parts of southern Texas and northern Mexico. Peyote has been used spiritually in ceremonies, and as a medicine by Native American people for millennia. It contains several psychoactive compounds, primarily mescaline, which is a hallucinogen. Different tribes of peyote people have their own name for the cactus. While it is still a controlled substance, U.S. laws passed in 1978 and 1994 allow Native Americans to use, harvest and transport peyote. However, these laws only allow federally recognized Native American tribes to use the substance and don't apply to the broader group of Indigenous people in the United States. The Native American Church developed into a distinct way of life around 1885 among the Kiowa and Comanche of Oklahoma. After 1891, it began to spread as far north as Canada. Now, more than 50 tribes and 400,000 people practice it. In general, the peyotist doctrine espouses belief in one supreme God who deals with humans through various spirits that then carry prayers to God. In many tribes, the peyote plant itself is a deity, personified as Peyote Spirit. Why was the Native American Church incorporated? The Native American Church is not one unified entity like, say, the Catholic Church. It contains a diversity of tribes, beliefs and practices. Peyote is what unifies them. After peyote was banned by U.S. government agents in 1888 and later by 15 states, Native American tribes began incorporating as individual Native American Churches in 1918. In order to preserve the peyote ceremony, the federal and state governments encouraged Native American people to organize as a church, said Darrell Red Cloud, the great-great grandson of Chief Red Cloud of the Lakota Nation and vice president of the Native American Church of North America. In the following decades, the religion grew significantly, with several churches bringing Jesus Christ's name and image into the church so their congregations and worship would be accepted, said Steve Moore, who is non-Native and was formerly a staff attorney at the Native American Rights Fund. 'Local religious leaders in communities would see the image of Jesus, a Bible or cross on the wall of the meeting house or tipi and they would hear references to Jesus in the prayers or songs,' he said. 'That probably helped persuade the authorities that the Native people were in the process of transformation to Christianity.' This persecution of peyote people continued even after the formation of the Native American Church, said Frank Dayish Jr. a former Navajo Nation vice president and chairperson for the Council of the Peyote Way of Life Coalition. In the 1960s, there were laws prohibiting peyote in the Navajo Nation, he said. Dayish remembers a time during that period when police confiscated peyote from his church, poured gasoline on the plants and set them on fire. 'I remember my dad and other relatives went over and saved the green peyote that didn't burn,' he said, adding that it took decades of lobbying until an amendment to the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1994 permitted members of federally recognized Native American tribes to use peyote for religious purposes. How is peyote used in the Native American Church? Peyote is the central part of a ceremony that takes place in a tipi around a crescent-shaped earthen altar mound and a sacred fire. The ceremony typically lasts all night and includes prayer, singing, the sacramental eating of peyote, water rites and spiritual contemplation. Morgan Tosee, a member of the Comanche Nation who leads ceremonies within the Comanche Native American Church, said peyote is utilized in the context of prayer — not smoked — as many tend to imagine. 'When we use it, we either eat it dry or grind it up,' he said. 'Sometimes, we make tea out of it. But, we don't drink it like regular tea. You pray with it and take little sips, like you would take medicine.' Tosee echoes the belief that pervades the church: 'If you take care of the peyote, it will take care of you.' 'And if you believe in it, it will heal you,' he said, adding that he has seen the medicine work, healing people with various ailments. People treat the trip to harvest peyote as a pilgrimage, said Red Cloud. Typically, prayers and ceremonies take place before the pilgrimage to seek blessings for a good journey. Once they get to the peyote gardens, they would touch the ground and thank the Creator before harvesting the medicine. The partaking of peyote is also accompanied by prayer and ceremony. The mescaline in the peyote plant is viewed as God's spirit, Red Cloud said. 'Once we eat it, the sacredness of the medicine is inside of us and it opens the spiritual eye,' he said. 'From there, we start to see where the medicine is growing. It shows itself to us. Once we complete the harvest, we bring it back home and have another ceremony to the medicine and give thanks to the Creator.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hold-for-wknd---what-is-the-native-american-church-and-why-is-peyote-sacred-to-members-/7915544.html	2024-12-28T23:22:25-08:00	
Virginia zoo welcomes newborn pygmy hippopotamus as year ends	richmond, virginia — A female pygmy hippopotamus delivered a healthy calf at the Metro Richmond Zoo earlier this month, officials said — the third baby hippo born at the zoo within the past five years. The mother, Iris, gave birth to the female calf on December 9 following a seven-month gestation, zoo officials said. The newborn, who has yet to be named, is the third calf for Iris and the father, Corwin. One of the calves born previously was also a December baby, the zoo said. 'Most people don't get a hippopotamus for Christmas at all, so we feel lucky to have received two over the years,' zoo officials said in a news release Tuesday. Five days after her birth, the baby had a neonatal exam and weighed 6.8 kilograms. Officials said that fully grown pygmy hippos can weigh up to 270 kilograms. According to the Richmond-area zoo, pygmy hippos are an endangered West African species, and only 2,500 mature hippos remain in the wild. Officials said pygmy hippos are distinctive from regular hippos because they do not live in groups and are usually solitary or in pairs. 'For this reason, once Iris' two previous calves grew up, they were moved to other zoological facilities to live with future mates and continue contributing to the conservation of their species,' the news release said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/virginia-zoo-welcomes-newborn-pygmy-hippopotamus-as-year-ends/7915527.html	2024-12-28T23:21:49-08:00	
Elaborate holiday light displays are making spirits bright in a big way	CONCORD, New Hampshire — Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow might be enough to brighten some homes this holiday season. But others are adorned with thousands of blinking lights synched to blasting music, drawing crowds and bolstering both holiday and community spirit. In a cul-de-sac in Mesa, Arizona, 14 homeowners have been going all out on holiday lights for the last 30 years in a tradition that hasn't been diminished by real estate turnover. Those buying homes in the neighborhood often find the attics full of decor left behind as a gift from the previous owners, and despite cultural and religious differences, residents come together to create a festival of lights, Stephanie Castillo Price said. 'Everybody has been able to take their interpretation of the holidays and put it into a full circle,' she said. 'There's not somebody that's going to walk down the street and not feel included.' In Santa Clarita, California, residents of Wakefield Court decided to coordinate their holiday light displays as a way to bring some joy to their community after an earthquake. Now in its 30th year, the Wakefield Winter Wonderland includes inflatable figures and wooden cutouts of a variety of characters, from Mickey Mouse to Homer Simpson. Bryan Cobb admits he initially was against buying a home in the neighborhood when he and his wife first viewed it. 'She started crying and said, 'But this is the Christmas street! I want to live there!' ' he said. 'She got her way. We live here, we love it. All the neighbors bond together.' In Edmond, Oklahoma, those looking to the western sky will easily spot the Miranda family's elaborate holiday light display featuring images and music from the movie 'Wicked.' Spotlights reminiscent of movie studio lights shoot up from the roof, while a singing witch's face takes shape across a towering tree. 'It just seemed like the perfect fit with a light show because you can really do the drama with the lights,' said Elisabeth Miranda, who handles the programming while her husband, Mark, tackles installation. 'It takes a very long time to set up. Every single bulb has a spot, a place, a number, so that when we program it, it does exactly what it needs to do at the right time.' The family started putting up holiday lights in 2015 and saw a surge in traffic after being featured on ABC's 'The Great Christmas Light Fight.' While most neighbors have been supportive, a few complaints prompted the couple to take a few years off before returning with a better plan to limit viewing hours and control traffic. This year, they are collecting donations for the Oklahoma Fraternal Order of Police. 'They give so much back to our community, so that's our little way of saying thank you to them for everything they do for us,' Miranda said. Charity also is a component in Las Vegas, where Laura Walters and Lenny Standish are closing in on a four-year goal of collecting 10,000 pairs of socks and underwear for organizations that help homeless people. Their display started during the COVID-19 pandemic with a single Christmas tree for community members to add ornaments. This year, they have three snow machines in addition to the lights and music. 'People are looking for joy,' Walters said. 'Our world is a tough place. So to be able to just come and feel just an incredible amount of love and happiness — it's peaceful. We've never had one problem here at all. Everyone's been highly respectful of our home and full of gratitude.' Richard Taylor of Kennesaw, Georgia, estimates that more than 40,000 people visit his display of 1.2 million lights each year. 'We bring joy to a lot of people,' he said. 'They walk around and they forget all their problems, and they just enjoy themselves.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/elaborate-holiday-light-displays-are-making-spirits-bright-in-a-big-way/7914333.html	2024-12-28T23:21:17-08:00	
Mexican prison board game brings together people from all walks of life	MEXICO CITY — On a Sunday afternoon in Mexico City's Roma neighborhood, Rosa María Espinosa joins nearly 80 men under a park pavilion to play poleana, a board game requiring mental dexterity that was born in the city's prisons nearly a century ago. Espinosa blows smoke rings with her cigarette and laughs with the others. Today she will be the only woman playing. Though the game's origins still carry a stigma, it is having a moment as people from diverse backgrounds discover its appeal. 'It's a lot of adrenaline,' said Espinosa. 'But sometimes the dice aren't lucky.' Playing for freedom Poleana is played on a square wooden box with a sunken center for dice rolling. Four players, each with four pieces, race to navigate the board, using specific dice combinations and calculations to move their pieces from their starting positions, around the board, and out through their designated corner, while strategically blocking opponents. The board symbolizes the confines of prison, and getting out before the others, winning freedom — even if just metaphorically — is the game's goal. 'People used to say 'these folks know how to play because they've been to prison,'' said the 62-year-old Espinosa. 'Thank God I've never been, but I like to play.' This afternoon's tournament marks the first time she's competed against anyone outside her circle of relatives or friends she usually plays with on Tuesdays and Sundays in the small chapel of her apartment complex. Ancient roots Alejandro Olmos, an archaeologist and anthropologist specializing in Mesoamerican games at the National Anthropology and History School, has studied and played poleana for years. He traces the game's origins to the Indian game chaupar (or pachisi), with archaeological evidence dating back to 600 A.D. After British colonization, the game spread to various Western countries under different names, including Ludo, Aggravation and Parcheesi. In the United States, game maker Parker Brothers marketed a similar game, which was based on the 1913 novel by Eleanor H. Porter Pollyanna. Sometime around 1940, the game spread in the lockups of Mexico City, with Lecumberri—a prison whose very architecture echoed the geometry of the poleana board — likely serving as its initial breeding ground. It was here where it was renamed poleana and received a new set of rules. 'All cultures have a process called adoption-transformation,' Olmos said. In Mexico, 'the game reflects the roughness of prison life: mistakes are not pardoned.' Poleana breaks out Six years ago, Jonathan Rulleri started a family business promoting poleana with the goal of bringing together people from different walks of life. One of the early challenges was establishing common rules for the game, 'which has been spreading from below, from prison to the street and from the street into neighborhoods,' said the 37-year-old Rulleri, who learned to play while incarcerated in the State of Mexico, outside the capital. After his release, he struggled to find work, a common problem for those who have been imprisoned. He launched a taco delivery service alongside his wife, but the business proved unsuccessful, leading him to reluctantly accept a commission to craft a poleana board for an acquaintance. Then came another commission — and he began to post his creations on social media. 'We dumped the taco idea and started making poleanas,' said Rulleri. The resulting business, Poleana Cana'da Frogs — a name derived from a slang word for prison and a description of the way the pieces hop around the board — has so far organized 55 poleana tournaments in public spaces, emphasizing a family-friendly atmosphere and explicitly excluding betting, a practice common in other poleana events. 'We want to remove the game's stigma, that it was a game for prisoners or slackers,' Rulleri said. In the 1980s, the game began to spread beyond the prisons and found purchase in many of Mexico City's rougher neighborhoods. Tepito — the capital's cradle of street commerce and boxing — is one of the neighborhoods where people can almost always be found playing poleana. At a handball court where men of all ages smack a ball against a wall, others on the sidelines play poleana late into the evening. Fernando Rojas, 57, learned poleana when he was 18, but it was in prison where he honed his talents. The games, which can last for hours, in prison happen back-to-back. 'It really helps you escape the reality of being a prisoner and that's how it started,' Rojas said. 'No one can understand what it's like to be a prisoner … you don't see the end of your sentence. There are people who have to do drugs as their way to escape. Poleana is very important in prison.' Now the game serves as Rojas' therapy: a way to relieve stress and avoid family conflict. He carries his dice and pieces in a small plastic bag, religiously joining his friends at the handball court to play. 'We all have problems, in prison and in the street,' he said. 'So a lot of people come here for a distraction.' In Poleana, plays and number combinations have names. For example, a roll of six is a 'six pack,' because that's what it looks like when seen from above. Rolling doubles prompts celebratory shouts of 'pares y no pares,' a play on Spanish words for pairs and not stopping. With luck, you could get a piece three-quarters of the way around the board. While chance plays a role, mathematical calculation is also key. That's why Diego González and Dana López are thrilled that their 7-year-old son Kevin is learning to play poleana. He has fun and he's getting faster with his calculations. González, 33, also makes poleana boards through his family business, Poleanas Iztapalapa, finding a creative outlet after serving a three-year sentence a decade ago. He crafts personalized boards with details like strobe lights and Bluetooth speakers. His boards are popular gifts for weddings, birthdays and Christmas. Some special commissions have included requests to include images of deceased loved ones in the sunken area where dice are tossed. Others want playful characters to decorate boards they give to their children. Sales surged during the COVID-19 pandemic, when people were shut in their homes and found poleana to be a good way to pass the time. 'Two, three hours counting and tossing, and all that was really nice for them,' he said. 'They realized it's not a bad game, it's a game of strategy and getting the family together.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexican-prison-board-game-brings-together-people-from-all-walks-of-life-/7914327.html	2024-12-28T23:20:45-08:00	
Abortions more common in US, as women turn to pills, travel	Abortion has become more common despite bans or deep restrictions in most Republican-controlled states, and the legal and political fights over its future are not over yet. It's now been two and a half years since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and opened the door for states to implement bans. The policies and their impact have been in flux ever since the ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. Here's a look at data on where things stand: Abortions are more common than before Dobbs Overturning Roe and enforcing abortion bans has changed how woman obtain abortions in the United States. One thing it hasn't done is put a dent in the number of abortions being obtained. There have been slightly more monthly abortions across the country recently than there were in the months leading up to the June 2022 ruling, even as the number in states with bans dropped to near zero. 'Abortion bans don’t actually prevent abortions from happening,' said Ushma Upadhyay, a public health social scientist at the University of California San Francisco. For women in some states, there are major obstacles to getting abortions — and advocates say that low-income, minority and immigrant women are least likely to be able to get them when they want. For those living in states with bans, the ways to access abortion are through travel or abortion pills. Pills become bigger part of equation — and legal questions As the bans happened, abortion pills became a bigger part of the equation. They were involved in about half the abortions before Dobbs. More recently, it’s been closer to two-thirds of them, according to research by the Guttmacher Institute. The uptick of that kind of abortion, usually involving a combination of two drugs, was underway before the ruling. But now, it's become more common for pill prescriptions to be made by telehealth. By the summer of 2024, about 1 in 10 abortions were via pills prescribed via telehealth to patients in states where abortion is banned. As a result, the pills are now at the center of battles over abortion access. This month, Texas sued a New York doctor for prescribing pills to a Texas woman via telemedicine. There's also an effort by Idaho, Kansas and Missouri to roll back their federal approvals and treat them as 'controlled dangerous substances,' and a push for the federal government to start enforcing a 19th-century federal law to ban mailing them. Travel for abortion has increased Clinics have closed or halted abortions in states with bans. A network of efforts to get women seeking abortions to places where they're legal has strengthened and travel for abortion is now common. The Guttmacher Institute found that more than twice as many Texas residents obtained abortions in 2023 in New Mexico as New Mexico residents did. And as many Texans received them in Kansas as Kansans. Abortion funds, which benefitted from 'rage giving' in 2022, helped pay the costs for many abortion-seekers. But some funds have had to cap how much they can give. The ban that took effect in Florida this year has been a game-changer Florida, the nation’s third most-populous state, began on May 1 enforcing a ban on abortions after the first six weeks of pregnancy. That immediately changed the state from one that was a refuge for other Southerners seeking abortions to an exporter of people looking for them. There were about 30% fewer abortions there in May compared with the average for the first three months of the year. And in June, there were 35% fewer. While the ban is not unique, the impact is especially large. The average driving time from Florida to a facility in North Carolina where abortion is available for the first 12 weeks of pregnancy is more than nine hours, according to data maintained by Caitlin Myers, a Middlebury College economics professor. Clinics have opened or expanded in some places The bans have meant clinics closed or stopped offering abortions in some states. But some states where abortion remains legal until viability – generally considered to be sometime past 21 weeks of pregnancy — have seen clinics open and expand. Illinois, Kansas and New Mexico are among the states with new clinics. There were 799 publicly identifiable abortion providers in the U.S. in May 2022, the month before the Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade. And by this November, it was 792, according to a tally by Myers, who is collecting data on abortion providers. Myers said some hospitals that always provided some abortions have begun advertising it. So, they’re now in the count of clinics – even though they might provide few of them. Lack of access to abortions during emergencies threatens patients' lives How hospitals handle pregnancy complications, especially those that threaten the lives of the women, has emerged as a major issue since Roe was overturned. President Joe Biden's administration said hospitals must offer abortions when they're needed to prevent organ loss, hemorrhage or deadly infections, even in states with bans. Texas is challenging the administration’s policy and the U.S. Supreme Court this year declined to take it up after the Biden administration sued Idaho. More than 100 pregnant women seeking help in emergency rooms were turned away or left unstable since 2022, The Associated Press found in an analysis of federal hospital investigative records. Among the complaints were a woman who miscarried in the lobby restroom of Texas emergency room after staff refused to see her and a woman who gave birth in a car after a North Carolina hospital couldn't offer an ultrasound. The baby later died. 'It is increasingly less safe to be pregnant and seeking emergency care in an emergency department,' Dara Kass, an emergency medicine doctor and former U.S. Health and Human Services official told the AP earlier this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/abortions-more-common-in-us-as-women-turn-to-pills-travel-/7917395.html	2024-12-28T18:45:35-08:00	
Iran says 2025 'important year' for nuclear issue	Iran, bracing for the possible re-imposition of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's 'maximum pressure' policy, said on Saturday that 2025 would be an important year for its nuclear issue. Trump in 2018 reneged on a deal struck by his predecessor, Barack Obama, in 2015 in which Iran agreed to curb uranium enrichment, which can yield material for nuclear weapons, in return for the relaxation of U.S. and U.N. economic sanctions. '2025 will be an important year regarding Iran's nuclear issue,' Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi told reporters in Beijing, adding in remarks aired by Iran's state TV that he had discussed the issue in talks with his Chinese counterpart. He did not mention Trump by name, however, or spell out how the year might be significant. Iranian leaders' main concern may be that Trump could empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran's nuclear sites, while further tightening U.S. sanctions on its crucial oil industry. The Iranian rial on Saturday hit a new all-time low against the U.S. dollar amid uncertainty about Trump's arrival in the White House on Jan. 20. The rial plunged to 820,500 to the dollar on the unofficial market, compared with 808,500 rials on Friday, according to Bonbast.com, which reports exchange rates. The bazar360.com website also said the dollar was being sold for about 820,500 rials. Also facing an inflation rate officially put at about 35%, Iranians seeking to shelter their savings have been buying dollars, other hard currencies, gold or cryptocurrencies. The rial has dropped about 18% in total since Trump was elected in November.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-says-2025-important-year-for-nuclear-issue/7917392.html	2024-12-28T17:24:42-08:00	
Plane crashes at airport in South Korea	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — An aircraft drove off the runway and crashed at Muan International Airport in South Korea, with 23 casualties confirmed, the Yonhap news agency reported on Sunday. The Jeju Air plane, which was carrying 175 passengers and six flight attendants, was flying back from Thailand and the accident took place while it was landing, the report said. The airport is in southern South Korea. Photos shared by local media showed smoke coming out of the plane. One person was found alive as the rescue mission was continuing, according to Yonhap. The news agency did not immediately give details on the casualties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/plane-crashes-at-airport-in-south-korea-/7917391.html	2024-12-28T17:18:48-08:00	
UK to tax private schools in $1.9 B boost to public education	LONDON — The U.K. will end a tax exemption for private schools Wednesday, the center-left Labour government has announced, in a move set to raise over £1.5 billion ($1.9 billion) for public education. After years of worsening educational inequalities, from Jan. 1, private schools will have to pay 20% value added tax on tuition fees, which will be used to fund thousands of new teachers and improve standards in state schools. 'It's time things are done differently,' finance minister Rachel Reeves said in a statement Sunday. The funding will 'go towards our state schools where 94% of this country's children are educated,' she said. The policy was promised by Labour in its election campaign and officially laid out in its inaugural budget in October. It hopes the move will bring in $1.9 billion for the 2025-2026 school year and rise to $2.1 billion a year by 2029-30, which will be used to fund 6,500 new teachers in the public sector. Tuition fees in private schools already average $22,600 a year, according to the Independent Schools Council, which represents private schools. That figure is set to rise, with the government estimating that tuition fees will increase by around 10%, with schools taking on part of the additional cost. 'High and rising standards cannot just be for families who can afford them,' said education secretary Bridget Phillipson. Opponents of the reform say state school enrolment will explode if the private sector is lost, increasing the cost to the government. But studies contradict this. The Institute for Fiscal Studies calculated that the number of children in state schools will actually fall by 2030 due to a projected population decline. Several research centers also point out that the disparity between private and state schools widened sharply under the 14-year Conservative rule. The Labour government won a landslide election in July promising to boost economic growth and improve public services.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-to-tax-private-schools-in-1-9-b-boost-to-public-education/7917387.html	2024-12-28T17:10:28-08:00	
North Korea launches 'toughest' US strategy during key party meeting	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un held a key policy-setting meeting of the country's ruling party last week ahead of the new year, state media KCNA reported on Sunday. The meeting of party and government officials decided that North Korea would launch the 'toughest' strategy to counteract the United States for its security and national interests, the report said, without elaborating. The alliance between South Korea, the U.S. and Japan has expanded to a 'nuclear military bloc' and South Korea has become an 'anti-communist outpost' for the U.S., the KCNA report added. 'This reality clearly shows to which direction we should advance and what we should do and how,' it said. The December 23-27 meeting also reviewed the handling of floods earlier this year, including the plan that brought those affected to Pyongyang, the capital, according to the report. The reclusive state also vowed to promote relations with 'friendly' countries during the meeting. Kim also called for progress in defense, science and technology to bolster the country's war deterrence. Such meetings often last a few days and have been used in recent years to make key policy announcements. In a reshuffle, Pyongyang named Pak Thae Song, a party secretary, as a new premier to replace Kim Tok Hun. Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui was named a member of the powerful Politburo of the party's Central Committee. The 11th plenary session of the eighth central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea wraps up a year in which Russian President Vladimir Putin held a summit with Kim and signed a deal that included a mutual defense pledge. Washington and Seoul have criticized the two countries' military cooperation, including what they say is a dispatch of North Korean troops to fight for Russia in its war against Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-declares-strongest-us-strategy-in-key-party-meeting-/7917386.html	2024-12-28T16:58:26-08:00	
Storms delay, cancel thousands of flights across US	Severe weather disrupted holiday travel on Saturday across the United States with deadly tornadoes in the Southeast and heavy snow and wind on the West Coast delaying or canceling thousands of flights across the country. More than 7,000 flights in the U.S. were delayed on Saturday, according to the tracking site FlightAware, and more than 200 were canceled. About a third of the flights were delayed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, Georgia, according to FlightAware, and nearly half of the flights originating from Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport in Texas and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston, Texas, were delayed. At least 10 tornadoes touched down in the U.S. states of Texas, Louisiana and Mississippi on Saturday, leaving one person dead near Houston, the National Weather Service and local law enforcement said. 'Those numbers will probably go up,' said forecaster Aaron Gleason, with the National Weather Service's Storm Prediction Center. The one death and four injuries were reported Saturday in Brazoria County, Texas, about 45 miles south of Houston, according to the Brazoria County Sheriff's Office. Officials say that many homes and schools were severely damaged or destroyed. Images on social media show scattered ruins of homes and snapped trees and utility poles strewn across streets and lawns. Out west, high winds, with gusts up to 241 kilometers per hour in the high elevations of the Tahoe Basin in California and 80 kph at lower elevations hit the area this weekend and with heavy rainfall expected from San Francisco to Portland, Oregon, forecasters said. Forecasters said to expect between 10 and 15 centimeters of rain before New Year's Eve and up to 3 meters of snow in Lake Tahoe, located on the border of California and Nevada. 'Damaging winds could blow down trees and power lines,' the Weather Service warned. 'Widespread power outages are possible.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/storms-delay-cancel-thousands-of-flights-across-us-/7917383.html	2024-12-28T16:37:54-08:00	
Belarus' leader pardons 20 more prisoners; rights groups say repression continues	TALLINN, ESTONIA — Belarus' authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko pardoned 20 more people that rights activists describe as political prisoners, a statement on the president's website said Saturday. The announcement came amid persistent oppression in the run-up to presidential elections next month that are likely to extend Lukashenko's decadeslong rule. Belarusian officials did not provide the names of those released, but the statement posted on the website of the president said that all of them had been convicted of 'crimes of an extremist nature.' The statement said the group included 11 women and 14 of those pardoned suffered from chronic illnesses. 'All of those released repented for their actions and appealed to the head of state to be pardoned,' the presidential administration said in a statement, using wording familiar from a series of previous group pardons in the past six months. Saturday's announcement marks the eighth such pardon by Lukashenko since the summer of 2024. In all, 207 political prisoners have been freed, according to Belarus' oldest and most established human rights group, Viasna. Most were jailed following mass anti-government protests in 2020, when Lukashenko secured his sixth term in a vote widely condemned as fraudulent. According to Viasna, over 1,250 political prisoners remain behind bars. No prominent opposition figures, many of whom have not been heard from for months on end, have been released. They include Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Viasna founder Ales Bialiatski; Siarhei Tsikhanouski, who planned to challenge Lukashenko at the ballot box in 2020 but was jailed before the vote; and Viktar Babaryka, who was also imprisoned after gaining popularity before the election. The mass pardons come amid a new wave of repression, said Viasna activist Pavel Sapelka, as Minsk prepares to hold new presidential elections in January 2025 that are likely to hand Lukashenko a seventh term in office. 'Lukashenko is sending contradictory signals (to the West), pardoning some but jailing twice as many political prisoners in their place,' Sapelka said. 'Repression is intensifying, and authorities are trying to root out any signs of dissent before the January elections.' Belarusian authorities engineer harsh conditions for political prisoners, denying them meetings with lawyers and relatives, and depriving them of medical care. At least seven political prisoners have died behind bars since 2020, according to Viasna. Lukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist for more than 30 years, is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin's closest allies, allowing Russia to use his country's territory to send troops into Ukraine in February 2022 and to deploy some of its tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.	https://www.voanews.com/a/belarus-leader-pardons-20-more-prisoners-rights-groups-say-repression-continues-/7917380.html	2024-12-28T16:19:32-08:00	
Olivia Hussey, star of the 1968 film 'Romeo and Juliet,' dies at 73	LONDON — Olivia Hussey, the actor who starred as a teenage Juliet in the 1968 film 'Romeo and Juliet,' has died, her family said on social media Saturday. She was 73. Hussey died on Friday, 'peacefully at home surrounded by her loved ones,' a statement posted to her Instagram account said. Hussey was 15 when director Franco Zeffirelli cast her in his adaptation of the William Shakespeare tragedy after spotting her onstage in the play 'The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,' which also starred Vanessa Redgrave. 'Romeo and Juliet' won two Oscars and Hussey won a Golden Globe for best new actress for her part as Juliet, opposite British actor Leonard Whiting, who was 16 at the time. Decades later, Hussey and Whiting brought a lawsuit against Paramount Pictures alleging sexual abuse, sexual harassment and fraud over nude scenes in the film. They alleged that they were initially told they would wear flesh-colored undergarments in a bedroom scene, but on the day of the shoot Zeffirelli told the pair they would wear only body makeup, and that the camera would be positioned in a way that would not show nudity. They alleged they were filmed in the nude without their knowledge. The case was dismissed by a Los Angeles County judge in 2023, who found their depiction could not be considered child pornography and the pair filed their claim too late. Whiting was among those paying tribute to Hussey on Saturday. 'Rest now my beautiful Juliet no injustices can hurt you now. And the world will remember your beauty inside and out forever,' he wrote. Hussey was born on April 17, 1951, in Bueno Aires, Argentina, and moved to London as a child. She studied at the Italia Conti Academy drama school. She also starred as Mary, the mother of Jesus, in the 1977 television series 'Jesus of Nazareth,' as well as in the 1978 adaptation of Agatha Christie's 'Death on the Nile' and horror movies 'Black Christmas' and 'Psycho IV: The Beginning.' She is survived by her husband, David Glen Eisley, her three children and a grandson.	https://www.voanews.com/a/olivia-hussey-star-of-the-1968-film-romeo-and-juliet-dies-at-73/7917214.html	2024-12-28T15:28:25-08:00	
DR Congo rebels kill at least 21 in during Christmas week	BENI, DR CONGO — Islamic State group-linked ADF rebels have killed at least 21 people this week in the conflict-riven eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, local sources told AFP on Saturday. The attacks all took place close to Manguredjipa, a town known for its rich mineral deposits and regularly targeted by the ADF. On December 21, ADF rebels made an incursion into the village of Robinet, in the Bapere sector of North Kivu province, a local official said. 'They killed six people on the spot, then on December 22 they arrived at the neighboring village we call Kodjo where they killed 12 people,' Macaire Sivikunula, a representative for the Bapere sector's governor, told AFP. Then on Christmas Day, ADF fighters 'arrived seven kilometers from Manguredjipa in the village called Makele and killed three people,' Sivikunula added. Multiple separate local sources confirmed the dates, locations and tolls of these attacks to AFP. Originally from Uganda, the ADF, or Allied Democratic Forces, have been present since the mid-1990s in the DRC's restive northeast, where its fighters have killed thousands of civilians. In 2019, the ADF pledged allegiance to IS. The IS touts them as its Islamic State Central Africa Province and claims responsibility for some of the rebel group's attacks. At the end of 2021, Uganda and the DRC launched a joint military operation against the ADF. That offensive has so far proven unsuccessful in putting an end to the rebel attacks. Both armies have pushed the rebels back into remote and inaccessible areas, where local civilians are often at their mercy. Sivikunula said the Ugandan and Congolese armies were present and at work in Manguredjipa. 'But as the rebels are scattered in small groups of dispersed fighters, it's really difficult to pinpoint their location,' he added. North Kivu province also faces a separate rebel insurgency further south, with the Rwanda-backed M23 movement and the DRC's army locked in fighting all week following the failure of a peace summit in mid-December. Home to vast mineral resources, the eastern DRC has been plagued by infighting between various armed groups for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-congo-rebels-kill-at-least-21-in-during-christmas-week-/7917197.html	2024-12-28T14:28:44-08:00	
Efforts to free reporter held in Iran 'complicated,' says Italy	ROME — Efforts to release Italian journalist Cecilia Sala from prison in Iran are 'complicated,' Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani said Saturday. Sala was detained on December 19 by police in Tehran and is being held in the city's notorious Evin prison, according to her employer. 'We are trying to resolve a complicated issue and to ensure in the meantime that Cecilia Sala is detained in the best possible conditions,' Tajani said. Asked when she might be released, he said 'I hope shortly, but it does not depend on us.' 'She is obviously detained, which is not ideal, but she is fed and in a single cell,' he said. Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's office said she was 'following the complex affair' closely, and Rome was pursuing 'all possible avenues of dialogue' to bring Sala home 'as soon as possible.' Chora Media, an Italian podcast publisher for which Sala worked, said she had traveled from Rome to Iran on December 12 on a journalist visa, and was due to return on December 20. But she went quiet on December 19 and then did not board her flight. Shortly afterwards she called her mother to say she had been arrested, it said. 'She was taken to Evin prison, where dissidents are held, and the reason for her arrest has not yet been formalized,' Chora Media said in a statement Friday. Sala also worked for Italian newspaper Il Foglio, which said she had been in Iran 'to report on a country she knows and loves.' 'Journalism is not a crime, even in countries that repress all freedoms, including those of the press. Bring her home,' it said. Sala, reported to be 29 years old, last posted on X on December 17, with a link to a podcast entitled 'A conversation on patriarchy in Tehran.' She had previously reported from Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/efforts-to-free-reporter-held-in-iran-complicated-says-italy/7917176.html	2024-12-28T14:02:41-08:00	
Turkish FM discusses with Blinken need to cooperate with new Syrian administration	ANKARA, TURKEY — Turkey's foreign minister discussed with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Saturday the need to act in cooperation with the new Syrian administration to ensure the completion of the transition period in an orderly manner, the ministry said. In a phone call, Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan told Blinken that Ankara would not allow Kurdish YPG militia to take shelter in Syria, the ministry spokesperson said. During the call, Blinken emphasized the need to support a Syrian-led and Syrian-owned political process that 'upholds human rights and prioritizes an inclusive and representative government,' according to a statement from the U.S. State Department. Blinken and Fidan also discussed preventing terrorism from endangering the security of Turkey and Syria, the statement said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-fm-discusses-with-blinken-need-to-cooperate-with-new-syrian-administration/7917171.html	2024-12-28T13:33:31-08:00	
Drought, fire, deforestation ravaged Amazon rainforest in 2024	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — 2024 was a brutal year for the Amazon rainforest, with rampant wildfires and extreme drought ravaging large parts of a biome that's a critical counterweight to climate change. A warming climate fed drought that in turn fed the worst year for fires since 2005. And those fires contributed to deforestation, with authorities suspecting some fires were set to more easily clear land to run cattle. The Amazon is twice the size of India and sprawls across eight countries and one territory, storing vast amounts of carbon dioxide that would otherwise warm the planet. It has about 20% of the world's fresh water and astounding biodiversity, including 16,000 known tree species. But governments have historically viewed it as an area to be exploited, with little regard for sustainability or the rights of its Indigenous peoples, and experts say exploitation by individuals and organized crime is rising at alarming rates. 'The fires and drought experienced in 2024 across the Amazon rainforest could be ominous indicators that we are reaching the long-feared ecological tipping point,' said Andrew Miller, advocacy director at Amazon Watch, an organization that works to protect the rainforest. 'Humanity's window of opportunity to reverse this trend is shrinking, but still open.' There were some bright spots. The level of Amazonian forest loss fell in both Brazil and Colombia. And nations gathered for the annual United Nations conference on biodiversity agreed to give Indigenous peoples more say in nature conservation decisions. 'If the Amazon rainforest is to avoid the tipping point, Indigenous people will have been a determinant factor,' Miller said. Wildfires and extreme drought Forest loss in Brazil's Amazon — home to the largest swath of this rainforest — dropped 30.6% compared to the previous year, the lowest level of destruction in nine years. The improvement under leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva contrasted with deforestation that hit a 15-year high under Lula's predecessor, far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro, who prioritized agribusiness expansion over forest protection and weakened environmental agencies. In July, Colombia reported historic lows in deforestation in 2023, driven by a drop in environmental destruction. The country's environment minister, Susana Muhamad, warned that 2024's figures may not be as promising because a significant rise in deforestation had already been recorded by July due to dry weather caused by El Nino, a weather phenomenon that warms the central Pacific. Illegal economies continue to drive deforestation in the Andean nation. 'It's impossible to overlook the threat posed by organized crime and the economies they control to Amazon conservation,' said Bram Ebus, a consultant for Crisis Group in Latin America. 'Illegal gold mining is expanding rapidly, driven by soaring global prices, and the revenues of illicit economies often surpass state budgets allocated to combat them.' In Brazil, large swaths of the rainforest were draped in smoke in August from fires raging across the Amazon, Cerrado savannah, Pantanal wetland and the state of Sao Paulo. Fires are traditionally used for deforestation and for managing pastures, and those man-made blazes were largely responsible for igniting the wildfires. For a second year, the Amazon River fell to desperate lows, leading some countries to declare a state of emergency and distribute food and water to struggling residents. The situation was most critical in Brazil, where one of the Amazon River's main tributaries dropped to its lowest level ever recorded. Cesar Ipenza, an environmental lawyer who lives in the heart of the Peruvian Amazon, said he believes people are becoming increasingly aware of the Amazon's fundamental role 'for the survival of society as a whole.' But, like Miller, he worries about a 'point of no return of Amazon destruction.' It was the worst year for Amazon fires since 2005, according to nonprofit Rainforest Foundation U.S. Between January and October, an area larger than the state of Iowa — about 15.1 million hectares of Brazil's Amazon — burned. Bolivia had a record number of fires in the first 10 months of the year. 'Forest fires have become a constant, especially in the summer months and require particular attention from the authorities who don't how to deal with or respond to them,' Ipenza said. Venezuela, Colombia, Ecuador, and Guyana also saw a surge in fires this year. Indigenous voices, rights made headway The United Nations conference on biodiversity — this year known as COP16 — was hosted by Colombia. The meetings put the Amazon in the spotlight and a historic agreement was made to give Indigenous groups more of a voice on nature conservation decisions, a development that builds on a growing movement to recognize Indigenous people's role in protecting land and combating climate change. Both Ebus and Miller saw promise in the appointment of Martin von Hildebrand as the new secretary general for the Amazon Treaty Cooperation Organization, announced during COP16. 'As an expert on Amazon communities, he will need to align governments for joint conservation efforts. If the political will is there, international backers will step forward to finance new strategies to protect the world's largest tropical rainforest,' Ebus said. Ebus said Amazon countries need to cooperate more, whether in law enforcement, deploying joint emergency teams to combat forest fires, or providing health care in remote Amazon borderlands. But they need help from the wider world, he said. 'The well-being of the Amazon is a shared global responsibility, as consumer demand worldwide fuels the trade in commodities that finance violence and environmental destruction,' he said. Next year marks a critical moment for the Amazon, as Belem do Para in northern Brazil hosts the first United Nations COP in the region that will focus on climate. 'Leaders from Amazon countries have a chance to showcase strategies and demand tangible support,' Ebus said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drought-fire-deforestation-ravaged-amazon-rainforest-in-2024/7917162.html	2024-12-28T13:14:49-08:00	
Elon Musk vows 'war' over H-1B visas in rift with Trump supporters	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX, vowed to go to 'war' to defend the H-1B visa program for foreign tech workers late Friday amid a dispute between President-elect Donald Trump's longtime supporters and his most recently acquired backers from the tech industry. In a post on social media platform X, Musk said, 'The reason I'm in America along with so many critical people who built SpaceX, Tesla and hundreds of other companies that made America strong is because of H1B.' 'I will go to war on this issue the likes of which you cannot possibly comprehend,' he added. Musk, a naturalized U.S. citizen born in South Africa, has held an H-1B visa, and his electric-car company Tesla obtained 724 of the visas this year. H-1B visas are typically for three-year periods, though holders can extend them or apply for green cards. Musk's tweet was directed at Trump's supporters and immigration hardliners who have increasingly pushed for the H-1B visa program to be scrapped amid a heated debate over immigration and the place of skilled immigrants and foreign workers brought into the country on work visas. Trump has so far remained silent on the issue. The Trump transition did not respond to a request for comment on Musk's tweets and the H-1B visa debate. In the past, Trump has expressed a willingness to provide more work visas to skilled workers. He has also promised to deport all immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally, deploy tariffs to help create more jobs for American citizens, and severely restrict immigration. The issue highlights how tech leaders such as Musk — who has taken an important role in the presidential transition, advising on key personnel and policy areas — are now drawing scrutiny from his base. The U.S. tech industry relies on the government's H-1B visa program to hire foreign skilled workers to help run its companies, a labor force that critics say undercuts wages for American citizens. The altercation was set off this week by far-right activists who criticized Trump's selection of Sriram Krishnan, an Indian American venture capitalist, to be an adviser on artificial intelligence, saying he would have influence on the Trump administration's immigration policies. On Friday, Steve Bannon, a longtime Trump confidante, critiqued 'big tech oligarchs' for supporting the H-1B program and cast immigration as a threat to Western civilization. In response, Musk and many other tech billionaires drew a line between what they view as legal immigration and illegal immigration. Musk has spent more than a quarter of a billion dollars helping Trump get elected president in November. He has posted regularly this week about the lack of homegrown talent to fill all the needed positions within American tech companies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7917156.html	2024-12-28T12:40:38-08:00	
Bloodied Ukrainian troops risk losing hard-won land in Kursk to Russia	KYIV, UKRAINE — Five months after their shock offensive into Russia, Ukrainian troops are bloodied and demoralized by the rising risk of defeat in Kursk, a region some want to hold at all costs while others question the value of having gone in at all. Battles are so intense that some Ukrainian commanders can't evacuate the dead. Communication lags and poorly timed tactics have cost lives, and troops have little way to counterattack, seven frontline soldiers and commanders told The Associated Press on condition of anonymity so they could discuss sensitive operations. Since being caught unaware by the lightning Ukrainian incursion, Russia has amassed more than 50,000 troops in the region, including some from its ally North Korea. Precise numbers are hard to obtain, but Moscow's counterattack has killed and wounded thousands and the overstretched Ukrainians have lost more than 40% of the 984 square kilometers of Kursk they seized in August. Its full-scale invasion three years ago left Russia holding a fifth of Ukraine, and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has hinted that he hopes controlling Kursk will help force Moscow to negotiate an end to the war. But five Ukrainian and Western officials in Kyiv who spoke on condition of anonymity to freely discuss sensitive military matters said they fear gambling on Kursk will weaken the whole 1,000-kilometer front line, and Ukraine is losing precious ground in the east. 'We have, as they say, hit a hornet's nest. We have stirred up another hot spot,' said Stepan Lutsiv, a major in the 95th Airborne Assault Brigade. Border raid turned occupation Army chief Oleksandr Syrskyi has said that Ukraine launched the operation because officials thought Russia was about to launch a new attack on northeast Ukraine. It began on August 5 with an order to leave Ukraine's Sumy region for what they thought would be a nine-day raid to stun the enemy. It became an occupation that Ukrainians welcomed as their smaller country gained leverage and embarrassed Russian President Vladimir Putin. Gathering his men, one company commander told them: 'We're making history; the whole world will know about us because this hasn't been done since World War II. Privately, he was less certain. 'It seemed crazy,' he said. 'I didn't understand why.' Shocked by the success achieved largely because the Russians were caught by surprise, the Ukrainians were ordered to advance beyond the original mission to the town of Korenevo, 25 kilometers into Russia. That was one of the first places where Russian troops counterattacked. By early November the Russians began regaining territory rapidly. Once in awe of what they accomplished, troops' opinions are now shifting as they come to terms with losses. The company commander said half of his troops were dead or wounded. Some frontline commanders said conditions are tough, morale is low, and troops are questioning command decisions, even the very purpose of occupying Kursk. Another commander said that some orders his men have received don't reflect reality because of delays in communication. Delays occur especially when territory is lost to Russian troops, he said. 'They don't understand where our side is, where the enemy is, what's under our control, and what isn't,' he said. 'They don't understand the operational situation, we so act at our own discretion.' One platoon commander said higher-ups have repeatedly turned down his requests to change his unit's defensive position because he knows his men can't hold the line. 'Those people who stand until the end are ending up MIA,' he said. He said he also knows of at least 20 Ukrainian soldiers whose bodies had been abandoned over the last four months because the battles were too intense to evacuate them without more casualties. Russia doubles down Ukrainian soldiers said they were not prepared for the aggressive Russian response in Kursk, and cannot counterattack or pull back. 'There's no other option. We'll fight here because if we just pull back to our borders, they won't stop; they'll keep advancing,' said one drone unit commander. Ukraine's General Staff told The Associated Press in a written response to questions that Ukrainian combat units are inflicting losses to Russian personnel and military equipment on a daily basis, and they are provided with 'everything necessary' to carry out combat duties. 'Troops are managed in accordance to situational awareness and operational information, taking into the account the operational situation in areas where tasks are performed,' the response said. American longer-range weapons have slowed the Russian advance and North Korean soldiers who joined the fighting last month are easy targets for drones and artillery because they lack combat discipline and often move in large groups in the open, Ukrainian troops said. On Monday, Zelenskyy said 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been killed and wounded. But they appear to be learning from their mistakes, soldiers added, by becoming more adept at camouflaging near forested lines. One clash took place last week near Vorontsovo tract, a forested area between the settlements of Kremenne and Vorontsovo. Until last week, the area was under Ukraine's control. This week part of it has been lost to Russian forces and Ukrainian troops fear they will reach a crucial logistics route. Eyeing frontline losses in the eastern region known as the Donbas — where Russia is closing on a crucial supply hub — some soldiers are more vocal about whether Kursk has been worth it. 'All the military can think about now is that Donbas has simply been sold,' the platoon commander said. 'At what price?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/bloodied-ukrainian-troops-risk-losing-more-hard-won-land-in-kursk-to-russia/7917149.html	2024-12-28T12:23:31-08:00	
Afghan forces target Pakistan in retaliation for deadly airstrikes	Afghanistan's Taliban Defense Ministry said Saturday that its forces hit several points inside Pakistan in retaliation for deadly airstrikes last week. Pakistan last Tuesday launched an operation to destroy a training facility and kill insurgents in Afghanistan’s eastern Paktika province. The strikes killed dozens of people, mostly women and children. Comments from the Taliban Defense Ministry on Saturday, posted on social media platform X, said its forces targeted Pakistani points that 'served as centers and hideouts for malicious elements and their supporters who organized and coordinated attacks in Afghanistan.' Ministry spokesperson Enayatullah Khwarzami gave no further information about the strikes, including how they were carried out and if there were any casualties on either side. However, a pro-Taliban media outlet, Hurriyet Daily News, cited ministry sources as saying that the strikes killed 19 Pakistani troops and three Afghan civilians. No one from Pakistan’s Foreign Ministry was immediately available for comment. People celebrated Afghanistan's retaliation in the country's southeastern Khost province, according to the organizer, Rasheedullah Hamdard. Thousands turned out to show their happiness and assure the Afghan military of their support against Pakistan. Khost neighbors Paktika, which was targeted last week. 'All of them were chanting angry slogans against this action by Pakistan, such as ‘death to Pakistan,’' Hamdard said. 'All Afghans are brothers, so it is necessary that the nation and government show their pride in their blood.' Pakistani officials have accused the Taliban of not doing enough to combat cross-border militant activity, a charge the Taliban government denies, saying it does not allow anyone to carry out attacks against any country from Afghan soil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-forces-target-pakistan-in-retaliation-for-deadly-airstrikes/7917118.html	2024-12-28T10:52:40-08:00	
Assad’s fall opens new dynamics in Middle East, regional analysts say	AMMAN, JORDAN — The overthrow of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad regime has opened the door to new dynamics in the Middle East, regional analysts say, with Turkey likely gaining superiority, Iran reeling and, with that, Iraq gaining more freedom from Iranian pressure. The Assad government in Syria spanned 54 years in power — first with the elder Hafez al-Assad and later with son Bashar of the minority Alawite community, a branch of Shiite Islam. Regional analysts say its fall marks a seismic shift in Middle East politics. Sinan Ulgen, a senior fellow with Carnegie Europe speaking during a Carnegie Middle East Center webinar on Dec. 19 in Beirut, called it a 'political earthquake' with far-reaching regional implications. 'Fundamentally, we now see the emergence of a government in Syria that maybe after 50 years really is likely to be more pro-Turkey than pro-Iran,' Ulgen said. 'This is a lasting change in the regional power constellation, which is another reason why the fall of Assad has been welcomed with such zeal in Ankara,' the capital of Turkey. Ellie Geranmayeh, the deputy head of the Middle East program at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Israel’s attacks on Iran’s assets in Syria and its Hezbollah proxies in neighboring Lebanon, as well as Israeli military strikes in the heart of the Iranian capital, Tehran, 'present a moment of regional reckoning' for Iran. 'It [Iran] is definitely on the backfoot,' she said. 'There is now a strategic rethink ... happening in the establishment about where their policies — both at home and abroad — go from here.' Geranmayeh said prominent figures in Iran’s powerful Revolutionary Guard Corps are likely to be replaced with others, given the nation’s demoted regional status and the near demise of its so-called axis of resistance in Syria, Lebanon, Iraq and Yemen. She said that Iran likely will spin a narrative that the late Revolutionary Guard commander Qassem Soleimani’s regional project to surround Israel with a so-called ring of fire has been 'accomplished,' and that Iran will look to devise other plans to deal with the new reality it faces. Harith Hasan, a nonresident senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center, said, 'Iraq is the last stronghold for Iran’s axis of resistance,' but that, too, could be changing. 'So, Iran might try to strongly defend that influence,' Hasan said. 'But as we see, the balance of power has shifted a lot, and the Iraqi government gained more freedom to be able to resist some of the pressure coming from Tehran.' Hasan said concerns about a possible Islamist-led government in Syria is giving cause for concern to its neighbors, as well as to regional political influencers Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. That, he said, 'could give Iraq new leverage' because of its long border with Syria and strong cross-border ties between the two countries. Hasan said that also may give Iraq a way out from under Iran’s influence, as developments in the region continue to unfold.	https://www.voanews.com/a/assad-s-fall-opens-new-dynamics-in-middle-east-regional-analysts-say/7917110.html	2024-12-28T10:42:48-08:00

Russia to stop gas exports to Moldova beginning Jan. 1	MOSCOW / CHISINAU, MOLDOVA — Russian energy giant Gazprom said Saturday it would suspend gas exports to Moldova from 0500 GMT on Jan. 1 due to unpaid debt by Moldova, which is bracing for severe power cuts. It said the company reserved the right to take any action, including terminating the supply contract with Moldova. Russia supplies Moldova with about 2 billion cubic meters of gas per year, which is piped via Ukraine to the breakaway region of Transdniestria, where it is used to generate cheap power that is sold to government-controlled parts of Moldova. Moldovan Prime Minister Dorin Recean condemned the Russian decision, which is a precursor to a total shutdown of Russian gas exports via Ukraine and to Europe, where it flows farther to Slovakia, Austria, Hungary and Italy, once a current transit deal with Ukraine expires on Dec. 31. Moldova will be hit the hardest by the shutdown. 'This decision confirms once again the intention of the Kremlin to leave the inhabitants of the Transdniestrian region without light and heat in the middle of the winter,' Recean wrote on Facebook, accusing Russia of using energy as a political weapon. Moscow has repeatedly dismissed those allegations. Difference over debt Russia, which is critical of Moldova's West-leaning central government, has said Moldova should pay a debt on past supplies. According to Russian calculations, the debt stands at $709 million. Moldova has put the debt at $8.6 million. Gazprom has said previously it wants Moldova to pay the debt before it starts to pump gas to the country via alternate routes. Transdniestria and the government in Chisinau agreed in 2022 that all Russian gas received by Moldova would flow to the breakaway region, which traditionally does not pay for fuel. Without gas supplies, the power-generating plant could stop working and Moldova and Transdniestria would face hourslong blackouts like those experienced by Ukraine due to Russia's attacks on its energy infrastructure in their war. Recean said Moldova had diversified sources of gas supply 'in order to reduce dependence on a single supplier.' 'Our country is prepared to handle any situation that arises following the Kremlin's decision,' he said. Moldova's population of 2.5 million has been preparing for long power cuts since Ukraine's government said it will not extend its transit contract with Gazprom. Moldova and Transdniestria have declared states of emergency over the threat of disrupted gas supplies, and Moldova said Friday it will curb power exports and introduce measures to reduce consumption by at least a third beginning Jan. 1. Moldovan President Maia Sandu has accused Gazprom of provoking an energy crisis, saying it was refusing to supply gas through an alternate route.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-to-stop-gas-exports-to-moldova-beginning-jan-1/7917083.html	2024-12-28T10:13:58-08:00	
Sweden searches for more cemetery space in case of war	GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN — Burial associations in Sweden are looking to acquire enough land for something they hope they'll never have to do: bury thousands of people in the event of war. The search follows recommendations from the Church of Sweden’s national secretariat, which reflect crisis preparedness guidelines from the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency and the Swedish Armed Forces. The preparedness guidelines have been put in a new light by Sweden's decision to join NATO and tensions with Russia in the Baltic Sea region. According to the Church of Sweden provisions, supported by legal paragraphs in Sweden’s Burial Act, burial associations are responsible for ensuring the availability of enough land to bury roughly 5% of the population within a parish, if needed. The Goteborg Burial Association, which operates in Sweden’s second-largest city, is currently trying to navigate the challenge of acquiring at least 40,470 square meters (about 10 acres) of land to ensure it can handle urgent casket burials for some 30,000 dead in case of war. That is in addition to another 60,700 square meters (about 15 acres) of land needed for building graveyards for regular use in Goteborg. 'The [recommendations] mean that we need more land for burial grounds and this is a phenomenon in the big cities, and a problem in the big cities, where land resources are scarce to begin with and not always sufficient to meet burial-ground needs even in times of calm and peace,' said Katarina Evenseth, senior adviser at the Goteborg Burial Association. Together with the local municipality, which has a monopoly in making decisions about land usage in Goteborg, the burial association has identified a vast area appropriate for building a large-scale cemetery for the intended purpose. But a lengthy approval and building process means it could take approximately 10 years to complete, posing further challenges in uncertain times. Meanwhile, the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency, or MSB, continues to stress the importance of crisis preparedness and highlights the efforts of the Church of Sweden. 'Already back in 2015 the Government assigned various authorities to once again start engaging in civil defense planning, and many organizations have started planning, with the Church of Sweden being at the forefront of that planning,' said Jan-Olof Olsson, critical infrastructure protection expert at MSB. 'Unfortunately, it is the case that we are reminded to a greater degree that war could happen and that we simply need to be prepared for that,' Olsson said. Sweden pursued a policy of neutrality from the early 19th century, including during World War II. But public opinion shifted sharply in 2022 after Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine, leading to Sweden and Finland applying to join the transatlantic alliance out of concern about the threat from their newly aggressive Russian neighbor across the Baltic Sea. Sweden and Finland sent out updated civil preparedness guides in November with instructions on how to survive in war. The guides are like those in Denmark and Norway, although they don't mention Russia by name.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-searches-for-more-cemetery-space-in-case-of-war/7917072.html	2024-12-28T10:01:45-08:00	
Extremist groups harass Kashmiri vendors in northern India	SRINAGAR, INDIAN-ADMINISTERED KASHMIR — Nomadic shawl vendors from the Indian side of Kashmir told VOA Friday that extremist Hindu groups have been harassing, threatening and obstructing them from selling their goods in Himachal Pradesh, a northern Indian state. Hindu groups claim that the local shopkeepers lose business when nomadic vendors sell their wares nearby. Sandeep Dhawal, police superintendent in the Bilaspur district, quoted in Friday’s edition of the Indian Express, a leading Indian newspaper, acknowledged that more than a dozen shawl vendors filed a complaint at the Ghumarwin police station. Dhawal said a similar dispute arose last year between Kashmiri hawkers and local shopkeepers, who claimed financial losses because of the vendors. 'No physical assault has been reported,' he told the Indian Express. 'We have requested the Deputy Commissioner’s office in Bilaspur to mediate and resolve the issue amicably. A meeting between both parties is expected within the next day or two.' The Indian Express reported that senior officials attributed the harassment claims to 'business rivalry' between the Kashmiri vendors and local shopkeepers affiliated with the Ghumarwin Beopar Mandal. A police investigation is under way. The traders said they have been visiting the region for more than 30 years but are facing threats and pressure this year to leave the state, where they stay for a few months annually. Kashmir vendors sell leather jackets, socks, bags and Kashmir-handmade Pashmina shawls. They also sell ladies suits. They move to different states of India to sell these items in the beginning of November and return after March. They carry their goods on their shoulders and sell them anywhere they find customers. 'For the past three days we have been forced by some Hindu extremist groups to stop selling our goods. They tell us to pack up our belongings and go back to Kashmir,' a trader currently residing in the Ghumarwin area of Bilaspur, Himachal Pradesh, said to VOA on the condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal. 'These threats and intimidations used to happen occasionally, but this year when we go to the market to purchase food and other essentials, we are mistreated there as well,' he said. He noted it has become difficult for them to even 'step out' of their rented accommodations. The trader said he and his fellow vendors asked the Hindu groups whether they considered Kashmiris less Indian. 'We also told them, ‘If people from other parts of India can work in Kashmir, then why we can’t work here?’' the trader said. 'Instead of apologizing, they threatened us with dire consequences if we don’t leave Himachal Pradesh. They also accused us of being anti-nationals and terror sympathizers.' Thousands of Kashmiris travel every winter to various Indian states to sell handmade goods such as shawls, suits and leather jackets door-to-door or street-to-street. They say they sometimes face difficulties — verbal abuse, physical assault and boycott calls — because of their regional identity and the growing communal tensions in India. The traders say such incidents were rare before 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling Bharatiya Janata Party came to power. 'Before 2014, only an insane person would make such statements or resort to violence, but today it has become common,' Peerzada Mohammad Shafi Shah, a leather jacket vendor, told VOA from Salt Lake City, West Bengal. 'Muslims, particularly Kashmiris, are seen as enemies in almost every part of India. There are three to four states where communalism is so high that the majority of Kashmiris have stopped going there,' Shah said. 'Had the government of Jammu and Kashmir, or J&K, taken action in the beginning, things could have been much better.' The traders in Himachal Pradesh claimed people affiliated with Hindu extremist groups have threatened them and the owners of buildings where they stay, either individually or in groups. 'We are being warned that they are being polite now, and if we do not comply, they will return and their language will be different,' another Kashmiri shawl seller told VOA, on the condition of anonymity out of fear for his safety. 'No one else has issues with us except them. They give absurd reasons, like claiming that local shopkeepers in Himachal Pradesh suffer because of us, even though their line of work is entirely different from ours,' he said. Maqsood Khan, one of the traders, said that following the police complaint, the deputy superintendent of the Ghumarwin police department visited them. He said the police officer spoke with representatives on both sides of the disagreement and instructed the accused persons not to harass the Kashmiri traders. 'The deputy superintendent of police told the opposing party that we, too, have the right to sell our products, just like the local shopkeepers in the area,' he said. 'This has eased temporarily,' but the situation will be remedied 'only after the representatives of both sides will express each other’s concerns in front of [the] deputy commissioner.' Meanwhile, Ifra Jan, the spokesperson of J&K’s ruling party, National Conference, told VOA by phone the lives and security of Kashmiri traders across India is crucial to her party. 'When we got to know about the harassment case, when these people were mishandled and abused and threatened, the Chief Minister of J&K Omar Abdullah immediately got in touch with chief minister of Himachal Pradesh,' Jan said. 'The Himachal Pradesh government has now taken cognizance of the matter, and his office is ensuring a safe and secure environment for the Kashmiri traders and students living there.' VOA contacted the Ghumarwin police department about the latest developments in the situation, although officers there said only higher officials can speak about the matter, and they were not available for comment. Earlier in November, a female official from a Panchayat, a local self-government body in Indian villages, told Kashmiri shawl sellers not to trade in Himachal Pradesh. In a video, she told them to leave the village and chanted 'hail Lord Ram' — one of the revered deities in Hinduism. She later apologized for those comments after being summoned to the Himachal Pradesh police station. 'We want to put an end to this unwanted controversy and live happily and peacefully alongside [our] Hindu brethren in the state,' Khan the trader said. 'We urge governments of both regions to do the needful' and take steps to end the harassment, 'to address the issue once and for all.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/extremist-groups-harass-kashmiri-vendors-in-northern-india/7917048.html	2024-12-28T09:37:14-08:00	
Trump energy plans complicated by tariffs, global competition	A different approach to energy is at the center of President-elect Donald Trump’s promise to bring down the cost of living for Americans. But as VOA’s Congressional Correspondent Katherine Gypson reports, Trump’s plans could be complicated by a complex global interdependence on oil and gas supplies.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-energy-plans-complicated-by-tariffs-global-competition/7916993.html	2024-12-28T08:10:49-08:00	
Putin apologizes to Azerbaijan for 'tragic incident' of plane crash	MOSCOW — Russian President Vladimir Putin Saturday apologized to his Azerbaijani counterpart for what he called a 'tragic incident' following the crash of an Azerbaijani airliner in Kazakhstan that killed 38 people. The Kremlin said in a statement that air defense systems were firing near Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, due to a Ukrainian drone strike as the plane attempted to land Wednesday. It stopped short of saying the plane was shot down by Russian air defenses. According to a Kremlin readout of the call, Putin apologized to Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev 'for the fact that the tragic incident occurred in Russian airspace.' The plane was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku to Grozny when it turned toward Kazakhstan and crashed while trying to land. There were 29 survivors. On Friday, a U.S. official and an Azerbaijani minister made separate statements blaming the crash on an external weapon. Friday’s assessments by Rashan Nabiyev and White House national security spokesperson John Kirby echoed those made by outside aviation experts who blamed the crash on Russian air defense systems responding to a Ukrainian attack. Neither Kirby nor the Azerbaijani minister directly addressed the statements blaming air defenses. Kirby told reporters Friday that the U.S. has 'seen some early indications that would certainly point to the possibility that this jet was brought down by Russian air defense systems,' but he refused to elaborate, citing an ongoing investigation. Nabiyev, Azerbaijan’s minister of digital development and transportation, told Azerbaijani media that 'preliminary conclusions by experts point to external impact,' as does witness testimony. Passengers and crew who survived the crash told Azerbaijani media that they heard loud noises on the aircraft as it was circling over Grozny. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, said Friday that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting the city, prompting authorities to close the area to air traffic. Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land, he was offered other airports but decided to fly to Aktau in Kazakhstan, across the Caspian Sea. He didn’t comment on statements from some aviation experts who pointed out that holes seen in the plane’s tail section suggested that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems. Earlier this week, Rosaviatsia cited unspecified early evidence as showing that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. In the days following the crash, Azerbaijan Airlines blamed 'physical and technical interference' and announced the suspension of flights to several Russian airports. It didn’t say where the interference came from or provide any further details.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-apologizes-to-azerbaijan-for-tragic-incident-of-plane-crash/7916971.html	2024-12-28T07:23:21-08:00	
South Africa reroutes Mozambique trade, travel to Eswatini border amid violence	MBABANE, ESWATINI — As Mozambique grapples with a political crisis following a disputed national election and violent protests, the situation at its southern border with South Africa is increasingly volatile, affecting trade and travel. The violence in Mozambique forced trade and travel to be diverted from South Africa’s Leebombo Border Post to Eswatini’s Mananga Border Post, with Mananga serving as a makeshift lifeline for those seeking passage from Mozambique. Michael Masiapato, commissioner of South Africa’s Border Management Authority, told VOA that although authorities are managing the crisis, it continues to pose significant challenges. 'Even ... when they deploy the military and when they deploy police officers on the corridor [between the capital, Maputo, and the border], it is not able to cover each and every area,' he said. The protests, he said, are 'very much sporadic' and 'very much widespread.' Following presidential candidate Daniel Chapo's controversial election victory Monday, Mozambique plunged into turmoil, leaving scores dead amid violent protests. Some analysts expressed concern that continued political violence could destabilize regional security and impede economic development, sparking weapons proliferation and criminal activity. Solomon Mondlane, a political analyst in Mozambique, told VOA he is cautiously optimistic that South African and European efforts can help calm the situation. 'The situation is volatile,' Mondlane said. 'The good news is we're hearing more calls from different countries — from South Africa, from other European countries — calling for more dialogue. South Africa has come out to say they are willing to facilitate a dialogue. 'We know that South Africa's ANC-led government has been in support of Frelimo,' the ruling political party,' he said. 'They were the first to congratulate Frelimo for winning these rigged elections. But we are happy that they are adhering to the calls now to say we are willing to facilitate dialogue between the opposition in Mozambique and the ruling party.' Levy Ndou, a South African political analyst and lecturer at Tshwane University of Technology in Johannesburg, said he believes regional players’ efforts at dialogue with the Mozambican government are encouraging signs that many in the region are seeking peace and stability. 'Of course, if the situation gets out of hand, it will therefore require the intervention of SADC in order to ensure that there is peace, there is stability and, indeed, there is economic activity that is going on,' Ndou said, referring to the Southern African Development Community. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the SADC chair, has said the regional bloc is ready to assist Mozambique.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-africa-reroutes-mozambique-trade-travel-to-eswatini-border-amid-violence/7916961.html	2024-12-28T07:10:44-08:00	
Turkey's pro-Kurd party to meet jailed PKK leader on Saturday	ISTANBUL — A delegation from Turkey's main pro-Kurdish DEM party is due on Saturday to visit jailed PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan, who is serving a life sentence on a prison island off Istanbul, a party source said. 'The delegation left in the morning,' the source told AFP, without elaborating how they would travel to the island for security reasons. The visit would be the party's first in almost 10 years. DEM's predecessor, the HDP party, last met Ocalan in April 2015. On Friday, the government approved DEM's request to visit Ocalan, who founded the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, nearly half a century ago and has languished in solitary confinement since 1999. The PKK is regarded as a terror organization by Turkey and most of its Western allies, including the United States and European Union. The DEM party delegation is made up of two lawmakers — Sirri Sureyya Onder and Pervin Buldan. They are not expected to make a statement after the visit, the same source told AFP. Detained 25 years ago in a Hollywood-style operation by Turkish security forces in Kenya after years on the run, Ocalan was sentenced to death. He escaped the gallows when Turkey abolished capital punishment in 2004 and is spending his remaining years in an isolation cell on the Imrali prison island south of Istanbul. Saturday's rare visit became possible after President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's nationalist ally Devlet Bahceli invited Ocalan to come to parliament to renounce 'terror' and to disband the militant group. Bahceli, who heads the ultra-nationalist MHP party, is fiercely hostile to the PKK. Erdogan backed the unprecedented appeal as a 'historic window of opportunity.' 'My dear Kurdish brothers, we expect you to firmly grasp [Bahceli's] sincerely outstretched hand,' he said in October, urging them to join in efforts to build what he called the 'century of Turkey.' Soon after Bahceli's call, Ocalan was allowed his first family visit since March 2020, prompting DEM to make its own request to the Justice Ministry to visit the 75-year-old militant. PKK militants subsequently claimed responsibility for an attack in October on a Turkish defense firm that killed five. That delayed the government approval of DEM's request. For several years up to 2015, Ocalan was engaged in talks with authorities, when then-Prime Minister Erdogan called for a solution for what is often called Turkey's 'Kurdish problem.' The peace process and a truce collapsed in 2015, sparking the resumption of violence, especially in the Kurdish-majority southeast. The government's surprise olive branch to the Kurds comes after rebels in neighboring Syria overthrew strongman president Bashar al-Assad on Dec. 8. Turkey routinely targets Kurdish fighters in northern Syria and Iraq.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-s-pro-kurd-party-to-meet-jailed-pkk-leader-on-saturday/7916870.html	2024-12-28T03:37:00-08:00	
Ukraine says it struck drone depot in Russia's Oryol region	Ukraine said on Saturday it had struck a storage and maintenance depot for long-range Shahed drones in Russia's Oryol region, adding that this had 'significantly reduced' Russia's ability to launch mass drone attacks on Ukraine. Ukraine military's general staff said in a statement on Telegram the attack took place on Thursday and was conducted by Ukraine's air force. 'As a result of the strike, a depot for storage, maintenance and repair of Shahed kamikaze drones, made of several protected concrete structures, was destroyed,' it said. 'This military operation has significantly reduced the enemy's potential in terms of conducting air raids of strike drones on Ukraine's civilian infrastructure.' Moscow has not made any comment on the attack. Russia has regularly launched missile and drone attacks on Ukraine throughout its 34-month invasion. For the past several months, Moscow has launched near-daily barrages of dozens of drones at Ukraine, hoping to damage its infrastructure and wear down air defenses leaving them less able to shoot down missiles. Ukraine's air force said earlier on Saturday it had downed 15 out of 16 drones launched by Russia overnight, with the other one disappearing from radar.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-it-struck-drone-depot-in-russia-s-oryol-region/7916862.html	2024-12-28T03:16:24-08:00	
Major Gaza hospital shut after Israeli raid, officials say	GAZA STRIP — An Israeli military raid targeting Hamas militants has forced a major hospital in northern Gaza out of service and led to the detention of its director, the World Health Organization and health officials said Saturday. The assault on Kamal Adwan Hospital has rendered the facility 'useless,' further worsening Gaza's severe health crisis, the Palestinian territory's health officials said. 'This morning's raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital has put this last major health facility in north Gaza out of service. Initial reports indicate that some key departments were severely burnt and destroyed during the raid,' the World Health Organization said overnight on X, referring to the Israeli operation that began in the early hours of Friday. The WHO said 60 health workers and 25 patients in critical condition, including some on ventilators, reportedly remain in the hospital. Patients in moderate to severe condition were forced to evacuate to the destroyed, non-functioning Indonesian Hospital, the U.N. health agency said, adding it was 'deeply concerned for their safety.' Hamas-run Gaza's health ministry reported that Israeli forces detained Kamal Adwan Hospital's director, Hossam Abu Safiyeh, along with several medical staff members. Gaza's civil defense agency said Abu Safiyeh was held alongside its north Gaza chief, Ahmed Hassan al-Kahlout. The Israeli military did not comment on the detentions. In the days leading up to the raid, Abu Safiyeh had repeatedly warned about the hospital's precarious situation, accusing Israeli forces of targeting the facility. On Monday, he issued a statement accusing Israel of targeting the hospital 'with the intent to kill and forcibly displace the people inside.' On Thursday, Abu Safiyeh said five staff members of the hospital had been killed in an Israeli strike near the facility. Since Oct. 6, Israel has intensified its land and air offensive in northern Gaza, saying its goal is to prevent Hamas militants from regrouping. The military said Friday that it was acting on intelligence regarding 'terrorist infrastructure and operatives' in the hospital's vicinity. 'Heinous crime' Before initiating the latest operation near the hospital, the military said its troops had 'facilitated the secure evacuation of civilians, patients, and medical personnel.' Hamas has denied claims its operatives were present at the hospital, accusing Israeli forces of storming it on Friday. 'The enemy's lies about the hospital aim to justify the heinous crime committed by the occupation army today, involving the evacuation and burning of all hospital departments as part of a plan for extermination and forced displacement,' Hamas said in a statement. Gaza's health ministry had earlier quoted Abu Safiyeh reporting that the military had 'set on fire all surgery departments of the hospital.' Abu Safiyeh said the military had also 'evacuated the entire medical staff and displaced people.' 'There are a large number of injuries among the medical team.' Iran, which backs Hamas, 'strongly condemned the brutal attack,' with a foreign ministry statement calling it 'the latest example of war crimes, crimes against humanity, gross violations of international law and norms.' Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. The Israeli military has regularly accused Hamas of using hospitals as command and control centers for attacks against its forces throughout the war. Hamas has denied the accusations. The WHO reiterated its call for a ceasefire. 'This raid on Kamal Adwan Hospital comes after escalating restrictions on access for WHO and partners, and repeated attacks on or near the facility since early October,' the WHO said. 'Such hostilities and the raids are undoing all our efforts and support to keep the facility minimal functional. The systematic dismantling of the health system in Gaza is a death sentence for tens of thousands of Palestinians in need of health care.' Meanwhile, Hamas's media center reported 'massive Israeli air and artillery strikes in Beit Hanoun,' in northern Gaza. The Israeli military says it has killed hundreds of militants since the stepped-up assault in northern Gaza began on October 6, while rescuers in the area say thousands of civilians have died in the sweeping offensive. Gaza civil defense also reported that in a separate Israeli strike in central Gaza at least nine Palestinians were killed on Saturday. The Gaza war was triggered by the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack on Israel last year, which resulted in 1,208 deaths, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. Israel's retaliatory military campaign has killed at least 45,436 people in Gaza, a majority of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-run territory's health ministry that the U.N. considers reliable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/major-gaza-hospital-shut-after-israeli-raid-officials-say/7916848.html	2024-12-28T01:59:45-08:00	
Israel says it intercepted missile from Yemen, day after Sanaa hit with strikes	SANAA, YEMEN — The Israeli military said it intercepted a missile launched from Yemen early Saturday, a day after the Houthi-held capital Sanaa was hit by fresh airstrikes. Sirens sounded in areas of Jerusalem and the Dead Sea on Saturday as 'a missile launched from Yemen was intercepted ... prior to crossing into Israeli territory,' the Israeli military said. The day before, a fresh airstrike hit Sanaa, which Houthi rebels blamed on 'U.S.-British aggression' though it remains unclear who was behind it. There was no comment from Israel, the United States or Britain. 'I heard the blast. My house shook,' one Sanaa resident told AFP late Friday. The Iran-backed Houthis control large parts of Yemen after seizing Sanaa and ousting the government in 2014. Since the eruption of war in Gaza in October last year, the Houthis -- claiming solidarity with Palestinians -- have fired a series of missiles and drones at Israel. They have stepped up their attacks since November's ceasefire between Israel and another Iran-backed group, Hezbollah in Lebanon. Israel has also struck Yemen, including targeting Sanaa's international airport on Thursday in an attack that came as the head of the World Health Organization was about to board a plane. The Houthis have also attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea, prompting reprisal strikes by the United States and sometimes Britain. Earlier Friday, before the strike on Sanaa, tens of thousands of people gathered to protest and express solidarity with Palestinians. 'The equation has changed and has become: (targeting) airport for airport, port for port, and infrastructure for infrastructure,' Houthi supporter Mohammed al-Gobisi said. 'We will not get tired or bored of supporting our brothers in Gaza.' The war in Gaza was triggered by the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel that killed about 1,200 people and led to the capture of 250 hostages. Gaza health officials say Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, while Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Airport damaged Israel's strike on the Sanaa international airport on Thursday shattered windows and left the top of the control tower a bombed-out shell. A witness told AFP that the raids also targeted the adjacent Al-Dailami air base, which shares the airport's runway. 'The attack resulted in four dead until now and around 20 wounded from staff, airport and passengers,' Houthi Deputy Transport Minister Yahya al-Sayani said. It occurred as the head of the U.N.'s World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, was preparing to fly out, and left one U.N. crew member injured. Tedros was in Yemen to seek the release of U.N. staff detained for months by the Houthis, and to assess the humanitarian situation. He later posted on social media that he had safely reached Jordan with his team. He said the injured member of the U.N.'s Humanitarian Air Service 'underwent successful surgery and is now in stable condition.' Israel's military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they knew at the time that the WHO chief was there. An Israeli statement said its targets included 'military infrastructure' at the airport and power stations in Sanaa and Hodeida -- a major entry point for humanitarian aid -- as well as other facilities at several ports. Houthis use these sites 'to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials,' the statement said. But U.N. humanitarian coordinator Julien Harneis said the airport was 'a civilian location' which the UN also uses, and the strikes took place as 'a packed civilian airliner from Yemenia Air, carrying hundreds of Yemenis, was about to land.' Although the plane 'was able to land safely ... it could have been far, far worse,' Harneis said. In his latest warning to the Houthis, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel's strikes would 'continue until the job is done.' 'We are determined to cut this branch of terrorism from the Iranian axis of evil,' he said in a video statement. Despite the damage, flights at Sanaa airport resumed at 10 a.m. (0700 GMT) on Friday, deputy transport minister Sayani said. Yemenis depend on aid U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres denounced the escalation in hostilities and said bombing transportation infrastructure threatened humanitarian operations in Yemen, where 80% of the population depends on aid. The United Nations has called Yemen 'the largest humanitarian crisis in the world,' with 24.1 million people in need of humanitarian aid and protection. The airport is 'absolutely vital' to continue transporting aid for Yemen, U.N. humanitarian coordinator Harneis said. 'If that airport is disabled, it will paralyze humanitarian operations.' After the attack on Sanaa airport, Houthis said they fired a missile at Ben Gurion Airport outside Tel Aviv and launched drones at the city and a ship in the Arabian Sea. The Israeli military said the same day a missile launched from Yemen had been intercepted. Israeli 'aggression will only increase the determination and resolve of the great Yemeni people to continue supporting the Palestinian people,' a Houthi statement said Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-intercepted-missile-from-yemen-day-after-sanaa-hit-with-strikes/7916831.html	2024-12-28T00:17:29-08:00	
Amputees in Sierra Leone turn to farming to combat discrimination	FREETOWN, SIERRA LEONE — Lahai Makieu struck the bamboo with a machete until it cracked and fell. Balancing on his crutch, he reached to pick it up. But colleagues pulled the bamboo's other end, and he tumbled into the dense grass. 'They forgot I had one leg,' the 45-year-old said, laughing. The trainer at a center for amputee farmers picked himself up and added: 'We fall and we rise.' The phrase encapsulates his journey since the civil war in Sierra Leone. From 1991 to 2002, conflict in the West African country created some 28,000 amputees like him. Amputation by machete was one terror tactic by rebels. But even now, amputation rates remain high in Sierra Leone due to motorbike accidents, poor medical care and delayed treatment by traditional healers, according to medical researchers. The government doesn't collect data on amputees, but the United Nations estimates there are about 500,000 disabled people in the country. Makieu's left leg was amputated as a child after rebels shot him and he received no medical attention for a week. More than 20 years later, in a nation ranked near the bottom of the U.N. development index, amputees still face discrimination, often regarded as a shameful reminder of the civil war. Many resort to begging and live in the streets. 'No one cares about you as an amputee in Sierra Leone,' Makieu said. The Farming on Crutches initiative where Makieu works near the capital, Freetown, offers a rare refuge. It aims to restore amputees' confidence and independence by teaching them skills to start a farm business. They've trained 100 amputees and want to expand their work. The training has transformed Makieu's life. After his amputation in 2002, he lived in a small room with a friend in Freetown, dependent on him for food, money and shelter. At a displacement camp for 270 amputees in Freetown, he met Mambud Samai, the founder of Farming on Crutches and a pastor. 'Many (amputees) are being rejected by their families and communities. They don't believe they have love,' the 51-year-old Samai said. He felt moved to help after being a refugee himself in Guinea during the civil war. First, Samai organized beach football matches for amputees in Freetown, boosting their confidence. During a visit to Sierra Leone, U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon saw the project and funded a site for an amputee football club outside the capital. But Samai decided football was not enough. As a farmer, he saw agriculture as a path to self-sufficiency. In 2020, he set up a demonstration farm to teach amputees how to farm and become rural leaders. His project's name reflects amputees' widespread use of crutches instead of prosthetic legs in Sierra Leone. Foreign donors distributed them after the civil war but many people say they don't fit well and cause sores. And the country's only prosthetic clinic is too expensive for many. Makieu was one of the first Farming on Crutches trainees in 2022. He learned how to use farm waste for organic fertilizer and bamboo sticks for fences. He set up a small farm operation this year with his wife, Zanib, also an amputee. They met during the training and now have a child. Makieu wants to inspire future farmers. 'It's my dream to teach people about life. It's about changing your mindset,' he said. Morning mist rolled over the nearby mountains as the camp rose for exercises ahead of a strenuous day. They gathered in a circle, harmonizing on local songs before Samai spoke. 'We are created for fellowship, not isolation,' he said. 'When we return, we are not as we came. We go home to serve our community as rural leaders.' Makieu interjected: 'I sustain my life through farming, I met my wife here. This training can be a big package for you.' But the vast majority of amputees in Sierra Leone have no such support. Alimany Kani, 30, lives in a camp built by the Norwegian Refugee Council for amputees on the outskirts of Freetown. He lost his leg when he was a baby, to the same bullet that killed his father in the civil war. Despite holding a master's degree in social work, he cannot find a job. 'Even if you have qualifications, an able-bodied with less education will always get the job,' Kani said. Sierra Leone's National Commission for Persons with Disability told AP that discrimination towards amputees has improved in the last decade since the Disability Act in 2011 aimed to provide equal opportunities and punish discrimination. Kani firmly disagreed and called on the government to deliver reparations to victims of the civil war. Sierra Leone's Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 2009 recommended that amputees receive pensions, access to healthcare, accommodation and education. But many of those pledges remain unfulfilled, including for Kani. Only 1,300 out of 32,000 have received a full reparations package due to lack of resources, according to the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration. 'The government don't keep their promises. It's inhumane,' Kani said. There currently is no specific support for amputees from the government, the National Commission for Persons with Disability said. Sierra Leone's health ministry, the president's office and the National Commission for Social Action office that manages the reparations program did not respond to questions. A farming charity in Britain, Pasture for Life, is financing Farming on Crutches in full, but Samai said they need support from Sierra Leone's government to expand. Meanwhile, the government is investing over $600 million in agriculture but some believe this will largely benefit large-scale agriculture over small-scale farmers, such as Farming on Crutches' trainees, who form 70% of the population. Two such smallholders are cousins and Farming on Crutches trainees, Amara and Moustapha Jalloh, aged 19 and 21, in central Sierra Leone. Both recently harvested rice and cassava. Moustapha, who was born without a leg, said his harvest surplus allowed him to pay for computer science training. He dreams of being an agricultural engineer. 'Any successful story, there must be painful experiences,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amputees-in-sierra-leone-turn-to-farming-to-combat-discrimination/7916767.html	2024-12-28T00:04:54-08:00	
Somali migrant who survived boat sinking wants to try again for Europe	MOGADISHU, Somalia — Idil Abdullahi Goley's journey seeking a better life in Europe started in Somalia with a $6,500 payment to local smugglers. It ended a month later with fellow migrants around her dying at sea, one of them screaming and reciting the Muslim profession of faith. The deaths of 25 migrants last month in boats off the Indian Ocean island of Madagascar brought to light yet another route that some in Africa are taking in dangerous bids for Europe. Goley was one of the 48 people rescued. She spoke to The Associated Press about the journey that thousands of Somalis embark on every year as extremist attacks and climate shocks destroy hopes and livelihoods at home. Some Somalis head for the Gulf countries via the Red Sea and Yemen. Others, like Goley, gamble on a longer sea voyage south, toward the French island territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean, the poorest territory in the European Union. Somalis are among an estimated 100,000 migrants living in Mayotte, according to French authorities. The migrants are part of communities affected after Cyclone Chido leveled entire neighborhoods on December 14. The International Organization for Migration has estimated that 2 million people migrated from Somalia in 2021 in search of work, the latest data available. Children left behind Goley, 28, heard about the smugglers from friends who had traveled the route and raised the $6,500 fee from her small tea shop business in the capital, Mogadishu, and from her brother and mother. She hoped to reach Europe and pay them back. She left her three small children behind. Her journey began with a flight from Mogadishu to Kenya's capital, Nairobi. Then she and others took a bus to the port city of Mombasa, where they set off in fishing boats for Mayotte, more than 620 miles (997 kilometers) away. They hoped to request asylum there. After three days at sea, the group of about 70 migrants was transferred to smaller boats, whose engines started to fail. The smugglers said they would fix the engines and left with them on another boat, leaving the migrants drifting without water and food. They started catching fish and collecting rainwater to survive. It was nearly cyclone season, and waves were choppy. Goley said she tried to save the life of an infant whose mother was also on board but struggling. 'But she died right in front of me. We couldn't hold on to her body for long and had to throw it into the sea to prevent it from decomposing, as more people perished around us,' she said. During 13 days of hunger, thirst and heat, Goley's two friends also died. She held one in her lap as she passed. 'The other screamed for help. I couldn't help her and she died shortly after, crying out loudly, reciting the Shahada,' Goley said. 'That is an image I will never forget, the suffering and helplessness we felt.' She said the ordeal ended when a fishing boat appeared on the horizon and the survivors waved for help. They offered the fishermen $100 for their rescue and were taken to a sports facility in Nosy Be in northern Madagascar. The migrants were repatriated in early December by chartered plane. Back home, Goley's mother had feared the worst. Unable to eat, she had lost 20 kilograms (44 pounds). 'When I returned home, my mother couldn't believe it until she heard my voice and saw me in person,' Goley said. Another attempt As she and the other survivors arrived in Mogadishu, the Somali president's special envoy on refugee affairs expressed hope for their future and said the government would help. 'They assured me they will never take the same risk again,' Maryan Yasin said. But Goley said she plans to attempt another journey on the same route, despite having nightmares about her ordeal. The hardships in Somalia are still the same, she said — and she did pay the smugglers' fee. 'Even if it leads me to prison, I believe I'd still find a better life than the one I have here,' she said. Her mother, meanwhile, fears this time she will never return. Other survivors are undecided as they mourn. Ahmed Hussein Mahadalle, 26, had watched helplessly as his sister Hanan, 21, died. Nothing compares to the pain of it, he said. His other sister, Haboon Hussein Mahadalle, was grateful for her brother's safe return, though he also has plans to try again. 'Hanan was courageous and vigilant. She met her fate with grace,' Haboon said, in tears. 'They say good people don't stay long, and my sister embodied all the qualities I can't begin to summarize.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-migrant-who-survived-boat-sinking-wants-to-try-again-for-europe/7915540.html	2024-12-28T00:02:47-08:00	
US agency says decongestant in many cold medicines doesn't work. So what does?	WASHINGTON — Changes are coming to the cold and cough aisle of your local pharmacy: U.S. officials are moving to phase out the leading decongestant found in hundreds of over-the-counter medicines, concluding that it doesn't actually relieve nasal congestion. Phenylephrine is used in popular versions of Sudafed, Dayquil and other medications, but experts have long questioned its effectiveness. Last month the Food and Drug Administration formally proposed revoking its use in pills and liquid solutions, kicking off a process that's likely to force drugmakers to remove or reformulate products. It's a win for skeptical academics, including researchers at the University of Florida who petitioned the FDA to revisit the drug's use in 2007 and again in 2015. For consumers it will likely mean switching to alternatives, including an older decongestant that was moved behind the pharmacy counter nearly 20 years ago. Doctors say Americans will be better off without phenylephrine, which is often combined with other medicines to treat cold, flu, fever and allergies. 'People walk into the drugstore today and see 55,000 medicines on the shelf and they pick one that is definitely not going to work,' said Dr. Brian Schroer of the Cleveland Clinic. 'You take away that option and it will be easier for them to self-direct toward products that really will help them.' Why is FDA doing this now? The FDA decision was expected after federal advisers last year voted unanimously that oral phenylephrine medications haven't been shown to relieve congestion. Experts reviewed several recent, large studies indicating that phenylephrine was no better than a placebo at clearing nasal passageways. They also revisited studies from the 1960s and 1970s that supported the drug's initial use, finding numerous flaws and questionable data. The panel's opinion only applied to phenylephrine in oral medications, which account for roughly $1.8 billion in annual U.S. sales. The drug is still considered effective in nasal sprays, though those are much less popular. Phenylephrine wasn't always the top choice for cold and allergy products. Many were originally formulated with a different drug, pseudoephedrine. But a 2006 law required pharmacies to move pseudoephedrine products behind the counter, citing their potential to be processed into methamphetamine. Companies such as Johnson & Johnson and Bayer decided to reformulate their products to keep them readily available on store shelves — and labeled many of them as 'PE' versions of familiar brand names. What are some alternatives for congestion? Consumers who still want to take pills or syrups for relief will probably need to head to the pharmacy counter — where the pseudoephedrine-containing versions of Sudafed, Claritin D and other products remain available without a prescription. Purchasers need to provide a photo ID. Beyond those products, most of the other options are over-the-counter nasal sprays or solutions. Saline drops and rinses are a quick way to clear mucus from the nose. For long-term relief from seasonal stuffiness, itching and sneezing, many doctors recommend nasal steroids, sold as Flonase, Nasacort and Rhinocort. 'These medicines are by far the most effective daily treatment for nasal congestion and stuffiness,' Schroer said. 'The biggest issue is they're not great when used on an as-needed basis.' Nasal steroids generally have to be used daily to be highly effective. For short-term relief, patients can try antihistamine sprays, such as Astepro, which are faster acting. Phenylephrine-based sprays will also remain on pharmacy shelves. Why doesn't phenylephrine work when taken by mouth? The experts who challenged the drug's effectiveness say it's quickly broken down and rendered ineffective when it hits the stomach. 'This is a good drug, but not when it's swallowed,' said Leslie Hendeles, professor emeritus at the University of Florida's College of Pharmacy, where he co-authored several papers on the ingredient. 'It's inactivated in the gut and doesn't get into the bloodstream, so it can't get to the nose.' When Hendeles and his colleagues first petitioned the FDA on phenylephrine, they suggested a higher dose might be effective. But subsequent studies showed that even doses 400% higher than those currently recommended don't treat stuffiness. The FDA and other researchers concluded that pushing the dosage even higher might carry safety risks. 'If you're using very high doses, the risk is raising blood pressure so high that it could be hazardous to patients,' said Randy Hatton, a University of Florida professor who co-led the research on phenylephrine. Because of its cardiovascular effects, the drug is sometimes used to treat dangerously low blood pressure during surgery, Hatton noted. What happens next? Oral phenylephrine medicines will still be with us for a while. Government regulators must follow a public, multistep process to remove the ingredient from FDA's list of drugs approved for over-the-counter decongestants. For six months, the FDA must take comments on its proposal, including from consumers and companies. Then, the FDA must review the feedback before writing a final order. Even after that decision is finalized, companies will likely have a year or more to remove or reformulate products. Drugmakers could further delay the process by requesting additional FDA hearings. For now, the Consumer Healthcare Products Association — which represents medicine makers — wants the products to stay available, saying Americans deserve 'the option to choose the products they prefer for self-care.' Hatton says he and his colleagues disagree: 'Our position is that choosing from something that doesn't work isn't really a choice.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agency-says-decongestant-in-many-cold-medicines-doesn-t-work-so-what-does-/7914334.html	2024-12-28T00:01:58-08:00	
Death toll in Brazil bridge collapse rises to 10	BRASILIA, BRAZIL — The death toll after a bridge collapsed in northern Brazil increased to 10 on Friday, authorities said. The Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira bridge, which connects the states of Maranhao and Tocantins, collapsed on Sunday, sending vehicles and their occupants plunging into the water below. The Brazilian navy had been conducting rescues in the area, finding an additional body Thursday 6 kilometers from the accident site and a second victim Friday in the Tocantins River. 'As such, there are 10 dead and seven missing victims so far,' the navy said in a statement, updating Thursday's toll of eight dead and nine missing. More than 70 rescuers continued the search nearly a week after the collapse, using a hyperbaric chamber to allow divers to search depths of more than 30 meters. On Tuesday, Brazilian authorities had warned that the Tocantins River could have been contaminated with sulfuric acid being transported by two trucks that tumbled into the water. A third truck involved in the accident was carrying pesticides. A spokesperson for the fire department later told AFP that the tanks of all three trucks were 'intact' after the collapse. The danger from those chemicals, however, had slowed rescue and body-recovery operations for days while water analyses and inspections of the trucks' chemical tank trailers were carried out. The bridge, initially constructed in the 1960s, measured roughly 500 meters long. The causes of the collapse were being investigated, but officials said initial indications were that the central beam of the bridge gave way.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-in-brazil-bridge-collapse-rises-to-10-/7916776.html	2024-12-27T18:53:31-08:00	
Fear, chaos grip Maputo after postelection violence	Maputo, mozambique — Mozambique's capital, Maputo, is limping back to normal but residents are still fearful because of widespread looting and vandalism sparked by confirmation that the ruling party won contested elections. Food, fuel and medicine are running low for the city's inhabitants while the daring escape of more than 1,000 inmates from a maximum-security prison is fueling wild rumors and prompted the creation of neighborhood patrols. 'My neighbor woke me up, telling me that men armed with machetes were walking around,' Maria Amelia, 55, a cleaner who lives in Matola, near Maputo, told AFP. 'When I went out, I saw my neighbors, armed with knives to defend themselves against these invaders. But I didn't see anyone. I was terrified.' Maputo bank worker Armand Tembe, 40, was also dragged out of bed before dawn. 'I haven't seen any criminals outside. But it's starting to get scary. I don't know where the country is going,' he said dejectedly. 'We stayed up until 4:30 in the morning and patrolled for something we only heard about and that no one saw,' said another woman, who wanted to remain anonymous. 'It was just hearsay. It makes it seem like a macabre plan.' Borges Nhamirre, a Pretoria-based Mozambican researcher, said that so far, 'there have been no verified reports of attacks of this kind.' But the fact that the police chief, speaking to reporters Wednesday evening, 'announced that detainees could 'visit' houses has fueled concern,' he added. 'The prevailing sentiment in the conversations suggests that the government may have invented this crisis to control the ongoing social unrest,' he said. 'Manipulation' Venancio Mondlane, Mozambique's main opposition leader, has denounced the October 9 election results as rigged. On Monday, the country's highest court confirmed victory for the ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power for half a century. That set off riots that left more than 125 dead over several days, according to the local NGO Plataforma Decide. 'We know who the real bandits are. It's Frelimo,' Mondlane said on social networks on Friday. On the streets of Maputo, makeshift barricades were slowly being dismantled, while the army was clearing some roads, according to AFP reporters on the ground. Residents were cautiously leaving their homes to look for basic necessities. 'I'm looking for bread,' said Isabel Rocha, 29, in the Laulane district of the city, after a sleepless night because of security fears. 'The bakeries have been closed for four days. In fact, we lack everything. Even the small grocery stores are closed.' Lina Chauque, 47, sat despondently on the pavement with a large bundle containing heads of lettuce and cabbage next to her. She had been waiting for two hours with several other women for a bus to arrive to sell her products at market. 'We tried to ask for help from some trucks that passed but the drivers did not want to take us,' she said. A short distance away, cars queued patiently outside a gas station where only one pump still had fuel. 'I am looking for medicine for me and my mother,' said Tomas Panguene, 65, who suffers from knee pain. 'Yesterday I went out to find a pharmacy but the streets were still barricaded. I found what I needed this morning.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fear-chaos-grip-maputo-after-postelection-violence-/7916769.html	2024-12-27T18:01:21-08:00	
Mexico tests cellphone app migrants can use to send alert if detained in US	Mexico city — Mexico is developing a cellphone app that will allow migrants to warn relatives and local consulates if they think they are about to be detained by U.S. immigration authorities, a senior official said Friday. The move comes in response to President-elect Donald Trump’s threats to carry out mass deportations after he takes office on Jan. 20. The app has been rolled out for small-scale testing and 'appears to be working very well,' said Juan Ramon de la Fuente, Mexico’s secretary of foreign affairs. He said the app would allow users to press a tab that would send an alert notification to previously chosen relatives and the nearest Mexican consulate. De la Fuente described it as a sort of panic button. 'In case you find yourself in a situation where detention is imminent, you push the alert button, and that sends a signal to the nearest consulate,' he said. U.S. authorities are obliged to give notice to home-country consulates when a foreign citizen is detained. Mexico says it has beefed up consular staff and legal aid to help migrants in the legal process related to deportation. De la Fuente expects the app to be rolled out in January. He didn't say whether the app has a deactivation tab that would allow someone to rescind an alert if that person wasn't really detained. The government says it has also set up a call center staffed 24 hours a day to answer migrants' questions. The Mexican government estimates there are 11.5 million migrants with some form of legal residency in the United States, and 4.8 million without legal residency or proper documents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-tests-cellphone-app-migrants-can-use-to-send-alert-if-detained-in-us/7916764.html	2024-12-27T17:31:05-08:00	
Anger over abductions mounts in Kenya	Nairobi, kenya — Kenyan rights groups, lawyers and politicians voiced grave concern Friday over a fresh spate of abductions targeting government critics. A small protest was organized in northeastern Embu town, where a 24-year-old man, Billy Mwangi, disappeared last weekend. Security forces in the East African nation have been accused of carrying out dozens of illegal detentions since youth-led anti-government demonstrations in June and July. The latest disappearances have been primarily young men who have criticized President William Ruto online. Police have denied involvement, but activists have questioned why they appear not to be investigating the disappearances. The Law Society of Kenya (LSK) said recent denials by the inspector-general of police were 'insufficient,' calling for him to take clear action against the kidnappers or resign. 'If indeed the police are not complicit,' LSK said, they must immediately 'investigate and prosecute those responsible.' Human Rights Watch said earlier this year that its research pointed toward a unit drawn from multiple security agencies. Former Deputy President Rigathi Gachagua, who was ousted after clashing with Ruto over the protests, also alleged on Friday that a secret unit was behind the disappearances. 'Abducting these children and killing them is not a solution. ... This is the first administration in the history of this country to target children for repression,' Gachagua said at a press conference. The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) said Thursday that there had been 82 abductions carried out 'clandestinely, with unidentified armed persons' since June, with 29 still missing. It listed seven people who had been abducted since December 17. Two of them — Mwangi and Peter Muteti — were taken shortly after sharing AI-generated images of Ruto dead. The Kenyan judiciary said this week that 'abductions have no place in law and indeed are a direct threat to the rights of citizens.' In a post on X on Thursday, it urged 'security agencies and all connected entities to adhere to the law to safeguard fundamental rights and freedoms.' The anti-government demonstrations earlier this year were sparked by proposed tax hikes, triggering the worst crisis since Ruto took power in 2022. While large-scale rallies have mostly stopped, anger against the government has simmered, fueled by a cost-of-living crisis and continued allegations of brutality by the security forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/anger-over-abductions-mounts-in-kenya/7916747.html	2024-12-27T17:14:15-08:00	
WHO chief describes Israeli strike on Yemen airport	ZURICH — The head of the World Health Organization said Friday that he was not sure he was going to survive an airstrike on Yemen's main airport carried out by Israel a day earlier during a series of attacks on the Iran-aligned Houthi movement. Speaking at the Sanaa International Airport on Thursday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the explosions that rocked the building were so deafening that his ears were still ringing more than a day later. Tedros said it quickly became apparent the airport was under attack, describing people 'running in disarray' through the site after about four blasts, one of them close to where he was sitting near the departure lounge. 'I was not sure actually I could survive because it was so close, a few meters from where we were,' he told Reuters. 'A slight deviation could have resulted in a direct hit.' Tedros said he and his colleagues were stuck at the airport for the next hour or so as what he thought were drones flew overhead, feeding concern they could open fire again. Among the debris, he and colleagues saw missile fragments, he said. 'There [was] no shelter at all. Nothing. So, you're just exposed, just waiting for anything to happen,' he said. The Israeli strikes on Yemen came after Houthis repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said afterward that Israel was 'just getting started' with the Houthis. The Houthi-controlled Saba News Agency said three people died in the strikes on the airport and three were killed in Hodeidah, with 40 others wounded in the attacks. Speaking by telephone from Jordan, where he flew to Friday, helping to evacuate a U.N. colleague seriously injured at the airport for further medical treatment, Tedros said he had received no warning Israel could be about to strike the airport. The injured man, who worked for the U.N. Humanitarian Air Service, was now 'OK' and in stable condition, Tedros said. Tedros traveled to Yemen to try to negotiate the release of U.N. staff and others held there. He acknowledged that he and colleagues knew the trip was risky in light of high tension between Israel and the Houthis. But such was the window of opportunity to work for the release of the U.N. personnel that they believed they had to take it, said Tedros, a former Ethiopian foreign minister. He said talks with Yemeni authorities had gone well and that he saw a chance that the 16 U.N. staff as well as employees of diplomatic missions and NGO workers held there could be freed. He declined to engage in recriminations over the attack but said his itinerary had been shared publicly and expressed surprise that civilian infrastructure should have been targeted. 'A civilian airport should be protected, whether I am in it or not,' he said, before observing there was 'nothing special' about what he had faced in Yemen. 'One of my colleagues said we narrowly escaped death. I'm just one human being. So, I feel for those who are facing the same thing every single day. But at least it allowed me to feel the way they feel. 'I'm worried about our world, where it's heading,' Tedros added, urging world leaders to work together to end global conflicts. 'I have never ... as far as I can remember, seen the world really being in such a very dangerous state.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-chief-describes-israeli-strike-on-yemen-airport-/7916743.html	2024-12-27T17:01:16-08:00	
CDC says bird flu virus likely mutated within a US patient	A genetic analysis suggests the bird flu virus mutated inside a Louisiana patient who contracted the nation’s first severe case of the illness, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said this week. Scientists believe the mutations may allow the virus to better bind to receptors in the upper airways of humans — something they say is concerning but not a cause for alarm. Michael Osterholm, a University of Minnesota infectious-disease researcher, likened this binding interaction to a lock and key. To enter a cell, the virus needs to have a key that turns the lock, and this finding means the virus may be changing to have a key that might work. 'Is this an indication that we may be closer to seeing a readily transmitted virus between people? No,' Osterholm said. 'Right now, this is a key that sits in the lock, but it doesn’t open the door.' The virus has been causing sporadic, mostly mild illnesses in people in the United States; nearly all of those infected worked on dairy or poultry farms. The patient in the U.S. state of Louisiana was hospitalized in critical condition with severe respiratory symptoms from bird flu after coming in contact with sick and dead birds in a backyard flock. The person, who has not been identified, is older than 65 and has underlying medical problems, officials said earlier this month. The CDC stressed there has been no known transmission of the virus from the Louisiana patient to anyone else. The agency said its findings about the mutations were 'concerning,' but the risk to the general public from the outbreak 'has not changed and remains low.' Still, Osterholm said, scientists should continue to follow what’s happening with mutations carefully. 'There will be additional influenza pandemics, and they could be much worse than we saw with COVID,' he said. 'We know that the pandemic clock is ticking. We just don’t know what time it is.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/cdc-says-bird-flu-virus-likely-mutated-within-a-us-patient/7916733.html	2024-12-27T16:48:38-08:00	
Venezuela accuses Argentine officer of terrorism as relations deteriorate	BOGOTA, COLOMBIA — An Argentine military officer who was arrested in Venezuela earlier this month has been charged with terrorism, Venezuela’s attorney general said Friday. In a statement published on Instagram, Attorney General Tarek William Saab accused the officer, Nahuel Gallo, of 'being part of a group of people who tried to commit destabilizing and terrorist acts [in Venezuela] with the support of international far-right groups.' In a news conference Friday, Argentine Security Minister Patricia Bullrich described the charges as 'another lie' by Venezuela’s government and said that Gallo should be returned to Argentina 'immediately.' The case has ramped up tensions between Venezuela’s socialist government and the right-wing administration of Argentine President Javier Milei, whose embassy in Caracas is sheltering five high-profile opposition activists and is surrounded by Venezuelan security forces. Gallo, a corporal in Argentina’s Gendarmerie security force, was detained by Venezuelan officials on Dec. 8 after he showed up at an immigration office along Venezuela’s border with Colombia and sought permission to enter the country. Gallo’s relatives said that he had traveled to Venezuela to visit his wife, who is Venezuelan, and was in the country to spend some time with her mother. They have published an invitation letter that was sent to Gallo, and said he was on vacation at the time of his arrest. Venezuela broke diplomatic relations with Argentina in August after Milei and several other Latin American leaders refused to recognize the reelection in July of Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. Argentina’s diplomats were expelled, but the five opposition activists, who had sought refuge at the ambassador’s residence to avoid arrest, remained in the building after they were denied safe passage out of Venezuela. The activists, who have been holed up in the embassy since March, recently said that Venezuelan security forces have cut off electricity and water to the residence in a bid to pressure them to leave the building. Venezuela officials have denied those accusations and said that the activists used the Argentine Embassy to plan terrorist acts. The Venezuelan human rights group Foro Penal said earlier this week that 19 foreigners are being held in Venezuela as political prisoners. In September, two Spanish citizens who were on vacation in the south of Venezuela were arrested and accused of being part of a plot to overthrow Maduro. They were arrested just days after Spain’s parliament recognized opposition candidate Edmundo Gonzalez as the winner of the election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-accuses-argentine-officer-of-terrorism-as-relations-deteriorate-/7916551.html	2024-12-27T16:45:15-08:00	
US proposes cybersecurity rules to limit impact of health data leaks	Health care organizations may be required to bolster their cybersecurity to better prevent sensitive information from being leaked by cyberattacks like the ones that hit Ascension and UnitedHealth, a senior White House official said Friday. Anne Neuberger, the U.S. deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technology, told reporters that proposed requirements are necessary in light of the massive number of Americans whose data has been affected by large breaches of health care information. The proposals include encrypting data so it cannot be accessed, even if leaked, and requiring compliance checks to ensure networks meet cybersecurity rules. The full proposed rule was posted to the Federal Register on Friday, and the Department of Health and Human Services posted a more condensed breakdown on its website. She said that the health care information of more than 167 million people was affected in 2023 as a result of cybersecurity incidents. The proposed rule from the Office for Civil Rights (OCR) within HHS would update standards under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act and would cost an estimated $9 billion in the first year, and $6 billion in years two through five, Neuberger said. 'We've made some significant proposals that we think will improve cybersecurity and ultimately everyone's health information, if any of these proposals are ultimately finalized,' an OCR spokesperson told Reuters late Friday. The next step in the process is a 60-day public comment period before any final decisions will be made. Large health care breaches caused by hacking and ransomware have increased by 89% and 102%, respectively, since 2019, Neuberger said. 'In this job, one of the most concerning and really troubling things we deal with is hacking of hospitals, hacking of health care data,' she said. Hospitals have been forced to operate manually and Americans' sensitive health care data, mental health information and other information are 'being leaked on the dark web with the opportunity to blackmail individuals,' Neuberger said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-proposes-cybersecurity-rules-to-limit-impact-of-health-data-leaks-/7916725.html	2024-12-27T16:38:12-08:00	
US sportscaster Greg Gumbel dies from cancer at age 78	NEW YORK — Greg Gumbel, a longtime CBS sportscaster, has died from cancer, according to a statement from family released by CBS on Friday. He was 78. 'He leaves behind a legacy of love, inspiration and dedication to over 50 extraordinary years in the sports broadcast industry; and his iconic voice will never be forgotten,' his wife, Marcy Gumbel, and daughter, Michelle Gumbel, said in a statement. In March, Gumbel missed his first NCAA Tournament since 1997 because of what he said at the time were family health issues. Gumbel was the studio host for CBS since returning to the network from NBC in 1998. Gumbel signed an extension with CBS last year that allowed him to continue hosting college basketball while stepping back from NFL announcing duties. In 2001, Gumbel announced Super Bowl XXXV for CBS, becoming the first Black announcer in the U.S. to call play-by-play of a major sports championship. David Berson, president and CEO of CBS Sports, described Gumbel as breaking barriers and setting standards for others during his years as a voice for fans in sports, including in the NFL and March Madness. 'A tremendous broadcaster and gifted storyteller, Greg led one of the most remarkable and groundbreaking sports broadcasting careers of all time,' said Berson. Gumbel had two stints at CBS, leaving the network for NBC when it lost football in 1994 and returning when it regained the contract in 1998. He hosted CBS's coverage of the 1992 and 1994 Winter Olympics and called Major League Baseball games during its four-year run broadcasting the national pastime. But it was football and basketball where he was best known and made his biggest impact. Gumbel hosted CBS's NFL studio show, 'The NFL Today' from 1990 to 1993 and again in 2004. He also called NFL games as the network's lead play-by-play announcer from 1998 to 2003. He returned to the NFL booth in 2005, leaving that role after the 2022 season.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sportscaster-greg-gumbel-dies-from-cancer-at-age-78-/7916545.html	2024-12-27T16:03:27-08:00	
Trump asks court to delay possible TikTok ban until he can weigh in as president	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump asked the Supreme Court on Friday to pause the potential TikTok ban from going into effect until his administration can pursue a 'political resolution' to the issue. The request came as TikTok and the Biden administration filed opposing briefs to the court, in which the company argued the court should strike down a law that could ban the platform by January 19 while the government emphasized its position that the statute is needed to eliminate a national security risk. 'President Trump takes no position on the underlying merits of this dispute. Instead, he respectfully requests that the court consider staying the act's deadline for divestment of January 19, 2025, while it considers the merits of this case,' said Trump's amicus brief, which supported neither party in the case. The filings come ahead of oral arguments scheduled for January 10 on whether the law, which requires TikTok to divest from its China-based parent company or face a ban, unlawfully restricts speech in violation of the First Amendment. Earlier this month, a panel of three federal judges on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit unanimously upheld the statute, leading TikTok to appeal the case to the Supreme Court. The brief from Trump said he opposes banning TikTok at this junction and 'seeks the ability to resolve the issues at hand through political means once he takes office.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-asks-court-to-delay-possible-tiktok-ban-until-he-can-weigh-in-as-president/7916535.html	2024-12-27T15:31:45-08:00	
US appeals court halts enforcement of anti-money laundering law	A U.S. appeals court has halted enforcement of an anti-money laundering law that requires corporate entities to disclose the identities of their real beneficial owners to the U.S. Treasury Department ahead of a deadline for most companies to do so. The New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated late Thursday a nationwide injunction that had been issued this month by a federal judge in Texas who had concluded the Corporate Transparency Act was unconstitutional. The order marked a change of course for the court. On Monday, a three-judge panel of the 5th Circuit at the urging of the U.S. Department of Justice put the injunction on hold while the government appealed the Texas judge's decision. But a different panel will ultimately decide whether to uphold the judge's ruling, and in Thursday's order, the court said it decided to keep enforcement of the law paused 'to preserve the constitutional status quo while the merits panel considers the parties' weighty substantive arguments.' Those arguments will be heard on March 25, the court said Friday. Before Thursday's order, most companies had faced a Jan. 13 deadline to submit their initial reports to the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN). The injunction had been obtained by the National Federation of Independent Business, which along with several small businesses challenged the law through lawyers at the conservative Center for Individual Rights. 'Given that we have established that the CTA is likely unconstitutional, this intrusive form of government surveillance should be halted until the law's fate is finally resolved,' Todd Gaziano, the Center for Individual Rights' president, said in a statement. FinCEN did not respond to requests for comment. Under the law, which was enacted in 2021, corporations and LLCs were required to report information concerning their beneficial owners to FinCEN, which collects and analyzes information about financial transactions to combat money laundering and other crimes. The measure's supporters said it was designed to address the country's growing popularity as a venue for criminals to launder illicit funds by setting up entities such as limited liability companies under state laws without disclosing their involvement. U.S. District Judge Amos Mazzant in Sherman, Texas, on Dec. 3 ruled Congress had no authority under its powers to regulate commerce, taxes and foreign affairs to adopt the 'quasi-Orwellian statute' and that it likely violated states' rights under the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-appeals-court-halts-enforcement-of-anti-money-laundering-law-/7916461.html	2024-12-27T14:19:45-08:00	
UN approves new AU force to take on al-Shabab in Somalia	UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. Security Council on Friday gave the green light to a new African Union force in Somalia that is meant to take on the Islamist armed group al-Shabab, with the soldiers due to deploy in January. The resolution was adopted by 14 of the council's 15 member states, while the United States abstained due to reservations about funding. It provides for the replacement of the African Union Transition Mission in Somalia, whose mandate ends on Dec. 31, by the African Union Support and Stabilization Mission in Somalia (AUSSOM). Somalia is one of the world's poorest countries, enduring decades of civil war, a bloody insurgency by the al-Qaida-linked al-Shabab and frequent climate disasters. Representatives from Somalia and its western neighbor Ethiopia were invited to participate in the council's meeting, although they were not allowed to vote. 'We emphasize that the current AUSSOM troops allocations are completed through bilateral agreements,' said the Somali representative, adding 11,000 troops were currently pledged. On Monday, Egypt's foreign minister announced his country would take part in the new force. Tensions flared in the Horn of Africa after Ethiopia signed a maritime deal in January with the breakaway region of Somaliland, pushing Mogadishu closer to Addis Ababa's regional rival Cairo. This month, Turkey brokered a deal to end the nearly yearlong bitter dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia, although Ethiopian troops would not be involved in the new AU force. Burundi will not be taking part in the new force either, a Burundian military source told AFP on the condition of anonymity. The text adopted by the U.N. Security Council provides for the possibility of using a mechanism that it created last year, under which an African force deployed with the green light of the U.N. can be up to 75% financed by the U.N. 'In our view, the conditions have not been met for immediate transition to application of' that measure, U.S. representative Dorothy Shea said, justifying her country's abstention.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-approves-new-au-force-to-take-on-al-shabab-in-somalia-/7916486.html	2024-12-27T14:18:05-08:00

Engineer pleads not guilty in US case of deadly Iran-linked drone strike	BOSTON, MASSACHUSETTS — A former engineer at a semiconductor manufacturer pleaded not guilty Friday to U.S. charges that he illegally procured technology for an Iranian firm that made a key component of a drone used in a January attack by Iran-backed militants in Jordan that killed three U.S. service members. Mahdi Sadeghi, who was fired by Analog Devices after his Dec. 16 arrest, pleaded not guilty during a hearing in federal court in Boston to charges that he engaged in a scheme to violate U.S. export control and sanctions laws. He entered the plea nearly two weeks after the U.S. Department of Justice announced charges against the dual U.S.-Iranian citizen and the head of an Iranian navigation systems manufacturer, Mohammad Abedini, who was arrested in Italy. Prosecutors said Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps was the primary customer of Abedini's company, San'at Danesh Rahpooyan Aflak Co, which made the navigation system used in its military drone program. Prosecutors say that system was used in an unmanned drone that struck a U.S. outpost in Jordan called Tower 22, near the Syrian border, in an attack that killed three Army Reserve soldiers from Georgia and injured 47 others. The White House has said the attack was facilitated by the Islamic Resistance in Iraq, an umbrella organization of hardline Iran-backed militant groups. Iran has denied involvement in the attack, and its Foreign Ministry was quoted in Iranian media Saturday saying the arrests of Sadeghi and Abedini, an Iranian citizen, violated international law. Prosecutors said that in 2016, Sadeghi, a resident of Natick, Massachusetts, traveled to Iran to seek funding from a governmental organization for a fitness wearables company that he had co-founded. Through an affiliated Iranian company he established, Sadeghi began helping procure U.S.-origin electronic components on behalf of Abedini, who is also known as Mohammad Abedininajafabadi, prosecutors said. After taking a job at Massachusetts-based Analog Devices in 2019, Sadeghi helped a Switzerland front company for Abedini's Iranian firm enter into a contract with Analog Devices and assisted Abedini in procuring U.S. technology, prosecutors said. The electronic components Abedini obtained included the same type used in the navigation system found in the drone, prosecutors said. Sadeghi has been detained since his arrest. U.S. Magistrate Judge Donald Cabell set a Jan. 2 hearing to potentially grant his release after a defense lawyer reported progress in talks with prosecutors on acceptable bail conditions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/engineer-pleads-not-guilty-in-us-case-of-deadly-iran-linked-drone-strike/7916458.html	2024-12-27T14:06:23-08:00

Zimbabwe to work with Russia, IAEA to establish nuclear energy	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwe is working with the International Atomic Energy Agency and Russian investors to establish nuclear energy as part of its efforts to end the country’s chronic power shortages, government officials said Thursday. The nation has expressed its interest in nuclear power to the IAEA, said Edgar Moyo, minister of energy and power development, and hopes to develop small, modular reactors. 'They have indicated their willingness to take us through paces until we get there,' Moyo told journalists. Establishing nuclear power is expensive and complex, said Joseph Siegle, the director of research at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, which is the reason countries such as South Africa and Egypt have sought Russia’s assistance. The process is also ripe for corruption, he said, so transparency is critical. 'Most economists would argue that those deals cost far more than are warranted for the benefits that they would provide to their economies and to their societies,' Siegle said, 'and so there's a worry that these huge infrastructure projects become a source of corruption, both in the country where it is being built, but also vis-a-vis the state-owned enterprises that the Russians provide to build the plant. 'In the end, it becomes the public in the country that is building the plant that would be responsible for paying off these costs,' he said. Zimbabwe says its goal is to have 4,000 megawatts of power capacity by 2035 and end years of power cuts that can sometimes last up to 18 hours per day. Siegle said Zimbabwe’s power needs do not warrant a traditional large-scale nuclear reactor and suggested that the government study the lasting impact of waste disposal. '[This] has always been a concern with nuclear energy — what you do with the waste, which requires some 10,000 years for the radioactive elements to decay and not pose a health risk to society,' he said. Nuclear power also heightens security risks, Siegle said. Gloria Magombo, secretary for energy and power development, said at the media briefing that Zimbabwe aims to increase the use of other renewable energies besides hydropower, given the nation’s recurring droughts. She mentioned solar, wind and mini-hydro stations. 'We are we are looking at coming in by 2030 with up to about 2,000 megawatts' from those sources, Magombo said. Zimbabwe's current capacity for power generation is about 2,600 megawatts, according to the government. The actual daily generation is roughly half of that.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-to-work-with-russia-iaea-to-establish-nuclear-energy/7916424.html	2024-12-27T13:26:35-08:00	
Taliban hint at shielding anti-Pakistan militants in Afghanistan as 'guests'	ISLAMABAD — A senior Taliban leader in Afghanistan has indicated that they will continue to provide refuge to anti-Pakistan militants, describing them as 'guests' under the country's traditions. Taliban Information Minister Khairullah Khairkhwa made the rare remarks just days after the Pakistani military reportedly conducted airstrikes against suspected terrorist locations in an eastern Afghan border province. The Taliban claimed that Tuesday's attack in Paktika resulted in the deaths of nearly 50 civilians, predominantly refugees from Pakistan. While the claims could not be verified from independent sources, the United Nations said that it had 'received credible reports' from the remote Afghan province that dozens of civilians, including women and children, were killed in the Pakistani airstrikes. Islamabad has refrained from publicly acknowledging the cross-border strikes, but Pakistani security officials anonymously confirmed and told reporters that the military action had targeted and destroyed several 'terrorist hideouts' of the Tehrik-e-Taliban Pakistan (TTP), an outlawed group engaged in lethal attacks against Pakistan. Several key TTP commanders were also said to be among more than a dozen militants killed. 'We must honor the Afghan nation's commitment to safeguarding these guests, friends,' an angry Khairkhwa said while denouncing the Pakistani attack. He was apparently referring to the TTP in his speech aired by Taliban-controlled state television and shared via X social media platform Friday. The Taliban minister emphasized the need for Pakistan 'to draw lessons from the consequences of military interventions' in Afghanistan by Britain, the former Soviet Union and the United States, respectively, since the 19th century. 'Anyone who attacks Afghanistan or harbors such intentions must learn from the defeat of three superpowers,' Khairkhwa asserted. This is the first public admission by a senior Taliban leader regarding the presence of TTP operatives in the country. Previously, Taliban officials have vehemently denied their existence, claiming that no foreign militants are permitted to operate and pose a threat to other nations from Afghan soil. TTP, designated as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations, has escalated attacks in Pakistan since the Taliban's August 2021 resurgence to power in Kabul, killing hundreds of Pakistani civilians and security personnel. On Friday, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif expressed his government's intention to enhance economic and trade relations with Afghanistan. However, he stated that the threat of TTP-led cross-border terrorism impedes that progress. 'Unfortunately, the TTP continues to operate from there and killing innocent people inside Pakistan. This cannot go on,' Sharif said in his televised remarks to a Cabinet meeting in Islamabad. 'They must rein in TTP. … This constitutes a red line for us. The TTP operating from Afghan soil is unacceptable under any circumstances,' he stressed. Sharif said his country was ready to talk with the Afghan government to address the issue. 'But there can be no progress if, on the one hand, they seek to foster relations with Pakistan while simultaneously permitting TTP to operate with impunity,' he emphasized. Separately, the Pakistani military reported Friday that its counterterrorism operations and clashes with TTP militants resulted in the killings of over 900 'terrorists' this year, including 27 Afghan suicide bombers and fighters. The violence also left nearly 400 Pakistani security forces and officers dead, said Lieutenant General Ahmed Sharif Chaudhry, the military spokesperson. Who is Khairkhwa? Khairkhwa, a U.N.-sanctioned Taliban leader, was captured by U.S. forces in collaboration with Pakistani counterparts in early 2002 and subsequently transferred to the U.S. Guantanamo Bay prison center. He was freed along with four other senior Taliban leaders in 2014 as part of a Qatar-mediated exchange for the release of U.S. soldier Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl. Following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States, American and Western-allied forces invaded Afghanistan, overthrowing the then-Taliban government due to its refusal to surrender Osama bin Laden, the leader of al-Qaida, who was accused of orchestrating the deadly attacks from his Afghan bases. The Taliban leadership at the time justified its refusal to surrender bin Laden, asserting that he was a 'guest' in the country and that surrendering him would violate local traditions. Subsequently, the Taliban regrouped and launched an insurgency against U.S.-led foreign forces, using sanctuaries on Pakistani soil. Bin Laden evaded capture and fled to Pakistan, where he was eventually tracked down and killed by American troops in 2011. Taliban leaders pledged to combat transnational militant networks to prevent them from using Afghanistan as a haven for global attacks after they seized power three years ago. However, an annual U.S. terrorism report released earlier this month cast doubts on Taliban counterterrorism commitments, citing TTP's growing attacks against Pakistan from Afghan sanctuaries and the threat transnational groups pose to regional stability from Afghanistan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-hint-at-shielding-anti-pakistan-militants-in-afghanistan-as-guests-/7916430.html	2024-12-27T13:22:50-08:00	
NASA spacecraft 'safe' after closest-ever approach to sun	NASA said on Friday that its Parker Solar Probe was 'safe' and operating normally after successfully completing the closest-ever approach to the sun by any human-made object. The spacecraft passed 6.1 million kilometers from the solar surface on Tuesday, flying into the sun's outer atmosphere — called the corona — on a mission to help scientists learn more about Earth's closest star. The agency said the operations team at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland received the signal, a beacon tone, from the probe just before midnight on Thursday. The spacecraft is expected to send detailed telemetry data about its status on January 1, NASA added. Moving at up to 692,000 kilometers per hour the spacecraft endured temperatures of up to 982 degrees Celsius, according to the NASA website. 'This close-up study of the sun allows Parker Solar Probe to take measurements that help scientists better understand how material in this region gets heated to millions of degrees, trace the origin of the solar wind (a continuous flow of material escaping the Sun), and discover how energetic particles are accelerated to near light speed,' the agency added. 'We're rewriting the textbooks on how the sun works with the data from this probe,' Dr. Joseph Westlake, NASA's heliophysics director, told Reuters. 'This mission was theorized in the fifties,' he said, adding that it is an 'amazing achievement to create technologies that let us delve into our understanding of how the sun operates.' The Parker Solar Probe was launched in 2018 and has been gradually circling closer toward the sun, using flybys of Venus to gravitationally pull it into a tighter orbit with the sun. Westlake said the team is preparing for even more flybys in the extended mission phase, hoping to capture unique events.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-spacecraft-safe-after-closest-ever-approach-to-sun-/7916419.html	2024-12-27T13:15:48-08:00	
Senate intelligence panel criticizes CIA response to Havana syndrome	A bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report released on Friday criticized the CIA's response to so-called Havana syndrome health problems among its workforce, saying many individuals 'faced obstacles to timely and sufficient care.' The report cast no new light on the causes of the headaches, nausea, memory lapses, dizziness and other ailments that were first reported by U.S. embassy officials in the Cuban capital Havana in 2016. A globe-spanning U.S. intelligence investigation concluded in March 2023 that it was very unlikely a foreign adversary was responsible for the ailments that afflicted some 1,500 U.S. diplomats, spies, other personnel and their families. It found the symptoms, reports of which peaked in 2021 and have since dramatically tapered off, likely resulted from pre-existing conditions, conventional illnesses and environmental and social factors. Commenting on the Senate findings, a CIA spokesperson said the agency had to respond to the 'vexing' health problems as it grappled with the pandemic, and worked with other agencies to determine if a foreign power was attacking U.S. personnel and their families. 'Whether, in hindsight, we could have done better is for others to evaluate, but our commitment to ensuring our officers and their families had access to the care they needed has never wavered,' the spokesperson said in a statement. The committee's report, the product of a year-long staff investigation, was largely based on hundreds of hours of testimony from CIA officials, other U.S. officials, medical personnel and those reporting symptoms, a panel statement said. The report's declassified summary said the unknown nature of anomalous health incidents (AHIs) complicated the CIA's response, which the agency first based on an assessment that an attack causing traumatic brain injuries was responsible. That assessment, the report said, changed with intelligence analyses leading to the 2023 intelligence community finding, and was one of several factors affecting how the agency provided medical care and other benefits to those reporting symptoms. The absence of a clear definition of AHIs, uncertainty about their origins and the CIA's 'evolving organizational structure' for dealing with the issue have 'greatly complicated CIA's ability to consistently and transparently facilitate medical care,' the report said. Those factors also complicated the agency's provision of compensation and other benefits to those reporting symptoms as well as its ability to communicate clearly about AHIs to its personnel, the report continued. The agency provided medical care in nearly '100 CIA-affiliated incidents, but many individuals faced obstacles to timely and sufficient care,' it said. In another finding, it said the agency provided benefits and compensation to many personnel but access to those programs has been inconsistent and affected by the way the CIA was organized to address the issue. The CIA stopped collecting clinical data on AHIs even though some clinical studies identified unexplained clusters of symptoms, the report said, adding that Pentagon research efforts continue.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-intelligence-panel-criticizes-cia-response-to-havana-syndrome-/7916368.html	2024-12-27T12:17:55-08:00	
US sanctions founder of Georgia's ruling political party	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration has imposed sanctions on the founder of Georgia's ruling political party, which has steered the country away from a pro-Western stance and toward Russia, U.S. officials said Friday. The State and Treasury departments said they hit Georgian Dream party founder and honorary chair Bidzina Ivanishvili with penalties 'for undermining the democratic and Euro-Atlantic future of Georgia for the benefit of the Russian Federation,' according to a statement. The designation of Ivanishvili is the latest in a series of sanctions the United States has slapped on Georgian politicians, lawmakers and others this year. The sanctions include freezes on assets and properties that those targeted may have in U.S. jurisdictions or that might enter U.S. jurisdictions as well as travel bans on the targets and members of their families. 'We strongly condemn Georgian Dream's actions under Ivanishvili's leadership, including its ongoing and violent repression of Georgian citizens, protestors, members of the media, human rights activists, and opposition figures,' the State Department said in a statement. 'The United States is committed to promoting accountability for those undermining democracy and human rights in Georgia.' Ivanishvili is a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia and served briefly as Georgia's prime minister. In 2012, he founded Georgian Dream, the longtime ruling party. Critics have accused Georgian Dream of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws like those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights, prompting the European Union to suspend Georgia's membership application process indefinitely. In October, Georgian Dream won another term in a divisive parliamentary election that has led to more mass protests. Last month, the country's prime minister, Irakli Kobakhidze, announced a four-year suspension of talks on Georgia's bid to join the European Union, fueling further public outrage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-founder-of-georgia-s-ruling-political-party/7916344.html	2024-12-27T12:05:58-08:00	
US homelessness up 18% as many in America cannot afford housing	The United States saw an 18.1% increase in homelessness this year, a dramatic rise driven mostly by a lack of affordable housing as well as devastating natural disasters and a surge of migrants in several parts of the country, federal officials said Friday. The U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department said federally required tallies taken across the country in January found that more than 770,000 people were counted as homeless — a number that misses some people and does not include those staying with friends or family because they do not have a place of their own. That increase comes on top of a 12% increase in 2023, which HUD blamed on soaring rents and the end of pandemic assistance. The 2023 increase also was driven by people experiencing homelessness for the first time. The numbers overall represent 23 of every 10,000 people in the U.S., with Black people being overrepresented among the homeless population. 'No American should face homelessness, and the Biden-Harris Administration is committed to ensuring every family has access to the affordable, safe, and quality housing they deserve,' HUD Agency Head Adrianne Todman said in a statement, adding that the focus should remain on 'evidence-based efforts to prevent and end homelessness.' Among the most concerning trends was a nearly 40% rise in family homelessness — one of the areas that was most affected by the arrival of migrants in big cities. Family homelessness more than doubled in 13 communities impacted by migrants including Denver, Colorado; Chicago and New York City, according to HUD, while it rose less than 8% in the remaining 373 communities. Nearly 150,000 children experienced homelessness on a single night in 2024, reflecting a 33% jump from last year. Disasters increase homelessness Disasters also played a part in the rise in the count, especially last year's catastrophic Maui wildfire, the deadliest U.S. wildfire in more than a century. More than 5,200 people were staying in emergency shelters in Hawaii on the night of the count. 'Increased homelessness is the tragic, yet predictable, consequence of underinvesting in the resources and protections that help people find and maintain safe, affordable housing,' Renee Willis, incoming interim CEO of the National Low Income Housing Coalition, said in a statement. 'As advocates, researchers, and people with lived experience have warned, the number of people experiencing homelessness continues to increase as more people struggle to afford sky-high housing costs.' The numbers also come as increasing numbers of communities are taking a hard line against homelessness. Angered by often dangerous and dirty tent camps, communities — especially in Western states — have been enforcing bans on camping. That follows a 6-3 ruling last year by the Supreme Court that found that outdoor sleeping bans don’t violate the Eighth Amendment. Homeless advocates argued that punishing people who need a place to sleep would criminalize homelessness. Homelessness among veterans drops There was some positive news in the count, as homelessness among veterans continued to trend downwards. Homelessness among veterans dropped 8% to 32,882 in 2024. It was an even larger decrease for unsheltered veterans, declining 11% to 13,851 in 2024. 'The reduction in veteran homelessness offers us a clear roadmap for addressing homelessness on a larger scale,' Ann Oliva, CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness, said in a statement. 'With bipartisan support, adequate funding, and smart policy solutions, we can replicate this success and reduce homelessness nationwide.' Several large cities had success bringing down their homeless numbers. Dallas, Texas, which worked to overhaul its homeless system, saw a 16% drop in its numbers between 2022 to 2024. Los Angeles, which increased housing for the homeless, saw a drop of 5% in unsheltered homelessness since 2023. California, the most populous state in the U.S., continued to have the nation's largest homeless population, followed by New York, Washington, Florida and Massachusetts. The sharp increase in the homeless population over the past two years contrasts with success the U.S. had been having for more than a decade. Going back to the first 2007 survey, the U.S. made steady progress for about a decade in reducing the homeless population as the government focused particularly on increasing investments to get veterans into housing. The number of homeless people dropped from about 637,000 in 2010 to about 554,000 in 2017. The numbers ticked up to about 580,000 in the 2020 count and held relatively steady over the next two years as Congress responded to the COVID-19 pandemic with emergency rental assistance, stimulus payments, aid to states and local governments and a temporary eviction moratorium.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-homelessness-up-18-as-many-in-america-cannot-afford-housing/7916304.html	2024-12-27T12:03:11-08:00	
Boat sinks en route to Spain, dozens killed, Malian minister says	BAMAKO, MALI — Nearly 70 migrants died when their boat sank as they tried to reach Spain earlier this month, Mali’s Minister for Malians Living Abroad said. In a press release Thursday, Mossa Ag Attaher announced that a migrant boat bound for Spain sank on Dec. 19. The migrants in this boat 'numbered 80 at the start, with only 11 survivors,' according to the Ministry. The Malian authorities have identified nine Malians among the survivors, and '25 young Malians have unfortunately been formally identified among the victims,' the minister added. The Atlantic route for migrants from West Africa to the Canary Islands is one of the deadliest in the world. Located nearer to Africa than mainland Spain, the archipelago is seen by most as a step toward continental Europe. Many of those making the journey come from Mali, Senegal, Mauritania, and other West African countries, seeking better job opportunities abroad or fleeing violence and political instability. Several of the Malian victims are from the Kayes region in the west of the country, according to Doulaye Keita, adviser to the ministry, in a statement to the AP on Friday. 'Among the 25 Malians dead, there are 8 Malians from my commune,' Mamadou Siby, the mayor of the commune of Marena in the Kayes region, told The Associated Press. 'These dead young men left my commune seven months ago to work in the construction industry in Mauritania. Unfortunately, they were in contact with their friends in Europe and America, who encouraged them to come to these countries, and in most cases, they took the perilous journey without even informing their families back home.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/7916336.html	2024-12-27T11:57:22-08:00	
Massive Chinese espionage scheme hit 9th telecom firm, US says	WASHINGTON — A sprawling Chinese espionage campaign hacked a ninth U.S. telecom firm, a top White House official said Friday. The Chinese hacking blitz known as Salt Typhoon gave officials in Beijing access to private texts and phone conversations of an unknown number of Americans. The White House earlier this month said the attack affected at least eight telecommunications companies and dozens of nations. Anne Neuberger, the deputy national security adviser for cyber and emerging technologies, told reporters Friday that a ninth victim was identified after the administration released guidance to companies about how to hunt for Chinese culprits in their networks. The update from Neuberger is the latest development in a massive hacking operation that alarmed national security officials, exposed cybersecurity vulnerabilities in the private sector and laid bare China's hacking sophistication. The hackers compromised the networks of telecommunications companies to obtain customer call records and gain access to the private communications of 'a limited number of individuals.' Although the FBI has not publicly identified any of the victims, officials believe senior U.S. government officials and prominent political figures are among those whose communications were accessed. Neuberger said officials did not yet have a precise sense of how many Americans overall were affected by Salt Typhoon, in part because the Chinese were careful about their techniques, but a 'large number' were in or near Washington. Officials believe the goal of the hackers was to identify who owned the phones and, if they were 'government targets of interest,' spy on their texts and phone calls, she said. The FBI said most of the people targeted by the hackers are 'primarily involved in government or political activity.' Neuberger said the episode highlighted the need for required cybersecurity practices in the telecommunications industry, something the Federal Communications Commission is to take up at a meeting next month. 'We know that voluntary cybersecurity practices are inadequate to protect against China, Russia and Iran hacking of our critical infrastructure,' she said. The Chinese government has denied responsibility for the hacking.	https://www.voanews.com/a/massive-chinese-espionage-scheme-hit-9th-telecom-firm-us-says/7916311.html	2024-12-27T11:42:32-08:00	
Montenegro approves extradition of cryptocurrency mogul Do Kwon to US	PODGORICA, MONTENEGRO — Montenegro has approved the extradition of a South Korean mogul known as 'the cryptocurrency king' to the United States, the Balkan country's Justice Ministry said Friday. Minister Bojan Bozovic has issued a deposition allowing the handover of Do Kwon, the founder of the Singapore crypto firm Terraform Labs who was arrested in Montenegro last year, according to the ministry. It was not immediately clear when exactly Kwon would be sent to the U.S. The move follows a months-long legal saga in the case of Do Kwon. Both South Korea and the U.S. had requested Do Kwon’s extradition and various courts in Montenegro over the past months have brought and overturned multiple rulings to extradite Kwon either to the U.S. or South Korea. The Justice Ministry statement cited the latest ruling of Montenegro's Supreme Court which said that conditions have been met for Kwon to be extradited to one of the two countries, and that the final decision lies with the justice minister. The ministry said Friday that more legal criteria were in favor of extradition to the U.S. Kwon’s lawyers in Montenegro said they learned about the decision from the media and that their client cannot be extradited until they receive the ruling. 'Behind such illegal behavior of the minister is the fact that the courts, on two occasions ... made a decision to extradite Do Kwon to South Korea,' lawyers Goran Rodić and Marija Radulović said in a statement. Kwon was charged in the U.S. with fraud by federal prosecutors in New York over a $40 billion crash of Terraform Labs’ cryptocurrency, which devastated retail investors around the world. He and another South Korean were arrested in Montenegro while trying to depart for Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using fake Costa Rican passports. Kwon has served a prison term in Montenegro for using a fake passport. Kwon and five others connected to Terraform had been wanted on allegations of fraud and financial crimes in relation to the implosion of its digital currencies in May 2022. TerraUSD was designed as a 'stablecoin,' a currency which is pegged to stable assets like the dollar to prevent drastic fluctuations in prices. However, around $40 billion in market value was erased for the holders of TerraUSD and its floating sister currency, Luna, after the stablecoin plunged far below its $1 peg.	https://www.voanews.com/a/montenegro-approves-extradition-of-cryptocurrency-mogul-do-kwon-to-us-/7916310.html	2024-12-27T11:41:53-08:00	
Senegal to close foreign military bases, cuts ties to ex-colonial power France	DAKAR, SENEGAL — Senegal has announced the closure of all foreign military bases, without setting a timeline for the exit of foreign troops. Prime Minister Ousmane Sonko made the announcement Friday during a general policy statement to the National Assembly. 'The president of the Republic has decided to close all foreign military bases in the very near future,' Sonko said. France's military and Foreign Ministry did not immediately respond to the announcement. President Bassirou Diomaye Faye last month expressed his desire to close the French bases in Senegal. 'Senegal is an independent country, it is a sovereign country, and sovereignty does not accommodate the presence of foreign military bases,' the head of state said in a rare media interview. This decision to close bases appears to be aimed primarily at France. A former colonial power in much of Africa, France has faced opposition from some African leaders over an alleged demeaning and heavy-handed approach to the continent. France, which has already left Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, on Thursday confirmed it had pulled its last troops out of the Faya base in Chad. France’s permanent military presence in Chad ″no longer met the expectations and interests of each party″ and described the withdrawal as part of a ″reconfiguration of its system in Africa″ since 2022, the military said. French officials have said that France aims to sharply reduce its presence at all its bases in Africa except Djibouti. That includes the 350 French troops in Senegal. France could instead provide defense training or targeted military support based on needs expressed by those countries, according to the officials. Senegal's new government, which has been in power for less than a year, has taken a hardline stance on the presence of French troops as part of a larger regional backlash against what many see as the legacy of an oppressive colonial empire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegal-to-close-foreign-military-bases-cuts-ties-to-ex-colonial-power-france/7916172.html	2024-12-27T10:08:37-08:00	
Tens of thousands of Syrian refugees return from Turkey	Nearly 31,000 Syrians have returned home since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar al-Assad earlier this month, Turkey’s interior minister said Friday. Turkey is home to nearly 3 million refugees who fled Syria after the start of the civil war in 2011. The recent fall of Assad’s government has raised hope that Syrian refugees in Turkey and elsewhere may be able to return. The return of Syrian refugees comes as Turkey says it will look to provide electricity to Syria and help enhance its power infrastructure, Turkey’s energy minister was quoted as saying on Friday. Assistance for Syria is coming from elsewhere, too. Some 50 tons of European Union-funded medical supplies that were flown to Turkey through Dubai are expected to enter Syria on Dec. 31, a United Nations health official told Agence France-Presse on Friday. 'The supplies are still in Istanbul and going through the customs process,' Mrinalini Santhanam of the World Health Organization’s Gaziantep office in southern Turkey told AFP. The goal is to support Syria’s healthcare system, which was pummeled by years of war under Assad. And Ukraine already has sent its first batch of food aid to Syria, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Friday. The Ukrainian leader said 500 tons of wheat flour were on their way to Syria. Meanwhile, Iran’s top diplomat warned Friday against 'destructive interference' in Syria’s future, he wrote in Chinese state media as he visited Beijing. Iran 'considers the decision-making about the future of Syria to be the sole responsibility of the people ... without destructive interference or foreign imposition,' Abbas Araghchi wrote in a Chinese-language article in the People’s Daily newspaper published on Friday. Both China and Iran were supporters of the now-deposed Assad. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-of-syrian-refugees-return-from-turkey-/7916193.html	2024-12-27T10:07:33-08:00	
Croatia's president seeks reelection, faces several contenders in Sunday's vote	ZAGREB, CROATIA — Croatia’s left-leaning president, an outspoken critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia, is running for reelection this weekend against an array of contenders, including the candidate backed by the conservative government. President Zoran Milanovic is seen as a favorite ahead of Sunday’s presidential election, although he is unlikely to score an outright victory. If none of the eight contenders gain more than half of the ballots cast in the first round, a runoff between the top two will be held on Jan. 12. The most popular politician in Croatia, 58-year-old Milanovic served as prime minister in the past. Populist in style, Milanovic has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic. The continuous sparring between the two has lately marked Croatia's political scene. Ahead of Sunday's vote, Plenkovic's Hrvatska Democratska Zajednica party, or Croatian Democratic Union party, has backed pediatrician and university professor Dragan Primorac for the presidency. Primorac has sought to portray himself as a unifier and Milanovic as divisive. Although the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme commander of the military. Milanovic has criticized the European Union's support for Ukraine and has often insisted that Croatia should not take sides. He has said Croatia should stay away from global disputes, although it is a member of NATO and the EU. Milanovic has also blocked Croatia's participation in a NATO-led training mission for Ukraine, declaring that 'No Croatian soldier will take part in somebody else’s war.' His main rival in the election, Primorac, has stated that 'Croatia's place is in the West, not the East.' His presidency bid, however, has been marred by a high-level corruption case that landed Croatia’s health minister in jail last month and which featured prominently in pre-election debates. Political expert Andjelko Milardovic said Milanovic’s reelection would be good for democracy in Croatia because the ruling party holds a tight grip over all other government institutions. 'We are interested to see a balance and control of power,' said Milardovic. Milanovic is backed by center-left Social Democrats, the biggest opposition party. Some analysts believe that Marija Selak Raspudic, a conservative independent candidate polling third in pre-election surveys, could stand a better chance against Milanovic if she somehow makes it to the runoff. Selak Raspudic was close to a right-wing party in the past but now runs as nonpartisan. She has focused on economic troubles of ordinary citizens, corruption and population decline in the country of some 3.8 million. Trailing fourth in the polls is the only left-green contender in the race, Ivana Kekin, from the Mozemo, or We Can, party, which governs Zagreb, Croatia's capital. Married to a popular rock musician, Kekin says she is a 'president for a new generation.' As a psychiatrist, Kekin has accused Primorac and HDZ of syphoning money from Croatia's health system in shady corruption deals. Four more candidates are running, but none are believed to stand a chance to reach the second round. Zagreb resident Ilka Matic said that she expects Milanovic to win another five-year mandate but that 'there is little difference between them all.' Croatia, the newest member state of the EU after joining the bloc in 2013, has around 1.6 million eligible voters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/croatia-s-president-seeks-reelection-faces-several-contenders-in-sunday-s-vote/7916158.html	2024-12-27T09:53:24-08:00	
Israeli forces raid northern Gaza hospital	Israeli forces raided the Kamal Adwan hospital on Friday, one of three medical facilities on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip, burning large sections and forcing dozens of patients and hundreds of others to leave, officials said. Gaza’s Health Ministry said it had lost contact with staff inside the hospital in the northern city of Beit Lahiya. 'The occupation forces are inside the hospital now and they are burning it,' Ministry Director Munir al-Bursh said in a statement. The Israeli military said it launched the operation to target Hamas militants near the hospital. The military said in a statement the hospital had become 'a key stronghold for terrorist organizations and continues to be used as a hideout for terrorist operatives.' Since the war began between Israel and Hamas in October 2023, the Israeli military has frequently accused Hamas of using hospitals as command and control centers for attacks against its forces. Hamas has rejected those accusations. Without providing specific details, the Israeli military said it had tried to mitigate harm to civilians and had 'facilitated the secure evacuations of civilians, patients and medical personnel prior to the operation.' The hospital has been under intense pressure from Israeli forces for weeks. 'The world must understand that our hospital is being targeted with the intent to kill and forcibly displace the people inside,' Hossam Abu Safiyeh, director of Kamal Adwan Hospital, said in a statement Monday. The hospital announced Thursday that five of its staff members, including a pediatrician, had been killed in an Israeli strike. The Israeli military said it was not aware of a strike at the hospital and that the report of the deaths would be examined. The World Health Organization has characterized conditions at the hospital as 'appalling' and said it was operating at a 'minimum' level. Hamas said Israeli forces had stormed the hospital Friday. 'The occupation army stormed Kamal Adwan Hospital, forcing medical staff, patients, the wounded, and displaced people to evacuate it,' the militant group said in a statement. Hamas also accused Israeli forces of isolating and detaining those evacuated. 'Hamas holds the occupation fully responsible for the lives of patients, wounded, and medical staff after they were cut off from communication, arrested, and taken to an unknown location,' the militant group added. The war was triggered by Hamas’ terror attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken to Gaza as hostages, according to Israeli data. Israel’s subsequent campaign against Hamas in Gaza has killed more than 45,400 Palestinians, according to health officials in the territory. An additional 108,000 people have been wounded, the health ministry said. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. The majority of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million people has been displaced as they continue to face threats of famine. The enclave itself is in ruins. Some information in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-forces-raid-northern-gaza-hospital-/7916008.html	2024-12-27T08:42:18-08:00	
Protests, traffic blockades keep up in Serbia over concrete canopy fall	BELGRADE, SERBIA — Serbian university students left piles of old schoolbooks outside the Education Ministry building Friday as part of almost daily street protests demanding accountability over the collapse nearly two months ago of a concrete canopy that killed 15 people in the country's north. Scattered traffic blockades were also held on various locations throughout Serbia at 11:52 a.m. — the time that the concrete construction on the front of the railway station building in Novi Sad crashed onto the people below. Traffic blockades have been held every Friday since the Nov. 1 crash, lasting 15 minutes for the 15 victims. Many in Serbia blame the collapse on widespread corruption and sloppy work on the railway station building in the city of Novi Sad, which was twice renovated in recent years as part of questionable mega projects involving Chinese state companies. Persistent protests in Serbia reflect widespread anger at the accident but also wider discontent with the rule of populist President Aleksandar Vucic and his government. Tens of thousands of people joined a rally Sunday in Belgrade led by the university students. Prosecutors arrested 13 people over the Novi Sad tragedy, including a government minister whose release later fueled public skepticism about the honesty of the investigation. Striking university students have garnered support from various walks of life, challenging the tight grip on power by Vucic's government. The movement's symbol — a red handprint telling authorities they have blood on their hands — has been used by actors, farmers and others backing the protests. In Belgrade, more than 2,000 students marched to the Education Ministry. A speaker told the crowd that 'we are sick of being called political mercenaries and attacked in the streets.' In Novi Sad, a student rally criticized the way the state-run RT Vojvodina reports about the protests and the canopy collapse. Populist officials and the pro-government mainstream media have described the protests as a 'hybrid war' against Vucic under the orders of foreign intelligence services. Though Serbia is formally seeking European Union membership, Vucic has faced accusations of curbing democratic freedoms rather than advancing them. University students in neighboring Bosnia’s capital, Sarajevo, and the northwestern town of Banja Luka on Friday gathered in support of their Serbian colleagues and to draw attention to problems in their own country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-traffic-blockades-keep-up-in-serbia-over-concrete-canopy-fall/7916060.html	2024-12-27T08:33:05-08:00	
Slovakia confirms it can host Ukraine-Russia peace talks	Slovakia on Friday confirmed its readiness to host peace talks aimed at ending the war between Russia and Ukraine. On Thursday, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Moscow is open to a Slovak proposal to host peace talks with Ukraine, which Russia invaded in February of 2022. 'We offer Slovak soil for such negotiations,' Slovak Foreign Minister Juraj Blanar said on Facebook. Blanar also said any talks must take place with all parties participating, including Russia. Russian officials were not present for previous talks in June in Switzerland. 'We consider the statement of the Russian president as a positive signal to end this war, this bloodshed and this destruction as soon as possible,' Blanar said. The foreign minister said Slovakia, a European Union and NATO member, told Ukraine in October about its availability to host peace talks. Slovakia’s Prime Minister Robert Fico is one of just a few European leaders who have remained close with Moscow. He prompted an angry reaction from Ukraine when he met with Putin in Moscow on Dec. 22. Fico also has halted all Slovakian military aid to Ukraine, and he has accused Ukraine of threatening Slovakia’s supply of Russian gas. Also on Friday, the Ukrainian air force said its air defense shot down 13 of 24 Russian drones launched in an overnight attack. The air force said the other 11 Russian drones were 'lost' without causing damage. That comes as Russia’s Defense Ministry said on Friday that its forces had taken control of two eastern Ukrainian villages, according to the RIA state news agency. The ministry identified the villages as Ivanivka in the Donetsk region and Zahryzove in the Kharkiv region. VOA could not verify the Russian report.

Brazil views labor violations at BYD site as human 'trafficking'	Rio de Janeiro, Brazil — Authorities in Brazil said Friday they are probing Chinese auto giant BYD and one of its contractors for suspected 'trafficking' of Chinese workers building a factory in the South American country. Federal prosecutors in Brazil are weighing possible criminal action after labor inspectors found 163 Chinese workers 'in slave-like conditions' at the construction site in the northeast state of Bahia, a government statement said. The workers, employed by BYD contractor Jinjiang Open Engineering, were viewed as 'victims of international trafficking for the purpose of labor exploitation,' said the statement. A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman in Beijing, Mao Ning, said: 'We have noted the relevant reports... and are currently verifying the situation.' She added that Beijing 'attaches great importance to protecting laborers' legitimate rights and interests, and has always required Chinese enterprises to operate in line with the law and regulations.' On Thursday, BYD and Jinjiang were quizzed by Brazilian government ministries, which said 'the companies committed to collaborate in protecting the rescued workers.' Allegations denied Brazilian officials on Monday said it had found the labor violations at the site, which is being built to be BYD's largest electric car plant outside of Asia. Bahia's regional ministry for works (MPT) ordered construction be suspended at part of the site. Inspections carried out since November found 'degrading working conditions' at the site, including beds in workers' accommodation lacking mattresses, and one bathroom per 31 workers, an MPT statement said. The workers, who spent long hours under Brazil's sun, had 'visible signs of skin damage,' the statement said. The MPT added that it suspected 'forced labor,' with workers' passports confiscated and their employer 'retaining 60 percent of their salary.' After the allegations were made public, BYD's Brazilian subsidiary said it had broken its contract with the Jinjiang subsidiary responsible for work on the site. It added that it had sent the 163 workers to stay in hotels. Jinjiang on Thursday — in a statement issued before the online hearing with Brazilian authorities — denied the slavery allegation. The company said the accusations 'seriously damaged the dignity of Chinese people' and claimed it 'made our staff feel seriously insulted and that their human rights have been violated.' A Jinjiang representative told AFP on Friday that the company would hold a press conference in Brazil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-views-labor-violations-at-byd-site-as-human-trafficking-/7916009.html	2024-12-27T08:02:00-08:00	
Chad opposition, civil society vow to disrupt Sunday elections	Yaounde — Tensions continue to mount in Chad, with opposition and so-called civil society groups vowing to disrupt Sunday’s local council, regional and parliamentary elections. The groups say the polls will be rigged to favor current President Mahamat Idriss Deby, and are visiting towns and villages warning people to stay home to avoid possible street violence. Chadians in the country’s capital, N'djamena, say uncertainty looms in the central African state ahead of elections slated to take place Sunday. Twenty-three-year old Limana Abba, a student at the university of N'djamena, told VOA via a messaging app Friday that opponents of the elections have been visiting neighborhoods to warn people against voting. He says he is not sure he and a majority of registered voters will be able to vote because opposition and civil society groups have increased threats to attack those who vote on Sunday. In Chad, civil society groups are associations authorized to help with the country's governance, human rights and democratic process. It’s not clear if the groups threatening violence Sunday qualify as civil society under that definition. In any case, Limana has concerns about whether the military and police can protect voters, candidates and election officials, despite pledges from the government to do so. Chadian officials told state TV this week that government troops and police have been deployed to safeguard civilians and their property, and to stop what the government calls the possible use of weapons by disgruntled civilians. Ahead of the vote, political parties and aligned groups have been holding daily campaigns against the elections. Soumaine Adoum, the spokesperson of Wakit Tama, a coalition of over a hundred groups, spoke to a press conference in N'djamena Thursday. He said civilians do not trust Deby, who wants to continue his father, Idriss Deby Itno's roughly 30-year rule at all costs. He added all Chadians should stay at home on Sunday as a sign of protest against the armed conflicts, corruption, abuses of press freedom, suffocation of liberties and democracy, and illegal arrests and detention of opposition and civil society members that have characterized Deby's rule. Soumaine said the Elections Management Body, ANGE, cannot claim the elections will be free, fair and credible when Deby is preparing to use government troops to stuff ballot boxes as he did during the central country’s May 6 presidential election. Deby and ANGE denied the presidential election was rigged, and ANGE has always claimed it organizes free, fair and transparent elections free of government intervention. The elections management body is asking civilians to brave the threats and contribute to the country's development by taking part in Sunday’s polls. Scores of opposition and civil society members have been arrested ahead of the polls. Government officials say police called in several dozen people for questioning this week because of complaints from Deby's ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement that their campaign teams were attacked and election materials destroyed. Sunday’s local, regional and parliamentary elections were organized to mark an end to Chad's three-year transition period after the death of longtime President Idriss Deby Itno in April 2021. The legislative elections are aimed at restoring the 188-member National Assembly that was dissolved in April 2021 when the army took power. Officials say government troops will vote Saturday, before the general voting, then be on alert to intervene in case of violence when civilians vote Sunday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-opposition-civil-society-vow-to-disrupt-sunday-elections-/7915943.html	2024-12-27T07:35:45-08:00	
How sisterhood of writers helped Afghan women through Taliban takeover	WASHINGTON — Marie Bamyani was in a taxi in Kabul on Aug. 15, 2021, when she learned that the Taliban had entered the Afghan capital. 'I felt like a glass that breaks at once,' said Bamyani, who is now 29. At the time, Bamyani worked with a German aid organization. She said she was too young in the 1990s to remember much about the previous period of Taliban rule. The only thing that came to her mind were horrific images in the media of the Taliban executing a woman in a soccer stadium in the late '90s. For her, the return of the Taliban meant 'death for Afghan women.' The Taliban quickly imposed repressive measures against women. In a state of shock, Bamyani remembers not daring to step outside of her house for weeks. 'I was feeling numb,' she told VOA. The only thing she did was share her experience in a WhatsApp chat group with 20 other women. Those messages, collected over that first year of Taliban rule and translated into English from Dari and Pashto, are now published as a diary in the book, My Dear Kabul. Published in 2024 in Britain, the book captures firsthand the changes to women's freedoms seen in the first year, and for some, their thoughts watching the situation in Afghanistan from overseas. For Bamyani, she continued contributing to the chat group even after being evacuated to Germany in October of that year. 'We just shared our feelings about the situation in the country,' she said, adding that they never thought the messages would one day be a book. The women were part of a writer development program, started in 2019 by Untold Narratives. At the time of the takeover, they were preparing to release a separate book, My Pen Is the Wing of a Bird. That book, released in 2022, is a collection of short fiction stories, written by Afghan women. Lucy Hannah, the founder of Untold Narratives and a coeditor of My Dear Kabul, told VOA that the WhatsApp messages were collected at the writers' request. 'It is important to hear from women's voices,' said Hannah. It is also important to hear 'from voices that are not necessarily journalists, that are working people whose lives are directly affected by what is going around them who also happen to be creative writers.' She said that the 21 contributors, ages 22 to 65, were from different ethnic groups. Another contributor, Fatima Saadat, told VOA that she and the women in the chat wanted a safe place to share, without hesitation, 'what came to their mind at that moment.' Saadat left Kabul a week before the fall of Kabul, to start on her master's degree in women's and gender studies as a Fulbright scholar in the U.S. 'I couldn't believe that in a few days after I left, something like that would happen,' she said. 'I wanted to know how the girls [in the group] were doing.' Saadat said it was 'an act of courage' that these women posted what they were feeling and experiencing. 'This encouraged me when I read their messages, and I started [sharing] my feelings while in the U.S.,' she said. 'As a woman, my fear was about my human rights, women's rights,' she said. 'The return of the Taliban meant the return of conflict, horror and backwardness to Afghanistan.' It is painful when one can't get an education, leave the house, and make choices in life, said Saadat. 'Your life becomes a prison.' Since the August 2021 takeover, the Taliban have imposed rules and regulations on women and girls: They are barred from secondary and university education, working with the government and non-government organizations, traveling long distances without being accompanied by a male relative, and going to public baths and restaurants. But, Saadat said, 'Writing is the thing that the Taliban can't take away from us.' Other Afghan female writers have welcomed the book's release. Parvin Malal, who writes poetry and fiction about women, conflict and refugees, told VOA it is important for Afghan women to write about their experiences. Writing helps people when 'going through crises and dealing with mental issues,' said Malal, who is originally from Kandahar. In a December report, Rawadari, an Afghanistan-focused rights group based outside the country, found deterioration of mental health and an increase in suicide attempts and child and forced marriages among girls in Afghanistan. 'As a result of the ban on women's education, violence against women increased, which has made life difficult for girls and women' in Afghanistan, the report said. For Bamyani, she believes the current situation in Afghanistan will not remain the same. 'I am optimistic and hopeful that it will not be forever, but I hope that people inside Afghanistan will not suffer for long,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-sisterhood-of-writers-helped-afghan-women-through-taliban-takeover-/7915973.html	2024-12-27T07:24:46-08:00

Ukrainian drone attack was under way before Azerbaijani plane crash, Russian aviation chief says	Russia's aviation chief said Friday that a Ukrainian drone attack was under way in the region of Chechnya at the time an Azerbaijani airliner attempted to land before diverting to Kazakhstan and crashing there earlier this week. Dmitry Yadrov, head of Russia’s civil aviation authority Rosaviatsia, didn’t comment on statements by an Azerbaijani lawmaker and many aviation experts who blamed Wednesday’s crash on Russian air defense fire. Azerbaijan Airlines’ Embraer 190 was flying from Azerbaijan’s capital of Baku to Grozny, the regional capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, but it turned to Aktau in Kazakhstan across the Caspian Sea and crashed while making an attempt to land there. The crash killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured. Authorities in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and Russia were tight-lipped about a possible cause of the crash pending an official probe, but a member of Azerbaijan's parliament, Rasim Musabekov told the Azerbaijani news agency Turan on Thursday that the plane was fired on while in the skies over Grozny and urged Russia to offer an official apology. Asked about Musabekov's statement, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov declined to comment, saying that it will be up to investigators to determine the cause of the crash. 'The air incident is being investigated, and we don't believe we have the right to make any assessments until the conclusions are made as a result of the investigation,' Peskov said in a conference call with reporters. Yadrov, the Russian aviation chief, said that as the plane was preparing to land in Grozny in deep fog, Ukrainian drones were targeting Grozny, prompting authorities to close the area for air traffic. Yadrov said that after the captain made two unsuccessful attempts to land in Grozny, he was offered other airports as an alternative but decided to fly to Aktau across the Caspian Sea. 'The situation in the area of Grozny airport was quite difficult,' he said in a statement. 'There are many circumstances that it's necessary to investigate jointly.' Investigators from Azerbaijan are working in Grozny as part of the crash probe, Azerbaijani Prosecutor General’s office said in a statement. As the official crash probe started, some aviation experts pointed out that holes seen in the plane’s tail section suggested that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country’s North Caucasus. FlightRadar24 said in an online post that the aircraft had faced 'strong GPS jamming' that interfered with flight tracking data. Russia has extensively used sophisticated jamming equipment to fend off drone attacks. Following Wednesday's suspension of flights from Baku to Grozy and Makhachkala, Azerbaiajan Airlines announced Friday that it would also halt service to more Russian cities, cutting air links to Mineralnye Vody, Sochi, Volgograd, Ufa, Samara. It said in a statement that the flights will be suspended 'following the preliminary results of the investigation into the crash of the Embraer 190 aircraft operating flight J2-8243 from Baku to Grozny, caused by physical and technical interference, and considering potential risks to flight safety.' The company will continue to operate flights to six other Russian cities including Moscow, St. Petersburg and Kazan. Those cities also have been repeatedly targeted by Ukrainian drone strikes in the past. Kazakhstan's Qazaq Air also announced Friday that it was suspending flights from Astana to the Russian city of Yekaterinburg in the Ural Mountains for a month. The day before, Israeli El Al suspended flights from Tel Aviv to Moscow citing 'developments in Russia’s airspace.' The airline said it would reassess the situation next week to decide whether to resume the flights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-drone-attack-was-under-way-before-azerbaijani-plane-crash-russian-aviation-chief-says-/7915869.html	2024-12-27T06:39:26-08:00	
Driver who killed 35 in China car ramming sentenced to death	Beijing — A man who killed 35 people in a car attack in the southern Chinese city of Zhuhai last month was sentenced to death on Friday, state media reported. On November 11, 62-year-old Fan Weiqiu deliberately drove through people exercising outside a sports complex in his small SUV, the worst attack in China since 2014. He was detained at the scene with self-inflicted knife injuries and fell into a coma, police said at the time. His case was publicly tried on Friday, state broadcaster CCTV reported, with the verdict reached on the same day. The court said the defendant's motives 'were extremely vile, the nature of the crime extremely egregious, the methods particularly cruel, and the consequences particularly severe, posing significant harm to society,' state media said. In front of some of the victims' families, officials and members of the public, Fan pleaded guilty, it added. The court found Fan had 'decided to vent his anger' over 'a broken marriage, personal frustrations, and dissatisfaction with the division of property after divorce,' the report said. China has this year seen a string of mass casualty incidents — from stabbings to car attacks — challenging its reputation for good public security. Some analysts have linked the incidents to growing anger and desperation at the country's slowing economy and a sense that society is becoming more stratified.	https://www.voanews.com/a/driver-who-killed-35-in-china-car-ramming-sentenced-to-death-/7915802.html	2024-12-27T05:24:27-08:00	
China sanctions 7 companies over US military assistance to Taiwan	BEIJING — The Chinese government placed sanctions on seven companies on Friday in response to recent U.S. announcements of military sales and aid to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims as part of its territory. The sanctions also come in response to the recent approval of the U.S. government's annual defense spending bill, which a Chinese Foreign Ministry statement said 'includes multiple negative sections on China.' China objects to American military assistance for Taiwan and often imposes sanctions on related companies after a sale or aid package is announced. The sanctions generally have a limited impact, because American defense companies don't sell arms or other military goods to China. The U.S. is the main supplier of weapons to Taiwan for its defense. The seven companies being sanctioned are Insitu Inc., Hudson Technologies Co., Saronic Technologies, Inc., Raytheon Canada, Raytheon Australia, Aerkomm Inc. and Oceaneering International Inc., the Foreign Ministry statement said. It said that 'relevant senior executives' of the companies are also sanctioned, without naming any. Any assets they have in China will be frozen, and organizations and individuals in China are prohibited from engaging in any activity with them, it said. U.S. President Joe Biden last week authorized up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and military education and training for Taiwan. Separately, the Defense Department announced that $295 million in military sales had been approved. The U.S. defense bill boosts military spending to $895 billion and directs resources toward a more confrontational approach to China. It establishes a fund that could be used to send military resources to Taiwan in much the same way that the U.S. has backed Ukraine. It also expands a ban on U.S. military purchases of Chinese products ranging from drone technology to garlic for military commissaries. Zhang Xiaogang, a Chinese Defense Ministry spokesperson, said earlier this week that the U.S. is hyping up the 'so-called' threat from China to justify increased military spending. 'U.S. military spending has topped the world and keeps increasing every year,' he said at a press conference. 'This fully exposes the belligerent nature of the U.S. and its obsession with hegemony and expansion.' The Foreign Ministry statement said the U.S. moves violate agreements between the two countries on Taiwan, interfere in China's domestic affairs and undermine the nation's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Taiwan's government said earlier this month that China had sent dozens of ships into nearby seas to practice a blockade of the island, a move that Taiwan said undermined peace and stability and disrupted international shipping and trade. China has not confirmed or commented on the reported military activity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-sanctions-7-companies-over-us-military-assistance-to-taiwan/7915788.html	2024-12-27T05:17:03-08:00	
NATO to boost military presence in Baltic after cables 'sabotage'	Brussels — NATO will bolster its military presence in the Baltic Sea after the suspected sabotage of an undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia this week, the Western military alliance's chief Mark Rutte said on Friday. On Christmas Day, the Estlink 2 submarine cable that carries electricity from Finland to Estonia was disconnected from the grid, just over a month after two telecommunications cables were severed in Swedish territorial waters in the Baltic. Finnish authorities on Thursday said they were investigating the oil tanker, Eagle S, that sailed from a Russian port, as part of a probe for 'aggravated sabotage.' Finnish President Alexander Stubb said on Friday: 'We've got the situation under control, and we have to continue to work together vigilantly to make sure that our critical infrastructure is not damaged by outsiders.' Officials suspect the tanker is part of the Russian 'shadow fleet', which refers to ships that transport Russian crude and oil products embargoed due to Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The Eagle S vessel, which flies under the flag of the Cook Islands in the South Pacific, was en route to Port Said in Egypt. Police suspect that the oil tanker's anchor might have damaged the power cable. Rutte said he spoke to President Stubb about Finland's probe, adding in a post on X: 'I expressed my full solidarity and support. NATO will enhance its military presence in the Baltic Sea.' Estonian Defense Minister Hanno Pevkur earlier on Friday said on X that the country began naval patrols to protect the undersea cable supplying electricity from Finland. In a separate statement he said Tallinn wanted to send a clear message it was ready to protect its power connections with Finland with military and non-military means. Rutte on Thursday promised NATO support to Estonia and Finland, and condemned attacks on critical infrastructure after speaking to Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal. More EU sanctions The European Union has also threatened further sanctions against Russia's shadow fleet after this week's incident. The bloc's 27 member states agreed earlier this month to blacklist around 50 more oil tankers from Russia's shadow fleet used to circumvent Western sanctions, taking the number targeted to around 80. Ukraine's international backers have looked to curb funds going to the Kremlin's war machine by imposing a price cap and restrictions on Russia's key oil exports. To skirt the measures, Russia has resorted to using a so-called 'shadow fleet' of often ageing vessels that operate under dubious ownership or without proper insurance. Tensions have mounted around the Baltic since Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In September 2022, a series of underwater blasts ruptured the Nord Stream pipelines that carried Russian gas to Europe, the cause of which has yet to be determined. In October 2023, an undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia was shut down after it was damaged by the anchor of a Chinese cargo ship. On November 17 and 18 this year, sections of two telecom cables were cut in Swedish territorial waters. Suspicions have been directed at the Yi Peng 3, which according to ship tracking sites had sailed over the cables around the time they were cut.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-to-boost-military-presence-in-baltic-after-cables-sabotage-/7915778.html	2024-12-27T05:03:37-08:00	
Germany's president dissolves parliament, sets national election for Feb. 23	FRANKFURT, Germany — German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier on Friday ordered parliament dissolved and set new elections for Feb. 23 in the wake of the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition. Scholz lost a confidence vote on Dec. 16 and leads a minority government after his unpopular and notoriously rancorous three-party coalition collapsed on Nov. 6 when he fired his finance minister in a dispute over how to revitalize Germany’s stagnant economy. Leaders of several major parties then agreed that a parliamentary election should be held on Feb. 23, seven months earlier than originally planned. Since the post-World War II constitution doesn’t allow the Bundestag to dissolve itself, it was up to Steinmeier to decide whether to dissolve parliament and call an election. He had 21 days to make that decision. Once parliament is dissolved, the election must be held within 60 days. In practice, the campaign is already well underway. Polls show Scholz’s party trailing the conservative opposition Union bloc led by Friedrich Merz. Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the environmentalist Greens, the remaining partner in Scholz’s government, is also bidding for the top job — though his party is further back. If recent polls hold up, the likely next government would be led by Merz as chancellor in coalition with at least one other party. Key issues include immigration, how to get the sluggish economy going, and how best to aid Ukraine in its struggle against Russia. The populist, anti-immigration Alternative for Germany, or AfD, which is polling strongly, has nominated Alice Weidel as its candidate for chancellor but has no chance of taking the job because other parties refuse to work with it. Germany’s electoral system traditionally produces coalitions, and polls show no party anywhere near an absolute majority on its own. The election is expected to be followed by weeks of negotiations to form a new government. It’s only the fourth time that the Bundestag has been dissolved ahead of schedule under Germany’s post-World War II constitution. It happened under Chancellor Willy Brandt in 1972, Helmut Kohl in 1982 and Gerhard Schroeder in 2005. Schroeder used the confidence vote to engineer an early election narrowly won by center-right challenger Angela Merkel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-s-president-dissolves-parliament-sets-national-election-for-feb-23-/7915727.html	2024-12-27T03:50:30-08:00	
Israel says struck 'infrastructure' on Syria-Lebanon border	Jerusalem — The Israeli military reported it conducted air strikes on Friday targeting 'infrastructure' on the Syrian-Lebanese border near the village of Janta, which it said was used to smuggle weapons to the armed group Hezbollah. 'Earlier today, the IAF [Israeli air force] struck infrastructure that was used to smuggle weapons via Syria to the Hezbollah terrorist organization in Lebanon at the Janta crossing on the Syrian-Lebanese border,' the military said in a statement. It did not specify whether the strikes were on the Syrian or Lebanese side, but they came a day after Lebanon's army accused Israel of 'violation of the ceasefire agreement by attacking Lebanese sovereignty and destroying southern towns and villages.' There is no official crossing point near Janta but the area is known for illegal crossings. The UN peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon, UNIFIL, has also expressed concern over 'continuing destruction' caused by Israeli forces in south Lebanon. The Israeli military said Friday's strikes were aimed at preventing weapons falling into the hands of Hezbollah, with whom it fought a land and air war for more than a year until a ceasefire was agreed upon last month. 'These strikes are an additional part of the IDF's [Israeli military's] effort to target weapons smuggling operations from Syria into Lebanon, and prevent Hezbollah from re-establishing weapons smuggling routes,' the military said. 'The IDF will continue to act to remove any threat to the state of Israel in accordance with the understandings in the ceasefire agreement.' The truce went into effect on November 27, about two months after Israel stepped up its bombing campaign and later sent troops into Lebanon following nearly a year of exchanges of cross-border fire initiated by Hezbollah over the war in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-struck-infrastructure-on-syria-lebanon-border-/7915712.html	2024-12-27T03:33:47-08:00	
Houthis claim new attacks on Israel after strikes hit Yemen airport	Sanaa — Yemeni rebels claimed a strike against the airport in Israel's commercial hub of Tel Aviv on Friday, after Israeli air strikes hit rebel-held Sanaa's international airport and other targets in Yemen. The Israeli strikes on Thursday landed as the head of the UN's World Health Organization said he and his team were preparing to fly out from Yemen's Houthi rebel-held capital. Hours later on Friday, the Houthis said they fired a missile at Ben Gurion airport and launched drones at Tel Aviv as well as a ship in the Arabian Sea. No other details were immediately available. Yemen's civil aviation authority said the airport planned to reopen on Friday after the strikes that it said occurred while the UN aircraft 'was getting ready for its scheduled flight.' The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on whether they knew at the time that WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus was there. Israel's attack came a day after the Iran-backed Houthi rebels claimed the firing of a missile and two drones at Israel. Yemen's Houthis have stepped up their attacks against Israel since late November when a ceasefire took effect between Israel and another Iran-backed group, Lebanon's Hezbollah. The Houthis Al-Masirah TV said the Israeli strikes killed six people, after earlier Houthi statements said two people died at the rebel-held capital's airport, and another at Ras Issa port. The strikes targeting the airport, military facilities and power stations in rebel areas marked the second time since December 19 that Israel has hit targets in Yemen after rebel missile fire towards Israel. In his latest warning to the rebels, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would 'continue until the job is done.' 'We are determined to cut this branch of terrorism from the Iranian axis of evil,' he said in a video statement. Yemenis depend on aid UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres denounced the 'escalation' in hostilities between Israel and the Houthis and called the Sanaa airport strikes 'especially alarming.' He said bombing transportation infrastructure posed a threat to humanitarian operations in Yemen, where 80 percent of the population is dependent on aid. Tedros was in Yemen to seek the release of UN staff detained for months by the Houthis, and to assess the humanitarian situation. He said he and other UN staff were about to board their flight when 'the airport came under aerial bombardment.' 'The air traffic control tower, the departure lounge — just a few meters from where we were — and the runway were damaged,' Tedros said on X, adding that he and United Nations staff were safe. A witness told AFP that 'more than six' attacks struck the rebel-held capital's airport, with raids also targeting the adjacent Al-Dailami air base. A series of strikes also targeted a power station in Hodeida, on the rebel-held coast, a witness and Al-Masirah TV said. Following rebel attacks against Israel, Israeli strikes had already twice this year hit Hodeida, a major entry point for humanitarian aid to impoverished Yemen, which has been ravaged for years by its own war. On December 19, after the rebels fired a missile towards Israel and badly damaged a school, Israel for the first time struck targets in Sanaa. It said the strikes were against ports and energy infrastructure that 'effectively contributed to' Houthi military actions. Houthi media said those strikes killed nine people. In the latest attacks, the Israeli military said its 'fighter jets conducted intelligence-based strikes on military targets belonging to the Houthi terrorist regime.' 'Iranian weapons' The targets included 'military infrastructure' at the airport and power stations in Sanaa and Hodeida, as well as other facilities at Hodeida, Salif and Ras Kanatib ports, an Israeli statement said. The targets were used by Houthis 'to smuggle Iranian weapons into the region and for the entry of senior Iranian officials,' the statement said. Iran's foreign ministry condemned Israel's strikes as a 'clear violation of international peace and security and an undeniable crime against the heroic and noble people of Yemen.' Palestinian militant group Hamas, whose top leaders Israel has killed during the war in the Gaza Strip, condemned the attack as an 'aggression' against its 'brothers from Yemen.' Almost a week ago, on December 21, Israel's military and emergency services said a projectile fired from Yemen wounded 16 people in Israel's commercial center, Tel Aviv. The Houthis have repeatedly fired missiles and drones at Israel since the Gaza war began in October last year, claiming solidarity with the Palestinians. They have similarly attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, waters vital to world trade. Scores of drone and missile attacks on cargo ships have prompted reprisal strikes against Houthi targets by U.S. and sometimes British forces. In July, a Houthi drone attack on Tel Aviv killed an Israeli civilian, prompting the first Israeli retaliation on Hodeida. The Houthis control large parts of Yemen after seizing the capital and ousting the internationally recognized government in September 2014. A Saudi-led coalition in March 2015 began a military campaign to dislodge them that was unsuccessful, despite what the Yemen Data Project, an independent tracker, said were more than 25,000 coalition air raids.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-claim-new-attacks-on-israel-after-strikes-hit-yemen-airport-/7915693.html	2024-12-27T03:18:43-08:00	
Estonia's navy to protect Baltic Sea power link after cable damage	STOCKHOLM — Estonia's armed forces have launched a naval operation to protect the Estlink 1 undersea power cable in the Baltic Sea in response to the damage this week of a parallel electricity line, Foreign Minister Margus Tsahkna said on Friday. Finland on Thursday seized a ship carrying Russian oil on suspicion the vessel caused an outage of the Estlink 2 undersea power cable which, like Estlink 1, connects Finland and Estonia, and that it also damaged four internet lines. Baltic Sea nations are on high alert for acts of sabotage following a string of outages of power cables, telecom links and gas pipelines since Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, although subsea equipment is also subject to technical malfunction and accidents. Damage to subsea installations in the region has now become so frequent that it is difficult to believe this was caused merely by accident or poor seamanship, Tsahkna said on Thursday. Finnish investigators believe the seized ship -- the Cook Island-registered ship, named as the Eagle S -- may have caused the damage by dragging its anchor along the seabed, one of several such incidents in recent years. 'If there is a threat to the critical undersea infrastructure in our region, there will also be a response,' Tsahkna said on social media X. The 658 megawatt (MW) Estlink 2 outage began at midday local time on Wednesday, leaving only the 358 MW Estlink 1 in operation between the two countries, operators Fingrid and Elering have said. Estonian public broadcaster ERR reported on Friday that the Baltic country had despatched a patrol ship, the Raju, to the waters where the Estlink 1 runs, and that the country hoped NATO allies would also deploy ships.	https://www.voanews.com/a/estonia-s-navy-to-protect-baltic-sea-power-link-after-cable-damage/7915662.html	2024-12-27T02:15:28-08:00	
Seoul: North Korean soldier captured in Russia-Ukraine war dies	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A North Korean soldier who was captured while fighting in Russia's war against Ukraine has died of his wounds, South Korea's spy agency said Friday. Pyongyang has deployed thousands of troops to reinforce Russia's military, including in the Kursk border region where Ukraine mounted a shock border incursion in August. One of those North Korean soldiers was captured alive by the Ukrainian army on Thursday, a South Korean intelligence source told AFP, adding that the location where he was seized was not known. Hours later, Seoul's National Intelligence Service (NIS) said that the soldier had succumbed to his wounds. 'It has been confirmed through an allied intelligence agency that the North Korean soldier captured alive on December 26th has just passed away due to worsening wounds,' the South's spy agency said in a statement. Friday's confirmation came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said that nearly 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been 'killed or wounded' so far as they joined Russian troops in combat. South Korea's intelligence service had previously put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 1,000, saying the high casualty rate could be down to an unfamiliar battlefield environment and their lack of capability to counter drone attacks. Pyongyang's soldiers were also being 'utilized as expendable front-line assault units,' lawmaker Lee Seong-kweun said, speaking last week after a briefing by South Korea's spy agency. 'Dangerous expansion' North Korea and Russia have strengthened their military ties since Moscow's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. A landmark defense pact between Pyongyang and Moscow signed in June came into force this month, with Russian President Vladimir Putin hailing it as a 'breakthrough document.' North Korean state media said Friday that Putin sent a New Year's message to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, saying 'the bilateral ties between our two countries have been elevated after our talks in June in Pyongyang.' Ukraine's allies have called Pyongyang's growing involvement in Russia's war in Ukraine a 'dangerous expansion' of the conflict. Seoul's military believes that North Korea was seeking to modernize its conventional warfare capabilities through combat experience gained in the Russia-Ukraine war. NATO chief Mark Rutte had also said that Moscow was providing support to Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs in exchange for the troops. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said Monday that Pyongyang is reportedly 'preparing for the rotation or additional deployment of soldiers' and supplying '240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery' to the Russian army. Pyongyang's involvement in Russia's war against Ukraine had prompted warnings from Seoul. South Korea's President Yoon Suk Yeol, currently suspended, said in November that Seoul was 'not ruling out the possibility of providing weapons' to Ukraine, which would mark a major shift to a long-standing policy barring the sale of weapons to countries in active conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/seoul-north-korean-soldier-captured-in-russia-ukraine-war-dies/7915658.html	2024-12-27T02:05:27-08:00	
South Korean lawmakers impeach acting President Han Duck-soo	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean lawmakers impeached the acting president on Friday, as the country struggles to shake off political turmoil sparked by his predecessor's martial law declaration that shocked the world. Han Duck-soo took over as acting president from President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was suspended following a parliamentary vote over his move to impose martial law on Dec. 3. However, opposition MPs demanded Han, who is also prime minister, be removed from office as well, arguing that he had refused demands to complete Yoon's impeachment process and to bring him to justice. 'I announce that Prime Minister Han Duck-soo's impeachment motion has passed. Out of the 192 lawmakers who voted, 192 voted to impeach,' said National Assembly Speaker Woo Won-shik. Counting for the impeachment was delayed as ruling People's Power Party (PPP) lawmakers protested in parliament after Woo said only a simple majority was needed in the 300-member parliament to proceed with the impeachment. PPP lawmakers began chanting angrily and many rushed towards Woo, demanding that he resign. They did not take part in the vote. It became the second impeachment of a South Korean head of state in just two weeks, adding to the turmoil of the country's dynamic political landscape. It was also South Korea's first impeachment of an acting president. PPP leader Kweon Seong-dong said after the vote that Han 'must continue to lead state affairs without yielding to the opposition's passage of the impeachment motion.' However, Han said in a statement after the vote that he 'respects the parliament's decision' and would wait for the Constitutional Court's subsequent decision whether to uphold it. The opposition said in its impeachment motion that Han was 'intentionally avoiding the special investigation to probe those involved in the insurrection and has clearly stated his intention to reject the appointments of three Constitutional Court judges.' Such actions, it said, were 'in violation of a public official's duty to uphold the law... and serve the public.' Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok will step in as acting president in Han's place. Choi had pleaded with the opposition lawmakers not to go ahead with the motion. 'An impeachment motion against the acting authority is no different from an impeachment motion against the entire Cabinet,' he told a news conference with other Cabinet members earlier on Friday. 'Our economy and people's livelihoods, which are walking on thin ice in a national emergency, cannot bear the expansion of political uncertainty surrounding the acting authority,' he said. 'True colors' At the heart of the current row is the composition of the Constitutional Court, which will decide whether to uphold parliament's decision to impeach Yoon and now Han. The court is currently short of three judges. While it can go ahead with its six members on the bench, a single dissenting vote would reinstate Yoon. The opposition wanted Han to approve three more nominees to fill the nine-member bench, which he had refused to do, leaving both sides in deadlock. Han's refusal to formally appoint the three judges 'revealed his true colors,' said Democratic Party lawmaker Jo Seoung-lae. The refusal 'is a direct challenge to the Constitution and the law,' said Jo. They sought to impeach Han to 'restore constitutional order and stabilize state affairs.' Han had said he wanted his PPP and the opposition to reach a compromise on the nominees. 'The consistent principle embedded in our constitution and laws is to refrain from exercising significant exclusive presidential powers, including the appointment of constitutional institutions,' Han argued. 'A consensus between the ruling and opposition parties in the National Assembly, representing the people, must first be reached,' the 75-year-old career bureaucrat said. The Constitutional Court held its first preliminary hearing on the validity of Yoon's impeachment on Friday despite the latest controversy. Yoon's legal team said they would attend a preparatory hearing of the court's impeachment trial at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT). The South Korean won plummeted to 1480.2 per U.S. dollar on Friday morning, marking its lowest level in nearly 16 years. The won earlier plunged to a two-year low against the dollar after the declaration of martial law as investors, already concerned about the state of Asia's number four economy, shunned the currency. Police said on Friday that they had begun a raid on a presidential safe house and were collecting footage from nearby security cameras as part of the martial law probe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-lawmakers-impeach-acting-president-han-duck-soo/7915650.html	2024-12-27T01:53:26-08:00	
Japan approves record budget for aging population, defense	TOKYO — Japan's government on Friday approved a record budget for the next fiscal year, ramping up spending on social welfare as the population ages, and defense to tackle regional threats. The $730 billion budget for the year from April 2025, approved by the Cabinet, includes $55 billion in defense spending. It also includes social security spending of around 38.3 trillion yen -- up from 37.7 trillion the previous year. The defense ministry said in a briefing document that Japan was facing its 'toughest and most complex security environment' since World War II, repeating a warning from Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba. Japan has a pacifist post-war constitution, which limits its military capacity to ostensibly defensive measures. But it updated key security and defense policies in 2022, explicitly outlining the challenge posed by China, and committed to double its defense spending to the NATO standard of 2% of GDP by 2027. The $55 billion approved Friday will help pay for measures to help attract recruits to Japan's Self-Defense Forces, and to improve relations between the U.S. and Japanese militaries with locals in Okinawa. It will also go towards a system to collect satellite information on ballistic missiles, such as those fired by North Korea, and the movement of vessels in waters around Japan, including territories disputed with China. 'Strengthening our defense capabilities is something we're actively working on,' Ishiba said at an event organized by the Yomiuri newspaper on Thursday. 'Now matter how great our military tanks or vehicles are, it's pointless if we don't have enough people to move them,' said the prime minister, who has pledged to fix a shortage of new troops. Another challenge facing the country is its ageing population caused by chronically low birth rates and a cautious approach to immigration. Japan is one of the world's oldest societies, and this year the proportion of its people aged 65 or overreached a record 29.3%. The draft budget needs to be approved by the parliament, and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party and its smaller coalition partner Komeito will need cooperation from opposition parties, having lost their majority in an October snap election. Ishiba has stayed on as prime minister despite leading the coalition to its worst general election result in 15 years. A vote to elect parliament's upper house will be held in summer 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-approves-record-budget-for-aging-population-defense/7915608.html	2024-12-26T22:21:33-08:00	
Seoul: North Korean soldier captured in Russia-Ukraine war	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's spy agency said Friday it had confirmed that a North Korean soldier sent to back Russia's war against Ukraine had been captured by Ukrainian forces. Pyongyang has deployed thousands of troops to reinforce Russian troops, including in the Kursk border region where Ukraine mounted a shock border incursion in August. 'Through real-time information sharing with an allied country's intelligence agency, it has been confirmed that one injured North Korean soldier has been captured,' South Korea's National Intelligence Service said in a statement. The soldier was captured by the Ukrainian army, an intelligence source told AFP, adding that the location where he was seized was unknown. The first confirmation of the capture of a North Korean soldier came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Monday that nearly 3,000 North Korean soldiers had been 'killed or wounded' so far. Seoul's Joint Chiefs of Staff also said Monday that more than 1,000 North Korean soldiers have been killed or wounded. The JCS had also said that Pyongyang is reportedly 'preparing for the rotation or additional deployment of soldiers' and supplying '240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery' to the Russian army.

Richard Parsons, prominent Black executive at Time Warner, Citigroup, dies at 76	NEW YORK — Richard Parsons, one of corporate America's most prominent Black executives who held top posts at Time Warner and Citigroup, died Thursday. He was 76. Parsons, who died at his Manhattan home, was diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2015 and cited 'unanticipated complications' from the disease for cutting back on work a few years later. The financial services company Lazard, where Parsons was a longtime board member, confirmed his death. David Zaslav, the president and CEO of Time Warner successor Warner Bros. Discovery, remembered Parsons as a 'great mentor and friend' and a 'tough and brilliant negotiator, always looking to create something where both sides win.' 'All who got a chance to work with him and know him saw that unusual combination of great leadership with integrity and kindness,' Zaslav said, calling him 'one of the great problem solvers this industry has ever seen.' Parsons' friend Ronald Lauder told The New York Times that the cause of death was cancer. Parsons stepped down on December 3 from the boards of Lazard and Lauder's company, Estee Lauder, citing health reasons. He had been on Estee Lauder's board for 25 years. Parsons, a Brooklyn native who started college at 16, was named chairman of Citigroup in 2009, one month after leaving Time Warner Inc., where he helped restore the company's stature following its much-maligned acquisition by internet provider America Online Inc. He steered Citigroup back to profit after financial turmoil from the subprime mortgage crisis, which upended the economy in 2007 and 2008. Parsons was named to the board of CBS in September 2018 but resigned a month later because of illness. 'Dick's storied career embodied the finest traditions of American business leadership,' Lazard said in a statement. The company, where Parsons was a board member from 2012 until this month, praised his 'unmistakable intelligence and his irresistible warmth.' 'Dick was more than an iconic leader in Lazard's history — he was a testament to how wisdom, warmth, and unwavering judgment could shape not just companies, but people's lives,' the company said. 'His legacy lives on in the countless leaders he counseled, the institutions he renewed, and the doors he opened for others.' Parsons was known as a skilled negotiator, a diplomat and a crisis manager. Although he was with Time Warner through its difficulties with AOL, he earned respect for the company and rebuilt its relations with Wall Street. He streamlined Time Warner's structure, pared debt and sold Warner Music Group and a book publishing division. He also fended off a challenge from activist investor Carl Icahn in 2006 to break up the company and helped Time Warner reach settlements with investors and regulators over questionable accounting practices at AOL. Parsons joined Time Warner as president in 1995 after serving as chairman and chief executive of Dime Bancorp Inc., one of the largest U.S. thrift institutions. In 2001, after AOL used its fortunes as the leading provider of internet access in the U.S. to buy Time Warner for $106 billion in stock, Parsons became co-chief operating officer with AOL executive Robert Pittman. Parsons became CEO in 2002 and was named chairman the following year, replacing AOL founder Steve Case, who had also championed the combination. The newly formed company's internet division quickly became a drag on Time Warner. The promised synergies between traditional and new media never materialized. AOL began seeing a reduction in subscribers in 2002 as Americans replaced dial-up connections with broadband from cable TV and phone companies. Parsons stepped down as CEO in 2007 and as chairman in 2008. A year later AOL split from Time Warner and began trading as a separate company. A board member of Citigroup and its predecessor, Citibank, since 1996, Parsons was named chairman in 2009 at a time of turmoil for the financial institution. Citigroup had suffered five straight quarters of losses and received $45 billion in government aid. Its board had been criticized for allowing the bank to invest so heavily in the risky housing market.

Bird flu virus shows mutations in first severe human case in US, agency says	The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday its analysis of samples from the first severe case of bird flu in the country last week showed mutations not seen in samples from an infected backyard flock on the patient's property. The CDC said the patient's sample showed mutations in the hemagglutinin (HA) gene, the part of the virus that plays a key role in it attaching to host cells. The health body said the risk to the public from the outbreak has not changed and remains low. Last week, the United States reported its first severe case of the virus, in a Louisiana resident above the age of 65, who was suffering from severe respiratory illness. The patient was infected with the D1.1 genotype of the virus that was recently detected in wild birds and poultry in the United States, and not the B3.13 genotype detected in dairy cows, human cases and some poultry in multiple states. The mutations seen in the patient are rare but have been reported in some cases in other countries and most often during severe infections. One of the mutations was also seen in another severe case from British Columbia, Canada. No transmission from the patient in Louisiana to other persons has been identified, the CDC said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bird-flu-virus-shows-mutations-in-first-severe-human-case-in-us-agency-says/7915550.html	2024-12-26T18:05:19-08:00	
New Syrian authorities arrest official from notorious prison, war monitor says	Syria's new authorities on Thursday arrested a military justice official from the government of ousted President Bashar al-Assad. The arrest of Mohammed Kanjo Hassan was confirmed by the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights one day after deadly clashes erupted in the coastal province of Tartus, an Assad stronghold, where gunmen sought to protect him. Twenty members of Kanjo Hassan's associates were also arrested. Kanjo Hassan, who issued sentences, including death sentences, for detainees at the Saydnaya prison, is the highest-ranking official whose arrest has been announced since Assad was ousted on Dec. 8. Kanjo Hassan ran Syria's military field court from 2011-14, the first three years of the war that began with Assad's crackdown on Arab Spring-inspired democracy protests, Agence France-Presse reported, citing Diab Serriya, co-founder of the Association of Detainees and Missing Persons of Saydnaya Prison. Serriya said Kanjo Hassan had sentenced thousands of people to death in 'trials that lasted minutes.' His group estimates 30,000 people had been detained at the prison since 2011, and 6,000 were released. The rest are missing, AFP reported. The arrest was part of an operation launched Thursday against militias aligned with Assad, according to state news agency SANA. The reports said that the operation was focused on the western province of Tartus, and that some militia members had been killed. The development came a day after pro-Assad fighters killed 14 members of the rebel group that led the offensive that pushed Assad from power. Syria's new interior minister said on Telegram that 10 other people were wounded in what he called an 'ambush,' and he vowed to crack down on anyone who undermined Syria's security. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rebel fighters were attacked while trying to arrest Kanjo Hassan. Syrian refugees U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said Thursday that more than 50,000 refugees have returned to Syria during the past three weeks, with the rate of return slowly increasing. 'Material conditions inside Syria remain dire — more humanitarian and recovery assistance must be delivered to returnees and all those in need,' Grandi said. By comparison, the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said earlier this month that it verified the return of 34,000 Syrian refugees during the first eight months of this year. More than 13 years of civil war prompted about 5 million people to flee the country, while 7 million others were displaced within Syria. More than half of the refugees went to Turkey, while most of the others fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. A UNHCR report earlier this month said that while many of the refugees are interested in returning to Syria, many are choosing to wait for now and evaluate the security situation and political stabilization. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-syrian-authorities-arrest-official-from-notorious-prison-war-monitor-says/7915525.html	2024-12-26T17:17:34-08:00	
Moldova backs defense strategy calling for increased spending	CHISINAU, MOLDOVA — The parliament in ex-Soviet Moldova, controlled by pro-Western lawmakers, approved a 10-year defense strategy on Thursday calling for increased military spending as part of a plan to join the European Union. The chamber's pro-Russian opposition ridiculed the document as pointlessly directed against Moscow in view of Moldova's small land mass and armed forces. The document, presented by Defense Minister Anatolie Nosatii, aims to boost military spending by 2030 to 1% of gross domestic product, with figures showing increases already being put into place. 'The first step to implementing this was taken after the war in Ukraine started, by increasing budget resources for defense to 0.39% in 2022 and 0.55% in 2023,' the document said. One of Europe's poorest countries, lying between Ukraine and EU member Romania, Moldova is a candidate to join the EU, with a membership date set for 2030. It is not considering joining the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) as the country's neutral status is set down in its constitution. The document says Moldova's neutral status requires it to boost partnerships with different countries and international organizations to strengthen its national defense. Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 has jolted Moldova as drone fragments land on its territory and missiles aimed at Ukrainian targets pass through its airspace. Pro-Western President Maia Sandu, reelected to a second term last month, though by a smaller margin than anticipated, has accused Russia of trying to unseat her government. Members of the pro-Moscow Socialist Party dismissed the document as meaningless. 'If, God forbid, we are subject to an attack from the direction of the Russian Federation, how long do you think Moldova will resist such aggression?' Socialist member Adrian Albu asked the minister. The document cites risks of the Ukraine conflict spreading, particularly around the Black Sea port of Odesa close to Moldova's border.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldova-backs-defense-strategy-calling-for-increased-spending/7915507.html	2024-12-26T16:56:04-08:00	
US Congress fails to extend North Korean Human Rights Act	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Congress once again failed to pass a bipartisan bill to reauthorize the North Korean Human Rights Act, or NKHRA, painting a bleak picture for the future of the measure originally adopted by Congress and signed by President George W. Bush in 2004 to ensure the U.S. continues to promote basic freedoms of speech, press and religion in North Korea. Last Friday, the Congress ended its 118th session at midnight without the Senate approving the extension of the NKHRA, which expired at the end of September 2022. The bill to extend the NKHRA was not even brought to the floor at the Senate this year, as the lawmakers were more focused on other issues, including averting a government shutdown. The bill called for measures such as reuniting Korean Americans with their families in North Korea, appointing a special envoy for North Korean human rights issues and supporting U.S. broadcasting efforts in North Korea. The 119th U.S. Congress starts next year, and the NKHRA reauthorization bill will have to be reintroduced at the new session and again go through a process of discussion, deliberation, changes and eventually voting. Lawmakers vow to try again It marks the first time since the NKHRA, became law that the reenactment bill has been dead for more than two years. Congress reapproved the measure three times, in 2008, 2012 and 2018. Lawmakers vowed to work toward the reenactment of the NKHRA during the next congressional session. Representative Young Kim, who chairs the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific, said she was 'extremely disappointed that the Senate failed to take up the North Korean Human Rights Reauthorization Act.' The House passed the bill last month. 'Kim Jong Un subjects his own people to gross human rights abuses as he grows his nuclear arsenal, and the Senate is turning a blind eye to North Korean aggression by failing to pass this bill,' Kim said in an emailed statement to VOA Korean on Monday. 'This remains a top priority of mine,' she stressed. 'I will keep fighting to get this across the finish line to counter North Korea and promote U.S. leadership and values around the world.' The office of Representative Ami Bera, ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Indo-Pacific, said in an emailed statement to VOA Korean that Bera 'looks forward to working with his Senate colleagues to pass this bipartisan legislation in the 119th Congress.' Kim and Bera led the bill in the House, while senators Marco Rubio and Tim Kaine introduced the Senate version of the bill. VOA Korean reached out to Rubio's and Kaine's offices for comments but did not receive a reply. VOA Korean also sought comment from the Permanent Mission of North Korea to the United Nations, but did not receive a response. Competing priorities Human rights experts in Washington said getting the NKHRA passed in Congress is challenging because North Korean human rights must compete with other seemingly more urgent issues. 'It's very hard to — when you're competing with Gaza and Ukraine — to get people to focus on what's going on,' said Robert King, who served as special envoy for North Korea human rights issues at the U.S. State Department from November 2009 to January 2017. 'The effort continues, and people are still concerned, and people still reflect the views that North Korea needs to make progress on human rights, but there's a lot of competition. There are a lot of other issues and concerns that are also important,' King told VOA Korean on Tuesday by phone, adding that he doesn't see any skepticism among U.S. lawmakers about the effectiveness of the NKHRA. Greg Scarlatoiu, president of the Washington-based Committee for Human Rights in North Korea, told VOA Korean in a Zoom interview Tuesday that the two-year absence of the NKHRA is 'a matter of prioritizing other crises.' Scarlatoiu emphasized that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's monolithic power and pursuit of nuclear weapons have come at the cost of North Korean people's human rights. 'By means of oppressing and exploiting its own people at home and abroad, there is a clear nexus between human rights violations and the security challenges that North Korea poses to the world,' he said. Scarlatoiu also pointed out that the recent deployment of North Korean soldiers in Russia is clear evidence of the Kim regime's violation of human rights. 'Now, as unbelievable as that might have sounded two years ago, it poses a security threat to Europe, so this is a very, very urgent issue for the Congress,' he said. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday there are indications that North Korea is preparing to send more troops and weapons to support Russia's war effort in Ukraine. North Korea so far has sent about 12,000 troops to Russia, according to South Korea, the United States and Ukraine. North Korean defectors say Pyongyang has likely kept the deployment of that nation's soldiers secret from its own people, including the soldiers' families. A State Department spokesperson declined to comment in response to VOA Korean's inquiry about Congress' failure to pass the bill. 'As a general matter, we do not comment on pending legislation,' the spokesperson said in an emailed statement. The State Department maintains, however, that North Korea is one of the most repressive regimes in the world. 'The DPRK [North Korea] is among the most repressive authoritarian states in the world. Its human rights situation is deplorable,' a State Department spokesperson said in an emailed statement to VOA Korean on October 15, after North Korea criticized the U.S. in its annual Universal Periodic Review, a process through which each United Nations member state undergoes a peer review of its human rights records.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-congress-fails-to-extend-north-korean-human-rights-act/7915242.html	2024-12-26T16:39:03-08:00

US says it pushed retraction of famine warning for north Gaza	WASHINGTON — A lead organization monitoring for food crises around the world withdrew a new report this week warning of imminent famine in north Gaza under what it called Israel's 'near-total blockade,' after the U.S. asked for its retraction, U.S. officials told The Associated Press. The move follows public criticism of the report from the U.S. ambassador to Israel. The rare public dispute drew accusations from prominent aid and human-rights figures that the work of the U.S.-funded Famine Early Warning System Network, meant to reflect the data-driven analysis of unbiased international experts, has been tainted by politics. A declaration of famine would be a great embarrassment for Israel, which has insisted that its 15-month war in Gaza is aimed against the Hamas militant group and not against its civilian population. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Jacob Lew earlier this week called the warning by the internationally recognized group inaccurate and irresponsible. Lew and the U.S. Agency for International Development, which funds the monitoring group, both said the findings failed to properly account for rapidly changing circumstances in north Gaza. Humanitarian and human rights officials expressed fear of U.S. political interference in the world's monitoring system for famines. The U.S. Embassy in Israel and the State Department declined comment. FEWS officials did not respond to questions. 'We work day and night with the U.N. and our Israeli partners to meet humanitarian needs — which are great — and relying on inaccurate data is irresponsible,' Lew said Tuesday. USAID confirmed to the AP that it had asked the famine-monitoring organization to withdraw its stepped-up warning issued in a report dated Monday. The report did not appear among the top updates on the group's website Thursday, but the link to it remained active. The dispute points in part to the difficulty of assessing the extent of starvation in largely isolated northern Gaza. Thousands in recent weeks have fled an intensified Israeli military crackdown that aid groups say has allowed delivery of only a dozen trucks of food and water since roughly October. FEWS Net said in its withdrawn report that unless Israel changes its policy, it expects the number of people dying of starvation and related ailments in north Gaza to reach between two and 15 per day sometime between January and March. The internationally recognized mortality threshold for famine is two or more deaths a day per 10,000 people. FEWS was created by the U.S. development agency in the 1980s and is still funded by it. FEWS is intended to provide independent, neutral and data-driven assessments of hunger crises, including in war zones. Its findings help guide decisions on aid by the U.S. and other governments and agencies around the world. A spokesperson for Israel's Foreign Ministry, Oren Marmorstein, welcomed the U.S. ambassador's public challenge of the famine warning. 'FEWS NET - Stop spreading these lies!' Marmorstein wrote on X. In challenging the findings publicly, the U.S. ambassador 'leveraged his political power to undermine the work of this expert agency,' said Scott Paul, a senior manager at the Oxfam America humanitarian nonprofit. Paul stressed that he was not weighing in on the accuracy of the data or methodology of the report. 'The whole point of creating FEWS is to have a group of experts make assessments about imminent famine that are untainted by political considerations,' said Kenneth Roth, former executive director of Human Rights Watch and now a visiting professor in international affairs at Princeton University. 'It sure looks like USAID is allowing political considerations — the Biden administration's worry about funding Israel's starvation strategy — to interfere.' Israel says the vast majority of the area's residents have fled and relocated to Gaza City, where most aid destined for the north is delivered. Lew, the U.S. ambassador, said the famine warning was based on 'outdated and inaccurate' data. He pointed to uncertainty over how many of the 65,000-75,000 people remaining in northern Gaza had fled in recent weeks, saying that skewed the findings. FEWS said in its report that its famine assessment holds even if as few as 10,000 people remain. Roth criticized the U.S. challenge of the report in light of the gravity of the crisis there. 'This quibbling over the number of people desperate for food seems a politicized diversion from the fact that the Israeli government is blocking virtually all food from getting in,' he said, adding that 'the Biden administration seems to be closing its eyes to that reality, but putting its head in the sand won't feed anyone.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-it-pushed-retraction-of-famine-warning-for-north-gaza-/7915491.html	2024-12-26T16:12:17-08:00

Eritrean, Somali leaders discuss stability amid regional tensions	WASHINGTON — President Isaias Afwerki of Eritrea and President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia held extensive discussions at the State House in Asmara, Eritrea, on Wednesday, focusing on the consolidation of bilateral ties and addressing regional and international issues of mutual concern. A statement from the Eritrean Foreign Ministry said the two leaders underlined the importance of Somalia's stability for the entire Horn of Africa region. 'Securing and [guaranteeing] Somalia's stability is pivotal for enduring regional peace and stability. In this respect, the two leaders discussed, in greater depth, salient agendas that promote achievement of the desired objective,' the statement said. Leaders meet for summit In October, the leaders of Egypt, Eritrea and Somalia met for a three-way summit in Asmara against a backdrop of heightened tensions in the Horn of Africa region between Somalia and Ethiopia. The October meeting, in which the leaders aligned to sign an agreement covering defense, security, and diplomatic and political cooperation, followed concerns about security and stability that resulted from a controversial deal Ethiopia signed in January with the breakaway Somali region of Somaliland. That deal, if enacted, would give Ethiopia long-sought access to the Red Sea. Somali diplomats, who requested anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the matter, told VOA that the two leaders also discussed on Dec. 11 an Ethiopia-Somalia agreement in Ankara that aimed at ending diplomatic tensions between the neighboring countries. They said they have an agreement in principle but are working on technicalities. According to the Eritrean Foreign Ministry, during their talks on Wednesday, Isaias said that it was necessary for the region to overcome external interventions that often exacerbate conflicts, stressing that local challenges must be addressed internally. 'President Isaias elaborated on the imperative for the region to extricate itself from external interventions that often advance agendas of incubating and fomenting conflict and chaos in the region. In the event, it is critical for the region to address and resolve its own challenges.' In a subsequent statement to the Eritrean Press, Somali's president expressed his appreciation for Eritrea's contributions in the ongoing efforts for training Somalia's National Army and security institutions. 'The support of Eritrea to Somalia is vital for the stability of Somalia as well as the Horn of Africa region. Somalia can learn from Eritrea's vast experiences in the efforts to foster viable and robust partnerships,' Mohamud said. Leaders reaffirm objectives The two leaders in a statement reaffirmed the objectives laid out in the October Tripartite Summit agreement between Eritrea, Somalia and Egypt, aimed at enhancing cooperation and promoting stability in the region. The discussions come against the backdrop of Egypt's commitment to contribute troops to the African Union Somalia peacekeeping mission, highlighting the growing collaboration between Somalia and Egypt amid regional tensions, particularly concerning Ethiopia's plans to get sea access in Somaliland. Eritrea has been training thousands of Somalia forces for at least four years. Most of the military has received regular and specialized training, including the naval force, as well as mechanized units. Mohamud's visit was the eighth since his reelection in May 2022 and the fourth this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eritrean-somali-leaders-discuss-stability-amid-regional-tensions/7915213.html	2024-12-26T15:50:17-08:00

Panama president rules out talks with Trump over canal threat	PANAMA CITY, PANAMA — Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino on Thursday ruled out negotiations with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump over control of the Panama Canal, denying that China was interfering in its operation. Mulino also rejected the possibility of reducing tolls for U.S. vessels in response to Trump's threat to demand control of the vital waterway connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans be returned to Washington. 'There's nothing to talk about,' Mulino said at a press conference. 'The canal is Panamanian and belongs to Panamanians. There's no possibility of opening any kind of conversation around this reality, which has cost the country blood, sweat and tears,' he added. The canal, inaugurated in 1914, was built by the United States but handed to Panama on December 31, 1999, under treaties signed some two decades earlier by then-U.S. President Jimmy Carter and Panamanian nationalist leader Omar Torrijos. Trump on Saturday slammed what he called 'ridiculous' fees for U.S. ships passing through the canal and hinted at China's growing influence. 'It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else,' Trump said in a post on his Truth Social platform. 'We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!' If Panama could not ensure 'the secure, efficient and reliable operation' of the channel, 'then we will demand that the Panama Canal be No Chinese returned to us, in full, and without question,' he said. US accounts for 74% of canal cargo An estimated 5% of global maritime traffic passes through the Panama Canal, which allows ships traveling between Asia and the U.S. East Coast to avoid the long, hazardous route around the southern tip of South America. The United States is its main user, accounting for 74% of cargo, followed by China with 21%. Mulino said the canal's usage fees were 'not set at the whim of the president or the administrator' of the interoceanic waterway, but under a long-established 'public and open process.' 'There is absolutely no Chinese interference or participation in anything to do with the Panama Canal,' Mulino said. Trump claims Chinese operate canal On Wednesday, Trump alleged on Truth Social, without evidence, that Chinese soldiers were 'lovingly, but illegally, operating the Panama Canal.' Mulino denied that allegation. 'There are no Chinese soldiers in the canal, for the love of God,' he said. Panama established diplomatic relations with China in 2017, after breaking off ties with Taiwan — a decision criticized by Trump's first administration. On Tuesday, dozens of demonstrators gathered outside the U.S. embassy in Panama City and chanted 'Trump, animal, leave the canal alone' and burned an image of the incoming U.S. president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/panama-president-rules-out-talks-with-trump-over-canal-threat-/7915162.html	2024-12-26T15:03:10-08:00	
Organizers say 2 sailors died in Sydney-to-Hobart yacht race	sydney — Organizers said Friday that two Sydney-to-Hobart sailors died at sea amid wild weather that forced many retirements, including the favorite to finish first, Master Lock Comanche. The race will proceed as the fleet continues its passage to Constitution Dock in Hobart, with the first boats expected to arrive later on Friday or early Saturday morning. The race is 628 nautical miles (722 miles, 1,160 kilometers) long. The Cruising Yacht Club of Australia in Sydney, which administers the yacht race, said that one sailor each on entrants Flying Fish Arctos and Bowline were killed after being struck by the boom, a large horizontal pole at the bottom of the sail. The incident aboard Flying Fish Arctos occurred around 30 nautical miles east-southeast of Ulladulla on the New South Wales south coast. Crew members attempted CPR but could not revive their teammate. The crew member aboard Bowline was struck approximately 30 nautical miles east-northeast of Batemans Bay and fell unconscious, with CPR also unsuccessful. A police vessel was escorting Bowline to Batemans Bay, where she was expected to arrive later Friday morning. 'As these incidents are being dealt with by the Water Police and all family members are yet to be contacted, we cannot provide further details at this stage,' the CYCA said in a statement. 'Our thoughts are with the crews, family and friends of the deceased.' Flying Fish Arctos, a New South Wales-based 50-footer, has contested 17 previous Hobarts since being built in 2001. The boat was designed for around-the-world sailing and is currently used by Flying Fish, a sailing school that operates in Mosman, a suburb on Sydney's north shore. The deaths came 26 years after six sailors were killed in storms during the 1998 running of the race, which triggered a state coronial inquest and mass reforms to the safety protocols that govern the race. The first all-Filipino crew of 15 sailors was entered in the 2024 race, but was among about 15 retirements because of weather. With veteran sailor Ernesto Echauz at the helm, Centennial 7 was one of six international entrants and included sailors from the Philippine national team and the Philippine navy. Last year, LawConnect was first to cross the finish line after holding off defending champion Comanche by less than a minute in an exciting finish between the super maxis. LawConnect, which was runner-up in the previous three editions of the race, finished in 1 day, 19 hours, 3 minutes, 58 seconds. Comanche's time was 1 day, 19 hours, 4 minutes, 49 seconds — a margin of just 51 seconds. It was the second-closest finish in Sydney-to-Hobart history after Condor of Bermuda beat Apollo by seven seconds in 1982. Comanche holds the race record of 1 day, 9 hours, 15 minutes, 24 seconds, set when it won in 2017. LawConnect, which led out of Sydney Harbor, was leading the 2024 race but still had 400 nautical miles before reaching Hobart, indicating an overnight finish. Celestial V70 was in second place, about 10 nautical miles behind LawConnect.	https://www.voanews.com/a/organizers-say-two-sailors-have-died-in-sydney-to-hobart-yacht-race/7915177.html	2024-12-26T14:26:57-08:00	
Russian defense fire likely caused Azerbaijan plane crash, experts say	Aviation experts said Thursday that Russian air defense fire was likely responsible for the Azerbaijani plane crash the day before that killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured. Azerbaijan Airlines' Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijan's capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons still unclear and crashed while trying to land in Aktau, Kazakhstan, after flying east across the Caspian Sea. The plane went down about 3 kilometers from Aktau. Cellphone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground and exploding in a fireball. Other footage showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rest of the aircraft lying upside down in the grass. Azerbaijan mourned the crash victims with national flags at half-staff across the country on Thursday. Traffic stopped at noon, and signals sounded from ships and trains as it observed a nationwide moment of silence. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that it was too soon to speculate on the reasons behind the crash, but he said that the weather forced the plane to change from its planned course. 'The information provided to me is that the plane changed its course between Baku and Grozny due to worsening weather conditions and headed to Aktau airport, where it crashed upon landing,' he said. Russia's civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said that preliminary information indicated that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. As the official crash investigation started, some experts alleged that holes seen in the plane's tail section could indicate that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the provincial capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country's North Caucasus. An official in Chechnya said another drone attack on the region was fended off Wednesday, although federal authorities didn't report it. Mark Zee of OPSGroup, which monitors the world's airspace and airports for risks, said that analysis of the images of fragments of the crashed plane indicate that it was almost certainly hit by a surface-to-air missile, or SAM. 'Much more to investigate, but at high level we'd put the probability of it being a SAM attack on the aircraft at being well into the 90 to 99% bracket,' he said. Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security firm based in the United Kingdom, warned its clients that the 'Azerbaijan Airlines flight was likely shot down by a Russian military air defense system.' Osprey provides analysis for carriers still flying into Russia after Western airlines halted their flights during the war. Osprey CEO Andrew Nicholson said that the company had issued more than 200 alerts regarding drone attacks and air defense systems in Russia during the war. 'This incident is a stark reminder of why we do what we do,' Nicholson wrote online. 'It is painful to know that despite our efforts, lives were lost in a way that could have been avoided.' Yan Matveyev, an independent Russian military expert, noted that images of the crashed plane's tail reveal damage compatible with shrapnel from small surface-to-air missiles, such as the Pantsyr-S1 air defense system. 'It looks like the tail section of the plane was damaged by some missile fragments,' he said. Matveyev added that it remains unclear why the pilots decided to fly hundreds of miles east across the Caspian Sea instead of trying to land at a closer airport in Russia after the plane was hit. 'Perhaps some of the plane's systems kept working for some time and the crew believed that they could make it and land normally,' Matveyev said, adding that the crew could also have faced restrictions on landing at another venue in Russia. Caliber, an Azerbaijani news website with good government connections, also claimed that the airliner was fired upon by a Russian Pantsyr-S air defense system as it was approaching Grozny. It questioned why Russian authorities failed to close the airport despite the apparent drone raid in the area. Khamzat Kadyrov, head of Chechnya's Security Council, said that air defenses downed drones attacking the region on Wednesday. Caliber also wondered why Russian authorities didn't allow the plane to make an emergency landing in Grozny or other Russian airports nearby after it was hit. Asked about the claims that the plane had been fired upon by air defense weapons, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters that 'it would be wrong to make hypotheses before investigators make their verdict.' Kazakhstan's parliamentary speaker, Maulen Ashimbayev, also warned against rushing to conclusions based on pictures of the plane's fragments, describing the allegations of air defense fire as unfounded and unethical. Other officials in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have similarly avoided comment on a possible cause of the crash, saying it will be up to investigators to determine it. According to Kazakh officials, those aboard the plane included 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhs and three Kyrgyzstan nationals. Russia's Emergencies Ministry on Thursday flew nine Russian survivors to Moscow for treatment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-defense-fire-likely-caused-azerbaijan-plane-crash-experts-say/7915149.html	2024-12-26T14:12:34-08:00	
Japan seeks better ties with China ahead of second Trump term	Japan and China are seeking to improve relations ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House, but analysts say Beijing’s aggressive military activities across the Indo-Pacific region will make it hard for the sides to reduce longstanding tensions. 'Tokyo does want to have smoother ties with Beijing, given the likely tumultuousness of the U.S.-China relationship and also the global situation more broadly once Trump comes into office,' said Ian Chong, a political scientist at the National University of Singapore. 'However, the basic positions of both countries are too far apart, and as long as Beijing continues to make claims on the East China Sea and is demonstrating its ability to use military force to pursue those ends, it’s difficult for China and Japan to pursue a fundamental reset in bilateral relations,' he told VOA by phone. Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya met with Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi and Chinese Premier Li Qiang in Beijing on Wednesday. Both sides agreed to facilitate a visit by Wang to Japan in 2025 and improve relations on a basic societal level. 'China and Japan should also strengthen people-to-people exchanges, consolidate public support for China-Japan friendship, and properly handle disputes and differences,' Wang said on Wednesday, adding that Tokyo should 'calibrate its strategic perception' and 'pursue a positive policy toward China.' While Beijing focused largely on the positive aspect of the meeting, Iwaya reiterated Tokyo’s concerns about the increased Chinese military activities in areas near Japan and Japanese citizens’ safety in China during his meeting with Wang. Iwaya 'expressed Japan's serious concerns about the situation in the East China Sea, including the situation surrounding the Senkaku Islands, and the intensification of Chinese military activities,' the Japanese foreign ministry said in a statement released on Wednesday. Despite these concerns, Iwaya and Wang agreed to hold a high-level economic dialogue and organize the Japan-China Security Dialogue to improve communication over security issues. Experts say Japan believes it can extract 'some positive goods' from China because of Beijing’s increasing concern about the incoming Trump administration. 'Tokyo sees the Trump administration as likely being very difficult on China in terms of tariffs and security issues, and they understand they may have a little bit more leverage now,' Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo's International Christian University, told VOA by phone. He said because China remains committed to reshaping the security environment in its surrounding region, Japan is focusing on securing short-term gains in improving ties rather than resetting the relationship. 'They believe there might be an opportunity to extract some positive goods from the Chinese, whether it’s business or increasing the flows of people between the two,' Nagy added. Countries dispute Fukushima discharge One of the main disputes between China and Japan is Tokyo’s discharge of treated radioactive wastewater from the damaged Fukushima nuclear power plant. Beijing has repeatedly opposed Tokyo’s move and imposed bans on the import of Japanese seafood. While both governments agreed on steps that would allow stakeholders like China to independently sample the treated waters in September, Wang and Iwaya’s discussion on the topic didn’t show signs of Beijing’s import ban being eased. 'Wang reiterated China's opposition to Japan's ocean discharge of Fukushima nuclear-contaminated water, stressing that Japan should fulfill its international obligations and commitments to China, establish a long-term international monitoring mechanism, and allow China to sample and test independently,' Chinese state-run tabloid Global Times reported on Wednesday. Despite China's continuation of the ban on Japanese seafood, Nagy said China will still try to seize this chance to strengthen relations with Japan and possibly weaken Washington-Tokyo ties. 'The Chinese government has a long track record of using economic incentives to drive a wedge between Washington and Tokyo, but since Japan has seen these strategies for decades and the Chinese economy is in decline, whether Beijing’s efforts can translate into sustainable changes is a different story,' he told VOA. Japan will prioritize US ties, says political scientist While Japan seeks to smooth ties with China, Chong in Singapore said the relationship with the U.S. will still be Tokyo’s priority once Trump returns to the White House in January. 'Tokyo will align [with the U.S.] as much as it can because the Japanese economy is very much tied with the U.S. economy,' he told VOA. During a press conference on Tuesday, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said he wanted Japan to bolster its alliance with the U.S. 'I think it's important to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance even further ... and share a common understanding of the situation in northeast Asia,' he said. Although the relationship with the U.S. remains a priority for Japan, Nagy said Tokyo will still try to influence how U.S.-China competition develops under the second Trump administration. 'Japan will try to convey to Washington that their relationship with China isn’t simple because they can’t simply cut off the relations and over-securitize the relationship since Beijing remains a neighbor that is not going away,' he told VOA. 'When Tokyo engages with the U.S., it’s a relationship of cooperation, coordination, and an attempt to influence the decision-making process in Washington so that they don’t take an over-securitized approach to the competition with China,' Nagy added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-seeks-better-ties-with-china-ahead-of-second-trump-term/7915120.html	2024-12-26T13:54:34-08:00	
Amid divisions, Kurds pursue unified representation in post-Assad Syria	WASHINGTON — Despite longstanding divisions, Kurdish political leaders and analysts say Syrian Kurdish groups are seeking a unified delegation to represent their interests in Damascus in negotiations with Syria’s new authorities. Since 2012, northeast Syria’s Kurdish region has been under the control of forces affiliated with the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, a key U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State terror group. The region is predominantly governed by the Democratic Union Party, or PYD, whose military arm forms the backbone of the SDF. For its part, Turkey views all these groups as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party, or PKK, which is designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Turkey, a major actor in post-Assad Syria, has pledged to eliminate these Kurdish groups if they refuse to disarm. The Kurdish National Council, or ENKS, is another coalition of Kurdish parties in Syria that have opposed the PYD’s de facto rule in the northeast. The ENKS has ties with Turkey and the Kurdistan Democratic Party, the ruling party in Iraqi Kurdistan. This week, ENKS and SDF held a meeting attended by officials from the U.S.-led coalition against IS. The meeting was 'to discuss the formation of a unified Kurdish position within the framework of the new Syria,' according to a joint statement. 'The sides agreed on the importance of urgently continuing meetings to resolve contentious issues.' Sulaiman Oso, the ENKS president who attended the meeting on Monday, said the discussion between the two sides was transparent. 'This was our first meeting with SDF commander Mazloum Abdi in four years,' he told VOA. 'We were clear and transparent about our demands, including an end to arrests of our members and the burning of our offices,' he added, referring to recent incidents in which ENKS members have been targeted by local security forces. Oso said that trust between the two sides has significantly eroded in recent years. 'We cannot go to Damascus with a unified delegation if these internal matters aren’t resolved first,' he said, adding that the U.S., U.K. and France are pushing both Kurdish sides to reach an agreement soon. None of these countries has publicly commented on their involvement in supporting intra-Kurdish dialogue in Syria. However, since Bashar al-Assad’s fall on Dec. 8, U.S., French and British officials have highlighted the need to safeguard the rights of Syria’s ethnic and religious minorities, including the Kurds. Saleh Muslim, a senior PYD official, emphasized the importance of forming a unified Kurdish delegation that includes Arabs and Christians from northeast Syria to effectively represent the region’s diverse population and their demands. 'The current meetings are still in the consultation stage,' he told VOA. 'Nothing concrete has emerged yet, but the ENKS has already sent representatives to Damascus for discussions.' The ENKS says its representatives are in the capital to hold meetings with community leaders, not with the new authorities, which are dominated by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the rebel group that led the 11-day offensive resulting in Assad’s downfall. The HTS is designated as a terrorist organization by the U.S., although initial meetings have taken place between U.S. diplomats and HTS leaders in Damascus. Oso of ENKS said no current presence should replace a unified Kurdish representation in Damascus. Observers warn that the slow progress between the two Kurdish sides could undermine efforts to establish a Kurdish foothold in Damascus. 'This is a historic moment for Syria,' said Zara Saleh, a Kurdish political analyst in London. 'If the Kurds don’t have a unified and strong representation in Damascus, Kurdish demands could be ignored by the new Islamist authorities, who already view them with suspicion.' HTS officials, including leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, have said that Kurdish rights will be protected in Syria. But in a recent interview with the Saudi news channel al-Hadath, Murhaf Abu Qasra, who was appointed by the HTS as defense minister in Syria’s caretaker government, rejected the concept of federalism, describing it as a means to divide Syria. Syrian Kurdish groups are advocating for federalism as a solution to both their political demands and the broader issues facing the country. But that is something that the SDF, PYD and ENKS have failed to clearly articulate, says analyst Zara Saleh. 'Their political rhetoric expired the moment the Syrian regime fell,' Saleh said. 'Therefore, there is an urgent need to include Kurdish experts, civil society leaders and influential social figures in any delegation heading to Damascus, and the United States, along with other stakeholders, should advocate for this.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/amid-divisions-kurds-pursue-unified-representation-in-post-assad-syria-/7915063.html	2024-12-26T12:41:15-08:00	
Taiwan seeks clarity on Trump team policy amid Chinese pressure	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As the world prepares for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House, Taiwan finds itself sandwiched between Washington and Beijing as it grapples with uncertainties about the outlook of U.S.-Taiwan relations and growing military pressure from China. Trump has already picked several politicians known for their hawkish stances on China as potential nominees for his Cabinet, including Marco Rubio and Mike Waltz, but analysts say the president-elect's comments about Taiwan on the campaign trail and in recent interviews have not offered much clarity about how he might handle one of Washington’s most delicate relationships. 'We don't know if [Trump] means it when he wants to return the United States to a more isolationist position,' said J. Michael Cole, a Taipei-based senior fellow with the Global Taiwan Institute. During an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek in July, Trump said Taiwan should pay the United States for defense and compared U.S. military spending on Taiwan to an insurance policy. 'I know the people very well. Respect them greatly. They did take 100% of our chip business. I think Taiwan should pay us for defense,' he said. In October, Trump pledged to impose additional tariffs on China if Beijing were to 'go into Taiwan.' 'I would say: If you go into Taiwan, I'm sorry to do this, I'm going to tax you, at 150% to 200%,' the President-elect said during an interview with The Wall Street Journal. In his first post-election interview with NBC News on Dec. 8, Trump didn’t publicly say whether the U.S. would militarily defend Taiwan in the event of a Chinese invasion. 'I’d prefer that they don’t do it,' Trump said, adding that he has a 'very good relationship' with Chinese President Xi Jinping and that the two have been communicating since last month’s election. During his time in office, U.S. President Joe Biden has on multiple occasions said his administration would defend Taiwan if it was attacked. Not panicking, but concerned Some Taiwanese residents worry about what they describe as a lack of clarity from the Trump administration. 'I’m slightly concerned about how Trump’s return to the White House might affect relations between the U.S. and Taiwan because he always prioritizes U.S. interests, which makes it hard to predict how his administration might form their Taiwan policies,' Angel Chi, a 28-year-old medical worker, told VOA in a recent interview on the streets of Taipei. Others say while Trump’s position on Taiwan seems uncertain, they do not think his administration will reduce support for Taipei. 'I still have faith in the U.S. democratic system because he can’t decide everything by himself,' Christine Chiu, a 42-year-old accountant, told VOA. The strong bipartisan support for Taiwan in Congress and some potential Trump Cabinet members’ track records on foreign policy could prevent U.S.-Taiwan relations from undergoing major changes during Trump’s second term, experts said. 'I don’t think there is panic in Taipei because we dealt with this situation before and we have confidence in our congressional support in the U.S.,' said Lai I-Chung, president of The Prospect Foundation, a Taiwan-based think tank made up of academics and government officials. 'The mood [in Taiwan] is we will be careful and watchful about the development, but we are not panicking,' he told VOA in an interview in Taipei. Taiwan-US relations In recent weeks, Taiwan’s government has been reaching out to Republican congressional leaders and Trump’s transition team. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te spoke with U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on the phone during his first overseas trip to the Pacific region in early December. On that trip, Lai had stopovers in Hawaii and the U.S. territory of Guam. Additionally, two senior national security officials from Taiwan traveled to the U.S. last week to meet members of Trump’s transition team, hoping to establish ties before next month’s inauguration, Reuters news agency reported last on Dec. 19. Cole said there should be enough 'institutional resistance' in the U.S. government to prevent longstanding policies toward Taiwan from being abruptly altered. During a regular press conference on Dec. 6, China’s Foreign Ministry responded to a question on Lai’s stopover in Guam and Hawaii and said, 'No one should underestimate the firm resolve, will and ability of the Chinese government and people to safeguard sovereignty and territorial integrity.' China’s military pressure campaign As Taiwan tries to deepen its engagement with U.S. officials and the incoming Trump administration, China has been increasing military pressure on the island throughout 2024. Beijing has conducted two blockade-style military exercises around Taiwan since Lai took office in May. Last week, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry said Beijing deployed the largest number of naval and coast guard vessels to regional waters in almost three decades. Apart from military exercises, China has increased pressure on Taiwan through a range of what are called gray zone operations, measures that involve irregular tactics but stop short of combat. China’s use of its coast guard to intimidate and test Taiwan is one example of those gray zone tactics. Beijing has repeatedly sent coast guard vessels to patrol waters near Taiwan’s outlying Kinmen and Matsu islands since February. Kinmen and Matsu are closer to China than they are to the main island of Taiwan. The Prospect Foundation’s Lai said China has some coast guard vessels that are similar in size to naval destroyers, making it harder for Taiwan’s coast guard to respond proportionately. 'It would be difficult for Taiwan to [deploy] naval vessels against the Chinese coast guard, and when Taiwan responds by deploying its coast guard forces, the vessels are smaller ships [while] the Chinese coast guard vessels are as big as navy ships,' he told VOA. Countering China To counter the growing military pressure and gray zone operations from Beijing, Taiwan has incorporated more unscripted, real-combat drills into its annual military exercises. The island has also increased its defense budget in recent years, which is set to reach a new high of $19.74 billion dollars in 2025. This year, Taiwan’s government also established a committee to help strengthen the island’s civil defense capabilities. Cole said Taiwan still faces challenges in that regard. 'There is still quite a bit of resistance not only within the security apparatus and armed forces, which don’t like the idea of involving citizens in defense, the opposition parties have also sought to derail [relevant] plans and fundings,' he told VOA. What may come next depends on Taiwan’s actions and Beijing’s assessment of Trump’s policies toward the island after he takes office in January.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-seeks-clarity-on-trump-administration-policy-amid-chinese-pressure/7915065.html	2024-12-26T12:14:16-08:00	
Nigeria probes Christmas Day airstrike that killed 10	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian authorities in northwest Sokoto state launched a probe Thursday into a Christmas Day airstrike by the military that killed at least 10 people. Sokoto Governor Ahmed Aliyu said in a statement he's in talks with the Nigerian Army to ensure a thorough investigation into the circumstances that led to the airstrike on early Wednesday. The military said in a statement Wednesday it was targeting the terror group Lakurawa in the villages of Gidan Sama and Rumtuwa, but Aliyu said the attack 'claimed the lives of innocent citizens.' State authorities said 10 people were killed and many others injured. Aliyu extended his condolences to the victims' families and pledged to support them with cash and food. The incident is the latest in a series of accidental strikes in recent years, raising concerns among human rights groups, including Amnesty International. 'This is yet another sign that the Nigerian military has not changed, and they have not learned a lesson from previous airstrikes that killed civilians,' said Isa Sanusi, Amnesty’s country director in Nigeria. 'I believe that they have to review their procedures, they have to investigate these incidents thoroughly, and they have to find a way to end this reckless deadly use of force. The military said that it did not target civilians and that it took necessary measures to avoid such accidents. The Nigerian Air Force said it will investigate. Nigeria has been waging deadly wars against terrorists, armed gangs and separatists for years, but accidents have been recurring. Last December, a military airstrike that hit Tudun Biri village in northern Kaduna state killed more than 120 people. In September, another airstrike in Kaduna killed 24 people. Nigerian authorities have promised to be more cautious, but in a Christmas broadcast, Nigerian Air Staff Chief Hassan Abubakar said, 'To every member of the Nigerian Air Force family, I want to especially thank you for your unwavering dedication, resilience and sacrifice in service of our great nation. Your commitment and professionalism have been instrumental in ensuring the security and stability of our beloved country.' In November, Nigerian authorities announced the emergence of the Lakurawa sect in the northwest and said security forces were tracking the group's activities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-probes-christmas-airstrike-that-killed-10/7915030.html	2024-12-26T11:48:53-08:00	
Deadly attack on journalists underscores danger for media in Haiti	A deadly gang attack in Haiti earlier this week that killed two journalists and wounded seven more underscores the dangers facing journalists in a nation that has been plagued by gang violence for years. At least two journalists — including one who worked with Voice of America — were killed and at least seven other journalists wounded when armed men fired on reporters gathered for the reopening of Haiti’s largest public hospital in the capital, Port-au-Prince, earlier this week, according to media reports and the Haitian government. The Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, said it was 'appalled' by the attack. 'We send deepest condolences to the families of those killed and call on Haitian authorities to swiftly bring these killers to justice,' a CPJ spokesperson said in a statement this week. Among those killed in the Christmas Eve attack was Marckendy Natoux, who did marketing for VOA’s Creole Service. Natoux worked for VOA’s umbrella organization, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, but also reported for various local outlets, including Heritage Express News and Boston Caribbean Network. Natoux began working for USAGM in 2022 and was dedicated to publicizing VOA Creole’s work, according to the journalist’s USAGM colleague, Iscar Blanco. 'He always offered a smile to everyone and a helping hand to anyone who needed it,' Blanco told VOA. Natoux is remembered as someone who was always eager to help his colleagues and community members. Blanco recalled how Natoux was always quick to help whenever journalists needed a microphone, a cable or anything else. And on the weekend, Natoux often volunteered to help the local community, according to Blanco. 'I am sure that he will always be remembered for his dedication to his work, but beyond work, for his love as a father, husband and friend,' Blanco added. Natoux is survived by his wife and two children. Jimmy Jean, a reporter with the online TV outlet Moun Afe Bon, was also killed in the Tuesday morning attack, which underscores the severe threats facing journalists working in the Caribbean nation. Seven other journalists covering the event were wounded. One police officer was killed, and another police officer was wounded in the shooting at State University of Haiti Hospital, which is known locally as the General Hospital. A local gang leader named Johnson 'Izo' Andre of the Viv Ansanm, or Living Together, gang coalition posted a video on social media claiming responsibility for the attack. Members of the Viv Ansanm coalition of street gangs, which have taken control of much of the Haitian capital, surrounded the hospital and opened fire through a metal gate. The gangs later said they were angry that the government had announced the hospital’s reopening without their permission. The Haitian Association of Journalists said the attack was 'a macabre scene comparable to terrorism, pure and simple.' The association also called for 'authorities to act prudently in their rush to make decisions, to avoid exposing to danger the journalists and others who accompany them at their events.' In a statement posted on social media, the prime minister’s office said, 'This heinous act, which targets an institution dedicated to health and life, constitutes an unacceptable assault on the very foundations of our society.' In a video statement, Leslie Voltaire, president of Haiti’s transitional presidential council, said that the shooting was 'unacceptable,' adding, 'This act will not remain without consequences.' 'I send my sympathies to the people who were victims, the national police and the journalists,' Voltaire also said. Haiti has been rocked by severe gang violence and political instability since President Jovenel Moise was assassinated in his home in 2021 by a group of foreign mercenaries in a plot that authorities say involved elite Haitian police officers. More than 5,300 people have been killed in gang-related violence in Haiti in 2024, according to the United Nations. And more than 2,100 people have been injured in gang-related violence. Also in 2024, CPJ ranked Haiti worst in the world in terms of impunity in journalist killings. The press freedom group has documented seven targeted journalist killings in the Caribbean nation over the past decade. To date, none of those killings have been solved. 'With increased violence, the dangers to journalists rise,' CPJ’s CEO, Jodie Ginsberg, told VOA in October. 'Haiti being at the top of this year’s impunity index is really a reflection of that increased violence.' Haiti ranks 93 out of 180 countries on the Global Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media freedom environment. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-attack-on-journalists-underscores-danger-for-media-in-haiti/7914953.html	2024-12-26T10:46:20-08:00	
Al-Shabab says one of its commanders killed in drone strike	Militant group al-Shabab said one of its top commanders, Mohamed Mire, was killed in a drone strike near Kunyo Barrow in Somalia’s Lower Shabelle region. Al-Shabab did not say when the strike took place but blamed the United States for the killing. The U.S. Africa Command did not immediately respond to VOA requests for comment on the reported strike. In a statement, Somalia’s Ministry of Information said the operation was 'well-planned' and conducted in coordination with international partners — an acknowledgement that a second party was involved in the operation. It said the Somali government and partners have been hunting Mire for a long time. Lower Shabelle Region Governor Mohamed Ibrahim Barre told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service that the operation occurred two days ago. Barre said Mire was traveling from the town of Jilib to Kunyo Barrow when he was targeted about 8 kilometers outside the town. Mire was head of al-Shabab’s regions department (Wilayaat), the militant group’s equivalent of an interior ministry. He also held multiple other positions within the group. In July, Somalia’s anti-money laundering committee issued a sanctions list targeting Mire and seven other al-Shabab commanders. U.S. officials designated Mire a global terrorist in October 2022, describing him as a senior al-Shabab leader responsible for the group’s strategic decision-making and head of the group’s interior wing, overseeing many of the group’s activities in Somalia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/al-shabab-says-one-of-its-commanders-killed-in-drone-strike/7914910.html	2024-12-26T10:05:08-08:00	
Former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh dies at 92	NEW DELHI — Former Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, widely regarded as the architect of India's economic reform program and a landmark nuclear deal with the United States, has died. He was 92. Singh was admitted to New Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences late Thursday after his health deteriorated due to 'sudden loss of consciousness at home,' the hospital said in a statement. He was 'being treated for age-related medical conditions,' the statement said. A mild-mannered technocrat, Singh became one of India's longest-serving prime ministers at 10 years and earned a reputation as a man of great personal integrity. He was chosen to fill the role in 2004 by Sonia Gandhi, the widow of assassinated Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. But his sterling image was tainted by allegations of corruption against his ministers. Singh was elected to a second term as prime minister from 2009 to 2014, which was clouded by financial scandals and corruption charges over the organization of the 2010 Commonwealth Games. This led to the Congress Party's crushing defeat in the 2014 national election by the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Singh adopted a low profile after relinquishing the post of prime minister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-indian-prime-minister-manmohan-singh-dies-at-92/7914896.html	2024-12-26T10:03:49-08:00	
Pakistan military court sentences 60 supporters of jailed former PM Khan	Islamabad — A military court in Pakistan on Thursday sentenced 60 supporters of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan to prison terms ranging from two to 10 years for allegedly attacking army facilities. A nephew of the 72-year-old imprisoned leader and two former army officers are among those convicted, as reported by the Pakistani army’s media wing. Khan has been in jail since August 2023 and faces a range of charges, including corruption, sedition, and inciting violence against the military. 'The nation, government, and the armed forces remain steadfast in their commitment to upholding justice and ensuring that the inviolable writ of the state is maintained,' the military statement said. The convictions came less than a week after a military court handed down sentences to 25 members of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party on the same charges. The allegations against Khan supporters stem from nationwide protests in May 2023, during which demonstrators stormed and ransacked several military installations in an unprecedented show of public outrage against the powerful Pakistani institution. The PTI has rejected the 'secretive' military trials. Khan and his aides deny any wrongdoing, saying intelligence agency operatives had infiltrated the ranks of 'peaceful' PTI protesters and carried out the vandalism to justify a subsequent state crackdown on the opposition party, charges government officials rejected. Last week’s sentencing of the initial group of 25 PTI members to 'vigorous imprisonment' of up to 10 years drew an international backlash. The United States urged Pakistani authorities to respect the right to a fair trial and due process in line with the country’s constitution. 'The United States is deeply concerned that Pakistani civilians have been sentenced by a military tribunal. ... These military courts lack judicial independence, transparency, and due process guarantees,' said a State Department statement on Monday. Britain also criticized Pakistan for putting civilians on trial in military courts, saying they lack 'transparency, independent scrutiny' and undermine 'the right to a fair trial.' The European Union condemned the sentencing of Pakistani civilians by military courts, calling the practice 'inconsistent with the obligations that Pakistan has undertaken under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.' The Pakistani government has defended the military trials and subsequent convictions, stating they uphold the right to a fair trial and allow appeals within military tribunals and civil courts. 'We also have underlined on multiple occasions that Pakistan's constitution and Pakistan's legal system have the capacity to resolve any issues that arise internally,' foreign ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch told her weekly news conference Thursday. '[The] Pakistani system has the remedy of judicial review by superior courts. … We will continue to uphold our Constitution and Pakistani law and our obligations under international law.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-military-court-sentences-60-supporters-of-jailed-former-pm-khan/7914849.html	2024-12-26T08:57:08-08:00	
Israel strikes Yemen's Sanaa airport, power stations, ports	JERUSALEM — Israel's military said it struck multiple targets linked to the Iran-aligned Houthi movement in Yemen on Thursday, including Sanaa International Airport and three ports along the western coast. Attacks hit Yemen's Hezyaz and Ras Kanatib power stations as well as military infrastructure in the ports of Hodeidah, Salif and Ras Kanatib, Israel's military said. There was no immediate comment from the Houthis, who have repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel in what they describe as acts of solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza. The Israeli attacks on the airport, Hodeidah and one power station were reported by Al Masirah TV, the main television news outlet run by the Houthis. More than a year of Houthi attacks have disrupted international shipping routes through the Red Sea, forcing firms to reroute to longer and more-expensive journeys that have, in turn, stoked fears over global inflation. Israel has instructed its diplomatic missions in Europe to try to get the Houthis designated as a terrorist organization. The U.N. Security Council is due to meet on Monday over Houthi attacks against Israel, Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon said on Wednesday. On Saturday, Israel's military failed to intercept a missile from Yemen that fell in the Tel Aviv-Jaffa area, injuring 14 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-strikes-yemen-s-sanaa-airport-ports-power-stations/7914813.html	2024-12-26T08:41:07-08:00	
Zimbabwe says SADC regional bloc ready to assist troubled Mozambique	Mount Hampden, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa — who is chairing SADC — has said the regional bloc is ready to assist troubled Mozambique engulfed in post-election violence that has claimed more than 100 lives of protesters, according to human rights organizations. South Africa calls for dialogue in the former Portuguese colony, where the opposition is claiming its electoral victory was stolen in the Oct. 9 polls. In a statement, Zimbabwe’s President Emmerson Mnangagwa, current chairman of the 16-nation Southern African Development Community, SADC, said the post-election violence in Mozambique must end after the country’s Constitutional Council this week gave 65% victory of the October to the ruling Frelimo party. Ronald Lomola, South Africa’s minister of international relations and cooperation, released an audio message on social media weighing in on post election violence in Mozambique. 'South Africa calls on all parties to commit to an urgent dialogue that will heal the country and set it on a new political and developmental trajectory. Furthermore, South Africa is ready to assist Mozambique in any manner to facilitate this dialogue,' he said. So did Venancio Mondlane, Mozambique’s runner-up to Frelimo’s Daniel Francisco Chapo in the disputed October presidential election. He said 'We not focused on our brother who is also suffering, who has been massacred by Frelimo. That’s not our focus. If you want change in the country, a revolution, my brothers, let’s defend the shops of our neighbors, the companies of our neighbors, let’s defend them.' Khanyo Farise, Amnesty International deputy regional director for east and southern Africa, urged Mocambique government to end what she called one of the worst crackdowns on protesters. 'Since the outcome of the elections on Oct. 9, police have responded with excessive use of force against those who decide to express themselves and to exercise their right to freedom of association and assembly. We've seen police using live ammunition, using rubber bullets and using various forms of excessive force against protesters. Many people have been seriously wounded, and over 110 people have been killed,' she said. Borges Nhamirre, a researcher with the Institute for Security Studies, said peace is important so the country’s closed ports can open to service countries like Zimbabwe, Zambia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Malawi and South Africa. 'So, nothing is happening. Everything has been paralyzed in Mozambique. It means that people will face more hardship[s] even after this is over. So, the fastest way to solve this problem is dialogue. There is no alternative to dialogue,' said Nhamirre. With the opposition and regional organizations such as SADC and African Union now calling for peace in Mozambique, there is hope that the situation can change.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-says-sadc-regional-bloc-ready-to-assist-troubled-mozambique/7914768.html	2024-12-26T08:19:09-08:00	
Finland detains Russia-linked vessel on suspicion it damaged undersea cable	FRANKFURT, GERMANY — Finnish authorities have detained a Russia-linked ship as they investigate whether it damaged a Baltic Sea power cable and several data cables, according to police and news media reports, in the latest incident involving disruption of key infrastructure. Finnish police and border guards boarded the vessel, the Eagle S, just past midnight Thursday and took over the command bridge, Helsinki Police Chief Jari Liukku said at a news conference. The vessel was intercepted in Finland's exclusive economic zone and taken to Finnish territorial waters, police said. The Eagle S is flagged in the Cook Islands but was described by Finnish customs officials as a suspected part of Russia's shadow fleet of fuel tankers, Yle television reported. Those are aging vessels with obscure ownership, acquired to evade Western sanctions over the war against Ukraine and operating without Western-regulated insurance. The Eagle S's anchor is suspected of causing damage to the cable, Yle reported, relying on police statements. The Estlink-2 power cable, which brings electricity from Finland to Estonia across the Baltic Sea, went down just after noon on Wednesday. The incident follows damage to two data cables and the Nord Stream gas pipelines, both of which have been termed sabotage. The Estonian government was holding a meeting on the issue Thursday, Prime Minister Kristen Michal said on X. Two data cables — one running between Finland and Germany and the other between Lithuania and Sweden — were severed in November. Germany's defense minister said officials had to assume the incident was 'sabotage,' but he did not provide evidence or say who might have been responsible. The remark came during a speech in which he discussed hybrid warfare threats from Russia. The Nord Stream pipelines that once brought natural gas from Russia to Germany were damaged by underwater explosions in September 2022. Authorities have said the cause was sabotage and launched criminal probes. Estonian network operator Elering says there was enough spare capacity to meet power needs on the Estonian side, public broadcaster ERR said on its website.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-detains-russia-linked-vessel-on-suspicion-it-damaged-undersea-cable/7914658.html	2024-12-26T07:03:46-08:00	
Poll: Exhausted by political news, Americans are tuning out	New York — As a Democrat who immersed himself in political news during the presidential campaign, Ziad Aunallah has much in common with many Americans since the election. He's tuned out. 'People are mentally exhausted,' said Aunallah, 45, of San Diego. 'Everyone knows what is coming and we are just taking some time off.' Television ratings — and now a new poll — clearly illustrate the phenomenon. About two-thirds of American adults say they have recently felt the need to limit media consumption about politics and government because of overload, according to the survey from the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Smaller percentages of Americans are limiting their intake of news about overseas conflicts, the economy or climate change, the poll says. Politics stand out. Election news on CNN and MSNBC was taking up too much of Sam Gude's time before the election, said the 47-year-old electrician from Lincoln, Nebraska. 'The last thing I want to watch right now is the interregnum,' said Gude, a Democrat and no fan of President-elect Donald Trump. Poll finds more Democrats than Republicans stepping away from news The poll, conducted in early December, found that about 7 in 10 Democrats say they are stepping back from political news. The percentage isn't as high for Republicans, who have reason to celebrate Trump's victory. Still, about 6 in 10 Republicans say they've felt the need to take some time off too, and the share for independents is similar. The differences are far starker for the TV networks that have been consumed by political news. After election night through Dec. 13, the prime-time viewership of MSNBC was an average of 620,000, down 54% from the pre-election audience this year, the Nielsen company said. For the same time comparison, CNN's average of 405,000 viewers was down 45%. At Fox News Channel, a favorite news network for Trump fans, the post-election average of 2.68 million viewers is up 13%, Nielsen said. Since the election, 72% of the people watching one of those three cable networks in the evening were watching Fox News, compared to 53% prior to election day. A post-election slump for fans of the losing candidate is not a new trend for networks that have become heavily identified for a partisan audience. MSNBC had similar issues after Trump was elected in 2016. Same for Fox in 2020, although that was complicated by anger: many of its viewers were outraged then by the network's crucial election night call of Arizona for the Democratic presidential candidate, Joe Biden, and sought alternatives. MSNBC had its own anger issues after several 'Morning Joe' viewers became upset that hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski visited Trump shortly after his victory last month. Yet while the show's ratings are down 35% since Election Day, that's a smaller drop than the network's prime-time ratings. CNN points out that while it has been suffering in the television ratings, its streaming and digital ratings have been consistent. Will political interest rebound when Trump takes office? MSNBC can take some solace in history. In previous years, network ratings bounce back when the depression after an election loss lifts. When a new administration takes office, people who oppose it are frequently looking for a gathering place. 'I'll be tuning back in once the clown show starts,' Aunallah said. 'You have no choice. Whether or not you want to hear it, it's happening. If you care about your country, you have no choice but to pay attention.' But the ride may not be smooth. MSNBC's slide is steeper than it was in 2016; and there's some question about whether Trump opponents will want to be as engaged as they were during his first term. People are also unplugging from cable television in rates that are only getting more rapid, although MSNBC believes it has bucked this trend eating away at audiences before. The poll indicates that Americans want less talk about politics from public figures in general. After an election season where endorsements from celebrities like Taylor Swift made headlines, the survey found that Americans are more likely to disapprove than approve of celebrities, large companies and professional athletes speaking out about politics. Still, Gude is among those discovering other ways to get news to which he does want to pay attention, including on YouTube. MSNBC is also in the middle of some corporate upheaval that raises questions about potential changes. Parent company Comcast announced last month that the cable network is among some properties that will spin off into a new company, which will give MSNBC new corporate leadership and cut its ties to NBC News. Advice for networks who want to see the viewers return Some of the Americans who have turned away from political news lately also had some advice for getting them engaged again. Gude said, for example, that MSNBC will always have a hard-core audience of Trump haters. But if the network wants to expand its audience, 'then you have to talk about issues, and you have to stop talking about Trump.' Kathleen Kendrick, a 36-year-old sales rep from Grand Junction, Colorado, who's a registered independent voter, said she hears plenty of people loudly spouting off about their political opinions on the job. She wants more depth when she watches the news. Much of what she sees is one-sided and shallow, she said. 'You get a story but only part of a story,' Kendrick said. 'It would be nice if you could get both sides, and more research.' Aunallah, similarly, is looking for more depth and variety. He's not interested 'in watching the angry man on the corner yelling at me anymore,' he said. 'It's kind of their own fault that I'm not watching,' he said. 'I felt they spent all this time talking about the election. They made it so much of their focus that when the main event ends, why would people want to keep watching?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/americans-are-exhausted-by-political-news-tv-ratings-and-new-ap-norc-poll-show-they-re-tuning-out/7914688.html	2024-12-26T07:02:19-08:00

Prayers and tears mark 20 years since Indian Ocean tsunami that killed some 230,000 people	BANDA ACEH, Indonesia — People gathered in prayer and visited mass graves in Indonesia's Aceh province on Thursday to mark 20 years since the massive Indian Ocean tsunami hit the region in one of modern history's worst natural disasters. Many wept as they placed flowers at a mass grave in Ulee Lheue village, where more than 14,000 unidentified tsunami victims are buried. It is one of several mass graves in Banda Aceh, the capital of Indonesia's northernmost province, which was one of the areas worst hit by a magnitude 9.1 earthquake and the massive tsunami it triggered. 'We miss them and we still don't know where they are. All we know is that every year we visit the mass grave in Ulee Lhue and Siron,' said Muhamad Amirudin, who lost two of his children 20 years ago and has never found their bodies. 'This life is only temporary, so we do our best to be useful to others,' Amirudin, visiting the grave with his wife, said. The powerful earthquake off the coast of the Indonesian island of Sumatra on Dec. 26, 2004, triggered a tsunami that killed around 230,000 people across a dozen countries, reaching as far as East Africa. Some 1.7 million people were displaced, mostly in the four worst-affected countries: Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand. More than 170,000 people died in Indonesia alone. Even though 20 years have passed, survivors in Indonesia are still grieving the loved ones they lost to the giant wave that flattened buildings all the way to the provincial capital of Banda Aceh. Hundreds of people gathered to pray at the Baiturrahman Mosque in downtown Banda Aceh. Sirens sounded across the city for three minutes to mark the time of the earthquake. Infrastructure in Aceh has been rebuilt and is now more resilient than before the tsunami struck. Early warning systems have been installed in coastal areas to alert residents of incoming tsunamis, providing crucial time to seek safety. The rebuilding efforts were made possible by the support of international donors and organizations, which contributed significant funds to help the region recover. Schools, hospitals, and essential infrastructure destroyed by the disaster have been reconstructed. In Thailand, people gathered at a memorial ceremony in Ban Nam Khem, a small fishing village in Phang Nga province that bore the brunt of the devastating wave in the country. The tsunami claimed the lives of over 8,000 people in Thailand, including many who remain missing, leaving a deep scar in the nation's history. Nearly 400 bodies remain unclaimed. Mourners shed tears and comforted each other as they laid flowers at the village's tsunami memorial. Around 300 people joined a modest ceremony with Muslim, Christian and Buddhist prayers. Urai Sirisuk said she avoids the seaside memorial park the rest of the year because the loss of her 4-year-old daughter still cuts deep every time she's reminded of it. 'I have this feeling that the sea has taken my child. I'm very angry with it. I can't even put my foot in the water,' she said. But, she said, 'I still hear her voice in my ears, that she's calling for me. I can't abandon her. So I have to be here, for my child.' In India, hundreds gathered at Marina beach in the southern city of Chennai in Tamil Nadu state. They poured milk into the sea to propitiate gods and offered flowers and prayers for the dead as drums beat in the background. According to official data, 10,749 people were killed in India, including nearly 7,000 people in Tamil Nadu alone. 'It has been 20 years since the tsunami,' said 69-year-old Sadayammal, who uses one name. 'We are here to pay respects to the people who lost their lives.' In Sri Lanka, survivors and relatives of tsunami victims gathered at the coastal village of Pereliya and laid flowers at a memorial that commemorates nearly 2,000 passengers who died when their train, the Queen of the Sea, was hit by the wave. Only a few dozen people are believed to have survived. Anura Ranjith joined the mourners to pay respects to his younger sister, Anula Ranjani, and her 9-year-old daughter who were passengers on the train. Ranjith never heard from them after that day. 'I looked for them everywhere for years and still, no information about them. Their loss is a great sorrow and pain for me. I am still grieving,' he said. Overall, more than 35,000 people died in Sri Lanka in the tsunami. People across the country observed two minutes of silence on Thursday in memory of those who lost their lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prayers-and-tears-mark-20-years-since-indian-ocean-tsunami-that-killed-some-230-000-people-/7914550.html	2024-12-26T04:59:25-08:00	
Azerbaijan observes day of mourning for air crash victims as speculation mount about its cause	Azerbaijan on Thursday observed a nationwide day of mourning for the victims of the plane crash that killed 38 people and left all 29 survivors injured as speculation mounted about a possible cause of the disaster that remained unknown. Azerbaijan Airlines' Embraer 190 was en route from Azerbaijan's capital of Baku to the Russian city of Grozny in the North Caucasus on Wednesday when it was diverted for reasons yet unclear and crashed while making an attempt to land in Aktau in Kazakhstan after flying east across the Caspian Sea. The plane went down about 3 kilometers from Aktau. Cellphone footage circulating online appeared to show the aircraft making a steep descent before smashing into the ground in a fireball. Other footage showed part of its fuselage ripped away from the wings and the rest of the aircraft lying upside in the grass. On Thursday, national flags were lowered across Azerbaijan, traffic across the country stopped at noon, and signals were sounded from ships and trains as the country observed a nationwide moment of silence. Speaking at a news conference Wednesday, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev said that it was too soon to speculate on the reasons behind the crash, but said that the weather had forced the plane to change from its planned course. 'The information provided to me is that the plane changed its course between Baku and Grozny due to worsening weather conditions and headed to Aktau airport, where it crashed upon landing,' he said. Russia's civil aviation authority, Rosaviatsia, said that preliminary information indicated that the pilots diverted to Aktau after a bird strike led to an emergency on board. According to Kazakh officials, those aboard the plane included 42 Azerbaijani citizens, 16 Russian nationals, six Kazakhs and three Kyrgyzstan nationals. Russia's Emergencies Ministry on Thursday flew nine Russian survivors to Moscow for treatment. As the official crash investigation started, theories abounded about a possible cause, with some commentators alleging that holes seen in the plane's tail section possibly indicate that it could have come under fire from Russian air defense systems fending off a Ukrainian drone attack. Ukrainian drones had previously attacked Grozny, the provincial capital of the Russian republic of Chechnya, and other regions in the country's North Caucasus. Some Russian media claimed that another drone attack on Chechnya happened on Wednesday, although it wasn't officially confirmed. Osprey Flight Solutions, an aviation security firm based in the United Kingdom, warned its clients that the 'Azerbaijan Airlines flight was likely shot down by a Russian military air-defense system.' Osprey provides analysis for carriers still flying into Russia after Western airlines halted their flights during the war. Osprey CEO Andrew Nicholson said that the company had issued more than 200 alerts regarding drone attacks and air defense systems in Russia during the war. 'This incident is a stark reminder of why we do what we do,' Nicholson wrote online. 'It is painful to know that despite our efforts, lives were lost in a way that could have been avoided.' Asked about the claims that the plane had been fired upon by air defense assets, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that 'it would be wrong to make hypotheses before investigators make their verdict.' Kazakhstan's parliamentary Speaker Maulen Ashimbayev also warned against rushing to conclusions based on pictures of the plane's fragments, describing the allegations of air defense fire as unfounded and 'unethical.' Other officials in Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan have similarly avoided comment on a possible cause of the crash, saying it will be up to investigators to determine it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijan-observes-day-of-mourning-for-air-crash-victims-as-speculation-mount-about-its-cause/7914523.html	2024-12-26T04:32:00-08:00	
New Syrian authorities launch operation against pro-Assad militias, state media reports	Syria’s new authorities launched an operation Thursday against militias aligned with ousted President Bashar al-Assad, according to state news agency SANA. The reports said the operation was focused in the western province of Tartous, and that some militia members had been killed. The development came a day after pro-Assad fighters killed 14 members of the rebel group that led the offensive that pushed Assad from power. Syria's new interior minister said on Telegram that 10 other people were wounded in what he called an 'ambush,' and he vowed to crack down on anyone who undermines Syria’s security. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the rebel fighters were attacked while trying to arrest a former official from Assad’s government who was accused of issuing execution orders at the notorious Saydnaya prison. Syrian refugees U.N. refugee chief Filippo Grandi said Thursday that more than 50,000 refugees have returned to Syria during the last three weeks, with the rate of return slowly increasing. 'Material conditions inside Syria remain dire - more humanitarian and recovery assistance must be delivered to returnees and all those in need,' Grandi said. By comparison, the U.N. refugee agency, UNHCR, said earlier this month that it verified the return of 34,000 Syrian refugees during the first eight months of this year. More than 13 years of civil war pushed about 5 million people to flee the country, while 7 million others were displaced within Syria. More than half of the refugees went to Turkey, while most of the others fled to Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and Egypt. A UNHCR report earlier this month said while many of the refugees are interested in returning to Syria, many are choosing to wait for now and evaluate the security situation and political stabilization. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-syrian-authorities-launch-operation-against-pro-assad-militias-state-media-reports/7914502.html	2024-12-26T04:03:21-08:00	
Russia says cargo ship blast was 'terrorist attack'	Moscow — A 'terrorist act' sank the cargo ship that went down in international waters in the Mediterranean this week, the Russian state-owned company that owns the vessel said Wednesday. The Oboronlogistika company said it 'thinks a targeted terrorist attack was committed on December 23, 2024, against the Ursa Major,' it said in a statement cited by Russian news agencies, without indicating who may have been behind the act or why. The ship sank in international waters off Spain in the early hours of Tuesday after having sent a distress call for help on Monday. 'Three consecutive explosions' took place on the ship before it began taking on water, added the company, which belongs to the Russian defense ministry. Oboronlogistika did not say what evidence it had allowing it to conclude a terrorist attack sank the Ursa Major. Russian foreign ministry's crisis unit said on Telegram on Tuesday that the ship sank 'after an explosion in the engine room.' It added that out of the 16 Russian crew members on board, 14 had been rescued and taken to the Spanish port of Cartagena and two were missing. The ship sent a distress call Monday morning from off the coast of southeastern Spain in bad weather, reporting it was listing and sailors had launched a lifeboat, Spain's sea rescue service said in a statement. Spain sent out a helicopter and rescue boats and took the survivors to port, the service said. A Russian warship then arrived and took charge of the rescue operation since the ship was between Spanish and Algerian waters, after which the Ursa Major sank overnight. The Ursa Major is listed on MarineTraffic.com as a 124.7-meter long general cargo ship. It is owned by a subsidiary of Russia's Oboronlogistika, which belongs to the defense ministry and also provides civilian transport and logistics, the Russian foreign ministry said. The Ursa Major was sailing from the Russian city of Saint Petersburg to Vladivostok in Russia's Far East. Last week Oboronlogistika issued a press release with photos of the ship in port, saying it was to transport a particularly large and heavy load: cranes each weighing 380 tons and hatch covers for icebreakers each weighing 45 tons to Vladivostok. The United States in 2022 imposed sanctions on Oboronlogistika and ships including the Ursa Major for providing 'transportation services...for the delivery of cargo to Russian-occupied Crimea'. This means any U.S. organization dealing with the company or its ships would risk sanctions. Ukraine's GUR military intelligence said the Ursa Major was also used to supply Russian troops in Syria where Moscow has a naval base at Tartus.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-cargo-ship-blast-was-terrorist-attack/7914477.html	2024-12-26T03:25:11-08:00	
Cambodia opposition politician jailed for 2 years for incitement	PHNOM PENH, CAMBODIA — A Cambodian opposition politician was sentenced on Thursday to two years in jail and banned from elections for inciting social unrest, his lawyer said, the latest in a series of cases that activists say are attempts to silence government critics. Sun Chanthy, president of the Nation Power Party, was arrested and charged in May after meeting supporters in Japan. Police said he had spread false information on Facebook to mislead the public but his arrest was not politically motivated, local media reported at the time. His lawyer, Choung Chou Ngy, on Thursday told reporters Sun Chanthy was sentenced in absentia as he was unable to travel from a provincial prison to attend court in Phnom Penh due to travel sickness. He joins a long list of politicians, journalists and labor and environmental activists in Cambodia imprisoned after speaking out against the government, which has been led by the Cambodian People's Party for four decades. Cambodia's justice ministry did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment on the sentence. For years the government has denied curtailing free speech and cracking down on its opponents, saying those jailed or subjected to legal action had broken the law. The CPP government has led a ruthless, years-long crackdown on its opponents, with scores of politicians jailed, many in absentia, and hundreds more fleeing into exile. Sun Chanthy formed the Nation Power Party in 2023 after Cambodia's only opposition, the Candlelight Party, was barred from an election last year that was won by the CPP in a landslide. According to human rights group LICADHO, which tracks cases against government critics, 102 people have been arrested and jailed in Cambodia this year, with 76 still in detention as of Dec. 10.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodia-opposition-politician-jailed-for-2-years-for-incitement/7914466.html	2024-12-26T03:04:59-08:00	
Japan Airlines suffers delays after carrier reports cyberattack	TOKYO — Japan Airlines reported a cyberattack on Thursday that caused delays to domestic and international flights but later said it had found and addressed the cause. The airline, Japan's second biggest after All Nippon Airways (ANA), said 24 domestic flights had been delayed by more than half an hour. Public broadcaster NHK said problems with the airline's baggage check-in system had caused delays at several Japanese airports but no major disruption was reported. 'We identified and addressed the cause of the issue. We are checking the system recovery status,' Japan Airlines (JAL) said in a post on social media platform X. 'Sales for both domestic and international flights departing today have been suspended. We apologize for any inconvenience caused,' the post said. A JAL spokesperson told AFP earlier the company had been subjected to a cyberattack. Japanese media said it may have been a so-called DDoS attack aimed at overwhelming and disrupting a website or server. Network disruption began at 7:24 a.m. Thursday (2224 GMT Wednesday), JAL said in a statement, adding that there was no impact on the safety of its operations. Then 'at 8:56 a.m., we temporarily isolated the router (a device for exchanging data between networks) that was causing the disruption,' it said. Report on January collision JAL shares fell as much as 2.5% in morning trade after the news emerged, before recovering slightly. The airline is just the latest Japanese firm to be hit by a cyberattack. Japan's space agency JAXA was targeted in 2023, although no sensitive information about rockets or satellites was accessed. The same year one of Japan's busiest ports was hit by a ransomware attack blamed on the Russia-based Lockbit group. In 2022, a cyberattack at a Toyota supplier forced the top-selling automaker to halt operations at domestic plants. More recently, the popular Japanese video-sharing website Niconico came under a large cyberattack in June. Separately, a transport ministry committee tasked with probing a fatal January 2024 collision involving a JAL passenger jet released an interim report on Wednesday blaming human error for the incident that killed five people. The collision at Tokyo's Haneda Airport was with a coast guard plane carrying six crew members -- of whom five were killed -- that was on mission to deliver relief supplies to a quake-hit central region of Japan. According to the report, the smaller plane's pilot mistook an air traffic control officer's instructions to mean authorization had been given to enter the runway. The captain was also 'in a hurry' at the time because the coast guard plane's departure was 40 minutes behind schedule, the report said. The traffic controller failed to notice the plane had intruded into the runway, oblivious even to an alarm system warning against its presence. All 379 people on board the JAL Airbus escaped just before the aircraft was engulfed in flames.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-airlines-suffers-delays-after-carrier-reports-cyberattack/7914450.html	2024-12-26T02:40:25-08:00	
South Korea's opposition moves to impeach acting president	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's opposition said Thursday it filed an impeachment motion against acting president Han Duck-soo, in an escalating dispute over the composition of the Constitutional Court which would decide whether to remove his predecessor from office. South Korea fell in a political crisis when President Yoon Suk Yeol, currently suspended, declared martial law on Dec. 3. Yoon was stripped of his duties by parliament on Dec. 14 over the dramatic declaration, but a constitutional court ruling upholding the decision by lawmakers is necessary to complete the impeachment process. The court is, however, currently short of three judges. While it can go ahead with its six members on the bench, a single dissenting vote would reinstate Yoon. The opposition wants Han to approve three more nominees to fill the nine-member bench, something that he has so far refused to do, essentially leaving both sides in a deadlock. The opposition Democratic Party therefore says the acting president should be impeached too. 'We have filed the motion... and will report it to the plenary session today,' MP Park Sung-joon told reporters at the National Assembly of the action against Han. 'We will put it to a vote tomorrow.' Han's refusal to formally appoint the three judges proves that he 'does not have the will or qualification to uphold the constitution,' the Democratic Party's floor leader Park Chan-dae told reporters. Han has said that he would certify the judges' appointments only if his ruling People Power Party (PPP) and the opposition reach a compromise on the nominees. 'The consistent principle embedded in our constitution and laws is to refrain from exercising significant exclusive presidential powers, including the appointment of constitutional institutions,' Han argued. 'A consensus between the ruling and opposition parties in the National Assembly, representing the people, must first be reached,' added the 75-year-old career bureaucrat. If the opposition passes the impeachment motion against Han in Friday's vote, it would mark the first time democratic South Korea has impeached an acting president. In Han's place, Finance Minister Choi Sang-mok would step in as acting president. Duty violated In the impeachment motion, the opposition accuses Han of violating his duty as acting president, citing his refusal to formally appoint the judges and promulgate two special probe bills to investigate Yoon's short-lived imposition of martial law and graft allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon Hee. Earlier this week, Han rejected the opposition's demand for the special bills that would establish two independent investigative bodies to probe the first couple, prompting warnings of impeachment from the Democratic Party. Han is 'intentionally avoiding the special investigation to probe those involved in the insurrection and has clearly stated his intention to reject the appointments of three Constitutional Court judges,' the motion reads. Such actions, it adds, are 'in violation of a public official's duty to uphold the law... and serve the public.' If the opposition succeeds in their bid on Friday, South Korea will see its second impeachment of a head of state in less than two weeks, further destabilizing its vibrant political scene. Separately, Yoon faces criminal charges of insurrection over his martial law declaration, which could result in life imprisonment or even the death penalty. Yoon was ordered a third time on Thursday to appear for questioning on the morning of the 29th, days after he refused a summons to do so on Christmas.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-opposition-moves-to-impeach-acting-president/7914444.html	2024-12-26T02:27:56-08:00	
Pope opens special 'Holy Door' for Catholic Jubilee at Rome prison	ROME — Pope Francis made a visit on Thursday to one of the largest prison complexes in Italy, opening a special 'Holy Door' for the 2025 Catholic Holy Year, in what the Vatican said was the first such action by a Catholic pontiff. Speaking to hundreds of inmates, guards and staff at the Rebibbia prison on the outskirts of Rome, Francis said he wanted to open the door, part of the prison chapel, and one of only five that will be open during the Holy Year, to show that 'hope does not disappoint.' 'In bad moments, we can all think that everything is over,' said the pontiff. 'Do not lose hope. This is the message I wanted to give you. Do not lose hope.' Francis opened the Catholic Holy Year, also known as a Jubilee, on Tuesday. A Catholic Jubilee is considered a time of peace, forgiveness and pardon. This Jubilee, dedicated to the theme of hope, will run through Jan. 6, 2026. Holy Years normally occur every 25 years, and usually involve the opening in Rome of four special 'Holy Doors,' which symbolize the door of salvation for Catholics. The doors, located at the papal basilicas in Rome, are only open during Jubilee years. The Vatican said the opening of the 'Holy Door' at Rome's Rebibbia prison was the first time such a door had been opened by a pope at a prison since the start of the Jubilee year tradition by Pope Boniface VIII in 1300. Francis has shown special attention for the incarcerated over his 11-year papacy. He often visits prisons in Rome and on his foreign trips.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-opens-special-holy-door-for-catholic-jubilee-at-rome-prison/7914441.html	2024-12-26T02:16:29-08:00	
BYD contractor denies 'slavery-like conditions' claims by Brazilian authorities	SHANGHAI/BEIJING — Jinjiang Group, a contractor for Chinese electric vehicle maker BYD, said Thursday that Brazilian authorities' portrayal of their employees as 'enslaved' was inconsistent with the facts and that there were translation misunderstandings. Brazilian labor authorities had on Wednesday said they found 163 Chinese nationals working in 'slavery-like conditions' at a construction site for a BYD-owned factory in Brazil's Bahia state. BYD said then that it had cut ties with the firm that hired the workers and was working with authorities. 'Being unjustly labeled as 'enslaved' has made our employees feel that their dignity has been insulted and their human rights violated, seriously hurting the dignity of the Chinese people. We have signed a joint letter to express our true feelings,' Jinjiang said on its official Weibo account. Their statement was reposted by Li Yunfei, general manager of branding and public relations at BYD, on his own Weibo account. He accused 'foreign forces' and some Chinese media of 'deliberately smearing Chinese brands and the country and undermining the relationship between China and Brazil.' A BYD representative directed Reuters to Li's Weibo post when asked about Jinjiang's comments and the situation. Jinjiang did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. BYD has been building the factory as part of plans to start production in Brazil in 2024 or early 2025. The factory is envisioned to have an initial capacity of producing 150,000 cars annually in Brazil, the Chinese EV giant's largest overseas market. Brazil is poised to hike tariffs on imported EVs to 35% in July 2026 from 18% currently. On Wednesday, China's foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said the Chinese Embassy in Brazil was communicating with Brazilian counterparts to verify the situation and handle it. Jinjiang said there had been translation and cultural difference issues that had led to the situation, and that the questions from the Brazilian inspectors had been 'suggestive.' It also posted a video showing a group of Chinese workers in front of the camera with one of them reading out a letter that Jinjiang said the workers have jointly signed. The letter said, for instance, that 107 workers had handed their passports to the company for help with applying for a temporary ID certificate in Brazil. The Brazilian labor inspectors had said that the workers had had their passports withheld by the company. 'We are very happy to come to Camacari to work,' an unidentified Chinese male said in the video. 'We have been complying with laws and regulations, working hard during the period with a hope that the construction of the biggest new energy vehicle project in Brazil could be completed as soon as possible,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/byd-contractor-denies-slavery-like-conditions-claims-by-brazilian-authorities/7914439.html	2024-12-26T02:07:07-08:00	
Rural communities urged to flee east Australia bushfire	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA — Australian authorities urged people in dozens of rural communities on Thursday to leave home 'immediately' to escape an out-of-control bushfire tearing through a national park. About 600 firefighters were battling the blaze in the Grampians National Park, 240 kilometers west of the city of Melbourne, a Victoria state emergency services spokesperson said. The blaze has persisted for more than a week in hot, windy conditions, scorching 55,000 hectares -- about one-third of the park -- so far without causing deaths or destroying homes. State emergency services warned residents to leave home immediately in more than two dozen mostly small rural communities, with populations ranging from as few as six to as many as several hundred. People in several other communities were told to take shelter indoors because it was unsafe to leave. Firefighters expected shifting winds to complicate their task during the day, said Victoria state control center spokesperson Luke Hegarty. 'We are reaching a critical part of the day when we see the wind change moving through the western part of the state,' Hegarty said in an afternoon update. 'We're expecting strong winds and variable winds to be a concern for us over the next few hours.' A total fire ban was declared across the whole of Victoria, a state located in southeastern Australia, barring any fires in the open air.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rural-communities-urged-to-flee-east-australia-bushfire/7914420.html	2024-12-26T01:16:47-08:00	
Sri Lanka train memorial honors tsunami tragedy	PERALIYA, SRI LANKA — Just inland from the crashing waves on Sri Lanka's palm-fringed shores, the train slowly came to a stop on Thursday -- marking the moment a deadly tsunami hit 20 years ago. Sri Lanka's Ocean Queen Express became a symbol of the biggest natural disaster to hit the South Asian nation in living memory, when the train was struck by the giant waves of Dec. 26, 2004. About 1,000 people were killed -- both passengers and local residents, who had clambered inside desperately seeking shelter after the first wave hit. After they boarded, two bigger waves smashed into the train, ripping it from the tracks and tumbling it onto its side more than 100 meters from the shoreline. Each year since then, the Ocean Queen has stopped on the tsunami anniversary at the spot in Peraliya, a sleepy village some 90 kilometers south of the capital Colombo, to commemorate those killed. 'To me, it all brings back the very hard memories,' said Tekla Jesenthu, whose 2-year-old daughter died as the waves hit the area. 'I don't want to think about or talk about it -- it hurts that much.' 'Monuments won't bring them back,' she added. Climbing for survival Survivors and relatives of the dead boarded the train in Colombo early in the morning before it headed south with national flags fluttering on its front and then slowed to a creaking halt in commemoration. Villagers came out, the line was closed, and a few moments of quiet settled. Mourners offered flowers and lit incense at a beachside memorial for 1,270 people buried in mass graves, with Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Muslim ceremonies held. 'When I saw the first wave, I started running away from the waves,' said U. A. Kulawathi, 73, a mother whose daughter was killed, her body swept out to sea. 'The water reached the roof levels and people climbed the roofs to save themselves.' The 9.1 magnitude earthquake off the western coast of Indonesia's Sumatra island triggered huge waves that swept into coastal areas of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, Thailand and nine other nations around the Indian Ocean basin. A total of 226,408 people died as a result of the tsunami according to EM-DAT, a recognized global disaster database. Of those, 35,399 were in Sri Lanka. Sarani Sudeshika, 36, a baker whose mother-in-law was among those killed, recalled how 'animals started making strange noises and people started shouting, saying, 'Seawater is coming.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/sri-lanka-train-memorial-honors-tsunami-tragedy/7914416.html	2024-12-26T01:07:09-08:00	
World Bank raises China's GDP forecast for 2024, 2025	The World Bank raised on Thursday its forecast for China's economic growth in 2024 and 2025, but warned that subdued household and business confidence, along with headwinds in the property sector, would keep weighing it down next year. The world's second-biggest economy has struggled this year, mainly due to a property crisis and tepid domestic demand. An expected hike in U.S. tariffs on its goods when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office in January may also negatively impact China’s growth. 'Addressing challenges in the property sector, strengthening social safety nets, and improving local government finances, will be essential to unlocking a sustained recovery,' Mara Warwick, the World Bank's country director for China, said. 'It is important to balance short-term support to growth with long-term structural reforms,' she said in a statement. Thanks to the effect of recent policy easing and near-term export strength, the World Bank sees China's gross domestic product growth at 4.9% this year, up from its June forecast of 4.8%. Beijing set a growth target of 'around 5%' this year, a goal it says it is confident of achieving. Although growth for 2025 is also expected to fall to 4.5%, that is still higher than the World Bank's earlier forecast of 4.1%. Slower household income growth and the negative wealth effect from lower home prices are expected to weigh on consumption into 2025, the Bank said. To revive growth, Chinese authorities have agreed to issue a record $411 billion in special treasury bonds next year, Reuters reported this week. The figures will not be officially unveiled until the annual meeting of China's parliament, the National People's Congress, in March 2025, and could still change before then. While the housing regulator will continue efforts to stem further declines in China's real estate market next year, the World Bank said a turnaround in the sector was not anticipated until late 2025. China's middle class has expanded significantly since the 2010s, encompassing 32% of the population in 2021, but World Bank estimates suggest about 55% remain 'economically insecure,' underscoring the need to generate opportunities for citizens.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-bank-raises-china-s-gdp-forecast-for-2024-2025-/7914410.html	2024-12-26T00:33:40-08:00	
Ukraine says it shot down 20 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Thursday it shot down 20 of the 31 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv and Kyiv regions, Ukraine’s air force said. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it destroyed five Ukrainian aerial drones over the Volgograd, Voronezh and Belgorod regions. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram a drone attack damaged several apartment buildings and a house, but that no one was hurt. The latest round of aerial attacks between the two sides followed a more active than usual day of drone and missile assaults. U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday condemned a massive Russian attack that Ukraine’s military said included 106 drones and 78 missiles. 'The purpose of this outrageous attack was to cut off the Ukrainian people’s access to heat and electricity during winter and to jeopardize the safety of its grid. Let me be clear: the Ukrainian people deserve to live in peace and safety,' Biden said in a statement. The United States, Biden said, 'has provided Ukraine with hundreds of air defense missiles, and more are on the way. I have directed the Department of Defense to continue its surge of weapons deliveries to Ukraine.' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Russia targeted energy infrastructure as part of an attempt to 'fight for a blackout in Ukraine.' Russia’s Defense Ministry said in a statement it struck critical energy infrastructure facilities that support Ukraine’s military. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-it-shot-down-20-russian-drones/7914405.html	2024-12-26T00:18:09-08:00	
Kyrgyzstan faces difficulties enforcing West's Russia sanctions	BISHKEK, KYRGYZSTAN — Experts say Kyrgyzstan’s efforts to enforce Western sanctions against companies supplying dual-use goods and equipment to Russia are constrained by opposition from business, limited bureaucratic resources, and unwillingness to antagonize the Kremlin. Since 2022, the U.S. and EU governments designated a dozen Kyrgyz companies as violators of international Russia sanctions. According to the U.S. Treasury Department website, 'Entities based in the Kyrgyz Republic have been frequent exporters of controlled electronics components and other technology to Russia since Russia began its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Some of these shipments have subsequently supplied sensitive dual-use goods to entities in Russia’s defense sector.' There has been a significant rise in trade between Kyrgyzstan and Russia since Moscow’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, with this year’s Kyrgyz exports to Russia through November up 47% from the same period last year, according to the Kyrgyz State Statistical Committee. Kyrgyzstan and Russia are both part of the Eurasian Economic Union, which also includes Armenia, Belarus and Kazakhstan. As some media reports have claimed, the Kremlin has relied on Kyrgyzstan’s membership in the bloc as a backdoor channel for sanctions evasion. Western actions targeting Kyrgyz companies have irked Kyrgyz officials, but they have taken a series of measures to avoid more sanctions. In October 2022, Kyrgyz banks stopped processing transactions with Russian MIR cards, the go-to payment system for Russian citizens. In August of this year, the Kyrgyz government set up a new government State Trading Company to engage in external trade and monitor private import and export transactions. A month later, a government decree obliged Kyrgyz banks to suspend monetary transactions of all local and foreign companies involved in reexporting goods from China, South Korea and the EU through Kyrgyzstan to Russia. The State Trading Company has been exempted from this requirement. Kyrgyz officials have portrayed the measures as effective, with Economy and Trade Minister Daniyar Amangeldiev saying in October, 'We have obligations, and we are fulfilling them. Accordingly, such [sanctioned] goods never came to us, and they didn’t go through our territory.' However, regional experts paint a different picture. Bishkek political analyst Emil Juraev told VOA by email that Kyrgyzstan has limited capacity to enforce Western sanctions. 'It is the purview of the [Kyrgyz] Customs Service, which must have full information about what kind of goods are being exported and imported. That way, it would be possible to see what is being shipped to Russia. But in our country, such [sanctioned] goods are brought through contraband [channels],' he said. Meanwhile, the government action to control external trade through State Trade Company has caused consternation among Kyrgyz businesses. Askar Sydykov, head of the International Business Council, a Bishkek-based business association, told an Oct. 15 roundtable in Bishkek the number of commercial transactions can reach hundreds and thousands, which may be beyond the capacity of the government to deal with. 'Given that the company has been created only recently and it lacks experience in such transactions,' he said, referring to the State Trading Company, 'this can have significant [negative] implications on the country's interests and profitability of the banking sector and business community.' Sydykov also added that Kyrgyz entrepreneurs have vague ideas about what constitutes sanctioned 'dual use goods,' implying that Kyrgyz authorities need to do more to raise awareness of the issue among exporting businesses. Kyrgyz authorities have also grappled with punishing companies involved in sanctions evasion. As of December, the Kyrgyz government only revoked registration of two Kyrgyz companies that were included on the U.S. sanctions list. 'Closing down a few companies will not make big difference,' a Kyrgyzstani entrepreneur whose company imports goods from China told VOA, on condition that she be identified by only her first name, Nazira. 'Hundreds of [Kyrgyz] companies are involved in this business,' she said, referring to sanctions evasion. Fears of antagonizing Russia At a Nov. 25 news conference, Russian Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Sergei Vakunov took a jab at Western secondary sanctions against Kyrgyz companies, portraying them as 'direct interference of foreign countries into affairs of a sovereign country such as Kyrgyzstan.' A Kyrgyzstani political analyst, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity out of fear of official retribution, said that the Kyrgyz government is loath to take measures that can antagonize Russia. In an early October interview with Russia state media, Kyrgyz President Sadyr Japarov criticized Western pressure on Kyrgyzstan. Traveling around Europe, he said, he hears EU officials on one hand say Russia should be punished for the invasion of Ukraine but those countries continue to cooperate with Russia. 'They should not tell us or ask us not to cooperate with Russia or the CIS,' he said, referring to the Commonwealth of Independent States, an alliance of a number of former Soviet republics. Western diplomats apparently know that putting too much pressure can push Kyrgyzstan closer to Russia. In a March interview with Kyrgyz media, U.S. Ambassador to Kyrgyzstan Lesslie Viguerie, said sanctions 'are not intended to prevent Kyrgyzstan from maintaining economic relations with Russia,' adding 'We do not pursue such a goal.' Nevertheless, Western governments are unwilling to reduce pressure on Kyrgyzstan. In late October, the U.S. government added four more Central Asian companies including one company from Kyrgyzstan to its sanctions list, a sign that illicit trade continues. Some experts doubt this latest measure will have impact. Joanna Lillis, a journalist based in Almaty, Kazakhstan, and the author of Dark Shadows: Inside the Secret World of Kazakhstan, told VOA, 'It is clear that the current system is not acting as a sufficient deterrent, and that further measures should be taken to thwart this trade.' 'It is possible,' she said, 'that singling out individuals for sanctions rather than companies might boost the deterrent factor.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/kyrgyzstan-faces-difficulties-enforcing-west-s-russia-sanctions/7914401.html	2024-12-26T00:07:34-08:00	
China to build world's largest hydropower dam in Tibet	BEIJING — China has approved the construction of what will be the world's largest hydropower dam, kicking off an ambitious project on the eastern rim of the Tibetan plateau that could affect millions downstream in India and Bangladesh. The dam, which will be located in the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, could produce 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually, according to an estimate provided in 2020 by the Power Construction Corp of China. That would more than triple the 88.2 billion kWh designed capacity of the Three Gorges Dam, currently the world's largest, in central China. The project will play a major role in meeting China's carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, stimulate related industries such as engineering, and create jobs in Tibet, the official Xinhua news agency reported on Wednesday. A section of the Yarlung Zangbo falls a dramatic 2,000 meters within a short span of 50 kilometers, offering huge hydropower potential as well as unique engineering challenges. The outlay for building the dam, including engineering costs, is also expected to eclipse the Three Gorges dam, which cost 254.2 billion yuan, or $34.83 billion. This included the resettling of the 1.4 million people it displaced and was more than four times the initial estimate of $7.8 billion. Authorities have not indicated how many people the Tibet project would displace and how it would affect the local ecosystem, one of the richest and most diverse on the plateau. But according to Chinese officials, hydropower projects in Tibet, which they say hold more than a third of China's hydroelectric power potential, would not have a major impact on the environment or on downstream water supplies. India and Bangladesh have nevertheless raised concerns about the dam, with the project potentially altering not only the local ecology but also the flow and course of the river downstream. The Yarlung Zangbo becomes the Brahmaputra river as it leaves Tibet and flows south into India's Arunachal Pradesh and Assam states and finally into Bangladesh. China has already commenced hydropower generation on the upper reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo, which flows from the west to the east of Tibet. It is planning more projects upstream.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-build-world-s-largest-hydropower-dam-in-tibet/7914400.html	2024-12-25T23:55:56-08:00	
Israeli strike kills 5 journalists, Palestinian channel says	Palestinian medics said an Israeli airstrike early Thursday killed five journalists in the Nuseirat camp in central Gaza. The Al-Quds Today television channel, which is affiliated with the Islamic Jihad militant group, said in a statement the strike hit a broadcast truck and killed its five staffers. The channel said the group was killed 'while performing their journalistic and humanitarian duty.' The Israeli military said its forces struck a vehicle containing Islamic Jihad terrorists in the Nuseirat area. A baby girl froze to death in southern Gaza, the head of the enclave's Ministry of Health said Wednesday. The newborn is at least the third baby to die in recent days in the cold. The girl's father, Mahmoud al-Faseeh, told The Associated Press that he had wrapped her in a blanket to try to keep her warm in the family's tent in the al-Muwasi camp outside of Khan Younis. 'It was very cold overnight and, as adults, we couldn't even take it. We couldn't stay warm,' he said. Baby Sila woke up crying three times in the night. In the morning, 'she was like wood,' he said. They rushed her to a field hospital, but she did not survive. Sila 'died from the cold,' her mother, Nariman, told CNN on Wednesday. 'I was warming her and holding her. But … [we] didn't have extra clothes for me to warm this girl.' The overnight low was 9 degrees Celsius, and their tent did not keep the wind out, Mahmood al-Faseeh said. Dr. Ahmed Al-Farra, the children's ward director at Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, confirmed the baby died of hypothermia, as did two others, both less than 1 month old, in the past two days. According to The Associated Press, Israel is allowing more aid into Gaza: an average of 130 trucks a day in December, up from about 70 in October and November. Before the war, about 500 trucks entered daily. Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in their October 2023 attack on southern Israel and took about 250 others hostage. There are still around 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, though at least one-third are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,300 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group.

French authorities rescue 107 migrants crossing Channel	LILLE, FRANCE — French authorities said they rescued 107 migrants trying to cross the Channel from France to England on Wednesday. Over the course of Christmas Day, 12 rescue operations were staged along the coast of northern France, including of a boat experiencing engine trouble, France's Channel and North Sea maritime prefecture said in a statement. In the morning, 30 passengers were rescued from a boat near Dunkirk, while the others onboard wished to continue onward and were taken into British custody once they reached British waters, the maritime authorities said. Another boat experiencing engine damage was spotted later in the day, also near Dunkirk, and all 51 passengers were rescued. Later, 26 people were taken off a boat having trouble near Calais. The English Channel is 'a particularly dangerous area, especially at the height of winter for precarious and overloaded boats,' the statement said. At least 73 migrants have died trying to cross the Channel to Britain in 2024, according to the Pas-de-Calais authorities, making it the deadliest year on record for the crossings. Tens of thousands more have reached Britain, where the government has vowed to crack down on people-smuggling gangs. In November, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for greater international cooperation against the gangs, which he described as a 'global security threat similar to terrorism.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-authorities-rescue-107-migrants-crossing-channel/7914340.html	2024-12-25T18:51:13-08:00	
Desalination plant quietly resumes operations in Gaza	The quiet resumption of operations at a desalination plant in the Gaza Strip last month marked a small but significant step toward restoring public services in the Palestinian territory ravaged by more than 14 months of war. The process of restarting the plant in Deir el-Balah, in central Gaza, involved both Israeli and Palestinian stakeholders who could have a hand in the territory's future, especially amid renewed hopes for a ceasefire in recent days. While its reopening has had a limited tangible impact so far, diplomats close to the project suggest it could offer a tentative road map for Gaza's postwar administration. Since being reconnected to Israel's electricity grid, the station has been producing about 16,000 cubic meters of water per day, according to UNICEF. It serves more than 600,000 Gaza residents through tankers or the networks of Deir el-Balah and Khan Younis governorates in central and southern Gaza, respectively. 'Its production capacity remains limited in the face of immense needs,' an official within the Palestinian Energy and Natural Resources Authority told AFP. Residents of the devastated Palestinian territory have struggled since the early days of the war between Israel and Hamas to secure even basic necessities, including food and clean water. The WASH Cluster, which brings together humanitarian organizations in the water sector, reports that distribution of water has become very complex in Gaza. The pipelines transporting water have been damaged, leaving Gazans, many of whom are living in makeshift shelters after being displaced by bombardments, without any means of storing the essential resource. Three plants The plant is one of three such seawater processing facilities in the Gaza Strip, which before the war met around 15% of the 2.4 million residents' needs. In the months following the outbreak of war, sparked by the Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, the plant operated at minimal capacity, relying on solar panels and generators amid a persistent scarcity of fuel in Gaza. It could fully resume operations only after reconnecting to one of the power lines supplied by Israel, which charges the Palestinian Authority for the electricity. UNICEF, which provides technical support for the Deir el-Balah plant, indicated in late June that it had reached an agreement with Israel to restore electricity to the plant. Subsequently, COGAT, a division of Israel's defense ministry overseeing civilian affairs in the Palestinian territories, announced that the desalination plant had been reconnected to the Israeli grid. But the line meant to supply the plant was heavily damaged. 'It took five months to repair the line from Kissufim' in Israel, said Mohammed Thabet, spokesman for Gaza's electricity company. 'These are emergency, temporary solutions.' Several diplomatic sources told AFP that the episode showed the Palestinian Authority proved it was in a position to have a hand in the future governance of Gaza, as its institutions were fixing the electricity line on the ground, coordinating with all actors. The authority aims to play a central role in postwar Gaza, seeking to strengthen its influence in the territory after it was significantly weakened when Hamas took control in 2007. An Israeli security source told AFP that the Israeli partners involved had acted on 'instructions from the political echelons,' and that the project was part of an effort to prevent an outbreak of disease, which could endanger the lives of hostages still held in Gaza. When Hamas militants attacked Israel last year, they abducted about 250 hostages, of whom about 100 are still held in Gaza, including the more than 30 who the Israeli military says are dead. Israel 'facilitated the connection of the electric line specifically to the desalination plant,' the source said, adding that a mechanism was in place to track usage to 'prevent electricity from being stolen.' Israeli authorities' cooperation on the plant's reopening comes soon after it agreed to work with a U.N.-led polio vaccination drive, pausing its bombing campaign in Gaza in areas where children were receiving the doses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/desalination-plant-quietly-resumes-operations-in-gaza/7914345.html	2024-12-25T18:48:01-08:00	
Taiwan Defense Ministry warns new laws could have 'serious impact' on security	taipei, taiwan — Taiwan's Defense Ministry warned of 'serious impact' to security after opposition parties passed laws that require a cut in defense spending of about $2.45 billion as the island is facing an elevated Chinese military threat. Taiwan's opposition parties, which hold a majority in parliament, last week passed legislation to shift spending from the central government to local municipalities, a move strongly contested by the ruling Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) and thousands of protesters. In a statement late Wednesday, the Defense Ministry said it might need to cut its defense budget plan by 28% for next year, equivalent to around $2.45 billion, to meet the new funding requirements. 'It is set to deliver a serious impact to the national forces' military buildup and combat preparedness,' the ministry said. Upgrades to some equipment will not continue, and it will be difficult to make payments for purchased items in accordance with contracts, resulting in delays or cancellations, it said. The ministry said the defense budget for next year amounted to about 2.4% of Taiwan's gross domestic product, but the possible cut would take the sum below 2%, even as other countries in the region are increasing military spending. 'How do we persuade international friends to help us in critical moments when the enemy is invading us?' the ministry said. China, which views democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has ramped up military pressure in recent years to assert those claims, which Taipei strongly rejects. Joseph Wu, secretary-general of Taiwan's National Security Council, told reporters on Wednesday that more discussions were needed because the budget cut would lead to 'serious consequences.' He did not give details, but said the cut would 'send a wrong message that Taiwan does not want to defend itself. Seeing that, like-minded countries might not want to help our nation.' The Cabinet in August proposed a 7.7% year-on-year rise for military spending to $19.8 billion, a record high for Taiwan as the island adds fighter jets and missiles to strengthen deterrence against the rising threat from Beijing. The DPP lost its parliamentary majority in January elections and is in a standoff with the opposition on several issues.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-defense-ministry-warns-new-laws-could-have-serious-impact-on-security-/7914337.html	2024-12-25T18:25:47-08:00	
Turkey's soaring costs creating 'lost generation' of children	ISTANBUL — In a dim one-room apartment in one of Istanbul's poorest neighborhoods, 11-year-old Atakan Sahin curls up on a threadbare sofa with his siblings to watch TV while their mother stirs a pot of pasta. The simple meal is all the family of six can look forward to most evenings. Atakan, his two younger brothers and 5-year-old sister are among the one-third of Turkish children living in poverty. 'Look at the state of my children,' said Rukiye Sahin, 28. 'I have four children. They don't get to eat chicken, they don't get to eat meat. I send them to school with torn shoes.' Persistently high inflation, triggered by currency depreciation and unconventional economic policies that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pursued but later abandoned, has left many families struggling to pay for food and housing. Experts say it's creating a lost generation of children who have been forced to grow up too quickly to help their families eke out an existence. According to a 2023 joint report by UNICEF and the Turkish Statistical Institute, about 7 million of Turkey's roughly 22.2 million children live in poverty. Look at neighborhoods such as Istanbul's Tarlabasi, where the Sahin family lives. The Sahins eat sitting on the floor of their room — the same floor Rukiye and her husband sleep on while their children occupy the sofas. In the chilly early December night, a stove burns scraps of wood to keep them warm. They sometimes fall asleep to the sound of rats scuttling through the building. Atakan spends his days helping his father scour trash bins in search of recyclable material to earn the family a meager income. Poor children in Istanbul also earn money for their families by selling small items such as pens, tissues or bracelets at the bars and cafes in the city's entertainment districts, often working late into the night. 'I can't go to school because I have no money,' Atakan said. 'We have nothing. Can you tell me how I can go? On sunny days, when I don't go to school, I collect plastic and other things with my father. We sell whatever we find.' The cash helps buy basic foodstuffs and pay for his siblings to attend school. On the days Atakan can attend, he is ill-equipped to succeed, lacking proper shoes, a coat and textbooks for the English class he loves. The Sahins struggle to scrape together the money to cover the rent, utilities and other basic expenses as Turkey's cost-of-living crisis continues to rage. Inflation stood at 47% in November, having peaked at 85% in late 2022. Prices of food and nonalcoholic drinks were 5.1% higher in November than in the previous month. Under these circumstances, a generation of children is growing up rarely enjoying a full meal of fresh meat or vegetables. Rukiye and her husband receive 6,000 lira ($173) per month in government welfare to help toward school costs, but they pay the same amount in rent for their home. 'My son says, 'Mom, it's raining, my shoes are soaking wet.' But what can I do?' Rukiye said. 'The state doesn't help me. I'm in this room alone with my children. Who do I have except them?' The picture of children rummaging through garbage to help support their families is far from the image Turkey presents to the world: that of an influential world power with a vibrant economy favorable to foreign investment. Speaking at the G20 summit in November, Erdogan described Turkey's social security system as 'one of the most comprehensive and inclusive' in the world. 'Our goal is to ensure that not a single poor person remains. We will continue our work until we achieve this,' he said. Finance Minister Mehmet Simsek, tasked with implementing austerity and taming inflation, said the 17,000 lira ($488) monthly minimum wage isn't low. But he has pledged to raise it as soon as possible. Although the government allocates billions of lira to struggling households, inflation eats into any aid the state can give. Experts say welfare payments aren't enough for the millions who rely on them. Volunteers are trying to ease the cycle of deprivation. Mehmet Yeralan, 53, a former restaurant owner, brings essentials to Tarlabasi's poor people, including coats, notebooks and the occasional bag of rice. 'Families are in very difficult situations,' he said. 'They cannot buy food for their children and send them to school. Children are on the streets, selling tissues to support their families. We are seeing deep poverty here.' Hacer Foggo, a poverty researcher and activist, said children are forced to drop out of school to work or are channeled into vocational programs where they work four days and study one day per week, receiving a small fraction of the minimum wage. 'Look at the situation of children,' she said. 'Two million of them are in deep poverty. Child labor has become very common. Families choose these education-work programs because children bring in some income. It's not a real education, just cheaper labor.' UNICEF placed Turkey 38th out of 39 European Union or Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries in terms of child poverty between 2019 and 2021, with a child poverty rate of 34%. It is a situation Rukiye fully understands. 'We can't move forward, we always fall behind. ... When you don't have money in your hands, you always fall behind,' she said. Her eldest son, meanwhile, clings to his childhood dreams. 'I want to go to school regularly.' Atakan said. 'I want everything to be in order. … I'd like to be a football player one day, to support my family.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-s-soaring-costs-creating-lost-generation-of-children/7914317.html	2024-12-25T17:07:02-08:00	
Asia to mourn tsunami dead with ceremonies on 20th anniversary	BANDA ACEH, INDONESIA — Emotional ceremonies were expected across Asia on Thursday to remember the 220,000 people who died two decades ago when a tsunami devastated coastal areas around the Indian Ocean in one of the worst natural disasters in human history. On Dec. 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake off Indonesia's western tip generated a series of massive waves that pummeled the coastline of 14 countries from Indonesia to Somalia. Beachside memorials and religious ceremonies will be held across Asia in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand, which were the worst hit countries. 'I hope we will never experience that ever again,' said Nilawati, a 60-year-old Indonesian housewife who lost her son and mother in the tragedy. 'I learned the devastation of losing a child, a grief I can't explain with words,' she said. 'It feels like it just happened yesterday. Whenever I am reminded of it, it feels like all the blood rushes out of my body.' Victims of waves as high as 30 meters included many foreign tourists celebrating Christmas on the region's sun-kissed beaches, bringing the tragedy into homes around the globe. The seabed being ripped open pushed waves at double the speed of a bullet train, crossing the Indian Ocean within hours without warning. A total of 226,408 people died because of the tsunami, according to EM-DAT, a recognized global disaster database. There was no warning of the impending tsunami, giving little time for evacuation, despite the hourslong gaps between the waves striking different continents. But today a sophisticated network of monitoring stations has cut down warning times. Indonesia suffered the highest death toll, with more than 160,000 people killed along its western coast. In its westernmost province, Aceh, mourners were to hold a moment of silence before visits to a mass grave and a communal prayer at the grand mosque in the provincial capital, Banda Aceh. The disaster also ended a decadeslong separatist conflict in Aceh, with a peace deal between rebels and Jakarta struck less than a year later. In Sri Lanka, where more than 35,000 people perished, survivors and relatives were to gather to remember around 1,000 victims who died when waves derailed a passenger train. The mourners will board the restored Ocean Queen Express and head to Peraliya — the exact spot where it was ripped from the tracks, around 90 kilometers south of Colombo. A brief religious ceremony will be held with relatives of the dead there while Buddhist, Hindu, Christian and Muslim ceremonies are also organized to commemorate victims across the South Asian island nation. In Thailand, where half of the more than 5,000 dead were foreign tourists, unofficial vigils were expected to accompany a government memorial ceremony. At a hotel in Phang Nga province, there will be a tsunami exhibition, a documentary screening and introductions by government and U.N. bodies on disaster preparedness and resilience measures. Nearly 300 people were killed as far away as Somalia, as well as more than 100 in the Maldives and dozens in Malaysia and Myanmar. 'My children, wife, father, mother, all of my siblings were swept away,' said Indonesian survivor and fisherman Baharuddin Zainun, 70. 'The same tragedy was felt by others as well. We feel the same feelings.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/asia-to-mourn-tsunami-dead-with-ceremonies-on-20th-anniversary/7914305.html	2024-12-25T16:40:33-08:00	
Finland-Estonia electricity cable outage is latest Baltic Sea incident	HELSINKI — An undersea power cable linking Finland and Estonia suffered an outage Wednesday, Finland's prime minister said, the latest in a series of incidents involving telecom cables and energy pipelines in the Baltic Sea. Arto Pahkin, the head of operations of the Finnish electricity grid, told public broadcaster Yle that 'the possibility of sabotage cannot be ruled out.' Finland's Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said the power outage 'does not affect electricity supplies for Finns.' 'The authorities remain vigilant even during Christmas and are investigating the situation,' he added on X. Operator Fingrid said current on the EstLink 2 cable sending electricity to Estonia was cut at 12:26 p.m. local time. Last month two telecom cables in the Baltic linking neighboring Sweden and Denmark were cut. Suspicions rapidly fell on the Chinese ship Yi Peng 3, which according to ship tracking sites had sailed over the cables around the time they were cut. Sweden said Monday that China had denied a request for prosecutors to conduct an investigation on the vessel and that it had left the area. European officials said they suspected several of the incidents were sabotage linked to Russia's invasion of Ukraine, with the Kremlin dismissing that as absurd. Early on November 17, the Arelion cable running from the Swedish island of Gotland to Lithuania was damaged. The next day, the C-Lion 1 submarine cable connecting Helsinki and the German port of Rostock was cut south of Sweden's Oland island. Tensions have mounted around the Baltic since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. In September 2022, a series of underwater blasts ruptured the Nord Stream pipelines that carried Russian gas to Europe, the cause of which has yet to be determined. In October 2023, an undersea gas pipeline between Finland and Estonia was shut down after it was damaged by the anchor of a Chinese cargo ship.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finland-estonia-electricity-cable-outage-is-latest-baltic-sea-incident-/7914297.html	2024-12-25T16:29:58-08:00	
Kosovo appeals panel lets ethnic Serb party run in parliamentary election	PRISTINA, Kosovo — Kosovo's election appeals authority on Wednesday canceled a ban on the main party of the ethnic Serb minority, allowing it to field candidates in the upcoming parliamentary election. The Electoral Panel for Complaints and Appeals decided that the party, Srpska Lista, or Serb List, has 'fulfilled the political terms to be certified for registration.' The panel overturned a decision Monday by the Central Election Commission, which declined to certify the Srpska Lista party because of its nationalist stance and close ties to neighboring Serbia. The panel ruled that the commission's decision was 'contrary to the legal dispositions referring to the application and certification of the political subjects.' Of the 10 seats reserved for the Serb minority in the 120-member parliament, Srspka Lista holds nine. It will put up 48 candidates for the parliamentary election on February 9, expected to be a key test for Prime Minister Albin Kurti, whose governing party won in a landslide in 2021. Western powers also expressed concern about the commission's decision, fearing it might further aggravate the tense ties between Kosovo and Serbia, despite their efforts to normalize them. Kosovo was a Serbian province until NATO's 78-day bombing campaign in 1999 ended a war between Serbian government forces and ethnic Albanian separatists in Kosovo. The war left about 11,400 dead, mainly ethnic Albanians, and pushed Serbian forces out. Kosovo proclaimed independence in 2008, which Serbia doesn't recognize. Belgrade still considers Kosovo as its province and has a major influence on the Serb minority there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kosovo-appeals-panel-lets-ethnic-serb-party-run-in-parliamentary-election/7914044.html	2024-12-25T15:09:14-08:00

Trial moved for man accused in Trump assassination attempt in Florida	ORLANDO, FLORIDA — A man accused of attempting to assassinate President-elect Donald Trump in South Florida won't be tried until September, a federal judge ruled this week. Ryan Routh's trial will begin Sept. 8 instead of the previously scheduled Feb. 10, start date, U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said in an order released on Monday. Routh, 58, a Hawaii resident, has pleaded not guilty. Routh's attorneys had asked the judge to delay the trial until no earlier than next December, saying they needed more time to review the evidence against him and decide whether to mount an insanity defense. Routh owned 17 cellphones and numerous other electronic devices, and there are hundreds of hours of police body camera and surveillance videos that have been provided to the defense, Routh's attorneys argued during a hearing two weeks ago in Fort Pierce, Florida. In her order, Cannon said that she wanted to err on the side of providing more time given the seriousness of the allegations, but that starting the trial no earlier than December would be an excessive amount. A September trial date didn't amount to an 'unreasonable delay,' she said. The judge said that any insanity defense or any request related to Routh's mental competency must be made by early February. Any visit to the scene of the assassination attempt must be made by the end of February. Prosecutors say Routh methodically plotted to kill Trump for weeks before aiming a rifle through the shrubbery as Trump played golf on Sept. 15 at his West Palm Beach country club. Before Trump came into view, Routh was spotted by a Secret Service agent. Routh allegedly aimed his rifle at the agent, who opened fire, causing Routh to drop his weapon and flee without firing a shot. Prosecutors say he left behind a note describing his intentions. He was arrested a short time later driving on a nearby interstate. Routh's charge of attempted assassination of a major presidential candidate carries a potential life sentence if he is convicted. Other charges include assaulting a federal officer and three firearms counts. He is being held without bail at the federal jail in Miami. Routh's arrest came two months after Trump was shot and wounded in the ear in an assassination attempt during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania. The Secret Service acknowledged failings leading up to that shooting but has said security worked as it should have to thwart the potential Florida attack.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trial-moved-for-man-accused-in-trump-assassination-attempt-in-florida/7914025.html	2024-12-25T14:01:03-08:00	
More than 1,500 prisoners escape in Mozambique amid post-election unrest	Maputo, Mozambique — More than 1,500 prisoners escaped from a prison near Maputo on Wednesday, taking advantage of the third day of unrest triggered by the controversial confirmation of the long-ruling Frelimo party as the winner of recent elections. A total of 1,534 detainees escaped the high-security prison located about 15 kilometers from the capital, national police chief Bernardino Rafael said at a press conference. Among those attempting to escape, 33 were killed and 15 were wounded in clashes with prison staff, he added. A search, backed by the army, led to the arrests of about 150 fugitives, he said. Around 30 of the prisoners were linked to armed groups that have been behind unrest and attacks in the northern province of Cabo Delgado for the past seven years. 'We are particularly concerned about this situation,' Rafael said. The Portuguese-speaking African country's highest court confirmed on Monday that Frelimo, in power since 1975, won the October 9 presidential election, which had already triggered weeks of unrest. Groups of protesters approached the penitentiary on Wednesday, creating confusion and triggering unrest inside, where inmates ended up knocking down a wall through which they escaped, Rafael said. Barricades remained in several areas of the capital Wednesday, limiting movements, as acts of vandalism continued. In addition to the ransacking of stores and public buildings Monday, ambulances were set ablaze along with a drugstore and other businesses, according to an AFP correspondent. Some demonstrators also set up tables in the streets to occupy the space while celebrating Christmas with family or neighbors, an AFP journalist witnessed in several working-class districts of Maputo. Monday's confirmation of the election results came despite claims of irregularities from many observers. Frelimo leader Daniel Chapo won 65.17% of the vote, about 5 percentage points less than the initial results declared by the country's electoral commission. Chapo's main challenger, exiled opposition leader Venancio Mondlane, has claimed the election was rigged, sparking fears of violence between rival party supporters. The unrest has led to the deaths of at least 150 people, according to reports from several nongovernmental organizations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-1-500-prisoners-escape-in-mozambique-amid-post-election-unrest/7913994.html	2024-12-25T13:16:25-08:00	
Desi Bouterse, dictator convicted of murder who ruled Suriname, dies at 79	PARAMARIBO, SURINAME — Desi Bouterse, a military strongman who led a 1980 coup in the former Dutch colony of Suriname then returned to power by election three decades later despite charges of drug smuggling and murder, has died. He was 79. Surinamese President Chan Santokhi on Wednesday reflected on Bouterse's outsized legacy in a message of condolences to his family and called on the nation to 'keep calm and maintain order.' Vice President Ronnie Brunswijk wrote on Facebook that Bouterse’s 'life had a lasting impact on our country and his efforts will not be forgotten.' The cause of death was not immediately known. Bouterse was applauded by supporters for his charisma and populist social programs. For his opponents, he was a ruthless dictator who was convicted of drug trafficking and extrajudicial killings. In December 2023, Bouterse was sentenced to 20 years in prison for the murders of 15 opponents of the then-military government in December 1982, ending a historic 16-year legal process. He then vanished and never served time in jail despite the sentencing. 'There is nobody who has shaped the history of Suriname since its independence like Desi Bouterse,' said Dutch historian Pepijn Reeser, who wrote a biography of Bouterse in 2015. He said that Bouterse was the first to overcome the stark social class divide that once defined Suriname. 'Before the coup, it was unthinkable somebody from the lower class could become the most powerful man of the country. But he was also the first post-colonial leader to resort to political violence, and the first to use Suriname as a transshipment point for illegal narcotics,' Reeser said. Early Wednesday, dozens of supporters gathered outside Bouterse’s home where his wife lived, tears streaming down their faces. Many were dressed in purple, the color of his political party. Born Oct. 13, 1945, at a former sugar plantation near the capital, Paramaribo, Bouterse left for the Netherlands in 1968, as did thousands of other Surinamers in that era to seek adventure or a better life in Europe. Suriname was then still a colony, and as a Dutch citizen he was eligible for conscription, so he joined the armed forces a few months after arriving. He graduated from the Royal Military School and served at several Dutch army bases in the Netherlands and Germany. Bouterse returned to Suriname two weeks before it became an independent republic on November 25, 1975, and joined its newly formed military. The initial optimism of young military men in serving their own country quickly turned into frustration over widespread favoritism and corruption in the consecutive governments of Prime Minister Henck Arron. When Arron forbade the troops from unionizing, 16 young soldiers led by Bouterse overthrew the government on February 25, 1980, and made him the de facto ruler. When promised democratic reforms did not materialize, opposition to Bouterse’s military regime grew rapidly. Frictions between the military and opposition groups culminated in the killing of 15 men on Dec. 8, 1982. The victims were journalists, lawyers, military and university teachers, and their slaying became known as the 'December Murders.' Shocked by the killings, the Netherlands suspended all development aid, disrupting life in Suriname. Ronnie Brunswijk, a former bodyguard of Bouterse, took up arms in 1986 in a bid to oust the dictator. For six years, the country’s jungles were torn by a civil war in which both sides violated human rights and hundreds died. International isolation and the lack of domestic support for his military regime led Bouterse to accept free elections in November 1987. He established his own political movement, the National Democratic Party, but won only three of 51 seats in Parliament. Nonetheless, as commander of the armed forces, Bouterse kept a tight grip on the newly elected government of President Ramsewak Shankar. Following a conflict between Bouterse and Shankar in 1990, the army seized power again, dismissing Shankar with a phone call. Civilian rule was restored the following year. Bouterse officially left Suriname’s army in 1993, and he became what he described as a fulltime politician and businessman. In 1999, a Dutch court sentenced him in absentia to 11 years in prison for smuggling more than 1,000 pounds of cocaine to the Netherlands. The absence of an extradition treaty between the nations meant he never served his time in prison. In 2007, Suriname’s military court started a trial against Bouterse and 24 others for their alleged roles in the December Murders of 1982. Bouterse was painted as the chief instigator by the prosecution. He maintained he was not present during the executions, although he said he accepted 'political responsibility' as army commander. While the trial dragged on for more than a decade, the former military leader reinvented himself as a politician by preaching nationalism and attracting support from many ethnic groups in Suriname, whose people have African, Asian, Amerindian, European and Middle Eastern roots. He was elected president for the first time in 2010. Instead of avoiding his past, he celebrated it. He quickly declared Feb. 25, the day of his military coup in 1980, a national holiday. He awarded other suspects in the December Murders case and coup plotters with high-ranking government jobs. Inspired by the socialist politics of then-Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, Bouterse continued construction of social housing, increased social welfare benefits and raised the government pension. These popular measures secured his reelection for another five-year term in 2015 but also proved to be an unpayable burden for the state. Large budget deficits and rampant inflation ensued. Consecutive devaluations of the Surinamese dollar in 2016 resulted in the currency losing more than half of its value in just a year. 'The reckless economic policies of Bouterse have put a huge burden on our future generations, who are forced to repay millions of dollars of loans to international creditors,' Surinamese economist Winston Ramautarsing told The Associated Press in 2016. With his support dwindling during his second term, Bouterse resorted to the tactics that he used during his dictatorship, including threatening the judges of his own murder trial during public events. History books for the country’s high schools that mentioned the December Murders were banned. He regularly fired Cabinet ministers while blaming them for Suriname’s problems. In 2012, the Bouterse administration proclaimed an internationally criticized amnesty law for the December Murders in an attempt to halt the murder trial. However, the law was ruled inapplicable by the military court in 2016, and in June 2017, the prosecutor recommended a 20-year prison sentence for Bouterse. 'If it was God who made me president; who is this judge to try to send me away?' Bouterse said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/desi-bouterse-dictator-convicted-of-murder-who-ruled-suriname-dies-at-79/7913985.html	2024-12-25T13:15:55-08:00	
Clashes between Islamists now in power in Syria and Assad's supporters leave casualties	Damascus — Clashes between Islamists who took over Syria and supporters of ousted President Bashar Assad's government killed two Islamic fighters on Wednesday and wounded others, according to interim officials. The details of how the fighting erupted and who instigated the confrontation were not immediately known. Interim officials in Syria said two fighters were killed from Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, which led the stunning offensive that toppled Assad earlier this month. Syria’s transition has been surprisingly smooth but it’s only been a few weeks since Assad fled the country and his administration and forces melted away. The insurgents who ousted Assad are rooted in fundamentalist Islamist ideology, and though they have vowed to create a pluralist system, it isn’t clear how or whether they plan to share power. Since Assad’s fall, dozens of Syrians have been killed in acts of revenge, according to activists and monitors, the majority of them from the minority Alawite community, an offshoot of Shi’ite Islam that Assad belongs to. In the capital, Damascus, Alawite protesters scuffled with Sunni counter-protesters and gunshots were heard. The Associated Press could not confirm details of the shooting. Alawite protests also took place along the coast of Syria, in the city of Homs and the Hama countryside. Some called for the release of soldiers from the former Syrian army now imprisoned by the HTS. The Alawite protests were apparently in part sparked by an online video showing the burning of an Alawite shrine. The interim authorities insisted the video was old and not a recent incident. Sectarian violence has erupted in bursts since Assad's ouster but nothing close to the level feared after nearly 14 years of civil war that killed an estimated half-million people. The war fractured Syria, creating millions of refugees and displacing tens of thousands throughout the country. This week, some Syrians who were forcibly displaced started trickling home, trying to rebuild their lives. Shocked by the devastation, many found that little remains of their houses. In the northwestern Idlib region, residents were repairing shops and sealing damaged windows on Tuesday, trying to bring back a sense of normalcy. The city of Idlib and much of the surrounding province have for years been under control of the HTS, led by Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Golani, once aligned with al-Qaida, but has been the scene of relentless attacks by the government forces. Hajjah Zakia Daemessaid, who was forcibly displaced during the war, said coming back to her house in the Idlib countryside was bitter-sweet. 'My husband and I spent 43 years of hard work saving money to build our home, only to find that all of it has gone to waste,' said the 62-year-old. In the dusty neighborhoods, cars drove by with luggage strapped on top. People stood idly on the streets or sat in empty coffee shops. In Damascus, Syria's new authorities raided warehouses on Wednesday, confiscating drugs such as Captagon and cannabis, used by Assad's forces. A million Captagon pills and hundreds of kilograms (pounds) of cannabis were set ablaze, the interim authorities said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-between-islamists-now-in-power-in-syria-and-assad-s-supporters-leave-casualties-/7913931.html	2024-12-25T11:37:48-08:00	
Israeli soldier who died 417 days after his Oct. 7 wounds becomes symbol of sacrifice	MODIIN, ISRAEL — For more than 400 days after being critically wounded during Hamas’ October 7, 2023, terror attack on southern Israel, Yona Brief tried to recover. But after losing both legs and enduring medically induced comas, the combat medic died in late November. The dual Israeli-American citizen has come to symbolize the sacrifice by hundreds of fallen soldiers in what many in Israel see as a war for the country’s survival. 'He became a symbol of ‘Don’t quit,’' said his mother, Hazel. His father, David, compared him to the oil that lit the candelabra in the Hanukkah story, miraculously burning longer than expected, according to Jewish tradition. More than 800 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Hamas’ attack, about 300 of them on the initial day and the rest in Gaza or in the war against Hezbollah in Lebanon. Thousands of others have been wounded, many of them seriously. The war in Gaza has killed nearly 45,000 Palestinians, while over 3,500 people have been killed in Lebanon, according to local health officials. Serving in Israel’s military is compulsory for most Jews. Soldiers’ service is revered, and Israelis see their sacrifice as deeply moving. Public opinion in previous wars has often been swayed by high soldier casualties. Injured previously Months before Brief was called into action on October 7, he had been seriously wounded, also in his legs, by a pipe bomb during a commando raid while serving in the occupied West Bank. The weekend of October 7 was his first on duty after his recovery. As militants attacked from Gaza, he and his seven-soldier commando unit raced to join the Israeli army’s house-by-house war in the communal farming villages, military bases and towns along the border. His father said Brief’s unit was ordered to clear the Kibbutz Kfar Aza, where Hamas fighters ambushed them, killing two soldiers. When Brief rushed to help one of them, he was shot 13 times. Suddenly, his training as a medic was used to save himself. His father said he cinched tourniquets around his mutilated legs and dragged himself and a fellow soldier into a nearby bullet-ravaged home. There, the family of Hadas Eilon-Carmi hid in a reinforced room and later described Brief as the soldier 'full of blood.' Brief was evacuated to a hospital hours later. The other soldier, his commanding officer, died at the scene. The hospital stay was grueling, too. Brief was the most critically wounded patient from the October 7 attack to be treated at Sheba Medical Center in Tel Aviv, the country's largest hospital. After his legs were amputated, he teetered between life and death. He had more than 20 surgeries. His doctors told Israeli media he received more than 200 units of blood. The hospital brought specialists and surgeons from around the world in a bid to save him. Eilon-Carmi’s family became close with his family, visiting Brief in the hospital and praying for his recovery. 'Yona represents everything I want an Israeli to be,' she said. Often awake and lively Brief's determination to live became a source of inspiration for the doctors and medical staff, who had been overwhelmed by work and heartbreak in the early days of the war, said Steve Walz, the international spokesperson for Sheba Medical Center. Although there were periods when Brief was in a medically induced coma, he was often awake and lucid, even lively. He was grateful for what remained, his mother said. He worked out in his hospital bed, raising a barbell above his head. He sang and danced with visitors. Once, he even left the hospital to spend the night in his family home, but his medical issues brought him back. Brief’s parents said there were sparks of joy in the nearly 14 months after he was wounded. Chefs cooked him special meals such as sushi.

Israel and Hamas accuse each other of complicating ceasefire efforts as they inch closer to deal	Jerusalem — Israel and Hamas accused each other of complicating ceasefire efforts on Wednesday, as the two sides inch closer to a deal that could wind down the 14-month war in Gaza. The two sides appear closer than they have been in months to reaching an agreement that would bring home dozens of hostages being held in Gaza. However, talks have come close before, only to collapse. Although Israel and Hamas have expressed optimism that progress was being made toward a deal, sticking points remain over the exchange of hostages for Palestinian prisoners and the withdrawal of Israeli troops from Gaza, people involved in the talks say. On Wednesday, Hamas accused Israel of introducing new conditions related to the withdrawal from Gaza, the prisoners and the return of displaced people, which it said was delaying the deal. Israel's government accused Hamas of reneging on reneging on understandings that have already been reached.' Still, both sides said discussions are ongoing. Israel’s negotiating team, which includes members from its intelligence agencies and the military, returned from Qatar Tuesday evening for internal consultations, following a week of what it called 'significant negotiations.' During its October 7, 2023, terror attack on southern Israel, Hamas and other groups took about 250 people hostages and brought them to Gaza. A previous truce in November 2023 freed more than 100 hostages, while others have been rescued, or their remains have been recovered over the past year. Israel says about 100 hostages remain in Gaza — at least a third of whom it believes were killed during the Oct. 7 attack or died in captivity. Sporadic talks have taken place for a year, but in recent weeks there's been a renewed push to reach a deal. President-elect Donald Trump, who takes office next month for his second term, has demanded the immediate release of Israeli hostages, saying on social media that if they're not freed before he is sworn in, there will be 'HELL TO PAY.' Families of the hostages are becoming increasingly angry, calling on the Israeli government for a ceasefire before Trump is sworn in. After Israel’s high-level negotiation team returned from Doha this week, hostage families called an emergency press conference in Tel Aviv, pleading for a ceasefire and a complete end to the war. Shir Siegel, the daughter of Israeli-American Keith Siegel, whose mother was released after more than 50 days in captivity, said every delay could endanger their lives. 'There are moments when every second is fateful, and this is one of those moments,' she said. The families are planning a special candle lighting ceremony in Hostages Square Wednesday, marking the first night of Hanukkah. The agreement would take effect in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip, according to Egyptian, Hamas and American officials. The last phase would include the release of any remaining hostages, an end to the war and talks on reconstruction. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, Britain and other Western countries. Israel’s bombardment and ground invasion into Gaza have killed more than 45,000 Palestinians in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza’s 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps along the coast as the cold, wet winter sets in.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-and-hamas-accuse-each-other-of-complicating-ceasefire-efforts-as-they-inch-closer-to-a-deal-/7913857.html	2024-12-25T10:52:16-08:00	
Israeli hostages' relatives light first candle of Hanukkah at Western Wall	Relatives of hostages held in Gaza lit the first candle of Hanukkah at the Western Wall in Jerusalem on Wednesday. Some relatives cried during the lighting while holding banners with images of their loved ones who are still held captive in Gaza after more than a year. 'Families of the hostages, we all pray that even today, they will return to Jerusalem, to the Holy Land, safe and well,' said Western Wall Rabbi Shmuel Rabinovitch. Israel says Hamas is holding 100 hostages, over one-third of whom are believed to be dead. The Israeli negotiating team working on a ceasefire returned from Qatar to Israel on Tuesday, the prime minister’s office said, after what it called 'a significant week' of talks. After months of deadlock, the United States, Qatar and Egypt resumed their mediation efforts in recent weeks and reported greater willingness by the warring sides to reach a deal. According to Egyptian and Hamas officials, the proposed agreement would take place in phases and include a halt in fighting, an exchange of captive Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, and a surge in aid to the besieged Gaza Strip. The war in Gaza was sparked by Hamas’s attack on southern Israel in October 2023, during which about 1,200 people were killed and 250 taken hostage by Palestinian militants. Israel's bombardment and ground invasion in Gaza has killed over 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza’s Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. On Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said there was 'some progress' in efforts to reach a deal but added he did not know how long it would take.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-hostages-relatives-light-first-candle-of-hanukkah-at-western-wall/7913823.html	2024-12-25T10:21:41-08:00	
Pope urges 'all people of all nations' to silence arms and overcome divisions in Christmas address	Vatican City — Pope Francis in his traditional Christmas message on Wednesday urged 'all people of all nations' to find courage during this Holy Year 'to silence the sounds of arms and overcome divisions' plaguing the world, from the Middle East to Ukraine, Africa to Asia. The pontiff's 'Urbi et Orbi' — 'To the City and the World' — address serves as a summary of the woes facing the world this year. As Christmas coincided with the start of the 2025 Holy Year celebration that he dedicated to hope, Francis called for broad reconciliation, 'even [with] our enemies.' 'I invite every individual, and all people of all nations ... to become pilgrims of hope, to silence the sounds of arms and overcome divisions,'' the pope said from the loggia of St. Peter's Basilica to throngs of people below. The pope invoked the Holy Door of St. Peter’s Basilica, which he opened on Christmas Eve to launch the 2025 Jubilee, as representing God’s mercy, which 'unties every knot; it tears down every wall of division; it dispels hatred and the spirit of revenge.' He called for arms to be silenced in war-torn Ukraine and in the Middle East, singling out Christian communities in Israel and the Palestinian territories, 'particularly in Gaza where the humanitarian situation is extremely grave,' as well as Lebanon and Syria 'at this most delicate time.' Francis repeated his calls for the release of hostages taken from Israel by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023. He cited a deadly outbreak of measles in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and the suffering of the people of Myanmar, forced to flee their homes by 'the ongoing clash of arms.' The pope likewise remembered children suffering from war and hunger, the elderly living in solitude, those fleeing their homelands, who have lost their jobs, and are persecuted for their faith. Pilgrims were lined up on Christmas Day to walk through the great Holy Door at the entrance of St. Peter’s Basilica, as the Jubilee is expected to bring some 32 million Catholic faithful to Rome. Traversing the Holy Door is one way that the faithful can obtain indulgences, or forgiveness for sins during a Jubilee, a once-every-quarter-century tradition that dates from 1300. Pilgrims submitted to security controls before entering the Holy Door, amid new security fears following a deadly Christmas market attack in Germany. Many paused to touch the door as they passed and made the sign of the cross upon entering the basilica dedicated to St. Peter, the founder of the Roman Catholic Church. 'You feel so humble when you go through the door that once you go through is almost like a release, a release of emotions,'' said Blanca Martin, a pilgrim from San Diego. '... It’s almost like a release of emotions, you feel like now you are able to let go and put everything in the hands of God. See I am getting emotional. It’s just a beautiful experience.' A Chrismukkah miracle as Hanukkah and Christmas coincide Hanukkah, Judaism’s eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900. The calendar confluence has inspired some religious leaders to host interfaith gatherings, such as a Hanukkah party hosted last week by several Jewish organizations in Houston, Texas, bringing together members of the city’s Latino and Jewish communities for latkes, the traditional potato pancake eaten on Hanukkah, topped with guacamole and salsa. While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it’s taking place this year as wars rage in the Middle East and fears rise over widespread incidents of antisemitism. The holidays overlap infrequently because the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar, which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. Iraqi Christians persist in their faith Christians in Nineveh Plains attended Christmas Mass on Tuesday at the Mar Georgis church in the center of Telaskaf, Iraq, with security concerns about the future. 'We feel that they will pull the rug out from under our feet at any time. Our fate is unknown here,' said Bayda Nadhim, a resident of Telaskaf. Iraq’s Christians, whose presence there goes back nearly to the time of Christ, belong to a number of rites and denominations. They once constituted a sizeable minority in Iraq, estimated at around 1.4 million. But the community has steadily dwindled since the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and further in 2014 when the Islamic State militant group swept through the area. The exact number of Christians left in Iraq is not clear, but they are thought to number several hundred thousand. German celebrations muted by market attack German celebrations were darkened by a car attack on a Christmas market in Magdeburg on Friday that left five people dead, including a 9-year-old boy, and 200 people injured. President Frank-Walter Steinmeier rewrote his recorded Christmas Day speech to address the attack, saying, 'There is grief, pain, horror and incomprehension over what took place in Magdeburg.' He urged Germans to 'stand together' and that 'hate and violence must not have the last word.' A 50-year-old Saudi doctor who had practiced medicine in Germany since 2006 was arrested on suspicion of murder, attempted murder and bodily harm. The suspect’s X account describes him as a former Muslim and is filled with anti-Islamic themes. He criticized authorities for failing to combat 'the Islamification of Germany' and voiced support for the anti-immigration Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-urges-all-people-of-all-nations-to-silence-arms-and-overcome-divisions-in-christmas-address/7913720.html	2024-12-25T08:48:37-08:00	
NORAD's Santa tracker was Cold War morale boost. Now it attracts millions of kids	The Christmas tradition has become nearly global in scope: Children from around the world track Santa Claus as he sweeps across the earth, delivering presents and defying time. Each year, at least 100,000 kids call into the North American Aerospace Defense Command to inquire about Santa’s location. Millions more follow online in nine languages, from English to Japanese. On any other night, NORAD is scanning the heavens for potential threats, such as last year’s Chinese spy balloon. But on Christmas Eve, volunteers in Colorado Springs are fielding questions like, 'When is Santa coming to my house?' and, 'Am I on the naughty or nice list?' 'There are screams and giggles and laughter,' said Bob Sommers, 63, a civilian contractor and NORAD volunteer. Sommers often says on the call that everyone must be asleep before Santa arrives, prompting parents to say, 'Do you hear what he said? We got to go to bed early.' NORAD’s annual tracking of Santa has endured since the Cold War, predating ugly sweater parties and Mariah Carey classics. The tradition continues regardless of government shutdowns, such as the one in 2018, and this year. Here’s how it began and why the phones keep ringing. Origin story is Hollywood-esque It started with a child’s accidental phone call in 1955. The Colorado Springs newspaper printed a Sears advertisement that encouraged children to call Santa, listing a phone number. A boy called. But he reached the Continental Air Defense Command, now NORAD, a joint U.S. and Canadian effort to spot potential enemy attacks. Tensions were growing with the Soviet Union, along with anxieties about nuclear war. Air Force Col. Harry W. Shoup picked up an emergency-only 'red phone' and was greeted by a tiny voice that began to recite a Christmas wish list. 'He went on a little bit, and he takes a breath, then says, ‘Hey, you’re not Santa,’' Shoup told The Associated Press in 1999. Realizing an explanation would be lost on the youngster, Shoup summoned a deep, jolly voice and replied, 'Ho, ho, ho! Yes, I am Santa Claus. Have you been a good boy?' Shoup said he learned from the boy’s mother that Sears mistakenly printed the top-secret number. He hung up, but the phone soon rang again with a young girl reciting her Christmas list. Fifty calls a day followed, he said. In the pre-digital age, the agency used an 18-by-24-meter plexiglass map of North America to track unidentified objects. A staff member jokingly drew Santa and his sleigh over the North Pole. The tradition was born. 'Note to the kiddies,' began an AP story from Colorado Springs on Dec. 23, 1955. 'Santa Claus Friday was assured safe passage into the United States by the Continental Air Defense Command.' In a likely reference to the Soviets, the article noted that Santa was guarded against possible attack from 'those who do not believe in Christmas.' Is the origin story humbug? Some grinchy journalists have nitpicked Shoup’s story, questioning whether a misprint or a misdial prompted the boy’s call. In 2014, tech news site Gizmodo cited an International News Service story from December 1, 1955, about a child’s call to Shoup. Published in the Pasadena Independent, the article said the child reversed two digits in the Sears number. 'When a childish voice asked COC commander Col. Harry Shoup, if there was a Santa Claus at the North Pole, he answered much more roughly than he should — considering the season: ‘There may be a guy called Santa Claus at the North Pole, but he’s not the one I worry about coming from that direction,’' Shoup said in the brief piece. In 2015, The Atlantic magazine doubted the flood of calls to the secret line, while noting that Shoup had a flair for public relations. Phone calls aside, Shoup was indeed media savvy. In 1986, he told the Scripps Howard News Service that he recognized an opportunity when a staff member drew Santa on the glass map in 1955. A lieutenant colonel promised to have it erased. But Shoup said, 'You leave it right there,' and summoned public affairs. Shoup wanted to boost morale for the troops and public alike. 'Why, it made the military look good — like we’re not all a bunch of snobs who don’t care about Santa Claus,' he said. Shoup died in 2009. His children told the StoryCorps podcast in 2014 that it was a misprinted Sears ad that prompted the phone calls. 'And later in life he got letters from all over the world,' said Terri Van Keuren, a daughter. 'People saying, ‘Thank you, Colonel, for having, you know, this sense of humor.’' Rare addition to Santa’s story NORAD’s tradition is one of the few modern additions to the centuries-old Santa story that have endured, according to Gerry Bowler, a Canadian historian who spoke to the AP in 2010. Ad campaigns or movies try to 'kidnap' Santa for commercial purposes, said Bowler, who wrote 'Santa Claus: A Biography.' NORAD, by contrast, takes an essential element of Santa’s story and views it through a technological lens. In a recent interview with the AP, Air Force Lt. Gen. Case Cunningham explained that NORAD radars in Alaska and Canada — known as the northern warning system — are the first to detect Santa. He leaves the North Pole and typically heads for the international dateline in the Pacific Ocean. From there he moves west, following the night. 'That’s when the satellite systems we use to track and identify targets of interest every single day start to kick in,' Cunningham said. 'A probably little-known fact is that Rudolph’s nose that glows red emanates a lot of heat. And so those satellites track [Santa] through that heat source.' NORAD has an app and website, www.noradsanta.org, that will track Santa on Christmas Eve from 4 a.m. to midnight, mountain standard time. People can call 1-877-HI-NORAD to ask live operators about Santa’s location from 6 a.m. to midnight, mountain time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7913717.html	2024-12-25T08:43:13-08:00	
Russian cargo ship which sank off Spanish coast was victim of 'act of terrorism,' RIA cites owner	Moscow — A Russian cargo ship called Ursa Major that sank in the Mediterranean Sea was the victim of 'an act of terrorism,' state news agency RIA cited the vessel's owner as saying on Wednesday. The ship, built in 2009, sank after an explosion ripped through its engine room and two of its 16 crew were missing, the Russia's Foreign Ministry said Tuesday. RIA cited Oboronlogistika, the ship's ultimate owner and a company that is part of the Russian Defense Ministry's military construction operations, as saying the vessel had been targeted in 'a terrorist act.' Oboronlogistika had previously said that the ship had been en route to the Russian far eastern port of Vladivostok with two giant port cranes lashed to its deck.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-cargo-ship-which-sank-off-spanish-coast-was-victim-of-act-of-terrorism-ria-cites-owner-/7913703.html	2024-12-25T08:35:50-08:00	
King Charles thanks medics for his and Kate's cancer care	London — King Charles thanked the medics who have cared for him and his daughter-in-law Kate, after they both underwent treatment for cancer this year, in a Christmas Day message that touched on global conflicts and the summer's riots in Britain. In his third Christmas TV broadcast since becoming king, Charles struck an unusually personal tone for the royal seasonal message, a tradition that dates back to a radio speech by George V in 1932. The year has been traumatic for the royals after Buckingham Palace said in February the 76-year-old had been diagnosed with an unspecified form of cancer detected in tests after a corrective procedure for an enlarged prostate. A month later, Kate, the wife of his son and heir Prince William, said she was undergoing preventative chemotherapy for cancer that concluded in September. William has said the year has been brutal for the family. 'All of us go through some form of suffering at some stage in our life, be it mental or physical,' Charles, who became king in 2022 after the death of Queen Elizabeth, said. His words were accompanied by footage of a visit he made to a cancer treatment center on returning to public duties in April and of one of Kate's first engagements when she resumed working. 'From a personal point of view, I offer special heartfelt thanks to the selfless doctors and nurses who this year have supported me and other members of my family through the uncertainties and anxieties of illness, and have helped provide the strength, care and comfort we have needed,' Charles said. 'I am deeply grateful too to all those who have offered us their own kind words of sympathy and encouragement,' he said in the pre-recorded broadcast that was filmed at an ornate chapel of a former London hospital. Last week, a palace source said the king's treatment was progressing well and would continue into next year. Earlier on Wednesday, Charles was joined by his family, including Kate, William and their children, for a traditional church service on his Sandringham estate in eastern England. Charles' brother Prince Andrew, who was embroiled in another scandal this month when a close business associate was banned from Britain over government suspicions he was a Chinese agent, was a notable absentee from the royal get-together. Diversity a strength The king spoke about nationwide riots, which broke out following the murder in July of three girls at a Taylor Swift-themed event in northern England, and mainly targeted mosques and immigrants. 'Diversity of culture, ethnicity and faith provide strength, not weakness', he said. 'I felt a deep sense of pride here in the United Kingdom when in response to anger and lawlessness in several towns this summer, communities came together not to repeat these behaviors, but to repair, to repair not just buildings, but relationships,' he said. Charles also referenced ongoing wars. 'On this Christmas Day, we cannot help but think of those for whom the devastating effects of conflict in the Middle East, in central Europe, in Africa and elsewhere, pose a daily threat to so many people's lives and livelihoods,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/king-charles-thanks-medics-for-his-and-kate-s-cancer-care-/7913696.html	2024-12-25T08:24:45-08:00	
Biden signs bill officially making the bald eagle the national bird of the US	Washington — The bald eagle, a symbol of the power and strength of the United States for more than 240 years, earned an overdue honor Tuesday: It officially became the country's national bird. President Joe Biden signed into law legislation sent to him by Congress that amends the United States Code to correct what had long gone unnoticed and designate the bald eagle — familiar to many because of its white head, yellow beak and brown body — as the national bird. The bald eagle has appeared on the Great Seal of the United States, which is used in official documents, since 1782, when the design was finalized. The seal is made up of the eagle, an olive branch, arrows, a flag-like shield, the motto 'E Pluribus Unum' and a constellation of stars. Congress, that same year, designated the bald eagle as the the national emblem, and its image appears in a host of places, ranging from documents and the presidential flag to military insignia and U.S. currency, according to USA.gov. But it had never been officially designated to be what many had just assumed it was — the national bird. The bald eagle is indigenous to North America.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-signs-a-bill-officially-making-the-bald-eagle-the-national-bird-of-the-us-/7913680.html	2024-12-25T08:13:31-08:00

Call for safety in Bangladesh Rohingya refugee camps after fatal fire	Kolkata, India — Sitting before a pile of dilapidated shacks and ashes in Cox’s Bazar, Bangladesh, 80-year-old Rohingya refugee Amena Khatun began weeping as she talked about her 60-year-old son, Abul Hair. 'He was well and alive next to us, less than 24 hours ago,' she told VOA. 'And then, the fire broke out.' At least two people were killed and over 4,000 rendered homeless Tuesday by the sudden outbreak of a massive fire in the Rohingya refugee camp in Kutupalong. More than a million Rohingya people reside in bamboo-and-tarpaulin shacks across Cox’s Bazar, with several thousand others pouring in over the last few months, fleeing clashes in their native Myanmar between the government and the rebel Arakan Army. At around 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, Khatun, alongside thousands of other Rohingya people in Kutupalong, first noticed the fire. 'My son had initially left our shelter with us when the fire started. But he went back to retrieve some important documents—and never made it out as he got stuck behind the intense flames,' said Khatun. 'Our lives are made to depend on the few documents we do possess as stateless refugees. But now, my son—a loving father of five—is gone along with the documents, all because of the sudden fire.' According to the Cox’s Bazar-based Refugee Relief and Repatriation Commissioner, or RRRC, of Bangladesh, the casualties include at least 19 Rohingya people, who were injured in the fire. The catastrophe also destroyed crucial infrastructure in the refugee camp like water tanks, tap stands, toilets and bath stalls. Mosques and offices of RRRC’s partner organizations were also damaged. Scant relief efforts RRRC Commissioner Mohammed Mizanur Rahman told VOA that the fire was brought under control by their officials, including the camp-in-charge, volunteers and the fire brigade. 'We had to demolish some shelters to prevent the fire from spreading. We, alongside the UNHCR and partner NGOs, have ensured that everyone left homeless has a temporary roof to sleep under, starting tonight,' he said. The U.N. World Food Program, WFP, will serve the fire survivors regular meals 'until they are fit to take care of themselves again,' Rahman said, adding that his team hopes to build them new shelters as soon as possible. While the cause of the fire has yet to be determined, fire service and civil defense senior official Tanharul Islam told reporters Tuesday that an investigation has been launched. However, survivors of the fire told VOA that as of Wednesday morning, they had not yet received any relief assistance. 'We have not received any help from the authorities or local NGOs yet,' said Khatun, the surviving parent of Abu Hair who lost his life yesterday. 'We don’t even know how the fire started.' A six-year-old boy, Burhanuddin, was the other camp resident killed in Tuesday’s fire. His father, 34-year-old Muzifur Rahman, echoed Khatun’s remark regarding assistance after the tragedy. 'In fact, our Rohingya refugee community in Cox’s Bazar has never been educated on any safety measures or protocols we are to follow to prevent or survive such fires,' he said. Recurring problem — across borders Bereaved father Rahman said that he is especially worried about his surviving family members because such fires are 'surprisingly common' in the Rohingya refugee camps. 'It makes me wonder if many of these fires are caused deliberately,' he said. Over 1,000 shelters were destroyed in a fire believed to have been started accidentally by a mud oven, mentioned by the UNHCR in their social media post, in the same camp in January of this year. In 2023, a fire that burned down the shelters of over 12,000 Rohingya refugees in Cox’s Bazar was described as a 'planned act of sabotage' by a senior government official, who said that the arson was carried out by militant groups. VOA had reported that the fire was started by feuding Rohingya gangs in the camps. On the other side of the border, in India, many Rohingya refugees living in camps face the same challenge. The Social and Political Research Foundation has reported that at least 12 'mysterious' fires broke out across Rohingya refugee camps in India between 2016 and 2021. Many of the incidents of arson are suspected to have been orchestrated by right-wing Hindu nationalist groups in the country. Responsibility for a 2018 fire in India that wrecked over 50 Rohingya refugee shelters was claimed by the youth wing of the ruling right-wing Bharatiya Janata Party, or BJP. Mohammed Arfan, a senior member of the Wash, Sanitation and Hygiene project with Community Partners International in Bangladesh, said that Rohingya refugee families in Cox’s Bazar live in overcrowded and extremely cramped shelters made of highly flammable material, often cooking with gas cylinders in unsafe conditions. 'These families have survived a genocide and lost everything already. Now, they face yet another tragedy. They are not just statistics, but parents, children and grandparents who have lost their homes, memories and loved ones,' he said. 'This fire is a reminder that we need to do more, not just in the aftermath of these tragedies but to prevent them from happening at all.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/call-for-safety-in-bangladesh-rohingya-refugee-camps-after-fatal-fire/7913606.html	2024-12-25T07:18:50-08:00	
American imprisoned in Russia sentenced to new 15-year jail term for espionage	Moscow — A Russian-born U.S. citizen already imprisoned in Russia on a bribery conviction has been handed a second 15-year jail term for espionage, Russian news agencies reported Tuesday. A Moscow court brought espionage charges against Gene Spector in August 2023. Details surrounding the case were not made public. The U.S. State Department said it was aware of reports of the sentencing of a U.S. citizen in Russia and was monitoring the situation. Spector, formerly an executive at a medical equipment company in Russia, was previously sentenced to more than three years in prison in September 2022 for enabling bribes to an aide of former deputy prime minister Arkady Dvorkovich. The aide, Anastasia Alekseyeva, was sentenced to 12 years in April for taking bribes of two expensive overseas vacation trips. Dvorkovich was a deputy prime minister under Dmitry Medvedev from 2012 to 2018. He is currently head of the international chess federation FIDE.	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-imprisoned-in-russia-sentenced-to-new-15-year-jail-term-for-espionage/7913592.html	2024-12-25T06:47:18-08:00

Taliban allege Pakistani military strikes kill dozens in Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — Taliban officials in Afghanistan reported Wednesday that at least 46 people were killed in an eastern border region because of an overnight aerial bombing that allegedly was conducted by Pakistan. Zabihullah Mujahid, the Taliban government spokesperson, stated that the attack on Tuesday evening targeted four locations in Barmal, a remote mountainous district in the Afghan border province of Paktika. 'The total number of dead is 46, most of whom were children and women,' Mujahid told the Agence France-Presse news agency, adding that six more civilians were wounded. The veracity of his claims regarding the purported casualties could not be ascertained from independent sources. While Pakistan has not commented on the allegations it had carried out the strikes, Pakistani security officials told reporters on condition of anonymity that the country carried out counterinsurgency precision airstrikes in Barmal. The officials, who were not authorized to interact with the media publicly, asserted that the military actions targeted multiple locations in the Afghan district that were associated with the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP. Islamabad maintains that the globally designated terrorist group orchestrates lethal attacks on Pakistani civilians and security personnel from its Afghan sanctuaries. The Afghan Ministry of National Defense condemned the strikes as 'barbaric' and a 'clear act of aggression' by Pakistan in violation of international laws. It asserted that both Afghan nationals and Pakistani refugee families residing in Barmal were the victims of the attack. 'The Islamic Emirate considers this brutal bombing a violation of international principles and a clear act of aggression,' said the Afghan Ministry of National Defense, using the official title of the Taliban government. 'This cowardly attack will not go unanswered,' the statement warned, without elaborating. The aerial attack came two days after heavily armed TTP militants stormed a security outpost in South Waziristan, a Pakistani district bordering Barmal, and killed 16 soldiers in one of the deadliest insurgent raids on Pakistan's military in recent months. Tuesday's strikes also came on a day when Taliban leaders hosted meetings with a high-level Pakistani delegation, marking the resumption of such interactions after a yearlong pause because of terrorism allegations. Taliban leaders have consistently denied allegations that Afghan territory is being used as a launching pad for attacks. The de facto Afghan government maintains it does not support the TTP or any other foreign militant group, describing the violence in Pakistan as an 'internal problem' for the neighboring country to resolve rather than blaming Kabul for the crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-allege-pakistani-military-strikes-kill-dozens-in-afghanistan/7913526.html	2024-12-25T05:49:19-08:00	
China, Japan foreign ministers meet and agree on visit, security dialog	BEIJING/TOKYO — Talks between China and Japan's foreign ministers in Beijing have paved way for Japan to host China's foreign affairs chief next year, and mutual agreement to hold a security dialog as soon as possible, Japan said on Wednesday. No details were given for when the events will take place but Japan's Takeshi Iwaya told reporters after his meeting and a working lunch with Chinese counterpart Wang Yi that both agreed on continued high-level talks, including potentially an economic dialog during the 2025 visit. The one-day visit is Iwaya's first to the Chinese capital since becoming Japan's foreign minister in October, to discuss thorny issues with his country's largest trading partner. It follows an agreement between leaders of both countries to work towards a mutually beneficial strategic relationship. Ties between the neighbors -- trade partners with close economic and investment ties but rivals in security and territorial claims -- are complicated with long-standing geopolitical disagreements and historical wartime sensitivities. Iwaya raised several security concerns, urging China to take 'necessary action' including removing a buoy Japan had identified and believe was installed by China in the exclusive economic zone near one of Japan's southernmost islands. 'I also expressed my serious concerns about the situation in the East China Sea...and the increasing activity of the Chinese military,' he said. On regional concerns, Wang and Iwaya discussed North Korea. Iwaya sought for China to partake in 'a responsible role in maintaining peace and security in the international community,' he said. Japan has expressed 'grave concern' over North Korea's security alliance with Russia, in which North Korea stands to gain advanced military technology and combat experience. Wang stressed in the meeting that the significance of the countries' relationship went beyond bilateral ties. 'If China-Japan relations are stable, Asia will be more stable,' Wang said at the start of their meeting. Visa rules and seafood ban In reciprocity to China's eased visa rules, Japan will remove some requirements for three-year multiple entry tourist visas for Chinese citizens and allow those on group visas to stay up to 30 days, an increase from the previous 15. The country also has introduced a new 10-year multiple entry tourist visa. Last month, Beijing expanded its visa-free arrangements to include Japan until the end of 2025, restoring a policy that was suspended during the pandemic. China also extended the stay period to 30 days from 15. Japanese citizens were able to enter China without a visa for up to 14 days before COVID-19. Iwaya pointed out that addressing the safety and security of Japanese nationals was important to increase travel between Japan and China. Cases of Japanese nationals detained under China's anti-espionage law and the lack of transparency around the law have led to Japanese people feeling hesitant about traveling to China, Iwaya said, calling for more transparency and the release of those detained. Their discussion of China's ban on Japanese seafood, highly expected on the agenda, did not indicate any easing on restrictions, but only that both sides agreed to 'properly implement' a recent agreement. A major sticking point in bilateral ties has been Japan's discharge of treated radioactive wastewater from the wrecked Fukushima nuclear plant that Beijing strongly opposed and responded to by tightening inspections on Japanese goods. China was Japan's largest export market for aquatic products until Beijing fully banned them in protest against Tokyo's actions. Both governments reached an agreement in September that obligates Japan to set up a long-term international monitoring arrangement allowing stakeholders such as China to conduct independent sampling of the treated water. That was expected to restart the imports but China still wants reassurances from Tokyo that it would fulfill its commitment before 'adjusting relevant measures' and gradually restore imports that meet standards and regulations. However, both countries were ready to restart talks on resuming Japanese beef and rice imports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-japan-foreign-ministers-meet-and-agree-on-visit-security-dialog/7913478.html	2024-12-25T04:55:49-08:00	
Bosnia's Serb MPs move to block state institutions, EU integration	SARAJEVO — Lawmakers in Bosnia's Serb Republic regional parliament on Wednesday ordered Serb representatives in state institutions to block decision-making and reform laws needed for the Balkan country's integration into the European Union. An emergency session of parliament was called on Tuesday evening to discuss a 'degradation of a legal system' in relation to the ongoing trial of the region's president Milorad Dodik at Bosnia's state court. Dodik, a Serb separatist leader, is being tried for defying decisions by the international High Representative which oversees peace in the country under the 1995 Dayton Accords which ended 3-1/2 years of ethnic war. The MPs said the trial was 'politically mounted,' based on the 'illegal decisions' of current envoy Christian Schmidt and of the state court and prosecution which they regard as unconstitutional because they were set up by the peace envoy and not by the Dayton treaty. Pro-Russian Dodik has tried hard to separate his Serb-dominated region from Bosnia in recent years but halted the process after the start of the war in Ukraine. Under the Dayton treaty, Bosnia was split into two autonomous regions, the Serb Republic and a Federation dominated by Croats and Bosniaks linked via a weak central government. That secured peace but left Bosnia dysfunctional as a state. After years of political obstructions to joining the EU, Bosnia received a boost last year when EU leaders agreed to open negotiations once it had reached the necessary compliance with membership criteria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bosnia-s-serb-mps-move-to-block-state-institutions-eu-integration/7913446.html	2024-12-25T03:57:14-08:00	
Houthis claim missile attack targeting central Israel	The Yemen-based Houthi militant group said Wednesday it fired a ballistic missile at the Tel Aviv area in central Israel, an attack that prompted air raid sirens to sound but caused no damage. Israel’s military said it intercepted the missile before it crossed into Israeli territory. The missile was the second in the span of two days launched by the Houthis and the latest in a campaign they say is in solidarity with the Palestinians amid the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. In addition to launching missiles at Israel, the Houthis have also disrupted the key shipping routes in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden with attacks against ships. Israeli officials have become more direct in their rhetoric toward the Houthis in recent days, pledging to take action against the Iran-backed group. Hostage deaths The presence of Israeli troops inadvertently contributed to the deaths in August of six hostages held in Gaza, according to the results of an investigation by the Israeli military released Tuesday. The six hostages, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, were taken by Hamas militants during the October 7, 2023, raid on Israel. They were killed by Hamas after nearly 330 days in captivity. The military's report found that 'ground activities in the area, although gradual and cautious, had a circumstantial influence on the terrorists' decision' to kill the six hostages. Their bodies were found 48 to 72 hours later in a tunnel in late August, the report said. The military was operating in that area of southern Gaza because the likelihood that hostages were there was considered medium to low, the report said. 'The investigation published tonight proves once again that the return of all hostages will only be possible through a deal,' the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement on Tuesday. Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in their 2023 attack on southern Israel and took about 250 others hostage. There are still around 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, though at least one-third are believed to be dead. Israel's counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,300 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/houthis-claim-missile-attack-targeting-central-israel/7913392.html	2024-12-25T02:19:57-08:00	
Passenger plane flying from Azerbaijan to Russia crashes in Kazakhstan with many feared dead	ASTANA — An Embraer passenger plane flying from Azerbaijan to Russia crashed near the city of Aktau in Kazakhstan on Wednesday with 62 passengers and five crew on board, Kazakh authorities announced, saying that 27 people had survived. Unverified video of the crash showed the plane, which was operated by Azerbaijan Airlines, bursting into flames as it hit the ground and thick black smoke then rising. Bloodied and bruised passengers could be seen stumbling from a piece of the fuselage that had remained intact. The Central Asian country's emergencies ministry said in a statement that fire services had put out the blaze and that the survivors, including three children, were being treated at a nearby hospital. Azerbaijan Airlines said the Embraer 190 aircraft, with flight number J2-8243, had been flying from Baku to Grozny, the capital of Russia's Chechnya, but had been forced to make an emergency landing approximately 3 km from the Kazakh city of Aktau. Russian news agencies said the plane had been rerouted due to fog in Grozny. Authorities in Kazakhstan said they had begun looking into different possible versions of what had happened, including a technical problem, Russia's Interfax news agency reported. Russia's aviation watchdog said in a statement that preliminary information suggested the pilot had decided to make an emergency landing after a bird strike. Following the crash, Ilham Aliyev, the president of Azerbaijan, was returning home from Russia where he had been due to attend a summit on Wednesday, Russia's RIA news agency reported. Ramzan Kadyrov, the Kremlin-backed leader of Chechnya, expressed his condolences in a statement and said those being treated in hospital were in an extremely serious condition and that he and others would pray for their rapid recovery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/passenger-plane-flying-from-azerbaijan-to-russia-crashes-in-kazakhstan-with-many-feared-dead/7913375.html	2024-12-25T01:15:42-08:00	
India Faces Diplomatic Challenge as Bangladesh Calls for Hasina’s Extradition	NEW DELHI — A formal request by Bangladesh to India to extradite former prime minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India after she was ousted by mass student-led protests, poses a diplomatic conundrum for New Delhi, say analysts. Since Hasina’s exit, who was New Delhi’s close ally during her 15-year rule of neighboring Bangladesh, India has been trying to build ties with the new administration that has requested her return to 'face a judicial process.' Confirming that it has received a diplomatic note for her extradition, India’s foreign ministry said on Monday that 'we have no comment to offer on this matter.' Political analysts say relations with Dhaka, which are already fraught, are likely to be further strained over the extradition request. 'This places Delhi in an uncomfortable position and will undermine ties with the interim government because India simply cannot accede to this request,' said Manoj Joshi, distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'She has sought political sanctuary here.' The extradition request for Hasina came two months after the Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal issued arrest warrants for the country’s former prime minister. She was summoned to appear to face charges of 'crimes against humanity' that took place during demonstrations in which hundreds were killed. However, analysts say there is no likelihood of India acceding to the extradition request. Both countries have an extradition treaty, but it allows for requests to be refused if the offense is of 'political nature.' 'There are no circumstances under which I can envision New Delhi granting this request,’’ said Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute, Wilson Center, in Washington. ‘’Hasina has arguably been India's closest friend in the neighborhood, and for a long time. New Delhi isn't about to turn on her. It will likely try to invoke one of the clauses in the extradition treaty to justify not turning her over to Dhaka.' The formal request to New Delhi comes two weeks after talks between India's foreign secretary, Vikram Misri, and the interim government in Dhaka raised hopes that ties between the South Asian neighbors would stabilize. It was the first high-level diplomatic meeting between the two countries since Hasina’s exit stressed relations. India has complained about what it said were attacks on minority Hindus in the Muslim-majority country in recent months. Bangladesh's interim leader, Muhammad Yunus, who met Misri, said the reports were exaggerated and asked India to help clear the 'clouds' that have cast a shadow over the relationship in recent times. Both countries said they were keen to pursue constructive relations. The extradition request, however, will be seen as a dampener on efforts to bring the relationship back on an even keel. 'The Bangladesh government is putting pressure on India, saying that if you want friendly ties, then repatriate her,' said analyst Joshi. India’s strong backing for Hasina during her 15-year rule was seen by many in Bangladesh as having contributed to the erosion of democracy in the country and had deepened anger against India, according to analysts in Dhaka. Hasina was perceived as an authoritarian ruler who had clamped down on dissent. 'In Bangladesh, there is widespread support to bring Hasina back to face trial. If India does not repatriate her, which it is unlikely to do, this will deepen anti-India sentiment in the country,' according to Khandakar Tahmid Rejwan, a researcher with the Bangladesh Peace Observatory in Dhaka. Hasina’s presence in India has made it challenging for Delhi to develop friendly ties with the new interim government in Dhaka. For India, a strong relationship with Bangladesh is important to ensure stability along their 4096-kilometer-long border in a neighborhood where it already confronts Pakistan and China along hostile borders. It is also important for the security of its northeastern states that share a border with Bangladesh. Trade has grown and both countries have built connectivity projects to boost economic ties. 'India will soft pedal the extradition issue for the time being,’’ said Tara Kartha, director of research and analysis at the Center for Land Warfare Studies in New Delhi. ‘’Hopefully, once an elected government comes, they will moderate their stand, over a period of time. There is an anti-India feeling, but you will certainly not give a signal to the entire neighborhood that you will not stand by a former ally.' Yunus has said Bangladesh's next elections will be held in late 2025 or early 2026. While the issue will be an irritant over the coming months, analysts say in the long run, both countries will smoothen ties. 'India likely knew Bangladesh would make the (extradition) request, and I'm sure Dhaka assumes New Delhi will say no,' said Kugelman, who said that while the relationship is in a 'bad place,’’ the issue is 'something that they can work around.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-faces-diplomatic-challenge-as-bangladesh-calls-for-hasina-s-extradition/7913341.html	2024-12-24T23:35:02-08:00	
Sweeping Vietnam internet law comes into force	BANGKOK — New Vietnamese internet rules requiring Facebook and TikTok to verify user identities and hand over data to authorities came into force on Wednesday, in what critics say is the latest attack on freedom of expression in the Southeast Asian nation. Under 'Decree 147,' all tech giants operating in Vietnam are required to verify users' accounts via their phone numbers or Vietnamese identification numbers, and store that information alongside their full name and date of birth. They must provide that data to authorities on request and remove any content the government regards as 'illegal' within 24 hours. The new rules came into force on Wednesday, state media VNExpress said. All social media sites had been given 90 days to provide data on 'the total number of regular visits from Vietnam' and the number of regular users per month to authorities, the website said. 'Decree 147 will be used to publicly suppress those with different viewpoints,' said activist Dang Thi Hue, who writes about politics and social issues on her Facebook account, which has 28,000 followers. The decree was 'the latest sign of infringement of basic freedoms... with a vague line between what is legal and what is not,' said former political prisoner Le Anh Hung. 'No one wants to go to jail. So, of course, some activists will be more cautious and afraid of this decree.' Vietnam's hardline administration generally moves swiftly to stamp out dissent and arrest critics, especially those who find an audience on social media. In October, blogger Duong Van Thai -- who had almost 120,000 followers on YouTube, where he regularly recorded livestreams critical of the government -- was jailed for 12 years on charges of publishing anti-state information. Decree 147 builds on a 2018 cybersecurity law that was sharply criticized by the United States, European Union and internet freedom advocates who said it mimics China's repressive censorship of the internet. 'Just keep playing' The decree also says that only verified accounts can livestream, impacting the exploding number of people earning a living through social commerce on sites such as TikTok. Aside from the ramifications for social media firms, the new laws also include curbs on gaming for under-18s, designed to prevent addiction. Game publishers are expected to enforce a time limit of an hour per game session and not more than 180 minutes a day for all games. Just over half of Vietnam's 100 million population regularly plays such games, says data research firm Newzoo. A large proportion of the population is also on social media, with the Ministry of Information and Communications estimating the country has around 65 million Facebook users, 60 million on YouTube and 20 million on TikTok. The force of the decree was yet to be felt Wednesday at a small online gaming cafe in capital Hanoi, where around a dozen young people were glued to their desktop screens. 'I don't know anything about a time limit for the games,' said one 15-year-old boy who said he had skipped class to come and play. 'I just keep playing, and as you see, it still works.' 'I never have to show an ID or student card to enter a gameshop or for my game account online. I don't know how (the decree) will work. Let's see.' The owner of the cafe, who charges around 30 cents for an hour of gaming, was similarly nonchalant. 'I have no idea what this decree is about. I don't know if it will work or not.' 'My business is still going normally. They pay and we let them use the desktop for their gaming. It's simple.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweeping-vietnam-internet-law-comes-into-force/7913333.html	2024-12-24T22:38:47-08:00	
Prosecutors find workers in 'slavery like' conditions at Chinese car company site in Brazil	RIO DE JANEIRO — A task force led by Brazilian prosecutors said it rescued 163 Chinese nationals working in 'slavery-like' conditions at a construction site in northeastern Brazil, where Chinese electric vehicle company BYD is building a factory. On Tuesday, the Labor Prosecutor’s Office released videos of the dorms where the construction workers were staying, which showed beds with no mattresses and rooms without any places for the workers to store their personal belongings. In a statement issued Monday, the prosecutor’s office said the workers had been hired in China by Jinjiang Construction Brazil, one of the contractors on the site, which is located in Camaçari, a city in the Salvador metropolitan region. Officials said Jinjiang Construction Brazil had confiscated the workers' passports and held 60% of their wages. Those who quit would be forced to pay the company for their airfare from China, and for their return ticket, the statement said. Efforts to reach Jinjiang Construction in Brazil were unsuccessful as a contact phone number and email address were not immediately available. BYD, which stands for Build Your Dreams, is one of the world’s largest producers of electric cars. The company said on Monday night that it will 'immediately terminate the contract' with the Jinjian group and is 'studying other appropriate measures.' BYD said that the Jinjiang workers will be housed in nearby hotels for the time being, and that they will not suffer from the decision to stop work at the site. The company said that over the past few weeks it had been revising working conditions at the construction site and had told its contractors that 'adjustments' had to be made. Prosecutors said the sanitary situation at BYD’s site in Camaçari was especially critical, with only one toilet for every 31 workers, forcing them to wake up at 4 a.m. to line up and get ready to leave for work at 5:30 a.m. Under Brazilian law, slavery-like conditions are characterized by submission to forced labor or exhausting working hours, subjection to degrading working conditions and restriction of the worker’s freedom of movement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutors-find-workers-in-slavery-like-conditions-at-chinese-car-company-site-in-brazil/7913328.html	2024-12-24T22:12:59-08:00	
Ukraine reports ‘massive’ Russian missile attack on Kharkiv	Officials in northeastern Ukraine reported a 'massive missile attack' Wednesday on the city of Kharkiv that injured at least three people. Kharkiv Mayor Igor Terekhov said on Telegram there was a series of explosions in the city. Oleh Syniehubov, the regional governor, said the attack damaged civilian infrastructure. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday its air defenses destroyed 58 Ukrainian aerial drones, a number that is higher than typical in the daily exchange of drone attacks between the two sides. The ministry said 26 of the intercepts took place over the Belgorod region and 23 over Voronezh, with other drones being shot down over Kursk, Bryansk, Tambov and the Sea of Azov. Voronezh Governor Aleksandr Gusev said on Telegram that the Ukrainian attacks damaged several houses and a power line.

China to focus on stabilizing housing market in 2025, housing regulator says	BEIJING — Efforts will continue in 2025 to stabilize and prevent further declines in China's real estate market, China Construction News reported, citing a work conference held by the housing regulator on Tuesday and Wednesday. China will vigorously promote the reform of the commercial housing sales system, and expand the scope of urban village renovation beyond the addition of one million units, the report said. China will strictly control the supply of commercial housing, while increasing the supply of affordable housing to help solve the living problems of a large number of new citizens, young people and migrant workers, it said. Policymakers have stepped up efforts to revive the real estate market by introducing new measures to encourage home demand after a government-led campaign to rein in highly leveraged developers, triggered a crisis in 2021. Since September, measures aimed at encouraging homebuying have included cutting mortgage rates and minimum down-payments, as well as tax incentives to lower the cost of housing transactions. The real estate market has shown some momentum of stabilizing, with home transactions in October and November seeing year-on-year and month-on-month growth for two consecutive months, said the conference. China's home prices fell at the slowest pace in 17 months in November, supported by government efforts to revive the sector, official data showed. An official of the Central Financial and Economic Affairs Commission in December called for policy measures with direct impact on stabilizing the real estate market to be adopted as soon as possible, with local governments getting greater autonomy to buy housing stock.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-to-focus-on-stabilizing-housing-market-in-2025-housing-regulator-says/7913316.html	2024-12-24T20:57:09-08:00	
Ecuadorian police investigate if bodies are those of missing children allegedly taken by soldiers	GUAYAQUIL, ECUADOR — Ecuadorian police on Tuesday found an undisclosed number of bodies in an area close to a military base, officials said, and were investigating whether the bodies could be of some of the four children who were last seen taken by men in military uniform earlier this month. The case of the children, aged 11 to 15, who went missing on December 8, has profoundly shaken Ecuador, with rights groups and the public demanding information about their whereabouts and asking that the case be investigated as a forced disappearance. Under pressure for answers, authorities said 16 soldiers had been placed in custody and were being investigated in the disappearance of the minors. Also Tuesday, prosecutors said they are looking to charge some members of the military with forced disappearance in the case. They did not provide further details, and no charges have yet been raised. According to a police official who spoke with The Associated Press, the bodies discovered Tuesday were found in a mangrove area near the western city of Taura, where the military base is located. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the case, did not say how many bodies were found but added that they are now being analyzed to determine whether they were the children. Two other officials following the case, who also asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to speak with the media, told the AP that the bodies were charred and showed signs of violence. President Daniel Noboa, whose government has used the military to fight soaring crime as part of a security strategy with which he seeks to be reelected in February, has promised that his administration would not cover up for anyone in the disappearance. The children went missing in the coastal city of Guayaquil, where dozens of people demonstrated on Monday demanding accountability and answers. Defense Minister Gian Carlo Loffredo on Tuesday ordered the army to keep 16 soldiers in custody pending investigation, according to a statement posted on X. The bodies were found near the Taura Military Base, on the outskirts of Guayaquil, where the Ecuadorian Air Force is headquartered, according to the police official. The 16 troops in custody were assigned to that base. Surveillance videos emerged this week showing men in military uniform grabbing two boys and driving off with them. The two are believed to be among four children who disappeared that night. Loffredo on Monday confirmed the four were detained in the area where the footage was taken. The videos, seen by the AP, show a group of children running, men in uniform, two children being placed in the back of a pickup truck and the vehicle moving through the streets of Guayaquil. The footage appears to back up the account of Luis Arroyo, the father of two of the missing children. Arroyo earlier told local media that his children were on their way home after playing soccer when two vehicles carrying people in military uniforms arrived in the area. The children, he said, were chased and four were caught and driven away. It wasn't clear how he knew this. Loffredo, the defense minister, told reporters on Monday that, according to a military report, the children were detained by a patrol with 16 agents who 'observed eight people who were allegedly robbing a woman.' He said the military later released the minors and did not hand them over to the police. The footage reviewed by the AP does not show the alleged robbery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuadorian-police-investigate-if-bodies-are-those-of-missing-children-allegedly-taken-by-soldiers-/7913294.html	2024-12-24T18:59:20-08:00	
Legendary Indian filmmaker Shyam Benegal dies at age 90	NEW DELHI — Shyam Benegal, a renowned Indian filmmaker known for pioneering a cinema movement that tackled social issues in the 1970s, has died after chronic kidney disease. He was 90. His contribution to cinema was recognized as a director, editor and screenwriter. He came into the limelight with films — Ankur (1974), Nishant (1975), Manthan (1976) and Bhumika (1977) — that challenged mainstream Bollywood by dealing with the social realities of a poor nation. Benegal died Monday at Mumbai's Wockhardt Hospital, and his cremation will take place on Tuesday, the Press Trust of India news agency reported, citing his daughter Piya. 'Benegal had been suffering from chronic kidney disease for several years but it had gotten very bad,' Piya said. Many paid tribute to the filmmaker on social media platform X. Filmmaker Mahesh Bhatt wrote that Benegal told stories without pretense. 'They were raw and real, about the struggles of ordinary people. His films had craft and conviction.' 'Deeply saddened by the passing of Shyam Benegal, whose storytelling had a profound impact on Indian cinema. His works will continue to be admired by people from different walks of life,' Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi posted. Benegal was a mentor to top Indian actors including Shabana Azmi, Smita Patil, Naseeruddin Shah and Om Puri, who made their mark in Bollywood's popular cinema as well. 'I have lost my foster father, a man to whom I owe more than I can say,' Shah posted. 'Shyam Benegal was not just a legend; he was a visionary who redefined storytelling and inspired generations,' said actor Manoj Bajpayee. The film Ankur explored the feudal divide in India, while Manthan was based on the story of the country's cooperative dairy milk movement. Benegal also was widely known for Bharat Ek Khoj, a landmark 53-episode television series based on the book Discovery of India, written by India's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru. It chronicled the country's troubled passages, from ancient times to modernity. He also directed a 2023 biopic on Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who led Bangladesh's freedom struggle against Pakistan in the 1970s. Former Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to India in August following a student movement, is the daughter of Rahman. Benegal was born in 1934 in Hyderabad in southern India. He earned an economics degree from Hyderabad's Osmania University and established the Hyderabad Film Society. He also ventured into advertising, where he directed over 900 sponsored documentaries and advertising films. Benegal also is survived by his wife, Nira Benegal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7913285.html	2024-12-24T17:54:13-08:00

France has new government, again. Politics and crushing debt complicate next steps	Paris — France's president and prime minister managed to form a new government just in time for the holidays. Now comes the hard part. Crushing debt, intensifying pressure from the nationalist far right, wars in Europe and the Mideast — challenges abound for President Emmanuel Macron and Prime Minister Francois Bayrou after an already tumultuous 2024. The most urgent order of business is passing a 2025 budget. Financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission are pushing France to bring down its deficit, to comply with European Union rules limiting debt and keep France's borrowing costs from spiraling. That would threaten the stability and prosperity of all countries that share the euro currency. France's debt is currently estimated at a staggering 112% of gross domestic product. It grew further after the government gave aid payments to businesses and workers during COVID-19 lockdowns even as the pandemic depressed growth, and capped household energy prices after Russia invaded Ukraine. The bill is now coming due. But France's previous government collapsed this month because Marine Le Pen's far-right party and left-wing lawmakers opposed $62.4 billion (60 billion euros) in spending cuts and tax hikes in the original 2025 budget plan. Bayrou and new Finance Minister Eric Lombard are expected to scale back some of those promises, but the calculations are tough. 'The political situation is difficult. The international situation is dangerous, and the economic context is fragile,' Lombard, a low-profile banker who advised a Socialist government in the 1990s, said upon taking office. 'The environmental emergency, the social emergency, developing our businesses — these innumerable challenges require us to treat our endemic illness: the deficit,' he said. 'The more we are indebted, the more the debt costs, and the more it suffocates the country.' This is France's fourth government in the past year. No party has a parliamentary majority, and the new Cabinet can only survive with the support of lawmakers on the center-right and center-left. Le Pen — Macron's fiercest rival — was instrumental in ousting the previous government by joining left-wing forces in a no-confidence vote. Bayrou consulted her when forming the new government and Le Pen remains a powerful force. That angers left-wing groups, who had expected more influence in the new Cabinet, and who say promised spending cuts will hurt working-class families and small businesses hardest. Left-wing voters, meanwhile, feel betrayed ever since a coalition from the left won the most seats in the summer's snap legislative elections but failed to secure a government. The possibility of a new no-confidence vote looms, though it's not clear how many parties would support it. Macron has repeatedly said he will remain president until his term expires in 2027. But France's constitution and current structure, dating from 1958 and called the Fifth Republic, were designed to ensure stability after a period of turmoil. If this new government collapses within months and the country remains in political paralysis, pressure will mount for Macron to step down and call early elections. Le Pen's ascendant National Rally is intent on bringing Macron down. But Le Pen faces her own headaches: A March court ruling over alleged illegal party financing could see her barred from running for office. The National Rally and hard-right Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau want tougher immigration rules. But Bayrou wants to focus on making existing rules work. 'There are plenty of [immigration] laws that exist. None is being applied,' he said Monday on broadcaster BFM-TV, to criticism from conservatives. Military spending is a key issue amid fears about European security and pressure from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for Europe to spend more on its own defense. French Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu, who champions military aid for Ukraine and ramping up weapons production, kept his job and stressed in a statement Tuesday the need to face down ''accumulating threats'' against France. More immediately, Macron wants an emergency law in early January to allow sped-up reconstruction of the cyclone-ravaged French territory of Mayotte in the Indian Ocean off Africa. Thousands of people are in emergency shelters, and authorities are still counting the dead more than a week after the devastation. Meanwhile, the government in the restive French South Pacific territory of New Caledonia collapsed Tuesday in a wave of resignations by pro-independence figures — another challenge for the new overseas affairs minister, Manuel Valls, and the incoming Cabinet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-has-new-government-again-politics-and-crushing-debt-complicate-next-steps/7913279.html	2024-12-24T17:24:53-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: How China's mineral export ban could affect US weapon manufacturing	In early December, China tightened export controls on dual-use goods to the United States.

NASA probe makes closest-ever pass by the sun	WASHINGTON — NASA's pioneering Parker Solar Probe made history Tuesday, flying closer to the sun than any other spacecraft, with its heat shield exposed to scorching temperatures topping 930 degrees Celsius (1,700 degrees Fahrenheit). Launched in August 2018, the spaceship is on a seven-year mission to deepen scientific understanding of our star and help forecast space-weather events that can affect life on Earth. Tuesday's historic flyby should have occurred at precisely 11:53 Greenwich Mean Time, although mission scientists will have to wait until Friday for confirmation as they lose contact with the craft for several days due to its proximity to the sun. 'Right now, Parker Solar Probe is flying closer to a star than anything has ever been before,' at 6.1 million kilometers (3.8 million miles) away, NASA official Nicky Fox said in a video on social media Tuesday morning. 'It is just a total 'yay, we did it,' moment.' If the distance between Earth and the sun is the equivalent to the length of an American football field, 109.7 meters, the spacecraft should have been about four meters from the end zone at the moment of closest approach — known as perihelion. 'This is one example of NASA's bold missions, doing something that no one else has ever done before to answer long-standing questions about our universe,' Parker Solar Probe program scientist Arik Posner said in a statement on Monday. 'We can't wait to receive that first status update from the spacecraft and start receiving the science data in the coming weeks.' So effective is the heat shield that the probe's internal instruments remain near room temperature — around 29 C (85 F) — as it explores the sun's outer atmosphere, called the corona. Parker will also be moving at a blistering pace of around 690,000 kilometers per hour (430,000 miles per hourph), fast enough to fly from the U.S. capital, Washington, to Japan's Tokyo in under a minute. 'Parker will truly be returning data from uncharted territory,' said Nick Pinkine, mission operations manager at the Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Maryland. 'We're excited to hear back from the spacecraft when it swings back around the sun.' By venturing into these extreme conditions, Parker has been helping scientists tackle some of the sun's biggest mysteries: how solar wind originates, why the corona is hotter than the surface below, and how coronal mass ejections — massive clouds of plasma that hurl through space are formed. The Christmas Eve flyby is the first of three record-setting close passes, with the next two — on March 22 and June 19, 2025 — both expected to bring the probe back to a similarly close distance from the Sun.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nasa-probe-makes-closest-ever-pass-by-the-sun/7913023.html	2024-12-24T16:25:18-08:00	
Kurdish-led forces push back Turkish-backed Syrian rebels	QAMISHLI, SYRIA — The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces said Tuesday they have launched a counteroffensive against the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army to take back areas near Syria's northern border with Turkey. The SDF is Washington's critical ally in Syria, targeting sleeper cells of the extremist Islamic State group scattered across the country's east. Since the fall of the totalitarian rule of Bashar al-Assad earlier this month, clashes have intensified between the U.S.-backed group and the SNA, which captured the key city of Manbij and the areas surrounding it. The intense weekslong clashes come at a time when Syria, battered by over a decade of war and economic misery, negotiates its political future following half a century under the Assad dynasty's rule. Ruken Jamal, spokesperson of the Women's Protection Unit under the SDF, told The Associated Press that their fighters are just over seven miles (11 kilometers) away from the center of Manbij in their ongoing counteroffensive. She accused Ankara of trying to weaken the group's influence in negotiations over Syria's political future through the SNA. 'Syria is now in a new phase, and discussions are underway about the future of the country,' Jamal said. 'Turkey is trying, through its attacks, to distract us with battles and exclude us from the negotiations in Damascus.' A Britain-based opposition war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, says since the SNA's offensive in northern Syria against the Kurds started earlier this month, dozens from both sides have been killed. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke on Tuesday with Turkish Minister of National Defense Yasar Guler, according to Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder. He said they discussed the ongoing situation in Syria, and Austin emphasized that close and continuous coordination is crucial to a successful effort to counter IS in the country. They also discussed the importance of setting the conditions to enable a more secure and stable Syria. Ankara sees the SDF as an affiliate of its sworn enemy, the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, which it classifies as a terrorist organization. Turkish-backed armed groups alongside Turkish jets for years have attacked positions where the SDF are largely present across northern Syria, in a bid to create a buffer zone free from the group along the large border. While the SNA was involved in the lightning insurgency — led by the Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham — that toppled Assad, it has continued its push against the SDF, seen as Syria's second key actor for its political future. On Monday, the SDF spokesperson Farhad Shami said the group's forces pushed back the Turkish-backed rebels from areas near the Tishrin Dam on the Euphrates, a key source of hydroelectric power. He said the SDF also destroyed a tank belonging to the rebels southeast of Manbij. The British-based war monitor said on Tuesday that the Kurdish-led group, following overnight fighting, has reclaimed four villages in the areas near the strategic dam. Turkish jets also pounded the strategic border town of Kobani in recent days. During Syria's uprising-turned-conflict, the Kurds carved out an enclave of autonomous rule across northeastern Syria, never fully allying entirely with Assad in Damascus nor the rebels trying to overthrow him. Even with the Assad family out of the picture, it appears that Ankara's position won't change, with Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan's landmark visit to Syria maintaining a strong position on the Kurdish-led group in his meeting with de facto leader Ahmad al-Sharaa of HTS. 'It has turned the region into a cauldron of terror with PKK members and far-left groups who have come from Turkey, Iraq, Iran and Europe,' Fidan said in a news conference after the meeting. 'The international community is turning a blind eye to this lawlessness because of the wardenship it provides [against IS].' With the ongoing fighting, SDF Commander Mazloum Abdi has expressed concern about a strong IS resurgence due to the power vacuum in Syria and the ongoing fighting, which has left the Kurdish-led group unable to carry out its attacks and raids on the extremist group's scattered sleeper cells. Tens of thousands of children, family members, and supporters of IS militants are still held in large detention centers in northeastern Syria, in areas under SDF control.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kurdish-led-forces-push-back-turkish-backed-syrian-rebels/7913011.html	2024-12-24T15:53:35-08:00

Armed men fire on Haiti hospital reopening, killing at least 2	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — At least two people were killed and others injured on Tuesday when armed men opened fire on a group of journalists who gathered for a government press conference set to announce the reopening of Haiti's largest public hospital, a witness to the attack told Reuters. A reporter and a police officer were killed, said a journalist at the scene who asked not to be named. Haiti's national police did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for information. The attack comes as armed gangs gain territory in Haiti in the face of under-resourced security forces and little international response and follows several mass killings in the capital and surrounding rural areas. Haiti's transitional presidential council said in a post on Facebook that the act would not go without consequences. 'We express our sympathy to all the victims' families, in particular, to the Haitian National Police and all the journalists' associations,' it said, without confirming the number of people killed. Journalists were invited to arrive at the hospital in the downtown area of the capital Port-au-Prince from 8 a.m. for the press conference with Haiti's new health minister. They were still awaiting the minister when shooting began about 11 a.m. Health Minister Duckenson Lorthe Blema was installed in November in a Cabinet reshuffle when former Prime Minister Garry Conille was ousted after just six months in office. The State University of Haiti Hospital, known locally as the General Hospital, is the country's largest public hospital, but it has been closed since a March surge in gang attacks that saw former Prime Minister Ariel Henry ousted from power. In July, authorities celebrated retaking control of the hospital with a press conference in the facility, but Conille was forced to flee alongside security officers and journalists under a flurry of gunfire. The hospital is a stone's throw from the central Champ de Mars square, an area that has seen frequent gun battles and clashes between police and a citywide alliance of gangs known as Viv Ansanm. Gangs are estimated to control 80% to 90% of the capital, while neighboring countries have been slow to deliver on promises of security support for the Caribbean nation. An international mission approved last year has so far seen just a fraction of troops deploying, while Haitian calls to shore up its resources by converting it to a peacekeeping force met opposition at the United Nations Security Council. A spokesperson for the mission, led by Kenya, told Reuters after shooting began that its personnel had not been invited to the conference, and it had sent in reinforcements. Only 24% of health facilities in the Port-au-Prince metropolitan area are currently operating, according to a recent U.N. report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/armed-men-fire-on-haiti-hospital-reopening-killing-at-least-2-/7912982.html	2024-12-24T14:35:56-08:00	
Searchers believe US journalist Tice still alive	The nonprofit group Hostage Aid Worldwide, one of the teams looking for U.S. journalist Austin Tice in Syria, said Tuesday it believes he is still alive. 'We have data that Austin is alive till January 2024, but the president of the U.S. said in August that he is alive, and we are sure that he is alive today,' said Nizar Zakka, president of Hostage Aid Worldwide, according to Agence France-Presse. 'We are trying to be as transparent as possible and to share as much information as possible,' he told a news conference Tuesday in Damascus but did not offer information on where Tice might be. Earlier this week, Roger Carstens, the U.S. hostage envoy, said a network of secret prisons run by the former Syrian government is more extensive than the U.S. had realized and is complicating efforts to find Tice. The U.S. government initially estimated Syria had about 10 to 20 secret prisons, but there may be 40 or more, Carstens told reporters Friday following a brief trip to Damascus, the Syrian capital. 'I've been rather amazed at the amount of secret prisons that Assad seems to have amassed,' Carstens said. 'They're in little clusters at times. Sometimes they're in the far reaches of Damascus.' The scale of the prison network has made it hard to locate Tice, according to Carstens. Not seen since 2012 Tice, 43, was working for Agence France-Presse, McClatchy News, The Washington Post, CBS and other media outlets in Syria. A Texas native and former U.S. Marine, Tice has been held in Syria since 2012, when he was detained at a checkpoint in Damascus. Aside from a brief video after his capture, little has been heard or seen of him. Over the past 12 years, the U.S. government has pinpointed about six prisons where Tice was believed to have likely been, Carstens said. But new information means as many as three more facilities have been added to the list. Limited resources make checking them a difficult endeavor, Carstens said. In the absence of sufficient U.S. government personnel on the ground, nongovernmental organizations, journalists and Syria's transitional government have been searching for Tice. 'In a perfect world, we'll find Austin and bring him home, and we'll stop the search,' Carstens said. 'We're not going to stop until we find the information we need to conclude what has happened to Austin, where he is, to return him home to his family.' Assad's ouster raises hope In the aftermath of the Assad government's collapse this month, thousands of prisoners have been released from facilities run by the government. That has raised hopes among the Tice family that Austin will be among them. 'I feel like we're standing in line, and we're not the only ones that are still standing in line,' Tice's mother, Debra Tice, told reporters on Monday. 'We just need to get all those prisons opened, get all those families reunited, including us.' Tice is the longest-held American journalist abroad. Shortly before the Assad government fell, the Tice family revealed that it had received information from a source vetted by the U.S. government that confirmed Austin was alive and held in the Damascus area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/searchers-believe-us-journalist-tice-still-alive/7912966.html	2024-12-24T14:09:50-08:00	
Medellin cartel victims demand justice as boss Ochoa walks free in Colombia	BOGOTA, Colombia — The return of former drug trafficker Fabio Ochoa to Colombia following his deportation from the United States has reopened old wounds among victims of the Medellín cartel, with some expressing dismay at the Colombian authorities' decision to let Ochoa walk free. Some of the cartel victims said Tuesday they are hoping the former drug lord will at least cooperate with ongoing efforts by human rights groups to investigate one of the most violent periods of Colombia's history and demanded that Colombian prosecutors take Ochoa in for questioning. In the late '80s and early '90s the Medellín cartel killed police officers, politicians, judges, journalists and bystanders as it waged war on the Colombian state, which had stepped up its efforts to cut off drug shipments, arrest drug traffickers and seize their properties. Some historians in Colombia attribute 10,000 killings to cartel leader Pablo Escobar. Ochoa was one of the cartel's key operators at the time and lived for several years in Miami where he ran a distribution center for the cocaine cartel. He has denied being involved in the cartel killings. But many victims of the cartel and their relatives are highly skeptical of that claim. Bogotá Mayor Carlos Fernando Galán was 12 when his father, presidential candidate Luis Carlos Galán was killed by cartel hitmen in 1989. On Monday night Galán wrote in a message on X that it was 'unacceptable' for Ochoa not to be facing any charges in Colombia. Galán's older brother, Juan Manuel Galán, went further. 'The majority of the [Medellín cartel's] crimes are in impunity' he wrote on X. 'Along with thousands of victims we hope to know the truth about Ochoa's responsibility and that of his allies in kidnappings, murders and indiscriminate acts of terrorism.' Ochoa was deported to Colombia on Monday after serving more than 20 years in prison in the U.S. for a drug trafficking conviction, which was not related to any killings in Colombia. The 67-year-old had his fingerprints taken at the airport and was let go by immigration officials who ran his name through a database and confirmed he is not wanted by Colombian authorities. Speaking to journalists, who frantically swarmed around him in Bogotá's airport, Ochoa claimed he had been 'framed' by U.S. prosecutors. He added that he had paid for his drug trafficking crimes in Colombia in the early 1990s, when he spent several years in a Colombian prison. Ochoa was released in 1996 but was once again arrested in 1999 and was extradited to the U.S. in 2001 in response to an indictment in Miami naming him and more than 40 others as part of a drug smuggling conspiracy. Gonzalo Enrique Rojas was a young boy in 1989 when his father died on a commercial plane that was blown up by the Medellín cartel, killing all 107 people on board. Rojas, who now leads a foundation for victims of Colombia's conflict said that Ochoa's return to Colombia presents an opportunity for more details to be known about that incident, such as what motivated the cartel to attack a plane full of civilians, and what were its relations with members of the Colombian government. He said that Colombian prosecutors should interrogate Ochoa about this event and other crimes committed by the cartel. He added that his foundation, Colombia with Memory, will also try to seek a meeting with the former cartel boss. 'The years in prison [for cartel leaders] are not that relevant for those of us who are victims of the Medellín cartel,' Rojas said. 'What really repairs the pain is justice and truth.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/medellin-cartel-victims-demand-justice-as-boss-ochoa-walks-free-in-colombia/7912971.html	2024-12-24T13:54:26-08:00	
Pope Francis kicks off year-long Jubilee that will test his stamina, Rome's patience	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis kicked off the 2025 Holy Year on Tuesday, inaugurating a celebration of the Catholic Church that is expected to draw some 32 million pilgrims to Rome in a test of the pope's stamina and the ability of the Eternal City to welcome them. From his wheelchair, Francis knocked a few times, and the great Holy Door of St. Peter's Basilica swung open. He was wheeled across the threshold as bells tolled across Rome and the choir inside the basilica began Christmas Eve Mass. In his homily, Francis said the Holy Year is an opportunity to relieve the debt of poor countries and commit to protecting the planet. The aim of the Jubilee, he said, is 'to bring hope to the interminable, dreary days of prisoners, to the cold and dismal lodgings of the poor and to all those places desecrated by war and violence.' The ceremony inaugurated the once-every-25-year tradition of a Jubilee, in which the Catholic faithful make pilgrimages to Rome. Francis has dedicated the 2025 Jubilee to the theme of hope, and he will underscore that message when he opens a Holy Door on Thursday at Rome’s Rebibbia Prison in a bid to give inmates hope for a better future. Francis has long incorporated prison ministry into his priestly vocation and has made several visits to Rebibbia and other prisons during his travels. Security around the Vatican was at its highest levels following the Christmas market attack last week in Germany, the Interior Ministry said. Italian authorities were using extra police patrols and camera surveillance around Rome, while pilgrims faced metal detectors and other security checks to access St. Peter's Square via a reinforced police barricade passage. Francis, who turned 88 last week, went into the Christmas week and Jubilee launch with a cold that forced him to deliver his weekly Sunday blessing from indoors. But he appeared in fine form Tuesday night. His health and stamina, already compromised because of his tendency to get bronchitis, are a concern given the rigorous calendar of events during the Holy Year. One of the highlights will be the canonization of the teenage internet whiz Carlo Acutis, considered the first millennial and digital-era saint, during the Jubilee dedicated to adolescents in April. This week, Francis also delivers his annual 'Urbi et Orbi' (to the city and the world) speech on Christmas Day from the loggia of St. Peter’s Basilica. In addition to the outing at Rebibbia, he will celebrate New Year’s Eve vespers and a New Year’s Day Mass. The city of Rome entered the Jubilee with some trepidation. It has undergone two years of traffic-clogging public works upgrades of transportation, hospital emergency rooms and other vital services, testing residents' patience. But only about a third of the 323 projects have been completed, and the city is already groaning under the weight of overtourism. Visitors have returned to Italy in droves following COVID-19, and the explosion of short-term vacation rentals has exacerbated a housing crisis. Some of Rome's prized monuments have reopened recently, including the Trevi Fountain. And the main Jubilee project was finished just in time: A pedestrian piazza linking Castel St. Angelo to the Via della Conciliazione, the main boulevard leading to St. Peter’s Square, was unveiled Monday. Vatican officials insist that Rome has a tradition of welcoming pilgrims and point to how past Jubilees have left their mark on the Eternal City’s urban and spiritual landscape. The Sistine Chapel was commissioned by Pope Sixtus IV for the Jubilee of 1475, and the big Vatican garage was built for the 2000 Jubilee under St. John Paul II. Pope Boniface VII called the first Holy Year in 1300, and in recent times, they are generally celebrated every 25 to 50 years. Pilgrims who participate can obtain 'indulgences' — related to the forgiveness of sins that roughly amounts to a 'get out of purgatory free' card. Francis declared a special Jubilee in 2015-2016 dedicated to mercy, and the next one is planned for 2033 to commemorate the anniversary of the crucifixion of Christ. The last regular Jubilee was in 2000, when St. John Paul II ushered in the church’s third millennium. The one before that, in 1975, was notable because Pope Paul VI was nearly hit by falling plaster when he opened the Holy Door. The door was still behind a fake wall and Paul had used a ceremonial hammer to bang on it three times to open it. The fake wall now is removed well in advance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7912956.html	2024-12-24T13:26:06-08:00

Iran cyberspace council votes to lift ban on WhatsApp	TEHRAN, IRAN — Iran's top council responsible for safeguarding the internet voted Tuesday to lift a ban on the popular messaging application WhatsApp, which has been subject to restrictions for over two years, state media reported. 'The ban on WhatsApp and Google Play was removed by unanimous vote of the members of the Supreme Council of Cyberspace,' the official IRNA news agency said. The council is headed by the president, and its members include the parliament speaker, the head of the judiciary and several ministers. It was not immediately clear when the decision would come into force. 'Restrictions ... achieved nothing but anger' The move has sparked a debate in Iran, with critics of the restrictions arguing the controls were costly for the country. 'The restrictions have achieved nothing but anger and added costs to people's lives,' presidential adviser Ali Rabiei said on X Tuesday. 'President Masoud Pezeshkian believes in removing restrictions and does not consider the bans to be in the interest of the people and the country. All experts also believe that this issue is not beneficial to the country's security,' Vice President Mohammad Javad Zarif said on Tuesday. Lifting restrictions 'a gift to enemies' Others, however, warned against lifting the restrictions. The reformist Shargh daily on Tuesday reported that 136 lawmakers in the 290-member parliament sent a letter to the council saying the move would be a 'gift to [Iran's] enemies.' The lawmakers called for allowing access to restricted online platforms only 'if they are committed to the values of Islamic society and comply with the laws of' Iran. Iranian officials have in the past called for the foreign companies that own popular international apps to introduce representative offices in Iran. Meta, the American giant that owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, has said it had no intention of setting up offices in the Islamic republic, which remains under U.S. sanctions. Iranians have over the years grown accustomed to using virtual private networks, or VPNs, to bypass internet restrictions. Other popular social media platforms, including Facebook, X and YouTube, remain blocked after being banned in 2009. Telegram was also banned by a court order in April 2018. Instagram and WhatsApp were added to the list of blocked applications following nationwide protests that erupted after the September 2022 death in custody of Mahsa Amini. Amini, a 22-year-old Iranian Kurd, was arrested for an alleged breach of Iran's dress code for women. Hundreds of people, including dozens of security personnel, were killed in the subsequent months-long nationwide protests, and thousands of demonstrators were arrested. Pezeshkian, who took office in July, had vowed during his campaign to ease the long-standing internet restrictions. in the past several years, Iran has introduced domestic applications to supplant popular foreign ones.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-cyberspace-council-votes-to-lift-ban-on-whatsapp/7912891.html	2024-12-24T12:45:09-08:00	
Amsterdam court sentences 5 men for violence linked to Ajax-Maccabi soccer game	The Hague, Netherlands — An Amsterdam district court on Tuesday sentenced five men to up to six months in prison for violence that erupted around a UEFA Europa League football match between the Dutch club Ajax and Israel’s Maccabi Tel Aviv in November. The riots, which caused an international outcry and accusations of deliberate antisemitic attacks, left five people in the hospital and 20 others with minor injuries. More than 60 people were detained. The court on Tuesday sentenced one man to 6 months in prison, another to 2 1/2 months and two to 1 month in jail. A fifth defendant received 100 hours of community service. A series of violent incidents took place between pro-Palestinian demonstrators and Israeli soccer fans around the soccer match. Some of the violence was condemned as antisemitic, with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu offering to evacuate Maccabi supporters. The violence, which garnered headlines worldwide, damaged Amsterdam’s reputation as a beacon of tolerance and a haven for persecuted religions, including Jews. 'It seems that the violence arose from strong pro-Palestine sentiments and dissatisfaction with the situation in Gaza, and related anger against the Israelis present,' the prosecutors’ office said in a statement at the conclusion of hearings two weeks ago. The five defendants, who are all Dutch residents and aged between 19 and 32, were accused of public violence, theft and assault. The November 8 game was allowed to go ahead after the Netherlands’ counterterror watchdog found there was no 'concrete threat' to Israeli fans, and the match wasn’t considered a high risk. Even so, Amsterdam authorities banned a pro-Palestinian demonstration outside the Johan Cruyff Arena. According to an investigation, the day before the game the authorities reported several incidents, including Israeli fans tearing a Palestinian flag from an Amsterdam building and attacking a taxi. Six more suspects will have their trials at a later date, including three minors. Under Dutch rules, proceedings for juveniles are held behind closed doors. Police are continuing to investigate the violence and have released images of several suspects they want to identify.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amsterdam-court-sentences-5-men-for-violence-linked-to-ajax-maccabi-soccer-game/7912895.html	2024-12-24T12:20:18-08:00	
Hong Kong issues arrest warrants, bounties for 6 democracy activists	Hong Kong police on Tuesday announced a new round of arrest warrants for six pro-democracy activists based abroad, with bounties set at 1 million Hong Kong dollars, or about $129,000, for information leading to their arrests. The six activists are wanted on charges that include secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces. The move underscores how the government of Hong Kong — which is a special administration region of China — targets activists living in exile in retaliation for their work. The six include Chloe Cheung, a 19-year-old activist with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong; Carmen Lau, a former district councilor and current activist with the Hong Kong Democracy Council; and Tony Chung, the former leader of the now-defunct pro-independence group Studentlocalism. 'Fear cannot restrain me. Suppression cannot silence me. I will wear this burden with pride and without fear,' Cheung, who is based in the United Kingdom, wrote in a statement on Tuesday. Lau said she would not let the arrest warrant and bounty deter her work. 'I have always considered serving Hong Kongers and fighting for freedom and democracy my lifelong obligation,' she said in a statement on social media platform X. 'As a member of the diaspora and as a Hong Konger, I swear to put our fight for Hong Kong before anything else, even before myself,' Lau added. Others on the list Tuesday include Chung Kim-wah, a former member of independent polling organization Hong Kong Public Opinion Research Institute; Joseph Tay, co-founder of Canada-based group HongKonger Station; and YouTuber Victor Ho. The Hong Kong government has previously issued two rounds of arrest warrants and bounties for prominent pro-democracy activists, including ex-lawmakers Ted Hui and Nathan Law, and activists Anna Kwok, Joey Siu and Frances Hui. The latest arrest warrants bring the total number of wanted people to 19. Government orders passports canceled In a separate move on Tuesday, the Hong Kong government also issued orders for the cancellation of passports belonging to seven 'absconders,' including Kwok, who leads the Hong Kong Democracy Council; Siu, a prominent activist; and Frances Hui, with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong. 'Our crime? Calling on the world to hold the CCP [Chinese Communist Party] accountable for violating the autonomy of our home,' Frances Hui said in a Tuesday statement on X. She made the statement in solidarity with her colleague Cheung. The passports of former Hong Kong lawmakers Ted Hui and Dennis Kwok also were canceled. The orders were made under Hong Kong's domestic national security law, which is known as Article 23. 'This is one of the first instances in which Hong Kong authorities have utilized one of the provisions in Article 23,' Siu said in a post on X. 'The international community must continue to monitor its use and implications closely. And of course, please continue to watch our friends who are still in prison.' Siu, who is an American citizen, also called on the U.S. government to do more to help exiled Hong Kongers who are targeted with transnational repression. Group calls charges 'absurd' The free expression group Article 19 condemned the arrest warrants and passport cancellations as 'an outrageous escalation in transnational repression against overseas Hong Kongers.' 'These absurd, arbitrary charges only serve to further drive home the farce of Hong Kong authorities claiming to follow the rule of law,' Michael Caster, the head of Article 19's China program, said in a statement on Tuesday. Hong Kong's Security Bureau did not immediately reply to VOA's email requesting comment. The arrest warrants and passport cancellations come as the trial against pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai continues in Hong Kong. The trial is widely viewed as a politically motivated sham. Lai, 77, rejects the national security charges against him. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-issues-arrest-warrants-bounties-for-6-democracy-activists/7912819.html	2024-12-24T11:49:08-08:00	
Big banks, business groups sue US Federal Reserve over annual 'stress tests'	Major banks and business groups sued the Federal Reserve on Tuesday, alleging the U.S. central bank's annual 'stress tests' of Wall Street firms violate the law. The lawsuit filed in U.S. District Court in Columbus, Ohio, claims the Fed's practice of determining how big banks perform against hypothetical economic turmoil, and assigning capital requirements accordingly, do not follow proper administrative procedure. Plaintiffs included the Bank Policy Institute, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and the American Bank Association. The lawsuit marks the latest example of the banking industry growing bolder and challenging in court their regulators' powers, particularly in the wake of recent Supreme Court rulings placing fresh restrictions on administrative authority. In June, the Supreme Court dealt a major blow to such power by overturning a 1984 precedent that granted deference to government agencies in interpreting laws they administer. The so-called 'Chevron doctrine' had called for judges to defer to reasonable federal agency interpretations of U.S. laws deemed to be ambiguous. While the 2010 Dodd-Frank law passed following the global financial crisis broadly requires the Fed to test banks' balance sheets, the capital adequacy analysis the Fed performs as part of tests, or the resulting capital it directs lenders to set aside, are not mandated by law. Specifically, the groups are calling for the Fed to make public and subject to feedback the now-confidential models the regulators use to gauge bank performance, as well as details of the annual scenarios they create to test for weaknesses. The groups said they did not want to kill the stress testing program, which provides an annual bill of health to the nation's biggest firms, but argue the process needs to be more transparent and responsive to public feedback. On Monday, the Fed announced plans to pursue similar changes ahead of the 2025 exams, citing recent legal developments, but the industry opted to proceed with its lawsuit. A Fed spokesperson declined to comment on the lawsuit on Tuesday. 'The opaque nature of these tests undermines their value for providing meaningful insights into bank resilience,' Rob Nichols, president and CEO of the American Bankers Association, said in a statement. 'We remain hopeful the Fed will address long-standing issues with the stress tests, but this litigation preserves our ability to seek legal remedies if the Fed falls short.' These tests, which banks have complained for years are opaque and subjective, are a central piece of the U.S. regulatory bank-capital structure. The Fed has long resisted calls to completely open up the testing process, due to concerns that it could make it easier for banks to clear the exams. How banks perform on the test informs how much capital they must set aside to meet their obligations and dictate the scope of dividend payouts and stock buybacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/big-banks-business-groups-sue-us-federal-reserve-over-annual-stress-tests-/7912850.html	2024-12-24T11:46:02-08:00	
Report alleges shrinking media space in Zambia	Lusaka — A new report says that media freedoms in Zambia are under attack. The report says more than 60 percent of people surveyed think that the media cannot operate freely, due to frequent instances of harassment and intimidation faced by journalists and bloggers. The Media Institute of Southern Africa, or MISA, launched its report on December 17 in Zambia’s capital, Lusaka. MISA chairperson Lorraine Mwanza said that journalists in Zambia still face censorship and violence in the course of their duties. Both she and the report cited the case of Thomas Zgambo, an investigative journalist, who has been arrested three times in the last 13 months for writing stories that Zambian authorities deemed overly critical. Zgambo faces up to seven years in prison if convicted of charges that include libel and sedition. Zgambo told VOA that he will not stop writing and reporting. 'All the three cases basically, it’s a journalist trying to find answers on behalf of the public but I’m now in court because instead of the government answering, they have decided to use the police to criminalize journalism and take me to court. So I’m in court with three criminal charges. I’m in court with three criminal cases before three different magistrates,' he said. Zgambo’s legal troubles started in November 2023, when he was arrested in connection with an article in which he alleged a government institution was renting a property from President Hakainde Hichilema. In August of this year, he was arrested for a 2022 story about an allegedly illegal government purchase of fertilizer. And in October, he was arrested for an article he wrote about food imports. The most recent arrest came hours after President Hichilema promised to uphold press freedom in a speech read on his behalf by chief government spokesperson Cornelius Mweetwa. Joan Chirwa, the founder of a Zambian media advocacy group, the Free Press Initiative, told VOA she agrees with the findings of the MISA report. 'We have seen political party figures still storming radio stations to disturb programming and threaten journalists there,' she said. 'We have seen journalists being detained by the police. We have also seen journalists been lumped with criminal charges just because of what they have written and our biggest worry right now is what may likely happen as we get closer to the 2026 election.' Chirwa criticized colonial-era laws being used by authorities against journalists in Zambia. These include criminal defamation, sedition and state security laws which Chirwa says are a hindrance to journalists playing their role as a watchdog on the government. However, at the launch of the MISA report, an official at the information ministry, Mumanga Morden Mayembe, argued that the government has not interfered with media freedoms at all. Mayembe said the government has opened up the media space, as evidenced by its licensing of more than 200 radio stations, 50 TV stations and many online platforms. 'When platforms are few, then there will be few people expressing themselves on those platforms. When we just had [one] tv station, for you to appear on tv you needed to be a president, you needed to be a vice president, a minister or at least somebody with a name in society,' said Mayembe. However, Muthoki Mumo, the Africa program coordinator with the Committee to Protect Journalists, said in a recent statement that the continued harassment of Zgambo paints a stark picture of the emptiness behind the government ‘s pledges to protect journalists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-alleges-shrinking-media-space-in-zambia-/7912610.html	2024-12-24T10:17:02-08:00	
Vietnam signs $286 million in defense contracts at 2024 international expo	Taipei, Taiwan — Vietnam's ambitions to modernize its military and diversify international partnerships were on full display at the 2024 Vietnam International Defense Expo, an exhibition that concluded with defense enterprises signing 16 contracts worth over $286 million, along with 17 strategic cooperation agreements with international defense firms. The exhibition, which took place from Dec. 19-22 in Hanoi, featured more than 240 defense industry companies and represented 49 countries. Vietnamese Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said the expo was 'an affirmation of Vietnam's role and contribution in international defense cooperation' and a 'symbol of trust, respect and goodwill in cooperation between nations for a world of peace, stability and prosperity.' Experts noted that the vast number of international companies at the exhibition reflected Vietnam’s long-term approach to diversifying its foreign partners. 'If you look at the list of invited firms and defense firms and companies at the expo, you can see there’s a wide range of companies from many different countries,' said Hanh Nguyen, a research fellow at the Yokosuka Council on Asia-Pacific Studies based in Japan. 'This decision reflects Vietnam's long-standing foreign policy approach, which is to strive to build partnerships with every country regardless of their political system or ideology,' he added. Bich Tran, a postdoctoral fellow at the Lee Kuan Yew School of Public Policy in Singapore, shared a similar sentiment, explaining to VOA that the presence of Chinese, Russian and Western countries at the expo showed that Vietnam is committed to the principle of diversifying its foreign relations. 'Vietnam has talked about diversifying its arms supplies for many years, but I think Russia’s invasion of Ukraine forced Vietnam to facilitate the process. So with this expo, [Vietnam] has the opportunity to talk with many different partners, to look around to see what will work,' Tran said. American firms Boeing and Lockheed Martin, French company Airbus, and Chinese state-owned China North Industries Corporation (NORINCO) attended the expo. NORINCO's participation marked the first time for a Chinese company. Concurrently, Vietnam’s general-secretary of the Communist Party, To Lam, met with visiting Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun. Despite the active participation and discussion between Beijing and Hanoi officials, Nguyen said the expo is unlikely to become a breakthrough point for arms sales between the two countries, noting that Vietnam has concerns over the transparency performance of Chinese military equipment. Nguyen The Phuong, a doctoral candidate in maritime security at the University of New South Wales, told VOA that 'Vietnam will never, ever buy any lethal weapons from China,' adding that Vietnam’s reluctance to buy weapons from China is a 'long-standing principle dating back to the ‘70s and '80s.' Phuong said Vietnam is preparing to advance and upgrade its outdated systems, 'focusing on the modernization of the Vietnamese army and maritime defense needs.' 'Vietnam is trying to modernize its navy and air force and trying to turn them into modernized and capable services after 2030. So, there are a lot of things that the Vietnamese military wants to improve from buying more aircraft for its air force, building more warships for its navy, and especially the capability to monitor.' Contributing to Hanoi’s need to modernize is the potential for conflict in the South China Sea, a geopolitically disputed territory that is both a critical maritime route for global trade and a region rich in resources, including oil, natural gas and fish stock. On Dec. 10, the South China Morning Post reported that Vietnam is actively building military facilities on several islands and reefs in the Spratly Islands — key territories in the South China Sea. 'Vietnam's military strategy in the South China Sea can be summed up in one word: deterrence. Or more precisely, deterrence by denial,' said Phuong, explaining that Vietnam’s decisions at the expo reflect an ambition to increase its coastal military capabilities. Another takeaway from the expo is Hanoi’s cooperation with the United States. Speaking at the expo, U.S. Ambassador to Vietnam Marc Napper said the United States' goal is to ensure that Vietnam 'has everything it needs to defend its interests at sea, in the air, on the ground and in cyberspace.' Tran said this goal demonstrates that the U.S.-Vietnam defense cooperation is shifting from a single arms assistance model to a broader multilateral cooperation framework.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-signs-286-million-in-defense-contracts-at-2024-international-expo/7912717.html	2024-12-24T09:55:45-08:00	
Syrians welcome new rulers' pledge of moderation but are concerned about extremists in their midst	Washington — With the militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) consolidating power in Syria following the ouster of President Bashar al-Assad, many Syrians fear the influence of extremist factions within the Islamist organization. HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, emerged as the de facto ruler of Syria after Assad’s fall on December 8, following an 11-day rebel offensive. Formerly known as al-Nusra Front, the HTS was the main affiliate of al-Qaida in Syria until 2017, when it formally severed ties with the global terror group. Since seizing control of Damascus, HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa -- formerly known by his nom de guerre, Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, has adopted a more moderate stance, pledging to establish a state founded on tolerance and coexistence among the country’s diverse ethnic and religious groups. Despite such overtures, many Syrians remain skeptical about the new rulers’ ability to rein in the more radical elements within HTS. Al-Masri, a resident of Damascus who provided only his last name, acknowledged that the new authorities have largely maintained order in the capital and elsewhere but expressed concerns that this stability could be short-lived. 'We know that Hayat Tahir al-Sham is trying to change, and we welcome that,' he told VOA via a messaging app. 'But there are two things that people in my circle are really concerned about. One is how genuine al-Sharaa is, and the other is how much control he really has over the more radical people in his group,' said al-Masri, who is a Sunni Muslim. His fears were echoed by another resident of Damascus who spoke to VOA on the condition of anonymity. 'Syrians in general, including the conservative ones, are not inclined to extremism,' the resident said. 'If al-Jolani keeps his promises and controls his men, then Syrians will support him. But if extremists dominate, Syrians will rise against them just as they rose against Bashar al-Assad,' the resident added, referring to the popular uprising against the former regime that began in 2011. Aymenn Jawad al-Tamimi, an expert on Islamist groups in Syria, says one of the main tensions he sees is 'between the HTS leadership under al-Jolani and the action of individual members who for years were fed propaganda' about other religions and sects. 'They may collectively impute guilt to Alawites and others like Christians and engage in attacks and insults,' he told VOA. On Monday, armed gunmen burned down a Christmas tree in the Christian-majority town of Suqaylabiya in Hama province in central Syria. Shortly after that, the HTS issued a statement saying the perpetrators, whom it described as foreign fighters, will be punished. While their exact numbers are unknown, fighters from several countries have joined HTS over the years, with Uighurs from China’s Muslim-majority region of Xinjiang being most notable. Aaron Zelin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said there have not been any indications of opposition within the main ranks of HTS toward al-Jolani’s current moderate approach. 'Even if there are people on their farther right flank that might be upset with them, it is plausible that if they then act out, the HTS and the caretaker government will arrest them,' he told VOA. 'I’m sure there are a lot of internal discussions and debates about how far they can go,' Zelin added. 'There are also the questions for some of them like ‘We will wait and see what this is like until the transition is over,’ and if this is just a public relations campaign, then maybe we will see some differences and changes and more reactions,' Zelin added. HTS has appointed a caretaker government, composed of loyalists, to manage affairs until March 1, 2025, the new government’s own deadline for initiating a transitional process. Caroline Rose, director of the Strategic Blind Spots Portfolio at the Washington-based New Lines Institute, believes 'that ultimately al-Sharaa will sideline the more extremist factions within HTS, the caretaker government, and the new government post-March 1.' She told VOA that this approach could particularly work if foreign governments 'keep normalization, sectoral sanctions relief, and delisting [from lists of designated terrorist groups] as an opportunity and a ‘carrot’ to incentivize behavioral change.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrians-welcome-new-rulers-pledge-of-moderation-but-are-concerned-about-extremists-in-their-midst-/7912678.html	2024-12-24T09:51:51-08:00	
Blast at Turkish ammunition factory kills 11 people	Istanbul — An explosion at an ammunition factory in northwest Turkey left 11 dead and five injured Tuesday morning. The blast occurred in Balikesir province, according to the state-run Anadolu Agency. The factory is in a rural area away from population centers. Balikesir Governor Ismail Ustaoglu said the explosion collapsed the capsule production building and the surrounding buildings had minor damage. 'The explosion was due to a technical issue. There is no possibility of sabotage,' he added. Justice Minister Yilmaz Tunc wrote on social media platform X that public prosecutors have been assigned to investigate the cause.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blast-at-turkish-ammunition-factory/7912650.html	2024-12-24T08:58:22-08:00	
Chad’s online journalists decry ban ahead of December 29 elections	Yaounde — Online media journalists in Chad are voicing dissatisfaction and frustration over officials’ refusal to lift a ban on the broadcasting of audiovisual content. The High Media and Audiovisual Authority, or HAMA, accuses journalists of reposting videos without the content producers’ permission but journalists say they are being silenced from reporting on critical election issues. Journalists reporting for online media platforms say they are surprised that Chad's High Media and Audiovisual Authority, or HAMA, has refused to respect a December 20 Supreme Court decision ordering an immediate end to a ban on broadcasting online media content. Bello Bakary Mana, the president of the Association of Online Media of Chad, Mana took part in a protest Tuesday in N'djamena against what he calls a deliberate attempt by HAMA to silence Chad's online media. Mana said several hundred online reporters assisted by local radio, print and TV journalists are in N'djamena to let the world know that the media is being silenced in Chad. 'They will continue protesting until HAMA stops threatening journalists and lifts what he calls its illegal December 4 ban on the broadcast of online audiovisual content,' he said. Bello, who spoke to VOA from N'djamena via a messaging app, also said only police can compel HAMA to respect the lifting of a ban on the broadcasting of online audiovisual content, but that police are controlled by the government, which ordered the ban. HAMA says it prohibited online newspapers from broadcasting audiovisual content because many of the newspapers refused to obey an order earlier this year to stop reposting videos from foreign sources, including international media outlets, without the author or media outlets’ permission, as required by law. Journalists say the decision, taken before elections on December 29 to mark an end to Chad's three-year transitional period, is an indication the government, through HAMA, wants to silence online media that the government has described as highly critical. HAMA has always complained that online media regularly publish unverifiable information about President Mahamat Idriss Deby. Deby became Chad's transitional president in April 2021 after his father, Idriss Deby Itno, was killed in a gun battle with rebels following 30 years in power. Deby was declared the winner of Chad's contested May 6 presidential polls amid opposition and civil society allegations the victory was stolen. Government officials in Chad complained after the presidential elections that online media were reporting on and posting videos of opposition and civil society members saying that Deby wants to continue his late father's rule, according to local media. Journalists in Chad say by banning online audiovisual content, HAMA wants to silence online media that have been reporting that Deby's Patriotic Salvation Movement, or MPS, wants to use the polls to consolidate its grip on power at all costs. Abderrahmane Barka, the president of HAMA, created by Chad's government to regulate the media in the central African state, says Chad's High Media and Audiovisual Authority that he leads noticed that before elections, rich politicians hire media organizations to broadcast campaign messages, and that poses a disadvantage to politicians who don’t have a lot of money. He says HAMA is reinforcing the law, which requires the media to give equal access without pay to all political parties taking part in elections. Barka spoke on state TV on Tuesday. He said Chadian laws do not permit online newspapers to broadcast audiovisual content but did not comment on whether a Supreme Court decision to lift the ban will be respected. Chad's online journalists say the ban has affected about 60% of their audience who no longer have access to online media. They say they are surprised that HAMA also ordered them to stop broadcasting audiovisual content that they produce locally. Before the ban and ahead of the December 29 elections, HAMA suspended all interactive online, radio and TV programs, arguing that the media do not have sufficient human resources to produce such programs during election periods — a claim the media deny. Last week, Reporters Without Borders asked Chad to reverse its decision and lift the ban. The media rights group says the job of HAMA is regulating and not prohibiting the media from informing, educating and entertaining their audience. RSF acknowledges that broadcasting content without the consent of the producers is wrong and has asked Chad to allow online reporters to broadcast local content they create.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-s-online-journalists-decry-ban-ahead-of-december-29-elections-/7912532.html	2024-12-24T08:40:01-08:00	
Pakistan resumes senior-level contacts with Afghanistan's Taliban to address mutual tensions	Islamabad — Taliban leaders in Afghanistan hosted meetings Tuesday with a high-level delegation from neighboring Pakistan, marking the resumption of such interactions after a year-long pause due to terrorism allegations. Mohammad Sadiq, Pakistan’s newly appointed special envoy for Afghan affairs, led his country’s team at the talks in Kabul with Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi and Interior Minister Sirajuddin Haqqani, among others. Muttaqi’s office said in a post-meeting statement that the delegations focused on enhancing diplomatic, trade, and transit relations between the countries, which share a nearly 2,600-kilometer border. The chief Taliban diplomat stated that Kabul 'desires positive relations' with Islamabad. Muttaqi said without elaborating that to develop trade and transit ties further, both governments 'must enhance mutual coordination, facilitate travelers’ cross-border movement, and address issues straining relations between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Taliban’s statement quoted Pakistani envoy Sadiq as saying that his mission was to 'bolster' bilateral political, economic, commercial, and transit relations. 'Held wide-ranging discussions. Agreed to work together to further strengthen bilateral cooperation as well as for peace and progress in the region,' the Pakistani envoy wrote on his X social media platform. Sadiq’s predecessor, Asif Ali, visited Kabul in September 2023 when Pakistan was experiencing a dramatic rise in terrorist attacks attributed to the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, with Islamabad persistently alleging the militant group was orchestrating the deadly cross-border violence from its Afghan 'hideouts.' TTP attacks have since intensified and killed hundreds of Pakistani civilians as well as security forces, leading to a further deterioration in relations. 'Given the current circumstances, we must expedite our collaborative efforts to safeguard the relationship between our peoples and ensure regional stability and development,' Haqqani’s office quoted him Tuesday as telling the Pakistani delegation. He stressed 'the urgency of accelerating joint efforts to resolve security and political challenges,' according to the statement. Taliban leaders have consistently denied allegations that Afghan territory is being used as a launching pad for attacks. The de facto Afghan government maintains it does not support the TTP or any other foreign militant group, describing the violence in Pakistan as an 'internal problem' for the neighboring country to resolve rather than blaming Kabul for the crisis. Afghanistan is landlocked, relying heavily on Pakistani overland routes and seaports to conduct bilateral and international trade. Tensions over terrorism charges have led to a significant decline in Afghan trade and transit activities through Pakistan in recent months. The Taliban swept back to power in 2021, but no country has officially recognized them as the legitimate rulers of Afghanistan. Several neighboring and regional countries, including Pakistan, China, Russia, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and Iran have retained their embassies in Kabul since the Taliban takeover, allowing the fundamentalist de facto rulers to take charge of Afghan diplomatic missions in their respective territories. Western countries have refused to open official contacts with the Taliban over their sweeping restrictions on Afghan women’s access to education, work, and most aspects of public life. The United Nations has turned down Taliban requests to let them represent Afghanistan at the global organization, citing the treatment of women. Taliban leaders defend their governance in line with Islamic law, known as Sharia, and Afghan culture, rejecting international criticism as interference in the country’s internal matters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-resumes-senior-level-contacts-with-afghanistan-s-taliban-to-address-mutual-tensions/7912605.html	2024-12-24T08:31:44-08:00	
People in Russia 'need the truth,' says journalist who sacrificed home and security to keep reporting	Prague — The list of sacrifices that Alesya Marokhovskaya has made to keep reporting on Russia from exile runs long: her home, her country, family, friends, culture, safety. This month alone, Russian authorities searched the home of the journalist’s parents in the eastern port town of Magadan and opened a criminal case against Marokhovskaya for violating Russia’s foreign agent law. When she spoke with VOA in Prague this fall, Marokhovskaya searched for words to explain why the sacrifices are worth it. Eventually, she settled on the Russian people. 'They’re poisoning Russians,' she said, explaining how she views Kremlin propaganda. 'Information in our world is one of the most important things, and I am completely against manipulating people’s minds.' As editor-in-chief of the exiled Russian investigative outlet IStories, breaking through propaganda to bring ordinary Russians the truth is Marokhovskaya’s core focus. But in doing so, Marokhovskaya and her team face legal threats and surveillance, even while based in Prague. Marokhovskaya had not planned to leave Russia, even when Moscow declared the journalist a so-called foreign agent in 2021. Instead, the reporter followed the strict rules that accompany the designation. For months, she labeled all of her social media posts — even ones that were photos of her dog — as the work of a so-called foreign agent, and she submitted financial reports to the Justice Ministry. 'It was really humiliating,' Marokhovskaya said. But she followed the rules because she wanted to keep reporting from inside Russia. 'For me, it was important to stay in Russia as long as I could. Because I was thinking there is no way to be a Russian journalist not inside Russia,' Marokhovskaya said. But when Russia invaded Ukraine, Marokhovskaya said it became clear that Moscow would ramp up its persecution of independent journalists. Soon after, she and many of her colleagues at IStories fled for the Czech capital of Prague. At the time, Marokhovskaya worried the relationship between IStories and its primary audience inside Russia wouldn’t survive the distance. 'It was our fear to become media for immigrants. We want to be media for Russians [inside Russia] in the first place,' Marokhovskaya said. But IStories survived. 'I still have this fear, but now I see we can work in such circumstances.' Marokhovskaya has worked for IStories, or 'Important Stories,' since it was founded in 2020. In September, at the age of 29, she became the outlet’s editor-in-chief. She took over the role from IStories founder Roman Anin, who is now the publisher. A former Novaya Gazeta reporter, Anin says he never expected something as extreme as the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but he predicted reporters would eventually have to leave because of Moscow’s rising repression. 'It was obvious that at some point, they will come after us as well,' Anin said. To Anin, a focus on collaborative journalism is one of the things that makes IStories distinct. The outlet also prioritizes publishing investigations and exclusive stories instead of daily news that other outlets are covering. 'The main job of reporters is actually to find the truth, not to republish it,' Anin said. Russia has labeled IStories as a foreign agent and an undesirable organization. The latter exposes its staffers, sources and donors to potential fines, criminal charges and jail time. That harassment shows how impactful IStories’ work has been, according to Karol Luczka, who covers Eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna. 'Investigative journalism definitely is the kind of journalism which angers political decision-makers the most,' he said. As the outlet’s new top editor, Marokhovskaya is tasked with leading what has become one of the most prominent exiled investigative Russian news outlets at a time when the stakes are especially high, she said. With the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war looming, Kremlin-backed harassment against exiled journalists posing a daily threat, and Russia’s future remaining uncertain, Marokhovskaya says their work is all the more important. Among her priorities is figuring out how to maintain the connection between IStories and its audience inside Russia — and, ideally, how to grow that audience. 'When you are living in Russia, you are surrounded by propaganda,' she said. 'Lots of people in Russia, they need the truth.' IStories doesn’t have much of a problem reaching people inside Russia who already oppose President Vladimir Putin and his war. Marokhovskaya wants to turn her focus to those who aren’t necessarily pro- or anti-Putin but lie somewhere in the ambivalent middle. 'These people are of interest to us. It’s [a] potential audience,' Marokhovskaya said. Part of that strategy is talking to people in a way that doesn’t isolate them, says Artem, the head of the IStories video department. 'We don’t say to them that you’re idiots, that you’re war criminals,' Artem said. 'We just present real life in Russia as it is. We’re talking to real people. We’re talking about their problems. We’re always trying to find something that’s interesting to just ordinary people.' A former journalist with Russian state-run media, Artem requested to be identified by only his first name for security reasons. Video is a primary focus at IStories. The site publishes on YouTube, where IStories has nearly 720,000 subscribers, and where most of its videos attract around 1 million views. In August, Russian authorities appeared to begin throttling YouTube loading speeds in an apparent attempt to limit access. Artem admitted he’s concerned about how that will affect IStories. The YouTube channel and videos have made an impact. A 2022 documentary that featured a Russian soldier confessing to killing a Ukrainian civilian has more than 2.5 million views. It also became the center of a lawsuit in Russia. The documentary’s lead reporter — Ekaterina Fomina, who now works at TV Rain — and IStories founder Anin are accused of spreading what the Kremlin views as false information about the Russian military. The pair are being tried in absentia and reject the charges. That lawsuit underscores the Moscow-backed threats facing exiled Russian journalists in a process known as transnational repression. Legal harassment — or 'lawfare' — is common. Surveillance, hacking and even suspected poisonings have also been documented. Over the course of several months last year, threatening messages were directed at Marokhovskaya and her colleague that suggested they were being surveilled. 'I’m physically in danger here. I put my family in potential danger,' Marokhovskaya said. 'It’s a big sacrifice.' Russia’s Prague embassy and foreign ministry did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment. With threats high, many of the outlet’s staffers work anonymously. 'It’s a pity, but it’s part of our work now,' Artem said. 'We’re fighting with criminals in the Kremlin, and they don’t follow rules. They just do what they want, and we’ll do the same,' he added. The personal cost of that work is high. But, said Anin, 'It’s so important in these historical moments to preserve the truth about what was really going on in the country, to preserve the truth about the crimes of Putin’s regime.' And for Marokhovskaya, it’s comforting to know that she’s doing the right thing for her country. 'It’s really simple to me,' she said. 'I’m a patriot for my country, and the Russian government — they’re not.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/press-freedom-istories-russia-media-exile/7912431.html	2024-12-24T08:06:39-08:00

At the time, Marokhovskaya worried the relationship between IStories and its primary audience inside Russia wouldn’t survive the distance. 'It was our fear to become media for immigrants. We want to be media for Russians [inside Russia] in the first place,' Marokhovskaya said. But IStories survived. 'I still have this fear, but now I see we can work in such circumstances.' Marokhovskaya has worked for IStories, or 'Important Stories,' since it was founded in 2020. In September, at the age of 29, she became the outlet’s editor-in-chief. She took over the role from IStories founder Roman Anin, who is now the publisher. A former Novaya Gazeta reporter, Anin says he never expected something as extreme as the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, but he predicted reporters would eventually have to leave because of Moscow’s rising repression. 'It was obvious that at some point, they will come after us as well,' Anin said. To Anin, a focus on collaborative journalism is one of the things that makes IStories distinct. The outlet also prioritizes publishing investigations and exclusive stories instead of daily news that other outlets are covering. 'The main job of reporters is actually to find the truth, not to republish it,' Anin said. Russia has labeled IStories as a foreign agent and an undesirable organization. The latter exposes its staffers, sources and donors to potential fines, criminal charges and jail time. That harassment shows how impactful IStories’ work has been, according to Karol Luczka, who covers Eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna. 'Investigative journalism definitely is the kind of journalism which angers political decision-makers the most,' he said. As the outlet’s new top editor, Marokhovskaya is tasked with leading what has become one of the most prominent exiled investigative Russian news outlets at a time when the stakes are especially high, she said. With the third anniversary of the Russia-Ukraine war looming, Kremlin-backed harassment against exiled journalists posing a daily threat, and Russia’s future remaining uncertain, Marokhovskaya says their work is all the more important. Among her priorities is figuring out how to maintain the connection between IStories and its audience inside Russia — and, ideally, how to grow that audience. 'When you are living in Russia, you are surrounded by propaganda,' she said. 'Lots of people in Russia, they need the truth.' IStories doesn’t have much of a problem reaching people inside Russia who already oppose President Vladimir Putin and his war. Marokhovskaya wants to turn her focus to those who aren’t necessarily pro- or anti-Putin but lie somewhere in the ambivalent middle. 'These people are of interest to us. It’s [a] potential audience,' Marokhovskaya said. Part of that strategy is talking to people in a way that doesn’t isolate them, says Artem, the head of the IStories video department. 'We don’t say to them that you’re idiots, that you’re war criminals,' Artem said. 'We just present real life in Russia as it is. We’re talking to real people. We’re talking about their problems. We’re always trying to find something that’s interesting to just ordinary people.' A former journalist with Russian state-run media, Artem requested to be identified by only his first name for security reasons. Video is a primary focus at IStories. The site publishes on YouTube, where IStories has nearly 720,000 subscribers, and where most of its videos attract around 1 million views. In August, Russian authorities appeared to begin throttling YouTube loading speeds in an apparent attempt to limit access. Artem admitted he’s concerned about how that will affect IStories. The YouTube channel and videos have made an impact. A 2022 documentary that featured a Russian soldier confessing to killing a Ukrainian civilian has more than 2.5 million views. It also became the center of a lawsuit in Russia. The documentary’s lead reporter — Ekaterina Fomina, who now works at TV Rain — and IStories founder Anin are accused of spreading what the Kremlin views as false information about the Russian military. The pair are being tried in absentia and reject the charges. That lawsuit underscores the Moscow-backed threats facing exiled Russian journalists in a process known as transnational repression. Legal harassment — or 'lawfare' — is common. Surveillance, hacking and even suspected poisonings have also been documented. Over the course of several months last year, threatening messages were directed at Marokhovskaya and her colleague that suggested they were being surveilled. 'I’m physically in danger here. I put my family in potential danger,' Marokhovskaya said. 'It’s a big sacrifice.' Russia’s Prague embassy and foreign ministry did not reply to VOA’s requests for comment. With threats high, many of the outlet’s staffers work anonymously. 'It’s a pity, but it’s part of our work now,' Artem said. 'We’re fighting with criminals in the Kremlin, and they don’t follow rules. They just do what they want, and we’ll do the same,' he added. The personal cost of that work is high. But, said Anin, 'It’s so important in these historical moments to preserve the truth about what was really going on in the country, to preserve the truth about the crimes of Putin’s regime.' And for Marokhovskaya, it’s comforting to know that she’s doing the right thing for her country. 'It’s really simple to me,' she said. 'I’m a patriot for my country, and the Russian government — they’re not.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-in-russia-need-the-truth-says-journalist-who-sacrificed-home-and-security-to-keep-reporting/7912431.html	2024-12-24T07:34:09-08:00

American Airlines operations up and running again after technical issue grounded US flights	American Airlines flights were cleared to fly by regulators early Tuesday after a brief grounding due to a systemwide technical issue. Just before 7 a.m. Eastern time, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered all American Airlines flights grounded in the U.S. at the airline’s request. American had reported a technical issue affecting its entire system with millions traveling for the holiday. In social media replies to frustrated travelers, the airline said: 'Our team is currently working to rectify this. Your continued patience is appreciated.' The company has not issued a press release explaining the issue and an email was not immediately returned. A post on the Federal Aviation Administration's website acknowledged the airline's request for a 'nationwide groundstop' for all American Airlines planes and their subsidiary airlines. The grounding occurred with millions of travelers expected to fly over the next 10 days. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through Jan. 2.	https://www.voanews.com/a/american-airlines-operations-up-and-running-again-after-technical-issue-grounded-us-flights/7912411.html	2024-12-24T06:16:33-08:00	
Syrian authorities say armed groups will dissolve	Syria’s new authorities said Tuesday that armed groups in the country agreed to dissolve and be integrated into the Defense Ministry. A statement said the decision followed a meeting between leaders of the armed groups and Ahmad al-Sharaa, who led the rebel advance that pushed longtime leader Bashar al-Assad from power. Rebels seized control of Syria’s capital December 8 after a lightning advance that saw them claim several key cities in a matter of days after many years of relative stalemate in the country’s 13-year civil war. Since Assad’s ouster, governments throughout the region have sent envoys to Damascus amid questions about Syria’s political future and concerns about additional instability in the region. One concern is the potential resurgence of the Islamic State group, which seized areas of eastern Syria in 2014 and western Iraq before losing much of that territory. The U.S. military said Monday it carried out an airstrike that killed two Islamic State militants in eastern Syria’s Deir Ezzour province. U.S. Central Command said in a statement that the militants were 'moving a truckload of weapons, which were destroyed during the strike.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-authorities-say-armed-groups-will-dissolve-/7912312.html	2024-12-24T05:13:08-08:00

Bethlehem is set to mark a second subdued Christmas during the war in Gaza	BETHLEHEM, West Bank — Bethlehem prepared Tuesday to mark another somber Christmas in the traditional birthplace of Jesus under the shadow of war in Gaza. The excitement and cheer that typically descends on the Palestinian town in the occupied West Bank on Christmas were nowhere to be found: The festive lights and giant tree that normally decorate Manger Square were missing. Throngs of foreign tourists that usually fill the square weren’t expected and youth marching bands that gather each year to mark the holiday were absent. Palestinian security forces arranged barriers near the Nativity Church, built atop the spot where Jesus is believed to have been born, and a worker cleared garbage bins. 'Always the message of Bethlehem is a message of peace and hope,' said Mayor Anton Salman. 'And these days, we are also sending our message to the world: peace and hope, but insisting that the world must work to end our suffering as Palestinian people.' The cancellation of Christmas festivities is a severe blow to the town's economy. Tourism accounts for an estimated 70% of Bethlehem’s income — almost all of it from the Christmas season. Salman said unemployment is hovering around 50% — higher than the 30% unemployment across the rest of the West Bank, according to the Palestinian Finance Ministry. The number of visitors to the town plunged from a pre-COVID high of around 2 million visitors per year in 2019 to fewer than 100,000 visitors in 2024, said Jiries Qumsiyeh, the spokesperson for the Palestinian Tourism Ministry. Bethlehem is an important center in the history of Christianity, but Christians make up only a small percentage of the roughly 14 million people spread across the Holy Land. There are about 182,000 in Israel, 50,000 in the West Bank and Jerusalem and 1,300 in Gaza, according to the U.S. State Department. While the war in Gaza has deterred tourists and pilgrims alike, it has also prompted a surge of violence in the West Bank, with more than 800 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire and dozens of Israelis killed in militant attacks. Since the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war, access to and from Bethlehem and other Palestinian towns in the West Bank has been difficult, with long lines of motorists waiting to pass Israeli military checkpoints. Restrictions have also prevented some 150,000 Palestinians from leaving the territory to work in Israel, causing the economy there to contract by 25%. More than 45,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza, according to health officials there, while some 90% of the territory’s 2.3 million residents have been displaced. Officials say more than half of the dead are women and children, though they don't give a breakdown of how many are civilians and how many fighters. In the Oct. 7 assault on southern Israel, Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 people, most of them civilians, and took more than 250 hostages.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bethlehem-is-set-to-mark-a-second-subdued-christmas-during-the-war-in-gaza-/7912280.html	2024-12-24T04:31:06-08:00	
Global hunger monitor says famine in war-torn Sudan is spreading	LONDON/CAIRO/DUBAI — Famine in Sudan has expanded to five areas and will likely spread to another five by May, the global hunger monitor reported Tuesday, while warring parties continue to disrupt humanitarian aid needed to alleviate one of the worst starvation crises in modern times. Famine conditions were confirmed in Abu Shouk and al-Salam, two camps for internally displaced people in al-Fashir, the besieged capital of North Darfur, as well as two other areas in South Kordofan state, according to the Famine Review Committee of the Integrated Food Phase Classification, or IPC. The committee also found famine, first identified in August, persists in North Darfur's Zamzam camp. The committee, which vets and verifies a famine finding, predicts famine will expand to five additional areas in North Darfur — Um Kadadah, Melit, al-Fashir, Tawisha and al-Lait — by May. The committee identified another 17 areas across Sudan at risk of famine. The IPC estimated about 24.6 million people - about half of all Sudanese - urgently need food aid through February, a sharp increase from the 21.1 million originally projected in June for the same period. The findings were published despite the Sudanese government's continued disruption of the IPC's process for analyzing acute food insecurity, which helps direct aid where it is most needed. On Monday, the government announced it was suspending its participation in the global hunger-monitoring system, saying it issues 'unreliable reports that undermine Sudan's sovereignty and dignity.' The IPC is an independent body funded by Western nations and overseen by 19 large humanitarian organizations and intergovernmental institutions. A linchpin in the world’s vast system for monitoring and alleviating hunger, it is designed to sound the alarm about developing food crises so organizations can respond and prevent famine and mass starvation. The Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) are engaged in a civil war with the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and are adamantly opposed to a famine declaration for fear it would result in diplomatic pressure to ease border controls and lead to greater foreign engagement with the RSF. In a Dec. 23 letter to the IPC, the famine review committee and diplomats, Sudan’s agriculture minister said the latest IPC report lacks updated malnutrition data and assessments of crop productivity during the recent summer rainy season. The growing season was successful, the letter says. It also notes 'serious concerns' about the IPC's ability to collect data from territories controlled by the RSF. Under the IPC system, a 'technical working group,' usually headed by the national government, analyzes data and periodically issues reports that classify areas on a one-to-five scale that slides from minimal to stressed, crisis, emergency and famine. In October, the Sudanese government temporarily stopped the government-led analysis, according to a document seen by Reuters. After resuming work, the technical working group stopped short of acknowledging famine. The Famine Review Committee report released today said the government-led group excluded key malnutrition data from its analysis. A recent Reuters investigation found that the Sudanese government obstructed the IPC’s work earlier this year, delaying by months a famine determination for the sprawling Zamzam camp for displaced people where residents have resorted to eating tree leaves to survive. The civil war that erupted in April 2023 has decimated food production and trade and driven more than 12 million Sudanese from their homes, making it the world’s largest displacement crisis. The RSF has looted commercial and humanitarian food supplies, disrupted farming and besieged some areas, making trade more costly and food prices unaffordable. The government also has blocked humanitarian organizations’ access to some parts of the country. 'We have the food. We have the trucks on the road. We have the people on the ground. We just need safe passage to deliver assistance,' said Jean-Martin Bauer, director of food security and nutrition analysis for the U.N.'s World Food Program. In response to questions from Reuters, the RSF said the accusations of looting were 'baseless.' The RSF also said millions of people in areas it controlled were facing 'the threat of hunger,' and that it was committed to 'fully facilitating the delivery of aid to those affected.' The government said that problems delivering aid were caused by the RSF. At least a dozen aid workers and diplomats contacted by Reuters for this report said tensions increased between the Sudanese government and humanitarian aid organizations after the IPC determined Zamzam was in famine in August. The sources said the government is slowing the aid response. The government’s general and military intelligence services oversee aid delivery, subjecting international aid approvals to the SAF's political and military goals, the sources said. The government is slow to approve visas for aid workers, and several aid workers said it has discouraged NGOs from providing relief in the hard-hit Darfur region, which is largely controlled by RSF forces. The government has told aid organizations 'there are no legitimate needs in Darfur, so you should not work there, and if you continue to respond to needs there, you should not expect visas,' said one senior aid official, who asked not to be named. The number of visa applications awaiting approval for non-UN aid workers has skyrocketed in the last four months, and the percentage approved has plummeted, according to data maintained by Sudan's INGO Forum, which represents and advocates for international non-governmental organizations in the country. The government didn't respond to specific questions about the blocking of visas. In the past, it has said that the majority of visa requests are approved. In October, the Sudanese government pressured the U.N. to remove the top humanitarian aid official for Sudan's embattled Darfur region after the person traveled there without government authorization, three sources told Reuters. Requests for authorization had stalled, the sources said. The government told the U.N. it would throw the official out if he was not withdrawn, the sources said. The U.N. complied. The government didn't respond to questions about the aid official's removal. A U.N. spokesperson said the organization doesn't comment on staff 'working arrangements.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-hunger-monitor-says-famine-in-war-torn-sudan-is-spreading-/7912264.html	2024-12-24T04:14:35-08:00	
Mozambique’s highest court upholds victory for the ruling Frelimo Party	Maputo — Mozambique's top court has declared election victory for the country’s ruling Frelimo Party and its 47-year-old presidential candidate, Daniel Chapo, in an election process marred by widespread rigging that sparked nearly two months of violent protests, causing the deaths of more than 100 people and injuring several others. Frelimo has been in power for 49 years. After more than 55 days of waiting, the chairperson of the Constitutional Council, Lucia Ribeiro, on Monday acknowledged irregularities in the election but said this did not substantially influence the results, and that Daniel Chapo of the governing Frelimo Party won with 65.17% of the vote, while opposition politician Venâncio Mondlane had 24.29%. The Constitutional Council also gave Frelimo a majority in parliament and all the 10 provincial governors. The results were initially announced by the National Election Commission in late October and triggered protests for more than eight weeks after Mondlane rejected the result and called for protests that resulted in at least 130 deaths in clashes with the police. 'One, proclaims citizen Daniel Francisco Chapo, elected president of the Republic of Mozambique. Two, validates the results of the parliamentary elections on October 9, 2024,' said Ribeiro. According to the final ruling, for parliament, Frelimo's number of seats was cut from 195 to 169. The Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique, which supported Mondlane, remains the second-largest party. Its number of seats increased from 31 to 43. Mozambique held several elections on October 9: presidential, legislative and provincial. The results announced by the National Election Commission in October gave victory to Chapo. In his acceptance speech on Monday, Chapo said he is ready to serve the interests of all Mozambicans and not just for his party and promised to introduce several reforms. 'It has become clear during these days that our electoral system needs profound reforms, and we all agree,' said Chapo. 'We need to build a new democratic architecture that responds to the aspirations of our society and not just partisan interests. I want to take this opportunity to say that I am willing to lead this reform process of our society and not just partisan interests. I want to take this opportunity to say that I am willing to lead this reform process.' Soon after the announcement of the results, Mondlane’s supporters again protested in the capital, Maputo, burning tires and blocking roads. Mondlane accused Frelimo of rigging the vote and called for a national shutdown starting this Friday. Human rights activist and director of the Center for Democracy and Human Rights Adriano Nuvunga says the results proclaimed by the Constitutional Council will only bring problems to the country instead of solving them. 'It is unbelievable that the Constitutional Council read these results knowing that the general state of the nation in Mozambique feels attacked by these results. This would have been the moment for the Council bringing the nation together, mobilizing to find a formula for everyone to feel represented in what will be the next government,' said Nuvunga. Multiple human rights organizations reported that violent and repressive measures were used by security forces against protesters who were taking part in peaceful demonstrations. At least 300 protesters have been arrested since October in connection with these demonstrations. With all the contesting parties rejecting the results on Monday, violent protests will continue in Mozambique at least for the coming weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-s-highest-court-upholds-victory-for-the-ruling-frelimo-party-/7912249.html	2024-12-24T03:50:29-08:00

Finnish youth taught how to spot disinformation	HELSINKI, FINLAND — Finland is consistently ranked as Europe's most media literate country and the skills needed to spot online hoaxes are on the school curriculum, amidst a boom of mis- and disinformation campaigns. 'Who knew what a troll was before?' literature and Finnish language teacher Saara Varmola asked her 14-to-15-year-old students, who all raised their hands during a class at a Helsinki school in November. 'Who produced the material that you watch, what do you produce yourself and whether you have an ethical responsibility,' Varmola tells AFP, as she lists the critical questions to ask when living in a global information environment increasingly characterized by misleading information. By teaching its citizens how to critically engage with media content to debunk hoaxes, mis- and disinformation, as well as to produce content of their own, Finland wants to promote media literacy as a civic skill. The Nordic country was among the first in Europe to outline a national policy for media literacy in 2013. Updated in 2019, the national policy ensures media literacy is integrated in subjects throughout education from early childhood to upper secondary classes. To enhance skills among adults and the elderly, libraries and NGOs are offering courses. 'Media literacy is essential to building societal resilience, and Finland realized this quite early on,' Anders Adlercreutz, Minister of Education, told AFP. ‘’As traditional media is responsible for less and less of the information we receive, it's especially important to be able to critically evaluate what you read,' he added. 'Not immune to influence' Considered a forerunner, Finland has been ranked first on the European Media Literacy Index every year since it was first published in 2017 by the Bulgarian Open Society Institute. The index compares 41 countries' resilience to disinformation based on indicators such as quality of education, media freedom and trust in society. Neighbours Denmark, Norway, Estonia and Sweden trailed Finland's top ranking last year. A collaborative approach between many sectors help explain Finland's success in promoting media literacy among its 5.5 million residents, according to Adlercreutz. 'It's not just the school, it's the media, the newspapers, businesses, the libraries, museums. Everybody sort of takes part in this work,' he said. According to Leo Pekkala, Deputy Director of Finland's National Audiovisual Institute (KAVI) -- an institution mandated to implement the country's media literacy policy -- it also boils down to Finns' trust in its societal institutions. 'We Finns still have a very strong trust in the defense forces, the army, the police and the government. We trust our politicians and we also trust the media,' he said. Still, between sharing a 1,340-kilometer border with Russia and facing the rise of artificial intelligence, Finland is not immune to the influence of dis- and misinformation campaigns, Adlercreutz warned. 'I'm not so sure that we have yet been tested fully in this matter', he said. Critical thinking key In the snow-covered school in Helsinki, Varmola handed out assignments to her students with questions related to online disinformation: 'Can youtubers and streamers mislead?' and 'Is sponsored content a way of influencing through information?' 'Yes, youtubers and streamers and people on social media can do it. In my opinion, it's something you come across,' 8th grader Bruno Kerman said in a discussion with some of his fellow students. 'Yes, and who is preventing them?' classmate Niilo Korkeaoja continued. The students said the education system had equipped them with abilities to spot suspicious information online, critically analyze content and verify sources they encounter on social media networks such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram. 'School has taught me to interpret messages in the media, also those written between the lines,' Ronja Turunen, another student, said. The country has a long tradition of promoting media skills among its citizens — when its free comprehensive school system was introduced in the 1970's, the first education curriculum already referenced mass media education. While education has evolved and adapted to the changing media environment and the advent of digital technologies, the key objective of teaching critical thinking has persisted, Pekkala noted. 'Our overall objective is to promote the kind of skills that will enable people to think and act critically and be active members of a democratic society,' he said. A major challenge now is to keep all its citizens up to date with the rapid changes in the digital sphere, including for the country's growing elderly population who may never have learned how to detect fake news on the internet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finnish-youth-taught-how-to-spot-disinformation-/7912218.html	2024-12-24T02:58:38-08:00	
Japanese PM Ishiba: important to strengthen US-Japan alliance	TOKYO — Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said on Tuesday he wanted to strengthen his country's alliance with the United States, as he pushed for as early as possible a meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Japan is neighbors with an increasingly assertive China and a nuclear-armed North Korea that has been deepening military ties with Russia. 'I think it's important to strengthen the U.S.-Japan alliance even further... and share a common understanding of the situation in north-east Asia,' he said at a press conference, adding that no dates for a potential meeting were set yet. Ishiba, in office since October, has sought a meeting with Trump, but told reporters last month that the president-elect's camp had said meetings with world leaders were restricted under the Logan Act before Trump's January inauguration. Trump has met with Akie Abe, the widow of the late Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Ishiba also said his cabinet plans to approve on Dec. 27 a draft state budget for the next fiscal year from April. He also pledged to work on measures to raise minimum wages and to eliminate public concerns for the future to boost private consumption.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japanese-pm-ishiba-important-to-strengthen-us-japan-alliance/7912212.html	2024-12-24T02:38:19-08:00	
Explosion sinks Russian cargo ship in Mediterranean, Russian Foreign Ministry says	MOSCOW — An engine room explosion sank a Russian cargo ship in the Mediterranean Sea between Spain and Algeria and two of its crew are missing, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. The vessel, built in 2009 and called ‘’Ursa Major,’’ was controlled by Oboronlogistika, a company that is part of the Russian Defense Ministry's military construction operations, which had previously said it was en route to the Russian far eastern port of Vladivostok with two giant port cranes lashed to its deck. The Foreign Ministry's crisis center said in a statement that 14 of the ship's 16 crew members had been rescued and brought to Spain, but that two crew were still missing. It did not say what had caused the engine room explosion. Unverified video footage of the ship heavily listing to its starboard side with its bow much lower down in the water than usual was filmed on Dec. 23 by a passing ship and published on Russia's life.ru news outlet on Tuesday. Oboronlogistika, the ship's ultimate owner, said in a statement on Dec. 20 that the ship, which LSEG data showed was previously called Sparta III, had been carrying specialized port cranes due to be installed at the port of Vladivostok as well as parts for new ice-breakers. Two giant cranes could be seen strapped to the deck in the unverified video footage. LSEG ship tracking data shows the vessel departed from the Russian port of Saint Petersburg on Dec. 11 and was last seen sending a signal at 2204 GMT on Monday between Algeria and Spain. On leaving Saint Petersburg it had indicated that its next port of call was the Russian port of Vladivostok, not the Syrian port of Tartous which it has called at previously. The operator and owner is a company called SK-Yug, part of Oboronlogistika, according to LSEG data. Oboronlogistika and SK-Yug declined to comment on the ship's sinking. Spanish news outlet El Espanol said on its website that crew members had been evacuated to the Spanish port of Cartagena and that several vessels, including a Spanish Navy ship, had taken part in rescuing the crew.

Ukrainian forces destroy 36 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it shot down 36 of the 60 drones that Russian forces deployed in overnight attacks. The intercepts took place in the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zaporizhzhia regions, Ukraine’s air force said. Serhiy Lysak, governor of Dnipropetrovsk, said on Telegram that the drone attacks and Russian shelling damaged several homes and a power line. In Khmelnytskyi in western Ukraine, Governor Serhii Tiurin reported the Russian attack damaged several homes. Officials in the Sumy region in northeastern Ukraine said a farm building was damaged there. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday its air defenses destroyed four Ukrainian aerial drones, including three over the Rostov region and one over Voronezh. Both Rostov and Voronezh are located along the Russia-Ukraine border and are frequent targets of Ukrainian drones. The governors of Rostov and Voronezh each said on Telegram there were no reports of damage or casualties as a result of the Ukrainian attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-forces-destroy-36-russian-drones/7912194.html	2024-12-24T01:43:12-08:00

UN investigative team says Syria's new authorities 'very receptive' to probe of Assad war crimes	UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. organization assisting in investigating the most serious crimes in Syria said Monday the country’s new authorities were 'very receptive' to its request for cooperation during a just-concluded visit to Damascus, and it is preparing to deploy. The visit led by Robert Petit, head of the International, Impartial and Independent Mechanism for Syria, was the first since the organization was established by the U.N. General Assembly in 2016. It was created to assist in evidence-gathering and prosecution of individuals responsible for possible war crimes, crimes against humanity and genocide since Syria’s civil war began in 2011. Petit highlighted the urgency of preserving documents and other evidence before it is lost. Since the rebel overthrow of Syria’s President Bashar Assad and the rebel opening of prisons and detention facilities there have been rising demands from Syrians for the prosecution of those responsible for atrocities and killings while he was in power. 'The fall of the Assad rule is a significant opportunity for us to fulfill our mandate on the ground,' Petit said. 'Time is running out. There is a small window of opportunity to secure these sites and the material they hold.' U.N. associate spokesperson Stephane Tremblay said Monday the investigative team 'is preparing for an operational deployment as early as possible and as soon as it is authorized to conduct activities on Syrian soil.' The spokesperson for the organization, known as the IIIM, who was on the trip with Petit, went further, telling The Associated Press: 'We are preparing to deploy on the expectation that we will get authorization.' 'The representatives from the caretaker authorities were very receptive to our request for cooperation and are aware of the scale of the task ahead,' the spokesperson said, speaking on condition of not being named. 'They emphasized that they will need expertise to help safeguard the newly accessible documentation.' The IIIM did not disclose which officials in the new government it met with or the site that Petit visited afterward. 'Even at one facility,' Petit said, 'the mountains of government documentation reveal the chilling efficiency of systemizing the regime’s atrocity crimes.' He said that a collective effort by Syrians, civil society organizations and international partners will be needed, as a priority, ' to preserve evidence of the crimes committed, avoid duplication, and ensure that all victims are inclusively represented in the pursuit of justice.' In June 2023, the 193-member General Assembly also established an Independent Institution of Missing Persons in the Syrian Arab Republic to clarify the fate and whereabouts of more than 130,000 people missing as a result of the conflict.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-investigative-team-says-syria-s-new-authorities-very-receptive-to-probe-of-assad-war-crimes/7912161.html	2024-12-23T23:56:04-08:00	
Amicorp Group to dispute $1 billion legal claim by Malaysia's 1MDB for alleged fraud	KUALA LUMPUR — Amicorp Group has said it will dispute a claim for more than $1 billion filed by scandal-hit Malaysian fund 1MDB, denying allegations it knowingly facilitated more than $7 billion in fraudulent transactions related to the misappropriation of 1MDB funds. Corporate services provider Amicorp, in a statement late Monday, said it would defend itself and challenge the effort by sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad, which filed a legal claim last week in the British Virgin Islands. 1MDB has alleged Hong Kong-headquartered Amicorp and its CEO played a vital role in enabling the Malaysian fund to be defrauded between 2009 and 2014. The claim is one of the biggest filed by 1MDB related to the multibillion-dollar graft scandal. Malaysian and U.S. investigators have previously estimated $4.5 billion was siphoned away from 1MDB in a complex, globe-spanning scheme that implicated former Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, Goldman Sachs staff and high-level officials elsewhere. 1MDB alleges Amicorp created and managed a complex conspiracy consisting of layers of shell companies, sham transactions, and fraudulent financial structures that obscured the true origin and destination of the funds. But Amicorp said the misappropriated 1MDB funds were 'ill-gotten by or for the benefit' of Malaysian senior government officials and the top senior management of Abu Dhabi's International Petroleum Investment Co and its unit Aabar Investments PJS. The two UAE firms agreed in 2023 to pay $1.8 billion to Malaysia to settle a legal dispute over the 1MDB scandal. Najib, who helped found 1MDB in 2009, is currently in prison for corruption and money laundering for receiving about $10 million from former 1MDB unit SRC International and has consistently denied wrongdoing. Najib's 12-year prison sentence was later halved by a pardons board chaired by Malaysia's former king, but he faces several other graft trials related to 1MDB. Amicorp said it has not been the subject of any administrative investigations or party to any civil suits, and has cooperated with Singapore and Swiss government agencies and criminal prosecutors based on 'mutual assistance' in criminal matters. It did not provide further details.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amicorp-group-to-dispute-1-billion-legal-claim-by-malaysia-s-1mdb-for-alleged-fraud-/7912158.html	2024-12-23T23:47:16-08:00	
Hong Kong offers bounties for six more democrats in security squeeze	HONG KONG — Hong Kong on Tuesday imposed bounties of HK$1 million, or $128,728, on six more pro-democracy campaigners deemed to have violated national security laws, and revoked the passports of seven others, in a continuing security squeeze in the financial hub. Hong Kong's Secretary for Security Chris Tang said the six -- all based overseas in countries including Britain and the United States -- had engaged in the alleged crimes of incitement to secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces. The six included UK-based commentator Chung Kim-wah, former head of a pro-independence group Tony Chung, and Carmen Lau, a member of the Hong Kong Democracy Council. '(I) will not back down only because of an arrest warrant and a bounty. And I hope to have every one of you standing with me in this fight for Hong Kong,' wrote Lau on Twitter. The move to add more names to Hong Kong's wanted list comes as the city strives to revive its economic growth and international reputation after a years-long crackdown on dissent that has drawn global criticism. China and Hong Kong authorities have defended the clampdown under sweeping national security laws, saying stability has been restored after mass pro-democracy protests in 2019. Tang said the six pro-democracy campaigners had engaged in activities including giving speeches, social media posts and lobbying for Hong Kong officials and judges to be sanctioned by foreign governments, thus endangering national security. China's office for safeguarding national security in Hong Kong said in a statement it supported the actions because these individuals had engaged in 'anti-China' and destabilizing acts. Others were deemed to have advocated Hong Kong's independence from China. Hong Kong, a former British colony for over 150 years, returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 'Instead of celebrating Xmas, it (Hong Kong) is taking a major step to escalate its transnational repression campaign,' wrote Anna Kwok, a U.S. based Hong Kong activist. There are now a total of 19 opposition figures on the city's wanted list including lawyers Kevin Yam and Dennis Kwok, former lawmaker Ted Hui and activists Nathan Law and Joey Siu. Hui had $100,000 of his money confiscated from an unspecified bank in the city, Tang said. Notices bearing black and white photographs of the 'fugitives' have been posted in public including at Hong Kong's international airport. Seven 'absconders,' including Hui, who are now based overseas, also had their passports revoked under a fresh set of national security laws known as Article 23, enacted this year. 'They will become someone without an identity,' Tang told reporters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-offers-bounties-for-six-more-democrats-in-security-squeeze/7912151.html	2024-12-23T23:16:23-08:00	
Israeli intercepts missile from Yemen, warns of ‘severe blow’ to Houthi militants	Israel’s military said early Tuesday it intercepted a missile that was launched from Yemen. The missile prompted air sirens, but caused no damage after being destroyed before entering Israeli territory, the military said. The Yemen-based Houthi militants have fired scores of missiles at Israel since Hamas launched its attack on Israel in October 2023, sparking the war in the Gaza Strip. Israel’s response has included airstrikes on Houthi targets, and on Monday Israeli Defense Minister Israel Katz warned that Houthi leaders would face the fate as leaders from Hamas and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group who have been killed in Israeli strikes. Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis are all backed by Iran, and all have been designated as terror groups by the United States and others. Katz on Monday confirmed Israel was responsible for the August explosion in Tehran that killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh. Israel was widely believed to have been behind the attack, but Monday’s comments appeared to be Israel’s first public acknowledgment. Israeli forces killed a number of Hezbollah leaders in recent months amid intensified fighting in southern and eastern Lebanon. That conflict has cooled with a month-old cease-fire, while negotiators including Egypt, the United States and Qatar have been working to try to achieve an elusive halt in fighting in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a speech Monday in the Knesset that there has been 'some progress' in the ongoing negotiations to secure the release of Israeli hostages held in Gaza. 'Everything we are doing cannot be disclosed,' Netanyahu said. 'I wish to say cautiously that there has been some progress and we will not stop acting until we bring them all home.' Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in their October 2023 attack on southern Israel and took about 250 others hostage. There are still around 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, though at least one-third are believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,200 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. Netanyahu also said Monday that he wants to sign new peace agreements with Arab countries, similar to the 2020 Abraham Accords negotiated by the U.S. for Israel and several Arab countries. 'Moderate Arab countries view Israel as a regional power and a potential ally,' Netanyahu said. 'I intend to seize this opportunity to the fullest.' Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-intercepts-missile-from-yemen-warns-of-severe-blow-to-houthi-militants/7912133.html	2024-12-23T21:25:27-08:00	
Report: Panel unable to reach consensus on Nippon's US Steel bid	tokyo — The Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS) has told the White House it is unable to reach a consensus on national security risks involved in Nippon Steel's bid for U.S. Steel, The Washington Post reported Monday. The decision now lies with President Joe Biden, who has 15 days to act. Both Biden and President-elect Donald Trump have said they oppose the $15 billion deal, which Nippon Steel announced last December. Nippon Steel said Tuesday that it did not receive any updates from CFIUS. U.S. Steel did not immediately reply to request for a comment. Both companies had previously planned to close the deal before the year's end. CFIUS, a government interagency committee that reviews security implications of foreign investment in the United States, said Monday that allowing Nippon Steel to take over U.S. Steel could result in lower domestic steel production, representing 'a national security risk,' according to the Post. Nippon Steel said it could eliminate that risk by appointing U.S. citizens to top management and board of director positions at U.S. Steel, but the committee was divided in its view of whether those remedies would be sufficient, the newspaper said. The U.S. Treasury Department, which leads CFIUS; the Commerce Department; and White House did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Nippon Steel faces a $565 million penalty to U.S. Steel if the deal collapses, which would also be a major blow to the Japanese steelmaker's overseas expansion. It said earlier that it could pursue legal action against the U.S. government if the deal fell apart. With U.S. Steel, Nippon Steel aimed to raise its global steel production capacity to 85 million metric tons per year from 65 million tons now, and the asset is core to its goal of lifting production capacity to more than 100 million tons in the long term. With Japan being the largest foreign investor in the U.S., Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba last month sent a letter to Biden asking him to approve Nippon Steel's acquisition of U.S. Steel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-panel-unable-to-reach-consensus-on-nippon-s-us-steel-bid/7912095.html	2024-12-23T18:56:13-08:00	
El Salvador lawmakers overturn mining ban in win for president	SAN SALVADOR, El salvador — El Salvador's legislature overturned a seven-year-old ban on metals mining Monday, a move that President Nayib Bukele had pushed for to boost economic growth, but that environmental groups had opposed. El Salvador in 2017 became the first country in the world to ban all forms of metals mining. Bukele, who took office in 2019, has called the ban absurd. All 57 of Bukele's allies in the Central American country's 60-seat legislature voted for the president's legislation to overturn the ban. The legislation will grant the Salvadoran government sole authority over mining activities within the country's land and maritime territory. 'By creating a law that puts the state at the center, we are guaranteeing that the population's well-being will be at the center of decision-making,' lawmaker Elisa Rosales, from Bukele's New Ideas party, said in a speech to the legislature. The legislation does prohibit the use of mercury in mining and seeks to declare some areas incompatible with metals mining as protected nature reserves. El Salvador's economy is expected to grow 3% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, but it has a heavy debt burden that hit a level of around 85% of gross domestic product earlier this year. Bukele, who enjoys wide popularity among voters after a gang crackdown, has touted mining's economic potential for the country of roughly 6 million people. The president shared on social media last month that studies conducted in just 4% of Salvadoran territory where mining is possible had identified gold deposits worth $132 billion, equivalent to about 380% of El Salvador's gross domestic product. 'This wealth, given by God, can be harnessed responsibly to bring unprecedented economic and social development to our people,' Bukele wrote at the time. Dozens of people protested Monday near Congress against the reauthorization of mining, arguing that future projects could affect the communities and ecosystem of the smallest country in Central America. 'We oppose metals mining because it has been technically and scientifically proven that mining is not viable in the country,' environmentalist Luis Gonzalez told reporters. 'The level of contamination that would be generated in the water, soil and biodiversity is unacceptable for life as we know it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/el-salvador-lawmakers-overturn-mining-ban-in-win-for-president-/7912091.html	2024-12-23T18:41:12-08:00	
Videos appear to show 2 of 4 missing Ecuadorian kids taken by men in military uniform	GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador — Ecuador's President Daniel Noboa on Monday pledged that his government would not cover up for anyone involved in the disappearance of four children who were last seen running away from a military convoy this month. The statement came as Noboa's government, which has leaned on the armed forces to try to rein in soaring crime, is under pressure from human rights organizations and fellow Ecuadorians over the case. Dozens of people demonstrated Monday in Guayaquil, where the children ages 11 to 15 went missing December 8, demanding information about their whereabouts and asking that the case be investigated as a forced disappearance. Meanwhile, surveillance videos have emerged from Guayaquil, showing men in military uniform grabbing two boys and driving off with them. The two are believed to be among the four children who disappeared that night. Ecuador's defense minister, Gian Carlo Loffredo, on Monday confirmed the four were detained in the area where the footage was taken. The Associated Press on Monday reviewed the videos, including those from a security camera at an intersection across from a public hospital near the Las Malvinas neighborhood, where the missing children lived. The videos were handed over by a city contractor to the attorney general's office, the anti-kidnapping unit of the National Police and the National Assembly. The videos show a group of children running, men in uniform, two children being placed in the back of a pickup truck and the vehicle moving through the streets of Guayaquil. The footage appears to back up the account of the father of two of the children given to local media. In related developments, the attorney general's office, in response to questions from the AP, confirmed that authorities raided an air force base on the outskirts of Guayaquil early Monday. The raid seized two white vans and the cellphones of 16 soldiers who carried out an unspecified operation the day the children went missing, according to the authorities. In the videos seen by the AP, two boys — one in a blue shirt and the other in an orange shirt — are taken by the uniformed men, placed face down in the back of a white pickup truck with tinted windows. One of the children is then punched in the head. The vehicle has a flashing siren, no license plate and a black bench in the back, similar to those used in military patrols. The men in the video are armed and in camouflage uniforms with badges resembling those of the Ecuadorian Air Force. Luis Arroyo, the father of two of the missing children, earlier told local media his children were on their way home after playing soccer when two vehicles carrying people in military uniforms arrived in the area. The children, he said, were chased, and four were caught and driven away. It wasn't clear how he knew this. Part of the footage shows 11 children near an overpass. A while later, some children are seen running and two of them get stopped, one by a person in uniform and the other by a civilian. The two are the ones later being pushed into the back of the pickup truck. Loffredo, the defense minister, told reporters Monday that according to a military report, the children were detained by a patrol with 16 agents who 'observed eight people who were allegedly robbing a woman.' He said the military later released the minors and did not hand them over to the police. The footage reviewed by the AP does not show the alleged robbery. Noboa told the local Radio Democracy station that it was still premature to classify the children's absence as a forced disappearance. 'We are on the side of justice, and whether it was a civilian, a priest, a policeman, a soldier who was involved, at the end of the day, people need answers,' said Noboa, who is seeking reelection in February. 'We are not going to cover up for anyone.' Fernando Bastias, a member of Ecuador's Permanent Committee for the Defense of Human Rights, an NGO, said the disappearances constitute 'a serious violation of human rights' and called for the prosecution of any military personnel involved.	https://www.voanews.com/a/videos-appear-to-show-2-of-4-missing-ecuadorian-kids-taken-by-men-in-military-uniform/7912073.html	2024-12-23T17:30:51-08:00	
Hawaii's Kilauea volcano erupts, spewing columns of lava	LOS ANGELES — One of the world's most active volcanoes sprang into life again Monday, spewing columns of lava 80 meters above Hawaii, U.S. vulcanologists said. Images showed enormous fissures in the caldera of Kilauea, on Hawaii's Big Island, spraying jets of molten rock into the air. The U.S. Geological Survey’s Hawaiian Volcano Observatory said the eruption began just after 2 a.m. local time (1200 GMT) in the southwestern section of the caldera. 'At 4:30 a.m., lava fountains were observed with heights up to 80 meters [262 feet],' the agency said. 'Molten material, including lava bombs, is being ejected from the winds on the caldera floor up onto the west caldera rim.' The eruption was also sending matter much higher into the atmosphere. 'The plume of volcanic gas and fine volcanic particles is reaching elevations of 6,000-8,000 feet above sea level ... and winds are transporting it to the southwest,' the observatory said. The observatory said sulfur dioxide emanating from the fissure would react with other gases in the atmosphere. So-called vog — volcanic smog — can affect people and animals, as well as crops. Kilauea has been very active since 1983 and erupts relatively regularly, including most recently in September. It is one of six active volcanoes in the Hawaiian Islands, which include Mauna Loa, the largest volcano in the world, though Kilauea is far more active.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hawaii-s-kilauea-volcano-erupts-spewing-columns-of-lava-/7912065.html	2024-12-23T17:14:25-08:00	
Holy Year about to start in Rome	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Tuesday formally inaugurates the 2025 Holy Year, reviving an ancient church tradition encouraging the faithful to make pilgrimages to Rome, amid new security fears following a Christmas market attack in Germany. At the start of Christmas Eve Mass, Francis will push open the Holy Door on St. Peter's Basilica, which will stay open throughout the year to allow the estimated 32 million pilgrims projected to visit Rome to pass through. The first Holy Year was called in 1300, and in recent times they are generally celebrated every 25 to 50 years. Pilgrims who participate can obtain 'indulgences' — the centuries-old feature of the Catholic Church related to the forgiveness of sins that roughly amounts to a 'get out of Purgatory free' card. The last regular Jubilee was in 2000, when St. John Paul II ushered in the church's third millennium. Francis declared a special Jubilee in 2015-2016 dedicated to mercy and the next one planned is in 2033, to commemorate the anniversary of the crucifixion of Christ. What are indulgences? According to church teaching, Catholics who confess their sins are forgiven and therefore released from the eternal or spiritual punishment of damnation. An indulgence is designed to remove the 'temporal' punishment of sin that may remain — the consequence of the wrongdoing that might disrupt the sinner's relationships with others. Martin Luther's opposition to the church's practice of selling indulgences inspired him to launch the Protestant Reformation in the 1500s. He was excommunicated, and the practice of buying and selling indulgences has been illegal since the 1562 Council of Trent. But the granting of them has continued and is an important element in Holy Year pilgrimages. According to the norms issued for the 2025 Jubilee, Catholics can obtain an indulgence if they: Undertake a pious pilgrimage, participating in Masses and other sacraments, at any of the four papal basilicas in Rome or the Holy Land, or other sacred Jubilee sites 'so as to manifest the great need for conversion and reconciliation.' Participate in works of charity, mercy or penance, such as visiting prisoners, sick people or elderly people or undertaking corporal works of mercy 'to feed the hungry, give drink to the thirsty, clothe the naked, welcome the stranger, heal the sick, visit the imprisoned and bury the dead.' Abstain, in a spirit of penance, for at least one day of the week from 'futile distractions,' such as social media, or from 'superfluous consumption,' such as fasting; or donating a proportionate sum to the poor or to help migrants. Why the focus on prisoners? Francis has long made ministry to prisoners a hallmark of his priestly vocation, and a Holy Year dedicated to a message of hope is no exception. In fact, the only other Holy Door that Francis will personally open this year is located at the chapel of Rome's Rebibbia prison, to draw attention to the need to give prisoners in particular hope of a better future. The final big event of the Holy Year before it closes on January 6, 2026, is the Jubilee of Prisoners on December 14, 2025. What's on the calendar? The Jubilee calendar is a compilation of official and unofficial Holy Year events that will test the stamina of Francis, who just turned 88 and went into the Christmas season with a cold that made it hard for him to catch his breath. Every month has two, three or four official Jubilee events that Francis is expected to attend that are designated for particular categories of people: the armed forces, artists, priests, poor people, volunteers and teachers. Then there are the unofficial Jubilee events, in which individual dioceses and other groups have organized their own pilgrimages to Rome. One item on the Jubilee's unofficial calendar, September 6, has made news because it has been organized by an Italian association, 'La Tenda di Gionata' or 'Jonathan's Tent,' which is dedicated to making LGBTQ+ Catholics feel more welcome in the Catholic Church. What about security for so many people? Rome Mayor Roberto Gualtieri has said the security plans call for a mix of traditional policing — a reported 700 extra officers — plus high-tech surveillance using drones and closed-circuit cameras that, thanks to algorithms informed by artificial intelligence, can keep track in real time of crowd sizes and congestion points. 'There will be more vehicles, more men, and very, very, shall we say, robust and important security devices,' Gualtieri told reporters last week. The Vatican has tried to reduce congestion for pilgrims by allowing them to reserve their visits to St. Peter's Basilica online in advance. After a driver plowed into a Christmas market in Magdeburg, Germany, killing five people, Italian authorities last week sent a circular to police stations around the country recommending 'maximum' investigative efforts and to immediately boost surveillance and police patrols around Christmas markets and displays and tourist attractions. The Vatican, with its life-sized creche and giant Christmas tree in St. Peter's Square and outdoor exhibit of nativity scenes in the Bernini colonnade ringing it, qualifies as an at-risk target. How else is Rome preparing? Rome has had two years of intense preparations for the Holy Year that involved major public works projects and artistic renovations that have coincided with separate initiatives paid for by the European Union's COVID-19 recovery funds. Fewer than a third of the 323 Jubilee projects have been finished or will wrap up by next month, meaning traffic headaches and eyesores will continue well into 2025 and even 2026. But Romans and visitors are beginning to see some of the finished products. Bernini's fountains in Piazza Navona are glistening white again after a monthslong cleaning. A spiffed-up Trevi Fountain reopened over the weekend, and on Monday the main Jubilee project was unveiled: A pedestrian piazza linking Castel St. Angelo to the Via della Conciliazione, the main boulevard leading to St. Peter's Square.	https://www.voanews.com/a/holy-year-about-to-start-in-rome/7911812.html	2024-12-23T16:11:05-08:00

VOA Turkish: Relatives of prisoners in Lebanon detained over Syria demand their release	Relatives of people who were arrested for various reasons, such as supporting armed groups in Syria and planning bomb attacks in Lebanon for this purpose, protested in downtown Beirut on Sunday. The Islamic Group, a Lebanese Sunni Muslim political party, organized the demonstration. The protesters claimed that their family members were arrested and unfairly accused because they were Sunni. They also protested the conditions in Lebanese prisons and alleged that the arrests were taken under pressure from Hezbollah and Iran. The families asked for the release of their imprisoned relatives, considering the recent developments in neighboring Syria.

MSF: South Sudan 'overwhelmed' by refugee influx and cholera outbreaks	Nairobi, Kenya — South Sudan is facing a 'completely overwhelming' influx of refugees from war-torn Sudan as well as a rapidly growing cholera epidemic, Doctors Without Borders (MSF) warned Monday. The medical charity said up to 5,000 people were crossing the border every day. The United Nations recently put the figure even higher at 7,000 to 10,000 a day. Sudan is suffering one of the world's worst humanitarian emergencies since conflict broke out between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces in April 2023, with tens of thousands killed and millions displaced. An MSF emergency coordinator in Renk town, near a transit center holding some 17,000 people, according to the U.N., said they were working with the International Committee of the Red Cross to provide care. 'But the situation is completely overwhelming, and it's not enough,' said Emanuele Montobbio. Facilities are expanding, but 'over 100 wounded patients, many with serious injuries, still await surgery,' he said. Alhida Hammed fled to Renk after his village was attacked, and he was shot in Sudan's Blue Nile state. 'The houses were blazing, and everyone was running in different directions,' he said. He now has no shelter and is living under a tree but does not want to return to Sudan. 'Home is no longer a home. It is filled with bad memories,' he said. 'Death's door' South Sudan is ill-equipped to handle the arrival of thousands seeking shelter from war, with the young country itself battling violence, endemic poverty and natural disasters. Huge numbers of its own citizens are living in camps for internally displaced people, and many now face an 'alarming and rapid increase' in cholera cases, MSF said. It said 92 people had died following an outbreak in Unity state, and that it had treated over 1,210 people in just four weeks in Bentiu city. In sprawling camps near the capital, Juba, home to tens of thousands, MSF said it had treated some 1,700 suspected cases, with 25 deaths reported by the community. 'What we are witnessing is not just a cholera outbreak — it is the result of systemic neglect,' said MSF's South Sudan head of mission Mamman Mustapha. He described 'mountains of uncollected waste,' broken latrines and raw sewage in the camps, leaving behind a legacy of contaminated drinking water and infected inhabitants at 'death's door.' Without immediate action, Mustapha said, 'we expect cholera cases to skyrocket in the coming days and weeks.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/msf-south-sudan-overwhelmed-by-refugee-influx-and-cholera-outbreaks/7911800.html	2024-12-23T15:42:28-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: 2024 was 'roller coaster' year for China's stock market	China's stock market has experienced a tumultuous year. As 2024 draws to a close, the Chinese government has rolled out a series of fiscal incentives, including implementing a moderately loose monetary policy. Analysts believe these measures indicate significant downward pressure on the Chinese economy. Analysts say that while the stock market may see a 'slow bull' trend due to ongoing interest rate cuts, in the long term there are still no clear signs of substantial recovery for China's overall economy.

Going home? Syrians in Europe are not so sure	Orleans, France — Nabil Attar sprinkles sesame and pomegranate over creamy mutabal, a roasted eggplant dip from his native Syria — one of his mother's many recipes now featured at his restaurant, Narenj. A plate of stuffed grape leaves sits nearby, ready for the swelling lunchtime crowd. The tiny kitchen where he works seems an unlikely place for Attar, once a successful Damascus businessman specializing in electronic fund transfers. That was before Bashar al-Assad's regime kidnapped one of his sons, nearly a decade ago. 'It was so complicated,' recalled Attar, describing extortive practices wielded by the state to fill its coffers. 'I paid a lot of money to get my son back.' In 2015, Attar and his family joined the hundreds of thousands of Syrians fleeing their war-torn country for Europe. He settled in the Loire Valley city of Orleans, an hour's train ride from Paris and best known for its historical ties to France's patron saint Joan of Arc. Then came news earlier in December that the Assad era was over. 'I never imagined in my lifetime it could happen,' Attar said, scrolling through videos of himself and fellow Syrians in Orleans, rejoicing in the dictator's downfall. 'Now Syria is free.' For a growing number of European Union countries, Assad's ouster is triggering more than celebrations. Amid growing anti-immigration sentiment across the region, several have suspended Syrian asylum claims on grounds that the reasons that triggered them no longer exist. That's the case of Germany, which took in nearly a million Syrian asylum-seekers at the peak of the refugee influx, in 2015-16. While Chancellor Olaf Scholz says those 'integrated' were welcome, one opposition Christian Democratic Union lawmaker suggested paying Syrians roughly $1,040 apiece to go home — a position already adopted by neighboring Austria. Hardening attitudes are also evident in France, despite its having only about 30,000 Syrian refugees. A CSA poll this month found 70% of French supported suspending new asylum claims. French authorities say they are studying the matter. 'Since we hear that Syrian refugees are rejoicing in the fall of dictator Assad, let's engage in sending them home,' Jordan Bardella, president of France's far-right National Rally, told a cheering crowd recently. 'And let's hope Europe shuts the door after they leave.' For Syria's diaspora in Europe and rights advocates, the vanishing welcome mat is triggering alarm. In interviews across the region, many refugees say they fear returning. 'The situation in Syria is extremely volatile, extremely unpredictable,' said Olivia Sundberg Diez, the European Union migration and asylum advocate for Amnesty International. 'What is most important should be the safety of Syrian refugees and people that are seeking protection — this has to be prioritized over political interests.' 'Rushing the return of millions of Syrians would put even more pressure on Syria at an extremely fragile moment and would undermine the prospect of a successful transition,' warned Will Todman, deputy director and a senior fellow in the Middle East Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, a Washington-based research group, in a commentary. The debate is echoed among the Syrian community around Orleans. 'I'm worried about the country, I'm worried about the future,' said Ramez Ghadri, a Syrian gynecologist who settled in France decades ago. Of Syria's new leaders, he added, 'they're extremists.' Ehad Naily, a Syrian rights lawyer living outside the city, is also concerned. Like Attar, he arrived in France in 2015 and set up a local association to support fellow refugees. 'You can't say 'the regime is destroyed, you can now live in Syria,'' Naily said, describing shattered infrastructure and towns, and a tangle of religious and ethnic tensions simmering in his homeland. After nearly a decade living in France, his 15-year-old daughter does not speak Arabic. 'You can't force people to leave host countries if there's no stability there,' he said. Attar is more optimistic about Syria's near future. 'I believe that Syria will be better — much, much better than before,' he said. Like other Syrians here, he described Orleans residents as welcoming the newcomers. His older son, who was kidnapped, is now a pilot. His youngest is still in school. 'We never had any problem' in France, Attar said. After receiving asylum, he learned how to run a restaurant. In 2018, he and his wife opened Narenj, which means 'bitter orange' in Arabic. 'He's well-known here. He's got lots of loyal customers,' said Sophie Martinet, Attar's former French teacher who has now become a friend. 'He's undeniably talented. And people like Nabil.' Throughout the years, however, Assad's secret service kept tabs on him, Attar said, demanding money to leave him alone. 'This regime, they keep tracking everyone,' he said. 'It was a business, a network. It was organized crime.' Now a French citizen, Attar doesn't have worry about being sent back to Syria. But he believes other refugees here with legitimate reasons to stay in France have nothing to fear. 'People who are working, who are doing their best, who are well integrated in society — they will not be affected by what's happening in Syria,' he said. Attar himself is eager to return to a post-Assad Syria. 'I would like to go back, visit my family, my friends,' he said. 'See the streets where I worked, where I lived.' But not for good. Today, Attar said, his life and future are in France.	https://www.voanews.com/a/going-home-syrians-in-europe-are-not-so-sure/7911777.html	2024-12-23T15:32:59-08:00	
Over 200 killed in Haiti's Cite Soleil massacre, UN report finds	At least 207 people were killed by members of the Wharf Jeremie gang in Haiti's portside neighborhood of Cite Soleil earlier this month, the United Nations said in a report on Monday, revising a death toll it initially estimated at 187. In a new report on the massacre, the U.N. Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights said at least 134 men and 73 women, most of them elderly residents accused of witchcraft, were killed in less than a week of mass executions, abductions and raids by some 300 members of the Wharf Jeremie gang. Gang leader Monel 'Mikano' Felix ordered the attacks after his child got sick, accusing local residents of causing the illness through Vodou. Many of the victims were abducted from Vodou temples and religious ceremonies, the U.N. said. The killings shocked the Caribbean nation, which has been engulfed in a worsening gang conflict, compounding devastating food shortages, while its neighbors lag on delivering long-promised security assistance. Felix's gang has controlled a small but strategic area between key ports, surrounding warehouses and national highways out of the capital for some 15 years, according to the U.N. After the killings, gang members attempted to erase evidence by confiscating mobile phones, burning bodies and dumping them into the sea. Over 5,300 people have been killed in Haiti since January and more than 12,000 since the start of 2022, according to the U.N., while over 700,000 have been internally displaced.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-200-killed-in-haiti-s-cite-soleil-massacre-un-report-finds/7911790.html	2024-12-23T15:22:12-08:00

'He remains in good spirits and deeply appreciates the excellent care he is receiving,' Urena said. Clinton, a Democrat who served two terms as president from January 1993 until January 2001, addressed the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this summer and campaigned ahead of November's election for the unsuccessful White House bid of Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bill-clinton-hospitalized-with-fever-but-in-good-spirits-spokesperson-says-/7911781.html	2024-12-23T15:02:54-08:00	
FAA probes holiday drone show accident that injured boy in Florida	ORLANDO — The Federal Aviation Administration said Monday it has launched an investigation into why several drones collided and fell from the sky during a holiday show over the weekend in downtown Orlando, Florida, injuring a 7-year-old boy who required surgery. The drones fell into a crowd of thousands of people watching the show Saturday night at the city's Lake Eola Park. The show was permitted through the FAA. 'Our thoughts are with the family and all those impacted by the outcome of this event,' the city of Orlando said in a statement. 'The city remains in contact with the vendor and FAA who will conduct a thorough investigation.' Adriana Edgerton told Orlando television station WESH that her son, Alexander, required surgery after being hit in the chest with a drone. 'The blade cut his mouth, but there's an actual imprint of the drone on his chest,' she said. Sky Elements Drone Shows, the Fort Worth, Texas, vendor that put on the show, didn't immediately respond to an emailed inquiry on Monday. On the company's website, it said, 'Every step of the way, we put accuracy, execution, and compliance first.' Drone shows typically require a waiver to operate more than one drone at a time, and the FAA reviews each drone show application to make sure 'the flying public and people on the ground will be safe,' the agency said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/faa-probes-holiday-drone-show-accident-that-injured-boy-in-florida-/7911775.html	2024-12-23T14:56:18-08:00	
Botswana issues 400 elephant hunting licenses, drawing fresh opposition	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Botswana has issued 400 elephant hunting licenses amid fresh opposition from conservationists. International hunters pay up to $50,000 to obtain a license in order to hunt an elephant. In a recent notice from the Wildlife and National Parks department, the elephants are among other wildlife species that will be offered to hunters. Botswana’s hunting season runs from April to November, attracting enthusiasts from abroad. However, a group of local and international conservationists has petitioned Botswana’s new government, which came into power after the Oct. 30 general election, to stop the practice of trophy hunting. Oaitse Nawa of the nonprofit Elephant Protection Society is part of those petitioning the government against hunting the big game. He said the organization is surprised the government has released the hunting quota for the new season. 'We did a petition — the idea was to ask the government to take time, to stop the elephant quota in the meantime because there was not enough consultation regarding all the stakeholders,' Nawa said. 'For this quota to come out, it was a big surprise to us.' The government held a consultative meeting at the beginning of December to decide on the number of animals to put up for the shoot. Nawa said the group wants the new government to intervene and stop the hunts. 'It is a very big concern looking at the fact that hunting does not benefit the community,' he said. 'Anything that has to do with hunting has to be reviewed. Remember, we are still dealing with the old regime and we are not surprised to see them come up with these numbers.' The government said nearly $3 million was raised by communities in the previous hunting season, mainly from the sale of elephant licenses. Conservationists opposed to the hunts argue the targeting of male elephants disturbs the animals’ breeding patterns. The chief executive of the Botswana Wildlife Producers Association, Isaac Theophilus, backs hunting. 'The petition to government is unfortunate and misguided,' he said. 'Trophy hunting does not target prime breeding bulls. It is highly selective. It targets animals that are past their breeding prime. So it [hunting] will nowhere affect the breeding patterns.' Wildlife management expert biologist Dr. Erik Verreynne said hunting will not disturb elephant populations in Botswana. 'It is possible that hunting activity in an area can affect the movements of a breeding herd,' he said, 'but if we see it within the larger context of 400 bulls being hunted in a population of 130,000 to 140,000 elephants in Botswana, then it’s highly unlikely that we are going to see an impact on the breeding rate or population growth of elephants.' Botswana has the world’s largest elephant herd at more than 130,000. The country resumed trophy hunting activities in 2019 following a five-year moratorium. Botswana also has one of the world’s highest incidences of human-wildlife conflict, with the animals moving closer to human settlements in search of water and forage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-issues-400-elephant-hunting-licenses-drawing-fresh-opposition-/7911746.html	2024-12-23T14:14:16-08:00	
Canada records 50,000 opioid overdose deaths since 2016	OTTAWA, CANADA — Nearly 50,000 people in Canada died of an apparent opioid overdose from January 2016 to June 2024, with fentanyl playing an increasingly prominent role in fatalities, the national health agency said Monday. The prevalence of fentanyl in Canada has drawn additional attention after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump cited the drug as part of his justification to impose sweeping tariffs on Canadian imports. Trump has accused Ottawa of not doing enough to stem the flow of fentanyl into the United States and said his promised 25% tariff would remain in place until Canadian authorities address the problem. Health Canada on Monday reported a total of 49,105 'apparent opioid toxicity deaths' from the start of 2016 to June of this year. Fentanyl was involved in 79% of opioid deaths so far this year, a figure that has increased by 39% since 2016, the agency said. Canadian authorities have acknowledged a significant spike in domestic fentanyl production. The seizure of Canadian-made fentanyl in the United States, Australia and elsewhere indicates that domestic production exceeds demand, and Canada has become a net fentanyl exporter, the Foreign Ministry has said. But experts do not believe Canadian-sourced fentanyl is a major player in the United States. Health Canada said that so far this year, an average of 21 people have died each day from an apparent opioid overdose, 72% of whom were males. Those figures marked an improvement compared to the same period in 2023, Health Canada said, but noted the figures are preliminary and subject to change. 'We must remain cautious in drawing conclusions on the trends for 2024,' he said in a statement. 'The extent of opioid and stimulant-related harms remains very high.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-records-50-000-opioid-overdose-deaths-since-2016/7911744.html	2024-12-23T14:01:09-08:00

Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City celebrates its first-ever metro line	HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM — Thousands of selfie-taking Ho Chi Minh City residents crammed into train carriages Sunday as the traffic-clogged business hub celebrated the opening of its first-ever metro line after years of delays. Huge queues spilled out of every station along the $1.7 billion line that runs almost 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the city center — with women in traditional 'ao dai' dress, soldiers in uniform and couples clutching young children waiting excitedly to board. 'I know it (the project) is late, but I still feel so very honored and proud to be among the first on this metro,' said office worker Nguyen Nhu Huyen after snatching a selfie in her jam-packed train car. 'Our city is now on par with the other big cities of the world,' she said. It took 17 years for Vietnam's commercial capital to reach this point. The project, funded largely by Japanese government loans, was first approved in 2007 and slated to cost $668 million. When construction began in 2012, authorities promised the line would be up and running in five years. But as delays mounted, cars and motorbikes multiplied in the city of 9 million people, making the metropolis hugely congested, increasingly polluted and time-consuming to navigate. The metro 'meets the growing travel needs of residents and contributes to reducing traffic congestion and environmental pollution,' said the city's deputy mayor, Bui Xuan Cuong. Cuong admitted authorities had to overcome 'countless hurdles' to get the project over the line. According to state media reports, the metro was late because of 'slow capital disbursement, unexpected technical problems, personnel difficulties and the Covid-19 pandemic.' 'The delays and cost overruns have been frustrating,' professor Vu Minh Hoang said at Fulbright University Vietnam, who warned that with just 14 station stops, the line's 'impact in alleviating traffic will be limited in the short run.' However, it is still a 'historic achievement for the city's urban development,' he added. With lessons learned, 'the construction of future lines will be increasingly easier, faster and more cost-efficient,' Hoang told AFP. Back on the train, 84-year-old war veteran Vu Thanh told AFP he was happy to experience below ground in a more positive way after spending three years fighting American troops in the city's famous Cu Chi tunnels, an enormous underground network. 'It feels so different from the underground experience I had years ago during the war. It's so bright and nice here,' he said. Reflecting on the delays, he added: 'We built the tunnels to hide from our enemies in the past, so building a tunnel for a train should not be that hard,' he added. 'Finally, we made it!'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-s-ho-chi-minh-city-celebrates-its-first-ever-metro-line-/7911715.html	2024-12-23T13:25:36-08:00	
US ship departs Cambodia after first port visit in nearly a decade	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — The USS Savannah departed from Cambodia last Friday, after the first port visit by the U.S. Navy to the Southeast Asian nation in eight years. Despite being a close partner of China, analysts say the stop in Cambodia’s port city of Sihanoukville shows that the country is looking to improve its relations with the United States. The Savannah arrived in Sihanoukville last Monday and docked there about 30 kilometers from the Chinese-funded Ream Naval Base, which has drawn concern from U.S. analysts as a potential permanent base for Chinese forces. Cambodia’s Ministry of National Defense says the U.S. warship’s five-day visit was aimed at 'strengthening and expanding friendship' and 'promoting bilateral cooperation.' In June 2024, U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin met with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Manet and Minister of National Defense Tea Seiha, with the two sides agreeing to strengthen their bilateral defense relationship. Recent anti-democratic reforms, human rights violations and an increasing Chinese presence within Cambodia have strained relations. The Ream Naval Base is a particular sore spot for the two nations, with the U.S. imposing sanctions in 2021 on two senior Cambodian military officials accused of profiting from the Chinese-built base. However, last week’s port call and official promises suggest that Cambodia wishes to push back against its reputation as a client state of Beijing, analysts say. 'I think that Cambodians are trying to show that — look, we’re not taking the side of the Chinese or the Americans,' said Abdul Rahman Yaacob, a researcher at the Lowy Institute in Australia. Yaacob said that Cambodia is using the return of a U.S. defense presence to its shores to demonstrate its adherence to self-proclaimed principles of nonalignment to the broader Asian region. Sam Seun, a policy analyst at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told VOA that the international community too often focuses on Cambodia’s relationship with China, and that this port call proves Cambodia can have good relationships with the United States and other countries too. He said China’s presence in Cambodia’s defense infrastructure is normal for a small country looking to 'strengthen its military capabilities.' One port call, though, might not be enough to quell U.S. fears about Chinese military influence in Cambodia and mend the U.S.-Cambodian relationship. Although he viewed it as a 'good start,' the warship docking in Cambodia 'will not lead to a full restoration of relations between Cambodia and the United States. The United States will still accuse Cambodia of allowing China to establish a military base in its territory,' Seun said. China's two Type 056A frigates, the Aba and the Tianmen, had been stationed at Ream Naval Base for nearly 12 months by the time the Savannah arrived in Cambodia. Cambodian officials earlier stated that the ships were there for training engagements with the Cambodian navy. The base’s location holds strategic significance to China, given its proximity to potential conflict arenas and vital shipping routes in the South China Sea, said Sun Kim, assistant dean and lecturer at the Faculty of Social Sciences and International Relations at the Pannasastra University of Cambodia. Sun said the base is important to Chinese oil and gas transportation, as it allows for a greater ease of transport of fuel from Africa and the Middle East. Additionally, in the event of a conflict in the South China Sea or the Taiwan Strait, Ream Base could prove even more important, analysts say. 'If China needs to deploy its navy, Ream Naval Base may be used as one of the bases for deployment by China,' said Sun. However, according to Cambodian law, foreign forces are prohibited from being permanently stationed in the country and from conducting military operations out of Cambodian bases. Cambodia has denied that the Ream Naval Base is controlled by China. On Friday, Cambodia’s former Prime Minister Hun Sen said Japan would be granted visitation rights to Ream Naval Base, according to a post on his Facebook page. The announcement came during a visit to Cambodia by Japan national security adviser Akiba Takeo.

Azerbaijani journalist says he was jailed over his work	WASHINGTON — A journalist jailed in Azerbaijan for nearly seven months has said he believes his arrest is linked to his reporting. Farid Mehralizada, an economist and journalist with VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, has been jailed since May on charges including conspiring to smuggle foreign currency. The journalist, his employer and press freedom groups believe the case is retaliatory and part of a wider crackdown in Azerbaijan. In messages relayed to VOA through his wife, Mehralizada spoke about his passion for journalism and said he believed he was targeted for his work. 'I’ve always enjoyed working with statistical data and numbers. As a journalist and economist, it was my job to interpret them,' Mehralizada said. Mehralizada says he believes he is being detained in retaliation for his work, which is often critical of the government’s economic policy. 'I think my arrest highlighted how authoritarian governments, like Azerbaijan’s, fear the power of numbers and the reality they reveal through statistics,' Mehralizada said. Among the journalist’s criticisms was that the Azerbaijani government isn’t diversifying the economy’s reliance on oil and gas. Mehralizada is one of at least 14 journalists jailed in the past year for their work in Azerbaijan, according to the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. Several of them work at Abzas Media, one of the country’s most prominent anti-corruption investigative outlets. Mehralizada did not work with Abzas Media but he sometimes provided expert commentary to the outlet. Still, he is facing charges of 'conspiring to smuggle foreign currency' in connection to a case brought against Abzas Media. Mehralizada denies the charge. Mehralizada and Abzas Media have both said that he never worked for the outlet. Mehralizada is facing additional charges of 'illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion and document forgery.' He faces up to 12 years behind bars if convicted of all the charges against him. He denies the accusations. A trial against Mehralizada and six Abzas Media staffers began on Dec. 17 in Azerbaijan’s capital, Baku. Press freedom groups say the charges against the group of journalists are politically motivated. The trial 'epitomizes the way the Azerbaijani government has used retaliatory criminal charges to lock up vast swathes of the country’s leading independent journalists over the past year,' Gulnoza Said, CPJ’s Europe and Central Asia program coordinator, said in a statement. RFE/RL has condemned the trial and called for Mehralizada’s immediate release. 'Farid is being punished for reporting uncomfortable truths about Azerbaijan’s economy. Azerbaijan must end this sham trial and release Farid to his wife and newborn daughter,' RFE/RL President Stephen Capus said in a statement last week. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken also called for the release of Mehralizada and other journalists jailed in Azerbaijan. 'The United States is deeply concerned not only by these detentions, but by the increasing crackdown on civil society and media in Azerbaijan,' Blinken said in a statement earlier in December. Azerbaijan’s Washington embassy and foreign ministry did not reply to VOA’s emails requesting comment. When the trial began, Mehralizada’s wife, Nargiz Mukhtarova, said it was difficult to see her husband and the other defendants in handcuffs. 'But their courage was incredibly impressive,' she told VOA. 'They were smiling during [the] hearing.' In prison, Mukhtarova said, her husband spends his days reading books — nearly 200 of them since he was detained — and doing crossword puzzles. He is being treated well, but without internet access, he 'mostly suffers' from a lack of economic news, Mukhtarova added. Mukhtarova and her husband are permitted one weekly meeting, which she said they always look forward to. 'He is doing good,' she said. 'His mood is better now because at least they have a chance to talk publicly about their case.' The trial is set to resume on Dec. 28.	https://www.voanews.com/a/azerbaijani-journalist-says-he-was-jailed-over-his-work/7911687.html	2024-12-23T13:11:40-08:00	
Experts urge US to use Taiwan logistics pact to counter China's military coercion	WASHINGTON — A recently released U.S. government report details China's ongoing efforts to 'erode long-standing norms in and around Taiwan' through various pressure tactics, including increased military flights crossing the Taiwan Strait median line. While U.S. officials have expressed serious concerns, some military experts argue that Washington's response has been ineffective in curbing Chinese aggression. To deter further coercion, some former U.S. military officials propose leveraging the U.S.-Taiwan Acquisition and Cross-Servicing Agreement (ACSA) to allow American military jets to refuel there as a clear demonstration of resolve. The ACSA, a rarely discussed logistics agreement between the U.S. and Taiwan, allows the U.S. Department of Defense to exchange supplies, services, and logistical support with its partners and allies. In its 2024 report, Military and Security Developments Involving the People's Republic of China, released last week as mandated by Congress, the Pentagon highlights China's ongoing military buildup to secure national interests and assert territorial claims along its periphery. The report notes that the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) is increasingly focused on 'military contingencies in the Taiwan Strait while simultaneously delaying or denying third-party intervention.' The report also details the PLA's extensive joint land, air and sea exercises around Taiwan throughout 2023 to enhance combat readiness and operational coordination. It notes that more than 1,500 PLA aircraft entered Taiwan's Air Defense Identification Zone in both 2022 and 2023. Officials in Washington say U.S. defense engagement with Taiwan has evolved in response to China's growing capacity and willingness to use military coercion against Taiwan. But in Beijing, officials are warning against what they call 'foreign military intervention,' asserting that Taiwan is part of China's 'internal affairs.' 'China urges the U.S. to immediately stop arming Taiwan,' a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson stated on Monday, following President Joe Biden's recent authorization of up to $571 million in Defense Department materials, services, and military training for the self-ruled island. The spokesperson condemned the U.S. announcement of military aid, warning that Washington is 'playing with fire' and will get 'burned.' Founded in 1949, the Communist Party-led People's Republic of China has never governed Taiwan but claims sovereignty over the self-ruled democracy. It has never excluded the possibility of using force to bring the island under its control. The U.S. maintains a policy of strategic ambiguity, taking neither an official stance on Taiwan's sovereignty nor supporting its independence. A State Department spokesperson recently said that the U.S. remains concerned about 'elevated' PLA activity near Taiwan, describing it as consistent with levels observed during previous 'Joint Sword' military exercises. The statement followed PLA naval drills near Taiwan and along the First Island Chain earlier in December. Trey Meeks, a senior defense fellow at the Washington-based Center for a New American Security, told VOA that low-cost strategies that would boost Taiwan's morale and demonstrate U.S. resolve could help counter China's 'new normal' of constant and escalated military coercion. Meeks is among the military experts who said President-elect Donald Trump’s team is likely to be much more aggressive only if Taiwan agrees to significantly increase its defense budget. When Chinese military jets cross the median line, he suggested, a pair of U.S. fighter jets could later respond by leveraging the U.S.-Taiwan logistics agreement, the ACSA, by making a refueling stop in Taiwan. Another U.S. option, Meeks said, would be a visit by a U.S. Coast Guard vessel already operating in the region. This would signify a strategic response and signal that larger ships, potentially including U.S. naval vessels, might follow at U.S.-Taiwanese discretion. It wouldn’t be the first time. In June 2021, a U.S. military aircraft traveled to Taiwan to deliver COVID-19 vaccines, while in February 2023, South Korea's 'Black Eagles' aerobatic team made a refueling stop at Taiwan's southern Kaohsiung airport while en route to an air show in Australia. For Taiwan, other options include intercepting Chinese aircraft incursions using radar missile locks. 'The ride stops being fun for the Chinese fighter pilot when you lock him up with a surface-to-air missile,' said Meeks, who's also a former U.S. military official. Forty-five years ago, Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA), which became law on April 10, 1979. TRA policies would provide Taiwan with defensive weapons. U.S. special operations forces have been operating in Taiwan since 2012, and several hundred U.S. troops are currently known to be serving as a training team on the ground in Taiwan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/experts-urge-us-to-use-taiwan-logistics-pact-to-counter-china-s-military-coercion/7911644.html	2024-12-23T12:45:50-08:00	
France unveils new government with budget battle looming	PARIS — France unveiled a new government on Monday, composed of former ministers and senior civil servants that Prime Minister Francois Bayrou will hope can oversee the passage of a 2025 budget and avoid a collapse that would deepen the country's crisis. Eric Lombard, 66, the head of Caisse des Depots, the investment arm of the French government, became finance minister, working with Amelie de Montchalin as budget minister. Conservative Bruno Retailleau remained interior minister. Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot and Defense Minister Sebastien Lecornu also remained in post. Elisabeth Borne, who stepped down as prime minister in January, became education minister, while former interior minister Gerard Darmanin will lead the Justice Ministry. Bayrou has struggled for almost 10 days to put together a government as he looks to stave off potential no-confidence votes from the far right and left. He will need to begin work immediately on passing a 2025 budget bill after parliamentary pushback over the proposed legislation led to the toppling of his predecessor, former Prime Minister Michel Barnier. The names were read out by President Emmanuel Macron's chief of staff Alexis Kohler.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-unveils-new-government-with-budget-battle-looming/7911562.html	2024-12-23T11:47:22-08:00	
Women’s football on rise in Zambia	Lusaka — The international success of Zambian footballers Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji is inspiring girls and young women in Zambia to take up the sport. The success of the two stars and the Zambian national women’s team offers a beacon of hope for many girls in Zambia. Women's football has been on the rise in Zambia since 2016. The Zambia women’s national football program has three teams competing internationally and filling up stadiums with thousands of enthusiastic fans. The national women’s team, known as the Copper Queens, was the first landlocked country in Africa to qualify for a World Cup in 2023. The country also boasts of the two most highly paid female football players in the world, Barbra Banda and Racheal Kundananji, both native Zambians now playing for teams in the United States. Football’s governing body, FIFA, recently named Banda its 2024 Women’s Footballer of the Year. Lilian Mwenda is the youngest member of the team at 15 years old. Initially, she said, her parents encouraged her to focus on education, but now they are behind her football dreams. 'They are supporting me very much, especially that I am [on] the national team now where there are a lot of big players. It makes me feel very happy. Even my young siblings are looking up to me. My inspiration is Cristiano Ronaldo, but I also look up to Barbra Banda and Kundananji because they inspire me. They always work hard and reach high levels,' said Mwenda. The growth of women ‘s football in Zambia has led to the rise of grassroots talent development across the country. Oliver Shalala Sepiso is one of the mentors of female footballers in Zambia. He founded the Elite Ladies Football Club, which has produced female football players for the national team as well as the Olympics. 'Young girls in Zambia have it tougher than their male counterparts in the sense that the economy is not one of the best in the world. It's clear that Zambia is quite talented, especially in terms of speed, in terms of stature, so they are able to play football or soccer. So. I am one of those that feels I have the knack and talent and skill and time, as well, to dedicate into trying to develop these young girls,' he said. In an exclusive interview with VOA in Lusaka, Copper Queens captain Banda said she is happy to see young girls looking up to her as a role model. 'Women’s football in Zambia has grown so big. That young child who’s looking up to me, I would say they should keep on chasing their dreams,' she said. Zambian President Hakainde Hichilema has been a strong supporter of women’s football in the country. At a luncheon he hosted to honor the athletes in Lusaka on Friday, he reaffirmed his administration‘s support toward developing women's football. 'Let's not write off the young people. When we see them for the first time, we don’t like their faces. We write them off. No, let's give them a chance to prove themselves so they can be the next Barbras, Kundananjis,' he said. FIFA President Gianni Infantino reiterated the world body’s commitment to growing football in Zambia, especially women’s football, during his first visit to Zambia in June. Infantino said FIFA would invest in a training center and an academy to promote football talent and coaches in Zambia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/women-s-football-on-the-rise-in-zambia/7911391.html	2024-12-23T10:23:32-08:00	
Survivors and advocates reflect on lessons from the massive 2004 earthquake and tsunami	The magnitude 9 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami on Dec. 26, 2004, killed over 230,000 people in 15 countries. The Indonesian province of Aceh was especially hard hit. Twenty years on, VOA’s Ahadian Utama reports on the lessons learned from the historic disaster.

Kenya records 7,000 cases of violence against women since September 2023	NAIROBI — Kenya’s security report this year has been dominated by the violence and killings of women and girls, with more than 7,100 cases of gender-based violence since September 2023. Included in that number are 100 documented cases of murder against women since August 2024. Sarah Wambui said she was attacked one morning by her husband of 20 years. 'He attacked me on Jan. 18, 2024,' she said. 'He stabbed me all over — 38 stabs from my face, the entire body, even my internal organs, my kidney and liver, were affected. I have been in hospital. I was discharged in August.' Speaking last week, Foreign Affairs Minister and acting Interior Minister Musalia Mudavadi said the number of incidents of sexual and gender-based violence, or SGBV, against women worries security officers. 'Nairobi County recorded the highest number of SGBV cases, while Samburu and Mandera counties had the lowest incidents,' Mudavadi said. 'There were 100 murders of women from August to November 2024. So far, the Directorate of Criminal Investigation has completed the investigations on these, and the majority are pending before court.' Two weeks ago, hundreds of people took to the streets in Kenya, demanding an end to the killings of women. The protest was dispersed by police using tear gas and making arrests. The response by police angered demonstrators, human rights groups, and women’s organizations. They accused authorities of not taking the attacks and killings of women seriously. Wambui’s accused attacker is out of prison and has been threatening to kill her, she said. The mother of two has been moving from one place to another to avoid him. 'Right now, my life is in danger,' she said. 'The perpetrator is out, and he has vowed he will finish me, and the case will be discarded. So I am actually in hiding.' Human rights researchers say patriarchal views and a lack of protection are some of the reasons behind the attacks on women and girls. Njoki Gachanja, a human rights defender, said the number of abused women may be higher than reported. 'Most of those numbers come from low-income areas where there is a lot of poverty and that is linked to a lot of violence. So, these numbers may sound staggering for people who are on the ground documenting these cases on a daily basis,' Gachanja said. 'We know that there are more people who have not been covered by those who made the headlines, and this is a catastrophe that must be addressed by the government.' According to the Gender Violence Recovery Centre, one in three Kenyan women has experienced sexual violence before the age of 18, and 38% of married women have experienced physical violence. The government has set up a security team to address attacks on women and ensure justice for the victims.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-records-7-000-cases-of-violence-against-women-since-september-2023/7911373.html	2024-12-23T09:13:39-08:00	
Frozen India-China ties thawed in 2024	Ties between India and China witnessed a thaw in 2024, with both sides pulling back some troops from flashpoints along their border.

Analysts also believe the India-China rapprochement will not affect India’s strategic cooperation with the United States.

US House Ethics Committee expected to release long-anticipated Matt Gaetz report Monday	Washington — The U.S. House Ethics Committee is expected to release its long-awaited report Monday into former Representative Matt Gaetz, ending a yearslong investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct with minors and use of illicit drugs while the Florida Republican was in office. The anticipated release comes after at least one Republican joined all five Democrats on the panel earlier this month in a secret vote to release the report about their former colleague despite initial opposition from Republican lawmakers, including House Speaker Mike Johnson, to publishing findings about a former member of Congress. While ethics reports have previously been released after a member's resignation, it is extremely rare. Gaetz has repeatedly denied all wrongdoing, saying last week that he would have 'no opportunity to debate or rebut' the findings as a former member of the House. On Monday, Gaetz filed a lawsuit seeking to block the report's release, saying it contains 'untruthful and defamatory information' that would 'significantly damage' his 'standing and reputation in the community.' Gaetz's complaint argues he's no longer under the committee's jurisdiction since he resigned from Congress. 'The Committee's position that it may nonetheless publish potentially defamatory findings about a private citizen over whom it claims no jurisdiction represents an unprecedented expansion of Congressional power that threatens fundamental constitutional rights and established procedural protections,' Gaetz's lawyers wrote in their request for a temporary restraining order. The often secretive, bipartisan panel has investigated claims against Gaetz since 2021. However, its work became more urgent last month when President-elect Donald Trump picked Gaetz as his attorney general nominee. Gaetz resigned from Congress that same day, putting him outside the purview of the Ethics Committee's jurisdiction. But Democrats had pressed to make the report public even after Gaetz was no longer a member and had withdrawn as Trump's pick to lead the Justice Department. A vote on the House floor this month to force the report's release failed; all but one Republican voted against it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-ethics-committee-expected-to-release-long-anticipated-matt-gaetz-report-monday/7911195.html	2024-12-23T07:21:23-08:00	
Luigi Mangione pleads not guilty to state murder and other charges in United Healthcare CEO's death	New York — The man accused of fatally shooting the CEO of UnitedHealthcare pleaded not guilty on Monday to murder and terror charges in a state case that will run parallel to his federal prosecution. Luigi Mangione, 26, was shackled and seated in a Manhattan court when he leaned over to a microphone to enter his plea. The Manhattan district attorney formally charged him last week with multiple counts of murder, including murder as an act of terrorism. His initial appearance in New York's state's trial court was preempted by federal prosecutors bringing their own charges over the shooting. The federal charges could carry the possibility of the death penalty, while the maximum sentence for the state charges is life in prison without parole. Prosecutors have said the two cases will proceed on parallel tracks, with the state charges expected to go to trial first. Authorities say Mangione gunned down Brian Thompson as he was walking to an investor conference in midtown Manhattan on the morning of Dec 4. Mangione was arrested in a Pennsylvania McDonald's after a five-day search, carrying a gun that matched the one used in the shooting and a fake ID, police said. He also was carrying a notebook expressing hostility toward the health insurance industry and especially wealthy executives, according to federal prosecutors. At a news conference announcing the state charges last Tuesday, Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg said the application of the terrorism law reflected the severity of a 'frightening, well-planned, targeted murder that was intended to cause shock and attention and intimidation.' 'In its most basic terms, this was a killing that was intended to evoke terror,' he added. 'And we've seen that reaction.' Karen Friedman Agnifilo, an attorney for Mangione, has accused federal and state prosecutors of advancing conflicting legal theories. In federal court last week, she called their approach 'very confusing' and 'highly unusual.' Mangione is being held in a Brooklyn federal jail alongside several other high-profile defendants, including Sean 'Diddy' Combs and Sam Bankman-Fried. Mangione was extradited from Pennsylvania on Thursday and quickly rushed to New York City, where he was seen wearing an orange jumpsuit as he was led away from a helicopter by heavily armed police officers and New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Adams said he was hoping to send a message to the suspect: 'I wanted to look him in the eye and say you carried out this terroristic act in my city — the city that the people of New York love,' the mayor told a local TV station. 'I wanted to be there to show the symbolism of that.' An Ivy-league graduate from a prominent Maryland family, Mangione appeared to have cut himself off from family and friends in recent months. He posted frequently in online forums about his struggles with back pain. He was never a UnitedHealthcare client, according to the insurer. Thompson, a married father of two high-schoolers, had worked at the giant UnitedHealth Group for 20 years and became CEO of its insurance arm in 2021. The killing has prompted some to voice their resentment at U.S. health insurers, with Mangione serving as a stand-in for frustrations over coverage denials and hefty medical bills. It also has sent shockwaves through the corporate world, rattling executives who say they have received a spike in threats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/luigi-mangione-pleads-not-guilty-to-state-murder-and-other-charges-in-united-healthcare-ceo-s-death-/7911177.html	2024-12-23T07:05:47-08:00

Bangladesh seeks extradition of ousted leader Sheikh Hasina from India	DHAKA — Bangladesh has sent a formal request to India to extradite ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who fled to New Delhi in August amid the student-led protests that ended her 15 years in power, the country's foreign affairs adviser said Monday. Md Touhid Hossain told reporters at his office in Dhaka that the country has sent a diplomatic note to India's Foreign Ministry for Hasina's extradition. 'We have informed India about our request to bring her back for the judicial process,' Hossain said. He didn't give further details. India's Foreign Ministry said it had received Bangladesh's request, but didn't immediately provide further details. Hasina fled to India after being ousted in a mass uprising in July and August in which hundreds of protesters were killed and thousands were injured. She faces many court cases over the deaths, including some on charges of crimes against humanity. The Dhaka-based International Crimes Tribunal has already issued arrest warrants for Hasina and her close aides, and the government has sought help from the international police organization Interpol for her arrest. Last month, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the country's interim leader, said that his administration would seek the extradition of Hasina from India. The Yunus-led interim government has promised to try Hasina and others in her administration for alleged crimes involving the uprising against her and has invited the United Nations to help investigate the killings. Hasina also called for investigation as she questioned the killings, saying many deaths may have involved others beyond security agencies. Authorities say that more than 750 people were killed and thousands more hurt during the mass uprising.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bangladesh-seeks-extradition-of-ousted-leader-sheikh-hasina-from-india-/7911141.html	2024-12-23T06:28:03-08:00	
India-China frozen ties witness thaw in 2024	New Delhi — After a four-and-a-half-year military standoff along their disputed Himalayan border, ties between India and China witnessed a thaw in 2024 with both sides withdrawing troops from two flashpoints. But analysts say mistrust remains a key hurdle to restoration of friendly ties between the Asian giants. Indian foreign minister, Subrahmanyan Jaishankar, told parliament this month that the pullback has set New Delhi-Beijing ties 'in the direction of some improvement.' But he stressed the need to restore stability on the frontier. 'We are clear that the maintenance of peace and tranquility in border areas is a pre-requisite for the development of our ties.' While troops have stepped back from face-to-face confrontation along disputed stretches, tens of thousands of soldiers are still spending a fifth winter in the Himalayas while artillery and fighter jets remain deployed along the border. 'The mood on the border for four years has been one of preparing for war, therefore turning them into peacetime deployments is going to be an operational, mental, psychological and structural activity, which is, again, going to take a certain amount of time,' said Swaran Singh, professor at the School of International Studies at New Delhi’s Jawaharlal Nehru University. Large stretches of the poorly defined 3,488-kilometer-long frontier between the two countries are disputed. Tensions had spiraled after a 2020 border skirmish that killed 20 Indian and four Chinese soldiers. A high-level diplomatic dialogue to discuss the boundary dispute resumed last week after five years. Following a meeting between Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi and Indian National Security Adviser Wang Yi in Beijing, both sides reaffirmed their commitment to seek solutions that were 'fair, reasonable and acceptable to both sides,' according to a Chinese foreign ministry statement. The two countries also decided to resume trips by Indian pilgrims to Tibet and restart border trade at a mountain pass. The ground for the thaw was laid by a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the BRICS summit in Russia in October. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Li Jian told reporters at a press briefing last week that Beijing is ready to work with India to enhance mutual trust and manage their differences. Analysts in New Delhi say India will be cautious moving ahead. 'Border-related issues is something that India wants to address first, and then expand into an overall larger normalization of relationship with China,' Singh said. Economic cooperation, however, is expected to move faster. China wants to tap into India’s growing market while New Delhi needs more Chinese imports as it seeks to become a manufacturing hub. Although bilateral trade has flourished despite the border crisis, India had put restrictions on Chinese investments and clamped down on issuing visas in the aftermath of the 2020 clash. 'While no one should expect a dramatic shift in political ties, economic ties will perhaps evolve in a much more accelerated manner and perhaps India would be much more liberal in opening up its markets or opening up certain sectors,' according to Harsh Pant, vice president for studies at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. Chinese foreign minister Wang asked his Indian counterpart to restore direct flights between the two countries that were suspended during the pandemic and facilitate visas for Chinese nationals at a meeting on the sidelines of the Group of 20 countries in Rio De Janeiro. 'China’s and India’s common interests far outweigh their differences. The two sides should see each other’s development as an opportunity,' Wang told Jaishankar. Analysts say the thaw between India and China – Asia’s two biggest countries -- will not impact the trajectory of New Delhi’s ties with Washington, which have gathered momentum in recent years partly over mutual concerns about Beijing’s assertiveness. Besides its Himalayan border, New Delhi is also concerned about China’s growing presence in the Indian Ocean – Beijing has built ports in Sri Lanka, Pakistan and is constructing one in Myanmar. 'Both India and the U.S. want a certain kind of Indo-Pacific, a certain kind of geography, strategic geography, which is free, balanced, open and fair, which is also inclusive and, in some ways, those ideas will continue to propel the relationship,' Pant said. The countries are cooperating in areas ranging from defense to high technology. The U.S. is also India’s largest trading partner. New Delhi’s ties with Washington have witnessed some stresses. India, for instance, did not join U.S. sanctions imposed on Russia and has continued to import large quantities of crude oil from Moscow. Speaking recently at the launch of a foreign policy magazine, ‘India’s World,’ in New Delhi, Jaishankar said that ties between India and the U.S. will continue to deepen even if both sides do not see eye to eye on every issue. 'We have very honest conversations on where we agree and where we do not,' Jaishanker said. Calling their relationship 'important and large,' Jaishankar said, 'we factor these conversations but keep advancing that [overall] relationship.' Analysts say India will stay aligned with the United States and other Western countries in forums like the Quad. 'It is a win-win for both sides. China is a structural challenge for both India and the U.S. So irrespective of the fact whether there is a crisis or not, India and U.S. will continue to deepen their relationship,' said Sankalp Gurjar, assistant professor of geopolitics at the Gokhale Institute of Politics and Economics.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-china-frozen-ties-witness-thaw-in-2024-/7911037.html	2024-12-23T05:05:58-08:00	
Biden gives life in prison to 37 of 40 federal death row inmates so Trump can't have them executed	Washington — President Joe Biden announced on Monday that he is commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment, takes office. The move spares the lives of people convicted in killings, including the slayings of police and military officers, people on federal land and those involved in deadly bank robberies or drug deals, as well as the killings of guards or prisoners in federal facilities. It means just three federal inmates are still facing execution. They are Dylann Roof, who carried out the 2015 racist slayings of nine Black members of Mother Emanuel AME Church in Charleston, South Carolina; 2013 Boston Marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev; and Robert Bowers, who fatally shot 11 congregants at Pittsburgh's Tree of life Synagogue in 2018, the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S history. 'I've dedicated my career to reducing violent crime and ensuring a fair and effective justice system,' Biden said in a statement. 'Today, I am commuting the sentences of 37 of the 40 individuals on federal death row to life sentences without the possibility of parole. These commutations are consistent with the moratorium my administration has imposed on federal executions, in cases other than terrorism and hate-motivated mass murder.' The Biden administration in 2021 announced a moratorium on federal capital punishment to study the protocols used, which suspended executions during Biden's term. But Biden actually had promised to go further on the issue in the past, pledging to end federal executions without the caveats for terrorism and hate-motivated, mass killings. While running for president in 2020, Biden's campaign website said he would 'work to pass legislation to eliminate the death penalty at the federal level, and incentivize states to follow the federal government's example.' Similar language didn't appear on Biden's reelection website before he left the presidential race in July. 'Make no mistake: I condemn these murderers, grieve for the victims of their despicable acts, and ache for all the families who have suffered unimaginable and irreparable loss,' Biden's statement said. 'But guided by my conscience and my experience as a public defender, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, vice president, and now president, I am more convinced than ever that we must stop the use of the death penalty at the federal level.' He took a political jab at Trump, saying, 'In good conscience, I cannot stand back and let a new administration resume executions that I halted.' Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has spoken frequently of expanding executions. In a speech announcing his 2024 campaign, Trump called for those 'caught selling drugs to receive the death penalty for their heinous acts.' He later promised to execute drug and human smugglers and even praised China's harsher treatment of drug peddlers. During his first term as president, Trump also advocated for the death penalty for drug dealers. There were 13 federal executions during Trump's first term, more than under any president in modern history, and some may have happened fast enough to have contributed to the spread of the coronavirus at the federal death row facility in Indiana. Those were the first federal executions since 2003. The final three occurred after Election Day in November 2020 but before Trump left office the following January, the first time federal prisoners were put to death by a lame-duck president since Grover Cleveland in 1889. Biden faced recent pressure from advocacy groups urging him to act to make it more difficult for Trump to increase the use of capital punishment for federal inmates. The president's announcement also comes less than two weeks after he commuted the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic, and of 39 others convicted of nonviolent crimes, the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. The announcement also followed the post-election pardon that Biden granted his son Hunter on federal gun and tax charges after long saying he would not issue one, sparking an uproar in Washington. The pardon also raised questions about whether he would issue sweeping preemptive pardons for administration officials and other allies who the White House worries could be unjustly targeted by Trump's second administration. Speculation that Biden could commute federal death sentences intensified last week after the White House announced he plans to visit Italy on the final foreign trip of his presidency next month. Biden, a practicing Catholic, will meet with Pope Francis, who recently called for prayers for U.S. death row inmates in hopes their sentences will be commuted. Martin Luther King III, who publicly urged Biden to change the death sentences, said in a statement issued by the White House that the president 'has done what no president before him was willing to do: take meaningful and lasting action not just to acknowledge the death penalty's racist roots but also to remedy its persistent unfairness.' Donnie Oliverio, a retired Ohio police officer whose partner was killed by one of the men whose death sentence was converted, said the execution of 'the person who killed my police partner and best friend would have brought me no peace.' 'The president has done what is right here,' Oliverio said in a statement also issued by the White House, 'and what is consistent with the faith he and I share.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-gives-life-in-prison-to-37-of-40-federal-death-row-inmates-so-trump-can-t-have-them-executed-/7911024.html	2024-12-23T04:35:20-08:00	
Germany looking into possible security lapses after Christmas market attack	Berlin — Germany searched for answers on Monday on possible security lapses after a man drove his car into a Christmas market, killing at least five people and casting a renewed spotlight on security and immigration ahead of a snap election. The possible motive of the arrested suspect, a 50-year-old psychiatrist from Saudi Arabia with a history of anti-Islamic rhetoric and a sympathy for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party, remains unknown. As a nation mourned, with citizens leaving flowers and lighting candles in Magdeburg where the incident took place on Friday, questions swirled about whether more could have been done and whether the authorities could have acted on warnings. Federal Interior Minister Nancy Faeser called for tougher internal security laws to be adopted, including a new act to strengthen police forces as well as the introduction of biometric surveillance. 'It is clear that we must do everything to protect the people of Germany from such horrific acts of violence. To do this, our security authorities need all the necessary powers and more personnel,' Faeser told Spiegel newsmagazine. The deputy head of a security committee in the Bundestag (parliament) announced he would convene a special session asking why previous warnings about the danger posed by the suspect, identified only as Taleb A., were not acted on. The arrested man has lived in Germany since 2006. The main opposition Christian Democratic Union, which is on course to form the next government after an election in February, called for the strengthening of intelligence services. 'We can no longer be satisfied with the fact that information about violent criminals and terrorists often only comes from foreign services,' Guenter Krings, justice spokesperson for the CDU, told the Handelsblatt newspaper. 'That is why our German security authorities need more powers of their own in order to gain more of their own knowledge, especially in the digital area.' The security services also must be able to remove dangerous people from circulation based on such knowledge, he said. 'The authority and obligation for official cooperation and data exchange must also be improved,' he said. Germany's data protection rules are among the strictest in the European Union, which federal police say has prevented them from resorting to biometric surveillance to date. Police in the northwestern city of Bremerhaven said on Monday they had arrested a man who had threatened in a TikTok video to commit 'serious crimes' at the local Christmas market. In the video, the man said he would target people who looked Arab or Mediterranean on Christmas Day. AfD LEADERS IN MAGDEBURG A committee in the local parliament of Saxony-Anhalt, the state where Magdeburg is located, will also convene to discuss the possible causes of the attack and its consequences, a state interior ministry spokesperson said. Holger Muench, president of the federal criminal police office (BKA), told public broadcaster ZDF over the weekend that Germany was reviewing security measures at Christmas markets and addressing any vulnerabilities. Muench said Germany had received a warning from Saudi Arabia as far back as 2023 about the suspect, which German authorities investigated but found vague. 'The man also published a huge number of posts on the Internet. He also had various contacts with the authorities, made insults and even threats. But he was not known for acts of violence,' Muench said. Leaders of the AfD, which has surged in support on an anti-immigration platform and is polling in second place ahead of the election, plan to stage an event in Magdeburg on Monday evening. 'The discussion about new security laws must not distract from the fact that #Magdeburg would not have been possible without uncontrolled immigration,' AfD leader Alice Weidel said on social media. 'The state must protect citizens through a restrictive migration policy and consistent deportations!' Also on Monday evening, an initiative organized under the motto 'Don't give hate a chance' is calling for a human chain to be formed in Magdeburg.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-looking-into-possible-security-lapses-after-christmas-market-attack-/7911018.html	2024-12-23T04:24:26-08:00	
Lebanese prime minister visits south amid Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire	Lebanon’s caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati on Monday visited Lebanese troops positions and U.N. peacekeeper posts in southern Lebanon, touring the region from which Israeli troops and Hezbollah militants are supposed to withdraw under a nearly month-old ceasefire agreement. Mikati praised the role of the U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL) after meeting with UNIFIL commanders, and began his tour with a visit to a Lebanese army barracks. He highlighted the need for Israeli troops to withdraw from Lebanon, saying the Lebanese military would then be able to carry out its tasks. The ceasefire agreement calls for Lebanese troops to deploy in southern Lebanon as Israeli and Hezbollah forces leave. Israeli troops entered the country at the end of September as part of an offensive aimed at pushing Hezbollah back from the border. The incursion was part of a significant intensification of the conflict, which had included lower-level cross-border attacks since the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel. Since the ceasefire with Hezbollah, Israeli forces have focused on the war against Hamas in the Gaza Strip. Gaza medics said Monday that Israeli airstrikes killed at least 20 people overnight. U.N. humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher said Monday that Israel continues to strike densely populated areas in Gaza, 'including on areas where Israeli forces have ordered people to move, causing destruction, displacement and death.' Israeli officials have previously responded to similar assessments by blaming Hamas for operating in populated areas. Fletcher expressed concern about the ability to get aid into Gaza and into the hands of those in need, saying northern Gaza has been under 'a near-total siege for more than two months.' He said Israeli authorities have denied meaningful access to humanitarian workers, and that local gangs inside Gaza have engaged in 'systematic armed looting of our supplies.' 'We deal with tough places to deliver humanitarian support. But Gaza is currently the most dangerous, in a year when more humanitarians have been killed than any on record,' Fletcher said. Hamas militants killed 1,200 people in their October 2023 attack on southern Israel and took about 250 others hostage. There are still around 100 hostages still being held in Gaza, and at least one-third of them are believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,200 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror organizations by the United States, the United Kingdom and the European Union.

China says it provided information, documents in Baltic Sea cables inquiry	BEIJING — China has provided information and documents to a joint investigation into two severed Baltic Sea undersea cables, and has invited Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to participate in and complete the inquiry, the foreign ministry said on Monday. Foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning made the remarks at a news briefing when asked about a Financial Times report that Sweden had criticized China for refusing full access despite an open investigation, and for not allowing its public prosecutor to board the suspect ship, Yi Peng 3. The Chinese bulk carrier is moving again after sitting still for more than a month in Danish waters, the Swedish Coastguard said on Saturday. China last week allowed representatives from Germany, Sweden, Finland and Denmark to board the vessel for the investigation. 'In order to cooperate with the investigation, the Yi Peng 3 has been suspended for a long period of time, and in order to safeguard the physical and mental health of the crew, the shipowner company has decided to resume its voyage after a comprehensive assessment and consultation with the parties concerned,' Mao said. She added that China had notified all relevant countries in advance and was willing to maintain communication and cooperation. Yi Peng 3 came under investigation following the breach in November of two fiber-optic cables - one linking Finland and Germany and the other connecting Sweden to Lithuania - that raised suspicions of sabotage and concerns about the security of critical infrastructure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-it-provided-information-documents-in-baltic-sea-cables-inquiry-/7910927.html	2024-12-23T01:55:41-08:00	
South Korean opposition threatens to impeach Han over martial law counsel	SEOUL — South Korea's main opposition party threatened on Monday to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo if he failed to approve legislation to launch a special counsel investigation into President Yoon Suk Yeol's failed bid to impose martial law. Prime Minister Han has taken over from the suspended Yoon, who was impeached on Dec. 14 and faces a Constitutional Court review on whether to oust him. With a majority in parliament, the opposition Democratic Party (DP) passed a bill this month to appoint a special counsel to pursue charges of insurrection, among others, against the conservative Yoon and to investigate his wife over a luxury bag scandal and other allegations. The party, which has accused Han of aiding Yoon's martial law attempt and reported him to police, said it would 'immediately initiate impeachment proceedings' against the acting president if the legislation was not promulgated by Tuesday. 'The delays show that the prime minister has no intention of complying with the constitution, and it is tantamount to admitting that he is acting as a proxy for the insurgent,' Democratic Party floor leader Park Chan-dae told a party meeting, referring to Yoon. Han is a technocrat who has held leadership roles in South Korean politics for 30 years under conservative and liberal presidents. Yoon appointed him prime minister in 2022. Han's office could not immediately be reached for comment. He has previously said he had tried to block Yoon's martial law declaration, but apologized for failing to do so. Park also accused Yoon of hampering the Constitutional Court trial by repeatedly refusing to accept court documents, intended primarily to notify Yoon of the beginning of the trial. 'Any delay in the investigation and impeachment trials is an extension of the insurrection and an act of plotting a second one,' Park said. Yoon's ruling People Power Party accused the DP of employing what it called 'impeachment politics' and taking Han's political fate 'hostage' to push through the special counsel despite multiple ongoing investigations. A Constitutional Court spokesperson said on Monday it had decided to consider the presidential office's refusal to receive the documents as delivery completed, and proceed with the trial. A joint investigative team including police and the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials has made a second attempt to call Yoon in for questioning on Dec. 25, though it was unclear whether he would appear. Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer helping form Yoon's defense team, told reporters on Monday that he was not delaying the trial but needed time to prepare, and would respond to any investigations after a decision on the impeachment was made. Woo Jong-soo, investigation chief of the national police agency, told parliament on Monday that police had tried to raid Yoon's office twice but the presidential security service denied them entry. Woo said his team sent a request to preserve evidence, including a secure phone server.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-opposition-threatens-to-impeach-han-over-martial-law-counsel-/7910923.html	2024-12-23T01:39:20-08:00	
Nissan, Honda announce plans to merge, creating world's No. 3 automaker	TOKYO — Japanese automakers Honda and Nissan have announced plans to work toward a merger, forming world’s third-largest automaker by sales as the industry undergoes dramatic changes in its transition away from fossil fuels. The two companies said they had signed a memorandum of understanding on Monday and that smaller Nissan alliance member Mitsubishi Motors also had agreed to join the talks on integrating their businesses. Honda's president, Toshihiro Mibe, said Honda and Nissan will pursue unifying their operations under a joint holding company. Honda will initially lead the new management, retaining the principles and brands of each company. The aim is to have a formal merger agreement by June and to complete the deal by August 2026, he said. No dollar value was given and the formal talks are just starting, Mibe said. There are 'points that need to be studied and discussed,' he said. 'Frankly speaking, the possibility of this not being implemented is not zero.' Automakers in Japan have lagged behind their big rivals in electric vehicles and are trying to cut costs and make up for lost time. News of a possible merger surfaced earlier this month, with unconfirmed reports saying that the talks on closer collaboration partly were driven by aspirations of Taiwan iPhone maker Foxconn to tie up with Nissan, which has an alliance with Renault SA of France and Mitsubishi. A merger could result in a behemoth worth more than $50 billion based on the market capitalization of all three automakers. Together, Honda and the Nissan alliance with Renault SA of France and smaller automaker Mitsubishi Motors Corp. would gain scale to compete with Toyota Motor Corp. and with Germany’s Volkswagen AG. Toyota has technology partnerships with Japan’s Mazda Motor Corp. and Subaru Corp. Even after a merger Toyota, which rolled out 11.5 million vehicles in 2023, would remain the leading Japanese automaker. If they join, the three smaller companies would make about 8 million vehicles. In 2023, Honda made 4 million and Nissan produced 3.4 million. Mitsubishi Motors made just over 1 million. Nissan, Honda and Mitsubishi announced in August that they would share components for electric vehicles like batteries and jointly research software for autonomous driving to adapt better to dramatic changes centered around electrification, following a preliminary agreement between Nissan and Honda set in March. Honda, Japan's second-largest automaker, is widely viewed as the only likely Japanese partner able to effect a rescue of Nissan, which has struggled following a scandal that began with the arrest of its former chairman Carlos Ghosn in late 2018 on charges of fraud and misuse of company assets, allegations that he denies. He eventually was released on bail and fled to Lebanon. Speaking Monday to reporters in Tokyo via a video link, Ghosn derided the planned merger as a 'desperate move.' From Nissan, Honda could get truck-based body-on-frame large SUVs such as the Armada and Infiniti QX80 that Honda doesn’t have, with large towing capacities and good off-road performance, Sam Fiorani, vice president of AutoForecast Solutions, told The Associated Press. Nissan also has years of experience building batteries and electric vehicles, and gas-electric hybrid powertrains that could help Honda in developing its own EVs and next generation of hybrids, he said. But the company said in November that it was slashing 9,000 jobs, or about 6% of its global work force, and reducing its global production capacity by 20% after reporting a quarterly loss of $61 million. It recently reshuffled its management and Makoto Uchida, its chief executive, took a 50% pay cut to take responsibility for the financial woes, saying Nissan needed to become more efficient and respond better to market tastes, rising costs and other global changes. 'We anticipate that if this integration comes to fruition, we will be able to deliver even greater value to a wider customer base,' Uchida said. Fitch Ratings recently downgraded Nissan’s credit outlook to 'negative,' citing worsening profitability, partly due to price cuts in the North American market. But it noted that it has a strong financial structure and solid cash reserves that amounted to $9.4 billion. Nissan’s share price also has fallen to the point where it is considered something of a bargain. The merger reflects an industry-wide trend toward consolidation. At a routine briefing Monday, Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said he would not comment on details of the automakers' plans, but said Japanese companies need to stay competitive in the fast-changing global market. 'As the business environment surrounding the automobile industry largely changes, with competitiveness in storage batteries and software is increasingly important, we expect measures needed to survive international competition will be taken,' Hayashi said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nissan-honda-announce-plans-to-merge-creating-world-s-no-3-automaker-/7910919.html	2024-12-23T01:18:44-08:00	
South Korea says North Korea preparing to send more troops, weapons to Russia	South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said Monday there are indications that North Korea is preparing to send more troops and weapons to support Russia’s war effort in Ukraine. The additional weapons being readied include suicide drones, and North Korea has already sent 240mm rocket launchers and 170mm self-propelled artillery to Russia, the JCS said in a statement. North Korea has also sent about 12,000 troops already to Russia, according to South Korea, the United States and Ukraine. The JCS said Monday that at least 1,100 of the North Koreans have been killed or wounded. Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 47 aerial drones that Russian forces launched in attacks overnight targeting multiple areas of the country. The Ukrainian air force said Russia used a total of 72 drones in its latest round of daily aerial assaults. Ukrainian air defenses shot down drones over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Odesa, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions, the military said. Khmelnytskyi Governor Serhii Tiurin said on Telegram that the drone attacks damaged a business and some homes, while injuring one person. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it destroyed a Ukrainian aerial drone over the Bryansk region, which is located along the Russia-Ukraine border. Bryansk Governor Alexander Bogomaz said on Telegram there were no reports of damage or casualties from the Ukrainian attack. Some information for this story was provided by Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-says-north-korea-preparing-to-send-more-troops-weapons-to-russia/7910907.html	2024-12-23T00:46:43-08:00	
Romanian parliament expected to approve new government	BUCHAREST — Romania's outgoing president Klaus Iohannis is expected Monday to designate leftist Social Democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu to form a new government after three pro-European parties agreed to the details of a parliamentary majority. The Social Democrat Party (PSD) will hold eight cabinet posts including justice, transport, labor and defense, and most of its current ministers will stay on in their posts. The centrist Liberal Party (PNL) will have six cabinet jobs, including energy and interior and foreign ministries. The ethnic Hungarian party UDMR will have two posts, including finance. Together with representatives of local ethnic minorities, the three parties will have a slim majority in the legislative in which three ultranationalist and hard-right parties won over a third of seats in a Dec. 1 parliamentary election. The new government will need to approve a calendar for a new two-round presidential election. The three parties in the coalition have agreed to back a single presidential candidate in an attempt to prevent a representative from the radical right from winning. The original three rounds of votes to elect a new president and parliament in the European Union and NATO state, which shares the longest land border with Ukraine, descended into chaos when a little-known far-right pro-Russian politician won the first presidential round on Nov. 24. His shocking win prompted Romania's top court to annul the election on suspicion of Russian meddling and order that it be re-run, likely in the first part of 2025. Romania's new cabinet will also have the daunting task of lowering the budget deficit from an expected 8.6% of economic output this year - the EU's largest - to around 7% in 2025 and ratings agencies and analysts expect tax hikes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-parliament-expected-to-approve-new-government-/7910900.html	2024-12-23T00:20:40-08:00	
Senegal's toy makers thrive ahead of Christmas	Senegal's local toymakers are experiencing a boom in demand ahead of Christmas, with sellers hoping to win market share with high-quality products that reflect the country’s culture and values. Mostly Muslim Senegal has a strong tradition in which different religions share and enjoy each other’s holidays. Christmas is an example in the capital Dakar, where the city is lit up with decorations in December and holiday markets draw families seeking gifts in this West African nation. Awa Gaye, the co-founder of the toy brand Yeewu, was among the sellers at a bustling Christmas market this month. She launched the business after having a daughter and realizing there were few toys that made her feel valued. 'She couldn’t see herself reflected in the toys she played with. So, we decided to create a brand,' Gaye said. Yeewu dolls are adorned with African hairstyles and clothing, and carry inscriptions in the widely spoken local language Wolof. The idea is still new to some Senegalese parents, who sometimes ask her for white dolls or for writing in French. Another local producer, Racky Daffé, founder of Senegalese toy brand Alyfa, is known for toys that promote Senegalese culture, like traditional wrestler figurines or dolls that come in a wide range of skin tones, including albino. Daffé says demand is growing, but there are challenges competing against cheaper, imported products. In Senegal, there are often shortages of raw materials or financing that constrain production. 'The biggest challenge compared with global brands is that we cannot produce at the scale needed to offer these toys at a price affordable for the Senegalese middle class,' said Daffé. Distributors, who have had rising sales in the past few years, are aware of the constraints. At Kidz Palace, a toy distributor in Dakar, chief executive Fatimetou Diop, said the toys sell quickly among families that want educational toys that reflect the country's cultural identity. 'The market cannot always be supplied consistently,' Diop said. 'Sometimes we run out of stock due to raw material shortages or financing issues. Local manufacturers often face these constraints.' Daffé remains optimistic that demand for Senegalese toys will remain strong, and noted that children often point out toys that look like them. 'It’s really about representing an entire community. Every child can see themselves through our toys,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegal-s-toy-makers-thrive-ahead-of-christmas/7910892.html	2024-12-22T23:53:18-08:00	
Malaysia's 1MDB files legal claim against Amicorp Group seeking over $1 billion for alleged fraud	KUALA LUMPUR — Scandal-hit Malaysian state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad said on Monday it has filed a legal claim of more than $1 billion against corporate services provider Amicorp Group and its CEO, alleging the firm knowingly facilitated over $7 billion in fraudulent transactions. The claim, among one of the biggest filed by 1MDB related to the multibillion dollar graft scandal, was filed in the British Virgin Islands against eight Amicorp entities and its Chief Executive Officer Toine Knipping, alleging that they played a vital role in enabling the sovereign wealth fund to be defrauded between 2009 and 2014, 1MDB said in a statement. Amicorp Group did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment and repeated phone calls. Malaysian and U.S. investigators had previously estimated $4.5 billion was siphoned away from 1MDB following its inception in 2009, implicating former Prime Minister Najib Razak, Goldman Sachs staff and high-level officials elsewhere. Najib is currently in prison but has denied wrongdoing. 1MDB alleges Hong Kong-headquartered Amicorp created and managed a complex conspiracy consisting of layers of shell companies, sham transactions, and fraudulent financial structures that obscured the true origin and destination of the funds. Stolen funds were purportedly routed through Singapore, Barbados, Curacao, Hong Kong, and the British Virgin Islands, 1MDB said. It further alleges that Amicorp provided access to the global financial system through Amicorp Bank, a bank registered in Barbados, and provided fund entities and banking services to allow the repeated cycling of assets, giving the impression that 1MDB’s assets had been invested and generated returns when in fact they had been misappropriated. 1MDB said it is seeking damages for the losses it incurred from Amicorp's 'dishonest' assistance in breaches of fiduciary duty and conspiracy to commit unlawful acts, adding the legal action was part of a global effort to recover stolen 1MDB assets. 'There is, in our view, strong evidence to suggest that Amicorp – at the highest levels – knew they were involved in a dishonest and illegal money laundering scheme designed to transfer large sums of cash away from its intended beneficiary - the people of Malaysia,' a spokesperson for 1MDB said in the statement. As of September this year, Malaysia has recovered $6.06 billion linked to 1MDB, state news agency Bernama reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-s-1mdb-files-legal-claim-against-amicorp-group-seeking-over-1-billion-for-alleged-fraud-/7910880.html	2024-12-22T23:05:16-08:00	
Makers of Taiwan's 'Zero Day' TV series set around invasion fear backlash from China	TAIPEI — A Chinese war plane goes missing near Taiwan. China sends swarms of military boats and planes for a blockade as Taiwan goes on a war footing. Panic ensues on the streets of Taipei. The premise of 'Zero Day,' a new Taiwan TV drama envisioning a Chinese invasion, is a topic that has for years been considered too sensitive for many Taiwan filmmakers and television show creators, who fear losing access to the lucrative Chinese entertainment market. But as China steps up military threats, including the large massing of naval forces last week and daily military activities close to the island, the upcoming drama confronts the fear by setting the 10-episode series around a Chinese invasion of Taiwan. 'We thought there is freedom in Taiwan, but in film and TV production we are restricted by China on many levels,' said Cheng Hsin Mei, the showrunner on 'Zero Day.' China, which claims Taiwan as its own territory over the objections of the government in Taipei, is a much larger market for film and television. Taiwanese entertainers are popular there partly due to language and cultural similarities. Cheng said creators in free and democratic Taiwan, however, are indirectly confined by Beijing's powerful state censorship. Beijing has regularly called out Taiwanese artists seen as violating China's political ideology and has threatened to blacklist those unwilling to cooperate. China pressured a popular Taiwanese rock band to make pro-China comments ahead of Taiwan's presidential vote early this year, sources told Reuters. Beijing denied pressuring the group Mayday. China's Taiwan Affairs Office did not respond to a request for comment. BUZZ IN TAIWAN For the 'Zero Day' crew, confronting such a sensitive topic means facing difficulties, from funding and casting, to finding places to film. Cheng said more than half of the 'Zero Day' crew asked to remain anonymous on the crew list, and some people including a director pulled out of the production at the last minute, due to worries it might jeopardize their future work in China or concerns about the safety of their families working there. 'Our freedom is hard-earned,' Cheng said, adding people should not give in easily due to fears over China. 'The People's Liberation Army has launched substantial incursions against us and they are getting closer and closer,' she said. 'We should look at this directly rather than pretending that it is not happening.' The show, which is set to be broadcast online and on yet-to-be announced television channels next year, is already creating buzz in Taiwan after the extended trailer went online in July. The drama focuses on several scenarios Taiwan might face in the days leading up to a Chinese attack, including a global financial collapse, the activation of Chinese sleeper agents and panicked residents trying to flee the island. 'Without freedom, Taiwan is not Taiwan,' the actor who plays a fictional Taiwan president says in a televised speech, urging unity after declaring war on China, in the show's trailer. The live broadcast then gets abruptly cut off, replaced by a feed of a Chinese state television anchor calling for Taiwanese to surrender and to report 'hidden pro-independence activists' to Chinese soldiers after their landing in Taiwan. Milton Lin, a 75-year-old Taipei resident, said he was grateful the TV series was putting a spotlight on the threats by China. 'It helps Taiwanese to understand that we are facing a strong enemy trying to annex us and how we should be on guard with unity to face such an invasion.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/makers-of-taiwan-s-zero-day-tv-series-set-around-invasion-fear-backlash-from-china/7910812.html	2024-12-22T21:38:36-08:00	
Why people in Africa's most populous country are risking their lives for holiday handouts	Abuja, Nigeria — Stampedes during three Christmas charity events across Nigeria have left at least 67 people dead in the past week, many of them children. Families are struggling during the country's worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. At least 35 children were killed in southwestern Oyo state on Wednesday. And on Saturday, 22 people died in southeastern Anambra state while 10 died in the capital, Abuja, where more than 1,000 people had gathered at a church to receive clothes and food. Here are some issues facing Nigerians. Inflation at a 28-year high 'There is hunger in this Nigeria. Every Nigerian needs food,' one woman, in tears, told the local Arise television after the stampede in Abuja. The economic crisis is blamed on the government's policies to save money and attract investors, which have contributed to pushing the inflation rate to a 28-year high of 34.6%. Meanwhile, the naira currency languishes at record lows against the dollar. At least 63% of Nigeria's more than 210 million people population is poor, according to the government's statistics office. The government has struggled to create jobs. And when people gather to protest hardship, security forces are quick to clamp down. In August, more than 20 people were shot dead by security forces during nationwide protests. 'The average Nigerian has seen food go out of their reach,' said Cheta Nwanze, managing partner at the Lagos-based SBM Intelligence research firm. In 2022, the firm found that about 97% of Nigerians spend up to 63% of their income on food, but that share must have grown since then, he said. Some of those who died in Abuja had waited overnight outside the church in cold weather for the chance to enter early, according to Loveth Inyang, a witness who rescued a baby from the crush. Security is costly, too Deadly stampedes are not new in Nigeria and are often caused by lack of adherence to public safety measures. But analysts say people's desperation to survive is making crowd control more difficult. Accounts from witnesses and police in Abuja and Anambra showed that the stampedes occurred before the events started as people tried to secure prime positions. In Abuja, the church was forced to cancel the event, leaving bags of rice and clothing items inside. Organizers of such charity events often do not consider security a priority, said Ademola Adetuberu, who runs the Abuja-based Barricade Executive Protection security firm. Meanwhile, the number of events is increasing as philanthropists and organizations try to meet the growing demand for food. 'If organizers of such events brainstorm more, get professionals to advise them and have a budget for security, this can be prevented,' Adetuberu said. How authorities are responding Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu has asked authorities to no longer tolerate 'operational lapses' by organizers of such events, while police have made it mandatory for organizers to get prior permission before hosting them. But such commitments are not new and usually difficult to enforce, analysts said. 'People's incomes have been squeezed through the entire year. When they hear somewhere that food is being distributed, their natural instinct is to go,' Nwanze said. 'Add this to our notoriously poor queue culture and you have the perfect storm that will lead to such a stampede.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-people-in-africa-s-most-populous-country-are-risking-their-lives-for-holiday-handouts/7910760.html	2024-12-22T17:37:41-08:00	
El Gordo' lottery in Spain spreads Christmas riches worth $2.8 billion	Madrid — For weeks, Spaniards had anticipated the arrival of 'El Gordo' or 'The Fat One.' But unlike Santa Claus, El Gordo arrived three days before Christmas, before noon on Sunday. El Gordo is the first prize of Spain's hugely popular national Christmas lottery, which is said to be the world's largest based on the total prize money involved, even though other lotteries have larger single prizes. This year's draw will spread riches of around $2.8 billion, much of it in small winnings. Several ticket holders with the number 72480 won the top prize, worth about $417,000 before taxes. The winning tickets were sold in Logrono, a city in northern Spain's La Rioja region that is known for its wines. Multiple tickets with the same number can be sold to different groups and full tickets are divisible into 10 parts. Buying and sharing these fractions, known in Spanish as 'décimos' or tenths, is a popular tradition in the run-up to Christmas. Families, friends, and co-workers often take part, usually spending $21 each. On Sunday, young students from Madrid's San Ildefonso school selected the numbers from two revolving orbs in the capital's Teatro Real opera house and sang them out in turn for nearly five hours in a cadence familiar to Spaniards. After 'El Gordo' was announced, audience members — some dressed in costume as Don Quijote, Christmas elves, Biblical wise men and the lottery itself — began streaming out of the venue, from which the event was televised nationally. María Angeles, a teacher from the southwestern province of Badajoz, said she waited for hours in line to get a seat inside the opera house to watch the event with a group of 14 friends and family members that she traveled with to Madrid. 'The point of coming to see the lottery is the hope,' Angeles said. She reckoned no one in her group won more than $146. The lottery works on the premise of distributing the most winning numbers to the largest number of people possible. There are hundreds of small prizes and 13 major ones, including the 'El Gordo' winner. In the weeks leading up to the draw, lines form outside lottery offices, especially those with a history of selling prize-winning tickets in previous years. Spain's Dec. 22 Christmas lottery began during the Napoleonic wars in 1812 and has continued largely without interruption since then, even during the Spanish Civil War. Students from the San Ildefonso school have been singing the prizes since the start. Spain's national lottery was first established as a charity in 1763 by the Bourbon monarch King Carlos III. It was later used to shore up state coffers. Today, it supports various charities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/el-gordo-lottery-in-spain-spreads-christmas-riches-worth-2-8-billion/7910758.html	2024-12-22T17:21:36-08:00	
Russia captures two villages in Ukraine as Moscow's forces advance on two cities	Russian forces captured two villages in Ukraine, one in Kharkiv region in the northeast and one in eastern Donetsk region, the Russian Defense Ministry said on Sunday. Donetsk region is where Moscow is concentrating most of its efforts to seize two cities. Russian forces, making steady progress across Donetsk region, are moving on the towns of Pokrovsk, a logistics center and site of an important coking colliery, and appear to be closing in on Kurakhove, farther south. The Defense Ministry statement said troops had taken control of Lozova, near the town of Kupiansk, in an area north of Donetsk region also under Russian pressure in recent weeks. The village of Sontsivka, north of Kurakhove, was also captured. The ministry on Saturday announced the capture of another village near Kurakhove, Kostiantynopolske. The Ukraine military's general staff made no mention of those villages falling into Russian hands, but said Sontsivka was in a sector subject to 26 Russian attacks in the past 24 hours. The general staff also reported heavy fighting near Pokrovsk, with 34 Russian attempts to pierce defenses. The popular Ukrainian military blog DeepState said Sontsivka was under Russian control. Russian reports have described intensified pressure on Kurakhove. The Moscow-appointed governor of areas of Donetsk region occupied by Russian forces, Denis Pushilin, said on Telegram that Russian troops now controlled the town center. He also said troops were advancing on Pokrovsk from the south. Russian troops have been moving through eastern Ukraine in the past two months at the fastest rate since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. The Ukrainian military said on Friday its forces had pulled back from the area around two villages -- one near Pokrovsk, the other near Kurakhove -- to avoid being encircled by advancing Russian troops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-captures-two-villages-in-ukraine-as-moscow-s-forces-advance-on-two-cities/7910751.html	2024-12-22T17:08:12-08:00	
Pope Francis calls for ceasefire on all fronts in his prayer ahead of Christmas	Vatican City — Pope Francis called for a ceasefire on all war fronts in his Sunday Angelus prayer ahead of Christmas, condemning the 'cruelty' of bombing schools and hospitals in Ukraine and Gaza. 'Let the weapons fall silent and let the Christmas carols ring out!' Francis said, delivering his Sunday blessing from indoors due to a cold and as a precaution ahead of a busy Christmas period. 'Let us pray that at Christmas there will be a ceasefire on all war fronts, in Ukraine, in the Holy Land, throughout the Middle East and throughout the world,' the pope said. Francis recalled, as he often does, the 'battered Ukraine' that continues to be hit by attacks on cities, 'which sometimes damage schools, hospitals and churches.' He also expressed his pain thinking of Gaza, 'of such cruelty, to the machine-gunning of children, to the bombing of schools and hospitals ... How much cruelty!' Francis on Saturday also criticized Israel's actions in Gaza and said that his envoy had been unable to enter the territory because of Israeli bombing. Israeli authorities on Sunday allowed Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the leader of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, to enter Gaza and celebrate a pre-Christmas Mass with members of the territory's small Christian community. Israel says it has made great efforts to spare civilians and is only at war with Hamas, which it accuses of genocidal violence in the attack that ignited the war. The pontiff, who turned 88 this past week, appeared in good shape on Sunday, after looking wheezing and congested during his annual Christmas greeting to Vatican bureaucrats on Saturday. The Vatican cited the cold temperatures outside and Francis' strenuous week ahead in deciding to deliver his Sunday blessing indoors. The pope on Tuesday is due to inaugurate his big Holy Year and preside over Christmas Eve and Christmas Day celebrations in St. Peter's Basilica. On Thursday, he is scheduled to travel to Rome's main prison to inaugurate the Jubilee there. Francis has long suffered bouts of bronchitis, especially in winter. In 2023, he ended up in hospital to receive intravenous antibiotics. He had part of one lung removed as a young man and frequently seems out of breath, especially after walking or exerting himself.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-calls-for-ceasefire-on-all-fronts-in-his-prayer-ahead-of-christmas/7910745.html	2024-12-22T16:52:43-08:00	
In a calendar rarity, Hanukkah starts this year on Christmas Day	Hanukkah, Judaism's eight-day Festival of Lights, begins this year on Christmas Day, which has only happened four times since 1900. For some rabbis, the intersection of the two religious holidays provides an auspicious occasion for interfaith engagement. 'This can be a profound opportunity for learning and collaboration and togetherness,' said Rabbi Josh Stanton, a vice president of the Jewish Federations of North America. He oversees interfaith initiatives involving the 146 local and regional Jewish federations that his organization represents. 'The goal is not proselytizing; it's learning deeply from each other,' he said. 'It's others seeing you as you see yourself.' One example of togetherness: a Chicanukah party hosted Thursday evening by several Jewish organizations in Houston, bringing together members of the city's Latino and Jewish communities for a 'cross cultural holiday celebration.' The venue: Houston's Holocaust museum. The food on offer was a blend of the two cultures — for example a latke bar featuring guacamole, chili con queso and pico de gallo, as well as applesauce and sour cream. The doughnut-like pastries were sufganiyot — a Hanukkah specialty — and buñuelos, And the mariachi band took a crack at playing the Jewish folk song 'Hava Nagila.' 'What really brings us together is our shared values — our faith, our families, our heritage,' said Erica Winsor, public affairs officer for the Jewish Federation of Greater Houston. Rabbi Peter Tarlow, executive director of the Houston-based Center for Latino-Jewish Relations, said the first Chicanukah event 12 years ago drew 20 people, while this year the crowd numbered about 300, and could have been larger had not attendance been capped. He said the partygoers were a roughly even mix of Latinos — some of them Jews with Latin American origins — and 'Anglo' Jews. 'There's too much hate, too much separation against both Jews and Latinos,' Tarlow said. 'This is a way we can come together and show we support each other.' While Hanukkah is intended as an upbeat, celebratory holiday, rabbis note that it's taking place this year amid continuing conflicts involving Israeli forces in the Middle East, and apprehension over widespread incidents of antisemitism. Rabbi Moshe Hauer, executive vice president of the Orthodox Union, acknowledged that many Jews may be feeling anxious heading into Hanukkah this year. But he voiced confidence that most would maintain the key tradition: the lighting of candles on menorah candelabras and displaying where they're visible through household windows and in public spaces. 'The posture of our community — without stridency, just with determination — is that the menorah should be in our windows, in a place where the public sees it,' Hauer said. 'It is less for us, the Jewish community, than for the world,' he added. 'We have to share that light. Putting the menorah in the window is our expression of working to be a light among the nations.' Hauer concurred with Stanton that this year's overlap of Hanukkah and Christmas is 'an exceptional opportunity to see and experience the diversity of America and the diversity of its communities of faith.' Rabbi Motti Seligson, public relations director for the Hasidic movement Chabad-Lubavitch, noted that this year marks the 50th anniversary of a milestone in the public lightings of menorahs. It was on Dec. 8, 1974 — as part of an initiative launched by the Lubavitcher leader, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson — that a menorah was lit outside Philadelphia's Independence Hall, where the Liberty Bell was housed at the time. 'Hanukkah is a celebration of religious liberty, so that it's not taken for granted,' Seligson said. 'One of the ways of doing that is by celebrating it publicly.' He said Chabad was organizing about 15,000 public menorah lightings this year through its numerous branches around the world. 'There certainly is some apprehension,' Seligson said, referring to concerns about antisemitism and political friction. 'Some people question whether Jews will be celebrating as openly as in the past.' 'What I'm hearing is there's no way that we can't,' he added. 'The only way through these difficult times is by standing stronger and prouder and shining brighter than ever.' Stanton concurred. 'Through our history, we've been through moments that are easy and moments that are hard,' he said. 'Safety for us does not come from hiding. It comes from reaching out.' Why is Hanukkah so late this year? The simple answer is that the Jewish calendar is based on lunar cycles and is not in sync with the Gregorian calendar, which sets Christmas on Dec. 25. Hanukkah always begins on the 25th day of the Jewish month of Kislev, a date which occurs between late November and late December on the Gregorian calendar. The last time Hanukkah began on Christmas Day was in 2005. But the term 'Chrismukkah' — signifying the overlap of the two holidays — had become a popular term before then. The term gained extra currency in 2003, when the character Seth Cohen on the TV drama 'The O.C.' embraced the fusion holiday as a tribute to his Jewish father and Protestant mother. This season, the Hallmark Channel introduced a new Christmas movie called 'Leah's Perfect Gift,' depicting a young Jewish woman who had admired Christmas from a distance and gets a chance to experience it up close when her boyfriend invites her to spend the holidays with his family. Spoiler alert: All does not go smoothly. Despite such storylines suggesting a fascination with Christmas among some Jews, Stanton says research by the Jewish Federations reveals a surge in Jews seeking deeper connections to their own traditions and community, as well as a surge in Jews volunteering for charitable activities during the holidays. 'The opportunity is to share with others how we celebrate Hanukkah,' he said. 'It's a holiday of freedom, hope, showing proudly you are Jewish.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-a-calendar-rarity-hanukkah-starts-this-year-on-christmas-day/7910740.html	2024-12-22T16:42:06-08:00	
Syria's new leader says all weapons to come under 'state control'	Damascus, Syria — Two weeks after seizing power in a sweeping offensive, Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa on Sunday said weapons in the country, including those held by Kurdish-led forces, would come under state control. Sharaa spoke alongside Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan, after earlier meeting with Lebanese Druze leaders and vowing to end 'negative interference' in the neighboring country. Ankara-backed rebels played a key role in supporting Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), which headed a rebel alliance that seized Damascus on December 8, toppling longtime ruler Bashar al-Assad. During a press conference with Fidan, Sharaa said Syria's armed 'factions will begin to announce their dissolution and enter' the army. 'We will absolutely not allow there to be weapons in the country outside state control, whether from the revolutionary factions or the factions present in the SDF area,' he added, referring to the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces. Sharaa traded in the olive-green military shirt he sported just days ago for a suit and tie during his meetings on Sunday at the presidential palace. He also said, 'We are working on protecting sects and minorities from any attacks that occur between them' and from 'external' actors exploiting the situation 'to cause sectarian discord.' 'Syria is a country for all and we can coexist together,' he added. That sentiment was on display at the colorfully lit Christmas market in Damascus, where Batoul al-Law, a dietician, said there were more Muslims than Christians. 'We have always celebrated both Christian and Muslim holidays together,' she said, but 'you feel that people are now happier and more comfortable.' Turkey's Fidan said sanctions on Syria must 'be lifted as soon as possible.' He called for the international community to 'mobilize to help Syria get back on its feet and for the displaced people to return.' Syria's nearly 14-year civil war killed more than a half-million people and displaced more than half its population, with many of them fleeing to neighboring countries, including 3 million in Turkey. Turkey has maintained strong ties with Syria's new leaders and has continued military operations against Kurdish-held areas in northeastern Syria. A senior German diplomat, Tobias Tunkel, on Sunday said on X that he had spoken with SDF leader Mazloum Abdi about rising tensions in the Kurdish-held border town of Kobane 'and urgent steps to diffuse them.' The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said a woman and her child were killed in 'artillery shelling by pro-Turkey factions' in the Kobane countryside, and the factions clashed with the SDF further south. Ankara regards the People's Protection Units (YPG), the main component of the SDF, as being connected to the militant Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) at home, which both Turkey and Western allies deem a 'terrorist' organization. Regional powerhouse Saudi Arabia is also in direct contact with Syria's new authorities, having supported the opposition to Assad for years during Syria's civil war. Riyadh will send a delegation to the country soon, Syria's ambassador in the Saudi capital said. During his meeting with visiting Lebanese Druze chiefs Walid and Taymur Jumblatt, Sharaa said Syria would no longer engage in 'negative interference in Lebanon at all.' Syria 'will stay at equal distance from all' in Lebanon, Sharaa added, acknowledging that Syria has been a 'source of fear and anxiety' for its neighbor. Walid Jumblatt, a fierce critic of Assad and his father, Hafez, who ruled Syria before him, arrived in Damascus on Sunday at the head of a delegation of lawmakers from his parliamentary bloc and Druze religious figures. The Druze religious minority is spread across Lebanon, Syria, Israel and Jordan. The Syrian army entered Lebanon in 1976, only leaving in 2005 after enormous pressure and mass protests following the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafik Hariri, a killing attributed to Damascus and its ally, Lebanon's Iran-backed Hezbollah group. The seizure of power by the Sunni Islamists of HTS – considered a terrorist organization by many governments, including the United States -- has sparked concern, though the group has in recent years sought to moderate its image. Global powers, including the United States and the European Union, have stepped up contacts with the war-ravaged country's new leaders, urging them to guarantee protections for women and minorities. The foreign leaders have also stressed the importance of combating 'terrorism and extremism.' Assad had long played a strategic role in Iran's 'axis of resistance,' a loose alliance of regional proxy forces aligned against Israel, particularly in facilitating the supply of weapons to Hezbollah in neighboring Lebanon. That axis has suffered heavy blows over the past year with Israel's devastation of the leadership of Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas in Gaza. Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader of Iran, on Sunday nonetheless denied that these armed groups acted as proxies, adding that: 'If one day we want to take action, we do not need a proxy force.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-new-leader-says-all-weapons-to-come-under-state-control/7910729.html	2024-12-22T16:17:41-08:00	
Custom clocks designed for Pennsylvania's Capitol a century ago still ticking	Harrisburg, Pennsylvania — Capitol buildings are almost always an imposing presence. As the seat of government, they tend to be elegant and stately — and frequently capped by a dome. Visitors to Pennsylvania 's Capitol are drawn to its priceless artwork, polished marble and intricate carvings, but hidden behind the doors of some of its most ornate offices and chambers are another treasure: hundreds of antique clocks that were part of its original design. The 273 working clocks include many that are integrated into fireplace mantels and other building features. They are not low maintenance, requiring regular oiling and occasional mechanical overhauls. And every week, in a throwback to a time before wristwatches and cellphones, clock winders roam the halls — ensuring the century-plus-old timekeepers keep ticking. On a recent morning, Bethany Gill demonstrated how it's done — going room to room with an array of ladders and custom tools. She opens the glass covers, rotates the mechanisms enough to keep them going for about a week and checks their accuracy before moving on to the next one. Gill is a former art student who works for Johnson & Griffiths Studio, a Harrisburg firm that just received a five-year, $526,000 winding and maintenance contract renewal from the Capitol Preservation Committee. She's also a lifelong clock lover who looks forward to the semiannual transitions between daylight saving time and Eastern Standard Time. Why? 'My dad was a clock collector growing up,' Gill said. 'And every Sunday we would go around the house and wind the clocks. And that was always just a nice thing that I did with my dad.' Pennsylvania's Capitol was crafted by architect Joseph M. Huston, who won its design competition in 1901 with a vision for a temple of democracy — a palace of art that would be as fancy as what could then be found in Europe. Among countless other fine touches, Huston designed at least 180 custom clock cases, including smaller so-called keystone clocks that are shaped to remind people of Pennsylvania's early and critical role in the formation of the United States, leaving it with the nickname of the Keystone State. 'The clocks are just part of why the building's so unique and so intricate,' said Capitol Preservation Committee historian Jason Wilson. 'The mantels surrounding the clocks are all custom designed.' Every so often the clocks, most of them built from mahogany or stained mahogany, are carefully removed from their spots around the Capitol and taken to a facility for cleaning, maintenance and repair. They seem to run better when kept wound. Huston, the architect, achieved his goal. The Capitol is a showpiece that draws thousands of visitors every year to where 253 state lawmakers convene to debate and pass legislation. While the buildings and the clocks are his lasting legacy, Huston was convicted of a conspiracy to defraud the state during the Capitol construction project and spent several months in another Pennsylvania landmark, Eastern State Penitentiary in Philadelphia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/custom-clocks-designed-for-pennsylvania-s-capitol-a-century-ago-still-ticking/7910492.html	2024-12-22T15:55:02-08:00	
Albanian PM says TikTok ban was not 'rushed reaction to a single incident'	Tirana, Albania — Albania's prime minister said Sunday the ban on TikTok his government announced a day earlier was 'not a rushed reaction to a single incident.' Edi Rama said Saturday the government will shut down TikTok for one year, accusing the popular video service of inciting violence and bullying, especially among children. Authorities have held 1,300 meetings with teachers and parents since the November stabbing death of a teenager by another teen after a quarrel that started on social media apps. Ninety percent of them approve of the ban on TikTok. 'The ban on TikTok for one year in Albania is not a rushed reaction to a single incident, but a carefully considered decision made in consultation with parent communities in schools across the country,' said Rama. Following Tirana's decision, TikTok asked for 'urgent clarity from the Albanian government' in the case of the stabbed teenager. The company said it had 'found no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts, and multiple reports have in fact confirmed videos leading up to this incident were being posted on another platform, not TikTok.' 'To claim that the killing of the teenage boy has no connection to TikTok because the conflict didn't originate on the platform demonstrates a failure to grasp both the seriousness of the threat TikTok poses to children and youth today and the rationale behind our decision to take responsibility for addressing this threat,' Rama said. 'Albania may be too small to demand that TikTok protect children and youth from the frightening pitfalls of its algorithm,' he said, blaming TikTok for 'the reproduction of the unending hell of the language of hatred, violence, bullying and so on.' Albanian children comprise the largest group of TikTok users in the country, according to domestic researchers. Many youngsters in Albania did not approve of the ban. 'We disclose our daily life and entertain ourselves, that is, we exploit it during our free time,' said Samuel Sulmani, an 18-year-old in the town of Rreshen, 75 kilometers north of the capital Tirana, on Sunday. 'We do not agree with that because that's a deprivation for us.' But Albanian parents have been increasingly concerned following reports of children taking knives and other objects to school to use in quarrels or cases of bullying promoted by stories they see on TikTok. 'Our decision couldn't be clearer: Either TikTok protects the children of Albania, or Albania will protect its children from TikTok,' Rama said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/albanian-pm-says-tiktok-ban-was-not-rushed-reaction-to-a-single-incident-/7910489.html	2024-12-22T15:41:36-08:00	
China says US is 'playing with fire' after latest military aid for Taiwan	Beijing — The Chinese government protested Sunday the latest American announcements of military sales and assistance to Taiwan, warning the United States that it is 'playing with fire.' U.S. President Joe Biden authorized Saturday the provision of up to $571 million in Defense Department material and services and in military education and training for self-ruled Taiwan, which Beijing claims as its territory and says must come under its control. Separately, the Defense Department said Friday that $295 million in military sales had been approved. A Chinese Foreign Ministry statement urged the U.S. to stop arming Taiwan and stop what it called 'dangerous moves that undermine peace and stability in the Taiwan Strait.' U.S. military sales and assistance aim to help Taiwan defend itself and deter China from launching an attack. The $571 million in military assistance comes on top of Biden's authorization of $567 million for the same purposes in late September. The military sales include $265 million for about 300 tactical radio systems and $30 million for 16 gun mounts. Taiwan's Foreign Ministry welcomed the approval of the two sales, saying in a post on X that it reaffirmed the U.S. government's 'commitment to our defense.' In October, the U.S. approved $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including the first-time delivery of an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system, also drawing China's criticism while Beijing has responded with war drills around Taiwan. Taiwan earlier this month demanded that China end its ongoing military activity in nearby waters, which it said undermined peace and stability and disrupted international shipping and trade. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said he would not commit to defending Taiwan if China were to invade during his presidency. Trump has also said that Taiwan should pay the U.S. for defending it against China, likening the relationship to insurance. Taiwan spends about 2.5% of its GDP on defense.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-says-us-is-playing-with-fire-after-latest-military-aid-for-taiwan/7910486.html	2024-12-22T15:24:58-08:00	
Mozambique council to rule on election results Monday	Maputo, Mozambique — Mozambique's constitutional council will announce Monday whether it will validate the results of elections that have plunged the country into deadly turmoil, the body said. Exiled opposition leader Venancio Mondlane has threatened to call 'a popular uprising' if the Constitutional Council approves initial results that found he came second in the Oct. 9 vote behind the ruling Frelimo party candidate. Constitutional council president Lucia da Luz Ribeiro will make 'the proclamation of the definitive results' of the presidential and legislative elections at a public hearing on Monday, the council said in a statement. The election commission results said that Mondlane won 20 percent of the presidential vote compared to 71% for Daniel Chapo, the Frelimo candidate. Mondlane has said the result was rigged and that he won 53% of the vote. Several international observer missions have also said there were irregularities. More than two months of political unrest has left at least 130 dead, according to the Plataforma Decide non-government group. Mondlane has said there will be 'chaos' and a 'new popular uprising of a scale never seen' if the earlier results are validated. He has taken refuge abroad, saying he fears for his safety. Frelimo has ruled the poor southern African state since independence from Portugal in 1975.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-council-to-rule-on-election-results-monday/7910484.html	2024-12-22T15:07:09-08:00

Pakistan faces backlash over military court convictions of 25 civilians	Islamabad — The European Union Sunday decried military court verdicts against 25 supporters of Pakistan’s jailed former prime minister, Imran Khan, affirming that these rulings contravene the country’s international obligations to ensure a fair and public trial for civilians. The individuals were tried and sentenced to 'vigorous imprisonment' ranging from two to 10 years in connection with attacks on military facilities during nationwide anti-government protests in May 2023, as announced by the Pakistani army on Saturday. The statement did not provide further details or publicize the verdicts, promising to announce sentences to the dozens of remaining accused 'in connection with the violence as and when the due process is complete.' In a statement released Sunday, the EU expressed concern over the sentencing of the 25 civilians. 'These verdicts are seen as inconsistent with the obligations that Pakistan has undertaken under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR),' it said. The multilateral treaty obligates nations to provide individuals 'with a fair and public trial in a court that is independent, impartial and competent, and has the right to adequate and effective legal representation.' The EU stated the treaty mandates that any judgment rendered in a criminal case be made public. The statement emphasized that countries benefiting from the EU’s Generalized Scheme of Preferences Plus, or GSP+, facility, including Pakistan, have voluntarily agreed to implement 27 international core conventions, including the ICCPR, effectively. The GSP+ designation grants zero import duties on more than two-thirds of tariff lines when exporting to the European Union, providing Pakistan, a cash-strapped nation, with a major and crucial trade partner. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party, which led the anti-government protests last year, promptly rejected the rulings as a blatant violation of human rights and the rule of law within the country. The party has long asserted that the riots were the result of operatives within the military who had infiltrated ranks of peaceful protesters. 'The actual perpetrators orchestrated a false flag operation on that day and are now utilizing military trials to serve as judge, jury and executioner, targeting innocent civilians,' the PTI asserted in a tweet on its X social media platform. Since August 2023, Khan has been incarcerated and faces multiple charges, including allegedly inciting attacks against military facilities, despite being in police custody when the nationwide protests erupted last year, demanding his release. Pakistan’s prestigious English-language DAWN newspaper slammed the military convictions in a Sunday editorial. 'Can serving officers, bound by military hierarchy, truly provide independent judgments? The one-line descriptions of convictions accompanying the names of the 25 individuals hardly qualify as reasoned judgments,' the paper asked. 'That such trials are occurring under civilian leadership adds a layer of irony to this distressing situation. Pakistan’s democracy, still finding its feet, cannot afford such compromises on core democratic values,' the editorial read.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-faces-backlash-over-military-court-convictions-of-25-civilians/7910477.html	2024-12-22T14:36:30-08:00	
Trump threatens to retake control of Panama Canal	West Palm Beach, Florida — President-elect Donald Trump threatened to reassert U.S. control over the Panama Canal on Sunday, accusing Panama of charging excessive rates to use the Central American passage and drawing a sharp rebuke from Panamanian President Jose Raul Mulino. Speaking to a crowd of supporters in Arizona on Sunday, Trump also said he would not let the canal fall into the 'wrong hands,' warning of potential Chinese influence on the passage. China does not control or administer the canal, but a subsidiary of Hong Kong-based CK Hutchison Holdings has long managed two ports located on the Caribbean and Pacific entrances to the canal. The president-elect's comments came hours after he leveled a similar threat against Panama in a post on Truth Social on Saturday night. 'Has anyone ever heard of the Panama Canal?' Trump said on Sunday at AmericaFest, an annual event organized by Turning Point, an allied conservative group. 'Because we're being ripped off at the Panama Canal like we're being ripped off everywhere else.' Trump's comments were an exceedingly rare example of a U.S. leader saying he could push a sovereign country to hand over territory. It also underlines an expected shift in U.S. diplomacy under Trump, who has not historically shied away from threatening allies and using bellicose rhetoric when dealing with counterparts. 'The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous, highly unfair,' Trump said. 'It was given to Panama and the people of Panama, but it has provisions. You get to treat us fairly, and they haven't treated us fairly. If the principles, both moral and legal, of this magnanimous gesture of giving are not followed, then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, quickly and without question.' In a recorded message released by Panamanian President Mulino on Sunday afternoon, the nation's leader said that Panama's independence was non-negotiable and that China had no influence on the canal's administration. He also defended the passage rates Panama charged, saying they were not set 'on a whim.' 'Every square meter of the Panama Canal and the surrounding area belongs to Panama and will continue belonging [to Panama],' Mulino said in the statement, which was released on X. Several other Panamanian politicians, including members of the opposition, also took to social media to criticize Trump's statements. The United States largely built the canal and administered territory surrounding the passage for decades. But the United States and Panama signed a pair of accords in 1977 that paved the way for the canal's return to full Panamanian control. The United States handed over control of the passage in 1999 after a period of joint administration. The waterway, which allows up to 14,000 ships to cross per year, accounts for 2.5% of global seaborne trade and is critical to U.S. imports of autos and commercial goods by container ships from Asia, and for U.S. exports of commodities, including liquefied natural gas. It is not clear how Trump would seek to regain control over the canal, and he would have no recourse under international law if he decided to make a play for the passage. This is not the first time Trump has openly considered territorial expansion. During his 2017-2021 term, Trump expressed interest in buying Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. He was publicly rebuffed by Danish authorities before any conversations could take place. Trump's appearance at AmericaFest capped a four-day event that drew more than 20,000 activists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-threatens-to-retake-control-of-panama-canal/7910466.html	2024-12-22T13:57:10-08:00	
Native American tribe closer to acquiring more land in Arizona after decades of delay	Federal officials have joined with the state of Arizona to begin fulfilling a settlement agreement that was reached with the Hopi Tribe nearly three decades ago, marking what tribal officials described as a historic day. Government attorneys filed condemnation documents on Friday to transfer dozens of square kilometers of state land into trust for the Hopi. The tribe will compensate the state nearly $4 million for more than 80 square kilometers of land near Winslow. It could mark the first of more transfers of land into trust to help eliminate the checkerboard of ownership that characterizes much of the lands used by the tribe for ranching in northeastern Arizona. A long time coming Friday's filing was born out of the 1996 passage of the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute Settlement Act, which ratified an agreement between the Hopi and federal government that set conditions for taking land into trust for the tribe. The wrangling over land in northeastern Arizona has been bitter, pitting the Hopi and the Navajo Nation against one another for generations. The federal government failed in its attempt to have the tribes share land and after years of escalating conflict, Congress in 1974 divided the area and ordered tribal members to leave each other's reservations. The resulting borders meant the Navajo Nation — the country's largest reservation at close to 70,000 square kilometers — surrounded the nearly 6,500-square-kilometer Hopi reservation. Since the 1996 settlement, the Hopi Tribe has purchased private land and sought to take neighboring state lands into trust in hopes of consolidating property for the tribe's benefit. A historic day There have been many roadblocks along the way, including in 2018 when the tribe sought the support of local governments in northern Arizona to back a proposed transfer for land south of the busy Interstate 40 corridor. Those efforts were stymied by the inclusion of national forest tracts in the Flagstaff area. Hopi Chairman Tim Nuvangyaoma said in a statement Friday that he was grateful for everyone who worked to make the condemnation filing a reality and that the timing for this historic moment was fitting. 'Within Hopi, it is our time of the soyal'ang ceremony — the start of the New Year and the revitalization of life,' he said. Gov. Katie Hobbs, who first visited the Hopi reservation in 2023, acknowledged that the tribe has been fighting for its rights for decades and that politicians of the past had refused to hear the voices of tribal communities. 'Every Arizonan should have an opportunity to thrive and a space to call home, and this agreement takes us one step closer to making those Arizona values a reality,' she said Friday. More transfers and economic opportunities In November, the Navajo Nation signed a warranty deed to take into trust a parcel of land near Flagstaff as part of the federal government's outstanding obligations to support members of that tribe who were forcibly relocated as a result of the Navajo-Hopi dispute. Navajo leaders are considering building a casino on the newly acquired land, saying such a project would provide significant economic benefits. For the Hopi, bringing more land into trust also holds the promise of more economic opportunities. The state lands near Winslow that are part of the condemnation filing are interspersed with Hopi-owned lands and have long been leased to the tribe for ranching and agricultural purposes, according to the U.S. Justice Department. Federal officials said Friday's filing is the first of an anticipated series of condemnation actions that ultimately would result in the transfer of more than 1440 square kilometers of state land into trust for the Hopi Tribe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/native-american-tribe-closer-to-acquiring-more-land-in-arizona-after-decades-of-delay/7910461.html	2024-12-22T13:18:31-08:00	
Media report: More than 3,100 Native American children died in US boarding schools	Washington — At least 3,104 Native American children died in boarding schools in the United States, taken from their families to be forcibly assimilated, The Washington Post reported on Sunday, with its estimate three times higher than that of the American government. In these establishments, some of which were religious and which existed from the beginning of the 19th century to the 1970s, many children suffered physical, psychological or sexual violence, according to a recent government report which estimated that at least 973 students died there. In late October, U.S. President Joe Biden apologized to Native American peoples, calling the atrocities 'a sin that stains our souls.' According to The Washington Post, which conducted a year-long investigation, 3,104 students lost their lives in these schools between 1828 and 1970, in what the newspaper describes as 'a dark chapter in American history that has long been ignored and largely covered up.' And the toll would actually be much higher according to historians, adds the newspaper. The Washington Post says it has 'determined that more than 800 of these students were buried in or near cemeteries at the schools where they attended, underscoring that, as in many cases, the children's bodies were never returned to their families or tribes.' According to documents seen by the daily, 'The causes of death included infectious diseases, malnutrition and accidents.' Dozens of Native American students have died under suspicious circumstances, the article continues, 'and in some cases, documents show indications of abuse or mistreatment that likely led to the children's deaths.' The boarding schools 'were not schools' but 'prison camps, work camps,' Judi gaiashkibos, director of the Nebraska Commission on Native Americans and whose relatives were sent there, told the newspaper. The Joe Biden administration has implemented a series of measures to support Native American nations and improve relations with the federal state. In the United States, reservations now administered by Native Americans are predominantly poor, with high suicide and overdose rates. In neighboring Canada, where the same practice of residential schools for young indigenous people existed, the country has also opened its eyes in recent years to this dark page of history.	https://www.voanews.com/a/media-report-more-than-3-100-native-american-children-died-in-us-boarding-schools-/7910455.html	2024-12-22T12:59:09-08:00	
Sonic 3' bests 'Mufasa' at box office	New York — In the holiday season battle of big-budget family movies, Paramount Pictures' 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' sped past the Walt Disney Co.'s 'Mufasa: The Lion King' to take the top spot at the box office ahead of the lucrative Christmas corridor in theaters. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' debuted with $62 million in ticket sales over the weekend, according to studio estimates. With strong reviews (86% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) and a high score from audiences (an 'A' on CinemaScore), 'Sonic 3' is well positioned to be the top choice in cinemas during the busiest moviegoing period of the year. It was telling of some wider trends that 'Sonic 3' — made for $122 million — bested one of Disney's top properties. Videogame adaptations, once among the most derided movie genres, have emerged as one of the most dependable box office forces in recent years. The two previous 'Sonic' movies together grossed more $700 million worldwide and the third installment appears likely to do better than both of them. A fourth 'Sonic' movie is already in development. 'Mufasa,' however, was humbled in its opening weekend, with its $35 million in domestic ticket sales coming in notably shy of expectations. The photorealistic 'Lion King' prequel even opened wider than 'Sonic 3,' launching on 4,100 theaters and gobbling up most IMAX screens, compared with 3,761 locations for 'Sonic 3.' Though 'Mufasa's' reviews were poor (56% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes), audiences gave it an 'A-' CinemaScore. 'Sonic 3' nearly doubled the haul for 'Mufasa,' which cost more than $200 million to make. Disney could look to $87.2 million in international sales to help make up the difference. The third 'Sonic' will roll out in most overseas markets in the coming weeks. In director Jeff Fowler's 'Sonic 3,' Ben Schwartz returns as the voice of the hedgehog, alongside Tails the Fox (Colleen O'Shaughnessey), Knuckles the Echidna (Idris Elba) and Jim Carrey in scene-stealing dual roles as Dr. Robotnik and his grandfather. 'Moonlight' filmmaker Barry Jenkins directs 'Mufasa's' voice cast, including Aaron Pierre, Kelvin Harrison Jr., Donald Glover, Beyonce Knowles-Carter, Mads Mikkelsen and Blue Ivy Carter. It follows Jon Favreau's 2019 photorealistic 'The Lion King' remake, which made $1.66 billion globally despite mixed reviews. 'Mufasa' didn't come close to that film's huge $191 million opening weekend. 'We felt strongly that the marketplace could support both movies and we're certainly holding up our side of the bargain,' said Chris Aronson, distribution chief for Paramount. No major franchise movie is coming this Christmas. The most anticipated Dec. 25 release might be 'A Complete Unknown,' with Timothee Chalamet as Bob Dylan. That means 'Sonic 3' could be looking at several weeks in a row at No. 1. 'The family audience was 59% on 'Sonic 2.' This time it's 46%. That 13% drop reflects the time of year we're dealing with,' said Aronson. 'I think once the marketplace really cooks, 'Sonic' is going to be the dominant force.' Many of Disney's live-action adaptations – including 'Aladdin,' 'Beauty and the Beast' and 'Jungle Book' – have been big hits. Others, such as 'Dumbo,' 'Mulan' and 'The Little Mermaid,' have been less well received. More are on the way, including a new 'Snow White' in March, 'Lilo & Stitch' in May, and plans for 'Moana' and 'Tangled' to get the same live-action treatment. Despite 'Mufasa's' muted opening, Disney is still celebrating its strongest annual performance in years. The studio has accounted for more than $5 billion in ticket sales worldwide, including the year's top two hits: 'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool and Wolverine.' The animated 'Moana 2' could give Disney the top three movies of the year. In four weeks of release, it has collected $790.2 million globally, including $13.1 million in U.S. and Canadian theaters over this weekend. Though Christmas often sees some of the biggest releases of the year, movies released around Thanksgiving really drove the box office this season. That includes 'Moana 2' and Universal Pictures' 'Wicked,' which managed third place in its fifth weekend. 'Wicked,' the hit musical adaption starring Cynthia Erivo and Ariana Grande, added $13.5 million in North American theaters to push its domestic total to $383.9 million. Those films, among others, have led a Hollywood rebound in 2024. After a significant deficit earlier in the year, overall sales are drawing close to those of 2023. According to Comscore, the gap has narrowed to 4.4% behind last year's results. While that's still significantly less than pre-pandemic years, it's enough to flip the script on what once looked like a rough year for the movies. Family films like 'Inside Out 2,' 'Moana 2' and 'Sonic 3' have played a major role. Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore, noted animated movies have accounted for 26.5% of this year's box office. 'The box office year was saved by the family audience being drawn to the multiplex,' said Dergarabedian. 'Homestead,' the latest release from Christian-themed Angel Studios, the distributor of 'Sound of Freedom,' opened with $6.1 million. It follows a group of Doomsday preparers who take shelter in a self-sufficient compound after a nuclear attack in California. Brady Corbet's 'The Brutalist,' one of the year's top Oscar contenders, launched on four screens in New York and Los Angeles. Its $66,698 per-screen average was one of the highest of 2024. The post-World War II epic runs three-and-a-half hours, posing obvious theatrical challenges. A24 is trying to turn the film starring Adrien Brody and Guy Pearce into an arthouse event. It was nominated for seven Golden Globes. Final domestic box office figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $62 million. 2. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $35 million. 3. 'Wicked,' $13.5 million. 4. 'Moana 2,' $13.1 million. 5. 'Homestead,' $6.1 million. 6. 'Gladiator II,' $4.5 million. 7. 'Kraven the Hunter,' $3.1 million. 8. 'Red One,' $1.4 million. 9. 'Lord of the Rings: The War of the Rohirrim,' $1.3 million. 10. 'The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,' $825,000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sonic-3-bests-mufasa-at-box-office/7910444.html	2024-12-22T12:28:45-08:00	
Saudi Arabia announces resumption of embassy operations in Kabul	Riyadh , Saudi Arabia — Saudi Arabia announced on Sunday the resumption of operations of its diplomatic mission in the Afghan capital, Kabul, more than three years after withdrawing its diplomats from the country amid the chaos that accompanied the Taliban's rise to power. 'Based on the keenness of the government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to provide all services to the brotherly Afghan people, it has been decided to resume the activities of the Kingdom's mission in Kabul as of December 22, 2024,' the Saudi embassy in Kabul said on X. The Saudi foreign ministry did not immediately respond to AFP's questions about the level of Saudi representation in Kabul. Saudi Arabia announced on August 15, 2021 that it had withdrawn its diplomats from Kabul due to the 'unstable situation' following the Taliban's return to power following the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. In November 2021, Saudi Arabia announced the resumption of consular services in Afghanistan, where the Saudi Humanitarian Aid and Relief Center (KSRelief) is providing humanitarian aid. The Taliban government is not recognized by any country. Saudi Arabia is one of three countries, along with the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan, to recognize the former Taliban government, which was overthrown in the U.S. invasion in 2001.	https://www.voanews.com/a/saudi-arabia-announces-resumption-of-embassy-operations-in-kabul/7910445.html	2024-12-22T12:26:37-08:00

Colombia's ELN rebels announce Christmas truce	BOGOTA, Colombia — Colombia's largest remaining rebel group announced a unilateral truce on Sunday, to last until Jan. 3, the first since the previous ceasefire broke down in August. In a statement posted on X, the National Liberation Army said that it will halt attacks on the military as the nation celebrates Christmas and New Year's. Colombian President Gustavo Petro shared the truce announcement on his X account, with a message saying that 'the end of war, is the nation's goal for 2025.' The group, known in Spanish as the ELN, was founded in the 1960s by university students, priests and union leaders inspired by the Cuban revolution. It currently has 6,000 fighters in Colombia and Venezuela according to Ministry of Defense estimates, and finances itself through illegal mining, extortion rackets and the drug trade. The ELN has increased its influence in some rural areas of Colombia by stepping into a power vacuum left by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia after that group signed a peace deal with the Colombian government in 2016. Two years ago, the ELN began to stage peace talks of its own with the Petro administration, which resulted in a ceasefire that began in August of last year. But peace talks stalled due to disagreements over when the ELN would stop kidnapping and taxing civilians. ELN commanders were also angered by the government's move to set up separate negotiations with an ELN offshoot in the southwest of the country. The ceasefire broke down four months ago, and since then the ELN has stepped up its attacks on military targets and oil infrastructure along Colombia's border with Venezuela. The Petro administration has attempted to stage peace talks with several armed groups in rural pockets of the country, under a strategy known as total peace. ELN commanders have criticized the Petro administration for trying to cut deals with some of these groups, instead of persecuting them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/colombia-s-eln-rebels-announce-christmas-truce/7910383.html	2024-12-22T10:21:53-08:00	
Putin meets Slovak PM Fico at Kremlin	Moscow — Russian President Vladimir Putin held talks at the Kremlin on Sunday with Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, one of the few European leaders he has stayed friendly with since the eruption of hostilities with Ukraine, according to Russian television. 'Putin is currently holding talks in the Kremlin with Slovak Prime Minister Fico,' Russian TV journalist Pavel Zarubin, a Kremlin insider, posted on his Telegram channel, along with a short video showing the two leaders. The visit by Fico, whose country is both a NATO and European Union member, had not been previously announced. Kremlin spokesman Dmitri Peskov told Zarubin however that it had been arranged 'a few days ago.' Peskov did not give details of the talks but said it could be 'presumed' that supplies of Russian gas would be discussed. Ukraine announced this year that it would not renew a contract allowing the transit of Russian gas through its territory that runs out on December 31. Slovakia and Hungary, which rely on Russian gas, have raised concerns about the prospect of losing supplies. Fico ended military aid to Ukraine when he became prime minister again in October 2023, and like Hungarian counterpart Viktor Orban has called for peace talks. Fico announced in November that he would go to Moscow in May for ceremonies to mark the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-meets-slovak-pm-fico-at-kremlin-/7910378.html	2024-12-22T10:19:55-08:00	
Pakistan’s political climate shaken by pro-Khan tweets from Trump’s choice for special missions envoy	Islamabad — Richard Grenell, a close confidant of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, has garnered substantial media and political attention in Pakistan due to his persistent social media posts advocating for the release of the country’s former prime minister, Imran Khan. The situation escalated on November 26 when the Pakistani government unleashed a violent crackdown in Islamabad to disperse opposition protesters who were demanding Khan’s release. This prompted Grenell to express his support on the social media platform X, tweeting, 'Free Imran Khan!' Although his initial post received limited attention, it was amplified by Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf, or PTI, party and its supporters on December 15, when Trump appointed Grenell as his special envoy for global missions in the incoming administration. Pakistan’s prominent Geo News channel, often accused of serving as a mouthpiece for the country’s military establishment, responded to Grenell’s selection with a headline on X reading, 'Trump appoints homosexual Richard Grenell as special envoy.' In response, the U.S. envoy-designate reiterated his message by stating, 'I’ll say it again. Free Imran Khan,' and noted in a subsequent post that his previous tweet had garnered 10 million views. Grenell has held several prominent positions, including U.S. ambassador to Germany, special presidential envoy for Serbia and Kosovo peace negotiations, and acting director of national intelligence during the first Trump administration from 2017 to 2021. His pro-Khan tweets have led to speculation regarding their potential implications for Pakistan's political landscape. Commentators on Pakistani television talk shows have addressed Grenell’s tweets, with some dismissing his social media engagement as mere publicity-seeking endeavors while others cautioning that it could eventually influence the new administration’s interactions with Islamabad. Some critics in Pakistan even questioned the authenticity of his X account. Grenell promptly responded to the skepticism by tweeting, 'How do I even prove I’m real?' He issued his latest pro-Khan tweet on Saturday in response to concerns Congresswoman Elissa Slotkin expressed on X about the deadly opposition protests in the Pakistani capital last month. 'Pakistani authorities must protect citizens’ rights to free speech and peaceful assembly, hold violators accountable, and uphold Pakistan’s democracy,' Slotkin wrote. Khan, viewed as the most popular Pakistani politician, has been imprisoned since August 2023 on various charges, including corruption and treason. He contends that the legal proceedings against him are politically motivated attempts to prevent him from returning to power due to his vocal criticisms of military involvement in civilian governance. The coalition government led by Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, believed to have military backing, disputes these allegations, encouraging Khan to prove his innocence in court rather than leveling what it calls baseless charges. Khan and independent analysts maintain that his PTI party would have won a significant majority in the February 2024 parliamentary election if not for alleged electoral rigging facilitated by the military to pave the way for Sharif’s party to form the government. PTI candidates and supporters faced state-sponsored crackdowns leading up to the polls, forcing key party leaders and candidates into hiding and rounding up hundreds of others, which critics said effectively undermined their election campaign. During his tenure from 2018 to 2022, Khan and his government played a key role in facilitating peace talks between the then-Trump administration and Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan, ultimately contributing to the withdrawal of U.S. troops in August 2021. Khan issued a statement from prison through his X account following Trump’s election victory last month, expressing congratulations on behalf of himself and his party. 'President-Elect Trump will be good for Pak-US relations based on mutual respect for democracy & human rights. We hope he will push for peace, human rights, and democracy globally,' the former Pakistani leader stated. Khan’s critics, including the Sharif government, have criticized him and his party for seeking U.S. intervention in domestic politics, recalling his consistent opposition to any external interference in Pakistan’s internal affairs. The former prime minister was ousted through an opposition parliamentary no-confidence vote in April 2022. Khan rejected the vote as illegal, saying it was orchestrated by the Pakistani military at the behest of the United States, charges army officials and Washington denied.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-s-political-climate-shaken-by-pro-khan-tweets-from-trump-s-choice-for-special-missions-envoy-/7910337.html	2024-12-22T09:42:13-08:00	
Trump taps ex-Treasury official Miran as chair of Council of Economic Advisers	Washington — President-elect Donald Trump said on Sunday that Stephen Miran, a Treasury Department adviser in his first administration, would be the chair of his Council of Economic Advisers. The council advises the president on economic policy and is composed of three members, including the chair. The council assists in the preparation of an annual report that gives an overview of the country's economy, reviews federal policies and programs and makes economic policy recommendations. Earlier this year, Miran and economist Nouriel Roubini authored a hedge fund study that said the U.S. Treasury last year effectively provided economic stimulus by moderating long-dated bond sales. The study echoed suggestions by Republican lawmakers that the Treasury deliberately increased issuance of short-term Treasury bills to give the economy a 'sugar high' ahead of the November elections. The Treasury denied any such strategy. Miran, a senior strategist at Hudson Bay Capital, has also argued that fears over trade tariffs that Trump has threatened to impose after he takes office next month are overblown. Trade and economic experts have said such duties would raise prices and would effectively be a new tax on consumers. Last month, Trump tapped Kevin Hassett, who was a key economic adviser in his first term, to chair his National Economic Council, which helps set domestic and international economic policy. Hudson Bay Capital took a position in Trump's social media firm Trump Media & Technology in the first quarter of this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-taps-ex-treasury-official-miran-as-chair-of-council-of-economic-advisers-/7910314.html	2024-12-22T09:04:36-08:00	
Thousands protest in Serbian capital over fatal train station accident	Belgrade — Thousands protested Sunday in Serbia's capital Belgrade to demand that leaders take responsibility for the collapse of a train station roof that killed 15 people last month. For over seven weeks, the Serbian government has been under pressure from nation-wide demonstrations following the deaths in the northern city of Novi Sad, with many protesters accusing authorities of corruption and inadequate oversight. Sunday's protest organized by university students started with 15-minutes of silence as tribute to the 15 victims in the incident. The demonstration occupied Slavija square, a key roundabout, snarling traffic in the city center. 'The state is children's property' and 'Protests are exams' read some of the banners of the demonstrators who have demanded that the prime minister and the Novi Sad mayor resign, and that those found responsible be prosecuted. Farmers, actors and other citizens from across Serbia have come to support the students. Students have also called for legal proceedings to be dropped against demonstrators, and for the prosecution of assailants who have attacked the protesters. In a bid to dilute the anger and calm the protests, the authorities over the past weeks have promised various subsidies for young people. On Friday, the government announced plans to close schools early for winter holidays. Students continued to protest, saying their demands have only been partially met. Fourteen people, aged between six and 74, were killed on November 1 when the roof collapsed after major renovation works on the station. A 15th victim died in hospital weeks later.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-protest-in-serbian-capital-over-fatal-train-station-accident/7910317.html	2024-12-22T09:01:31-08:00	
At least 9 dead in Brazil plane crash, authorities say	Sao Paulo, Brazil — At least nine people died when a small plane crashed on Sunday morning in Gramado, in southern Brazil, authorities said, slamming into a commercial area of the tourist city. The aircraft crashed into the chimney of a building, struck the second floor of a house and then 'fell on a furniture store,' the Rio Grande do Sul state security secretariat said in a statement. An inn was also damaged, it added. 'There are nine deaths confirmed by the civil defense, and there are no survivors of the plane,' Cleber dos Santos Lima, director of the Interior Police Department of the state civil police, told AFP. Authorities have not yet confirmed how many passengers and crew were traveling on the plane, a Piper Cheyenne 400 turboprop, but earlier said they thought it was carrying 10 people. At least 15 people were taken to the hospital, most for smoke inhalation from the fire caused by the crash. The plane had taken off from the municipality of Canela, another tourist town in Rio Grande do Sul. Gramado is a popular tourist city in Brazil, with a significant influx of visitors during the Christmas season.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-9-dead-in-brazil-plane-crash-authorities-say/7910302.html	2024-12-22T08:51:13-08:00

Italy's Meloni says security threat posed by Russia is far-reaching	SAARISELKA, Finland — Russia poses a bigger threat to European Union security than just defense as Moscow can use illegal immigration and other issues to undermine the bloc, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said on Sunday. Finland hosted the leaders of Italy, Sweden and Greece, as well as the EU foreign affairs chief, in its northern Lapland region at the weekend to discuss security in the Nordic region and the Mediterranean, as well as migration challenges in southern Europe. 'We have to understand the threat is much wider than we imagine,' Meloni, who leads a conservative government, told a press conference when asked about Russia. The danger to EU security from Russia or from elsewhere would not stop once the Ukraine conflict ended and the EU must be prepared for that, she said. 'It's about our democracy, it's about influencing our public opinion, it's about what happens in Africa, it's about raw materials, it's about the instrumentalization of migration. We need to know it's a very wide idea of security,' Meloni said. She urged the EU to do more to protect its borders and not let Russia or any 'criminal organization' steer the flows of illegal migrants. Some EU members, including Finland and Estonia, have accused Russia of allowing illegal migrants from the Middle East and elsewhere to enter EU states via Russia without proper checks, undermining the EU's security. Moscow has denied Russia was deliberately pushing illegal migrants into the EU. Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo said securing his country's 1,340-km border with Russia was 'an existential' question for Finland and for other EU members and NATO allies. Meloni said the EU had been wrong in dealing with the issue of immigration over the years simply in terms of how to share the burden. 'Tackling the issue of illegal immigration solely as a solidarity-based debate was a mistake,' she said. 'The result is that we have been unable to protect our borders. ... We want to defend our external borders and we will not allow Russia or criminal organizations to undermine our security.' While NATO remained 'the cornerstone' of EU security, the bloc had to tackle wider challenges, Meloni said. 'Security also means critical infrastructure, it means artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, raw materials, supply chains. It means a new and more effective foreign and cooperation policy, it means migration,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-meloni-says-security-threat-posed-by-russia-is-far-reaching-/7910119.html	2024-12-22T04:07:02-08:00	
China takes steps against Canada institutions, individuals over Uyghurs, Tibet	BEIJING — China said on Sunday it was taking countermeasures against two Canadian institutions and 20 people involved in human rights issues concerning the Uyghurs and Tibet. The measures, which took effect on Saturday, include asset freezes and bans on entry and the targets include Canada's Uyghur Rights Advocacy Project and the Canada-Tibet Committee, China's foreign ministry announced on its website. Rights groups accuse Beijing of widespread abuses of Uyghurs, a mainly Muslim ethnic minority that numbers around 10 million in the western region of Xinjiang, including the mass use of forced labor in camps. Beijing denies any abuses. China seized control of Tibet in 1950 in what it describes as a 'peaceful liberation' from feudalistic serfdom. International human rights groups and exiles, however, have routinely condemned what they call China's oppressive rule in Tibetan areas. For the two institutions, China said it is freezing their 'movable property, immovable property and other types of property within the territory of China.' It is freezing the property in China of 15 people in the Uyghur institution and five on the Tibet committee, banning them from entering China, including Hong Kong and Macao. Calls to the Canadian Embassy in Beijing went unanswered. Reuters did not receive an immediate response from the rights groups or Global Affairs Canada.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-takes-steps-against-canada-institutions-individuals-over-uyghurs-tibet-/7910112.html	2024-12-22T03:46:55-08:00	
German police say Christmas market attack killed 4 women and a boy	MAGDEBURG, GERMANY — More details emerged Sunday about those killed when a man drove a car at speed through a Christmas market in Germany, while mourners continued to place flowers and other tributes at the site of the attack. Police in Magdeburg, the central city where the attack took place on Friday evening, said that the victims were four women ranging in age from 45 to 75, as well as a 9-year-old boy they had spoken of a day earlier. Authorities said 200 people were injured, including 41 in serious condition. They were being treated in multiple hospitals in Magdeburg, which is about 130 kilometers west of Berlin, and beyond. Authorities have identified the suspect in the Magdeburg attack as a Saudi doctor who arrived in Germany in 2006 and had received permanent residency. Saturday evening, the suspect was brought before a judge, who ordered behind closed doors that he be kept in custody pending a possible indictment. Police haven't publicly named the suspect, but several German news outlets identified him as Taleb A., withholding his last name in line with privacy laws, and reported that he was a specialist in psychiatry and psychotherapy. Describing himself as a former Muslim, the suspect appears to have been an active user of the social media platform X, sharing dozens of tweets and retweets daily focusing on anti-Islam themes, criticizing the religion and congratulating Muslims who had left the faith. He also accused German authorities of failing to do enough to combat what he referred to as the 'Islamification of Europe.' The horror triggered by yet another act of mass violence in Germany make it likely that migration will remain a key issue as German heads toward an early election on Feb. 23. The far-right Alternative for Germany party had already been polling strongly amid a societal backlash against the large numbers of refugees and migrants who have arrived in Germany over the past decade. Right-wing figures from across Europe have criticized German authorities for having allowed high levels of migration in the past and for what they see as security failures now. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who is known for a strong anti-migration position going back years, used the attack in Germany to lash out at the European Union's migration policies. At an annual news conference in Budapest on Saturday, Orban insisted that 'there is no doubt that there is a link between the changed world in Western Europe, the migration that flows there, especially illegal migration and terrorist acts.' Orban vowed to 'fight back' against the EU migration policies 'because Brussels wants Magdeburg to happen to Hungary, too.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-police-say-christmas-market-attack-killed-4-women-and-a-boy/7910099.html	2024-12-22T02:24:10-08:00	
Israeli strikes across Gaza kill at least 16, Palestinian officials say	DEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA STRIP — Israeli strikes across the Gaza Strip overnight and into Sunday killed at least 16 people, Palestinian medical officials said. A strike on a school housing displaced people in Gaza City killed at least six people, including four children, according to the Civil Defense, first responders affiliated with the Hamas-run government. The Israeli military said it carried out a precise strike on Hamas militants sheltering there. A strike on a home in the central city of Deir al-Balah late Saturday killed at least eight people, according to the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, which received the bodies. A further two people were killed in a strike in the southern city of Khan Younis on Sunday, just after midnight, according to the nearby Nasser Hospital. There was no immediate comment from the military on those strikes. Israel has continued to carry out daily strikes in Gaza more than 14 months into the war with Hamas. It says it only targets militants, whom it accuses of hiding among civilians, but the bombings frequently kill women and children. The war began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel in a surprise attack, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Around 100 hostages are still in Gaza, at least a third of whom are believed to be dead. Hamas has been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Israel's subsequent bombardment and ground invasion have killed over 45,000 people in Gaza, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between fighters and civilians in its count. The offensive has caused widespread destruction and displaced some 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands are packed into squalid tent camps along the coast as the cold, wet winter sets in. Israel has been carrying out a major operation in northern Gaza since early October, battling Hamas in the most isolated and heavily damaged part of the territory. Tens of thousands have fled as the military has ordered a complete evacuation and allowed almost no humanitarian aid to enter. The Israeli military body overseeing civilian affairs in Gaza, known as COGAT, said it had facilitated the evacuation of over 100 patients, caregivers and others from the Kamal Adwan Hospital and the Awda Hospital in the far north, which have struggled to function. COGAT said it had also facilitated the delivery of 5,000 liters of fuel and food packages to the hospitals. Israeli authorities also allowed Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the leader of the Catholic Church in the Holy Land, to enter Gaza and celebrate a pre-Christmas Mass with members of the territory's small Christian community. The Latin Patriarchate confirmed the visit in a brief statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-across-gaza-kill-at-least-16-palestinian-officials-say/7910081.html	2024-12-22T01:03:52-08:00	
What Assad's fall has revealed about Syria's trade in stimulant drug Captagon	BEIRUT — Since the fall of former Syrian President Bashar Assad, industrial-scale manufacturing facilities of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon have been uncovered around the country, which experts say fed a $10 billion annual global trade in the highly addictive drug. Among the locations used for manufacturing the drug were the Mazzeh air base in Damascus, a car-trading company in Latakia and a factory that once made snack chips in the Damascus suburb of Douma. Government forces seized the factory in 2018. 'Assad's collaborators controlled this place. After the regime fell ... I came here and found it on fire,' Firas al-Toot, the original owner of the factory, told The Associated Press. 'They came at night and lit the drugs on fire but couldn't burn everything.' 'From here, Captagon pills emerged to kill our people,' Abu Zihab, an activist with Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the main group now ruling the country, said while his group gave journalists access to the site. Syria's nearly 14-year-old civil war fragmented the country, crumbled the economy and created fertile ground for the production of the drug. Militias, warlords and the Assad government transformed the production of Captagon from a small-scale operation run by criminal groups into a billion-dollar industrial revenue stream. The recent ousting of Assad has disrupted these networks and has given a closer look at its operations — revealing the workings of a war economy that sustained Assad's power over Syria. Experts say the change in Syria might create an opportunity to dismantle the Captagon industry. How did Syria build its Captagon empire? Captagon was first developed in Germany in the 1960s as a prescription stimulant for conditions like narcolepsy. It was later outlawed due to heart issues and its addictive properties. Its amphetamine-like effects made it popular in the Middle East among both elites and fighters, as it enhanced focus and reduced fatigue. Assad's government recognized an opportunity in the cheaply manufactured drug amid Syria's economic turmoil and the heavy sanctions imposed on it. Captagon is produced through a simple chemical process that involves mixing amphetamine derivatives with excipients to form tablets, typically in makeshift labs. The Captagon trade began industrializing around 2018-19 as the Assad regime — and other armed groups in Syria -- invested in production facilities, warehouses and trafficking networks. This allowed Syria to emerge as the largest producer of Captagon globally, with some production also occurring in Lebanon. Most seized consignments of Captagon originated from Syria, according to data by the New Lines Captagon Trade Project, an initiative of the New Lines Institute think tank. Evidence of the Assad regime's sponsorship of the Captagon industry is overwhelming, the report published in May said. The Security Office of the 4th Armored Division of the Syrian Arab Army, headed by Bashar al-Assad's brother Maher oversaw operations and created a coordinated production system, the report added. Where and how was Captagon smuggled? Captagon was smuggled across borders in trucks and cargo shipments. Sometimes the drugs were concealed in food, electronics and construction materials to evade detection. The primary smuggling routes were Syria's porous borders with Lebanon, Jordan and Iraq, from which the drug was distributed throughout the region. The leading markets are wealthy Gulf countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. In Lebanon, the Captagon trade has flourished, particularly near the Syrian border and in the Bekaa Valley. Lebanese authorities struggled to curb the flow of Captagon from Syria, which analysts say was facilitated by the Hezbollah militant group. Following the discovery of crates of fruit meticulously packed with bundles of the drug hidden among pomegranates and oranges, Saudi Arabia and the UAE implemented bans on Lebanese agricultural products. Captagon has also found its way as far as Southeast Asia and parts of Europe. How much revenue did it produce for the Assad regime? The annual global trade in Captagon had an estimated value of $10 billion, with the ousted Assad family's annual profit reaching around $2.4 billion, according to Caroline Rose, director of the New York-based New Lines Institute Captagon Trade Project. 'Seeing the uncovering of so many industrial-scale facilities affiliated with the regime was shocking but not surprising. There was extensive evidence linking key regime-aligned cronies and Assad family members to the trade,' said Rose, whose organization tracks all publicly recorded Captagon seizures and lab raids. The discovery of the facilities, she said, confirmed 'the concrete relationship between Captagon and the former regime.' The exact number of factories in Syria remains unclear, but experts and HTS members estimate that there are likely hundreds spread throughout the country. Captagon as a narco-diplomatic tool While neighboring countries have long sought to curb drug trafficking, their influence over Assad was limited. Saudi Arabia imposed strict penalties for Captagon trafficking and enhanced border security, collaborating with other Gulf states to monitor smuggling routes. However, these efforts faced challenges from the complex networks operating across Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. Captagon provided Assad's government with leverage to end his political isolation. In recent years, as several Arab states reestablished ties with him, stopping the Captagon trade was a key demand in talks aimed at normalizing relations. In May 2023, Syria was readmitted to the Arab League, where it had been suspended since 2011 due to Assad's brutal crackdown on protesters. Syria pledged to clamp down on smuggling, leading to the formation of a regional security coordination committee. Shortly after the summit and in a possible sign of behind-the-scenes trade-offs, Jordan intensified surveillance along the Syrian border. Activists and experts attributed airstrikes on a known drug kingpin's home and on a suspected Captagon factory near Daraa to Jordan, likely with Assad's consent. The future of Captagon in post-Assad Syria Assad has turned Syria into 'the largest Captagon factory in the world,' HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa stated in a victory speech at Damascus's Umayyad Mosque on Dec. 8. 'Today, Syria is being cleansed, thanks to the grace of Almighty God.' While Assad and his circle may have been the primary beneficiaries, there is also evidence that Syrian opposition groups were involved in drug smuggling. Rebel groups, local militias and organized crime networks manufactured and smuggled the drug to finance their operations, analysts say. 'Likely, we will see a short-term supply reduction in the trade, with a decline in the size and frequency of seizures as industrial-scale production is largely halted. However, criminal actors are innovative, likely seeking out new locations to engage in production and smuggling, particularly as demand levels remain stable,' Rose said. They may also 'seek out alternative illicit trades to engage in instead,' she said. In addition to dismantling the Captagon trade, the country's transitional government should 'establish programs for economic development that will incentivize Syrians to participate in the country's formal, licit economic sphere,' Rose said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-assad-s-fall-has-revealed-about-syria-s-trade-in-stimulant-drug-captagon-/7909379.html	2024-12-21T23:52:39-08:00	
It's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in US	Drivers and airline passengers without reindeer and sleighs better make a dash for it: it's beginning to look like another record for holiday travel in the U.S. The auto club AAA predicts that more than 119 million people will travel at least 80 kilometers from home between Saturday and New Year's Day, which would top the previous holiday-season high set in 2019. The two weekends on either side of Christmas look to be some of the most crowded times on the road and at airports. Trade group Airlines for America also foresees record travel, saying it expected U.S. airlines to carry 54 million passengers during a 19-day period that started Thursday and ends Jan. 6. The number would represent a 6% increase over last year. What will be the busiest travel days? Airlines expect to have their busiest days on Friday and Sunday, and on Dec. 26, Dec. 27 and Dec. 29. Flight traffic is expected to be light on both Christmas Day and New Year's Day. The slowest U.S. air-travel day this year — by a wide margin — was Thanksgiving Day. The Transportation Security Administration expects to screen 40 million passengers over the holidays and through Jan. 2. About 90% of Americans traveling far from home over the holidays will be in cars, according to AAA. 'Airline travel is just really high right now, but most people do drive to their destinations, and that is true for every holiday,' AAA spokesperson Aixa Diaz said. Gasoline prices are similar to last year. The nationwide average Thursday was about $.99 a liter, down from $1 a year ago, according to AAA. Charging an electric vehicle averages just under 35 cents per per kilowatt hour, but varies by state. Transportation-data firm INRIX says travel times on the nation's highways could be up to 30% longer than normal over the holidays, with Sunday expected to see the heaviest traffic. Boston, New York City, Seattle and Washington, D.C., are the metropolitan areas primed for the greatest delays, according to the company. Weather and other wildcards Because the holiday travel period lasts weeks, airports and airlines typically have smaller peak days than they do during the rush around Thanksgiving, but the grind of one hectic day followed by another takes a toll on flight crews. And any hiccups — a winter storm or a computer outage — can snowball into massive disruptions. That is how Southwest Airlines stranded 2 million travelers in December 2022, and Delta Air Lines suffered a smaller but significant meltdown after a worldwide technology outage in July caused by a faulty software update from cybersecurity company CrowdStrike. Many flights during the holidays are sold out, which makes cancellations even more disruptive than during slower periods. That is especially true for smaller budget airlines that have fewer flights and fewer options for rebooking passengers. Only the largest airlines, including American, Delta and United, have 'interline agreements' that let them put stranded customers on another carrier's flights. This will be the first holiday season since a Transportation Department rule took effect that requires airlines to give customers an automatic cash refund for a canceled or significantly delayed flight. Most air travelers were already eligible for refunds, but they often had to request them. Passengers still can ask to get rebooked, which is often a better option than a refund during peak travel periods. That's because finding a last-minute flight on another airline yourself tends to be very expensive. 'When they rebook you, they will pay for the fare difference. If my flight to visit grandma that I booked six months ago for $200 gets canceled, and I turn around and book a flight four hours from now for $400, I have to pay that difference,' said Sally French, a travel expert at consumer-affairs company Nerdwallet. People traveling on budget airlines with fewer flights and no partnerships with other carriers may face a difficult choice in the event of a canceled flight. 'They will put you on the next outgoing Spirit or Frontier flight, but that could be a while from now. Sometimes waiting three days for that next flight is not going to work for you,' and paying more to rebook on a big airline might be worthwhile, French said. Some airlines are taking advantage of a provision in the new Transportation Department rule that defined a significant delay as three hours for a domestic flight and six hours for an international flight. According to Brett Snyder, who runs the Cranky Flyer website, airlines that previously issued refunds for shorter delays — Delta, United and JetBlue, for example — are now using the government standard. Delayed flights increase the risk that bags will get lost. Passengers who get separated from their bags should report it to the airline and ask what the airline will cover. Links to the customer-service plans of major U.S. airlines are at the bottom of this page. Planning ahead for 2025 Airline fares were up 4.7% in November, compared with a year earlier, according to U.S. government figures. But early 2025 is a good time to start planning next year's trips, including for spring breaks and summer vacations. 'Because travel is so popular, you're not going to find anything that feels very rock-bottom, but January and February are great times to plan for March, April and May,' Laura Motta, an editor at travel-guide publisher Lonely Planet, said. 'If you want to go to Paris in the spring, you need to be thinking about that in January.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/it-s-beginning-to-look-like-another-record-for-holiday-travel-in-us-/7909375.html	2024-12-21T23:52:02-08:00	
Survey: Most US teens are abstaining from drinking, smoking and marijuana	NEW YORK — Teen drug use hasn't rebounded from its drop during the early years of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the results from a large annual national survey released Tuesday. About two-thirds of 12th graders this year said they hadn't used alcohol, marijuana, cigarettes or e-cigarettes in the previous 30 days. That's the largest proportion abstaining since the annual survey started measuring abstinence in 2017. Among 10th graders, 80% said they hadn't used any of those substances recently, another record. Among eighth graders, 90% didn't use any of them, the same as was reported in the previous survey. The only significant increase occurred in nicotine pouches. About 6% of 12th graders saying they'd used them in the previous year, up from about 3% in 2023. Whether that has the makings of a new public health problem is unclear. The University of Michigan's Richard Miech, who leads the survey, said: 'It's hard to know if we're seeing the start of something, or not.' The federally funded Monitoring the Future survey has been operating since 1975. This year's findings are based on responses from about 24,000 students in grades eight, 10 and 12 in schools across the country. The survey is 'one of the best, if not the best' source of national data for substance use by teens, said Noah Kreski, a Columbia University researcher who has studied teen drug use. Early in the pandemic, students across the country were told not to go to schools and to avoid parties or other gatherings. They were at home, under parents' supervision. Alcohol and drug use of all kinds dropped because experimentation tends to occur with friends, spurred by peer pressure, experts say. As lockdowns ended, 'I think everyone expected at least a partial rebound,' Miech said. Even before the pandemic, there were longstanding declines in teen cigarette smoking, drinking and use of several types of drugs. Experts theorized that kids were staying home and communicating on smartphones rather than hanging out in groups, where they sometimes tried illicit substances. But marijuana use wasn't falling before the pandemic. And vaping was on the upswing. It was only during the pandemic that those two saw enduring declines, too. Some experts wonder if the pandemic lockdowns had a deeper influence. Miech noted that a lot of teens who experiment with e-cigarettes or drugs start in the 9th grade, sometimes because older adolescents are doing it. But the kids who were 9th graders during the lockdowns never picked up the habit, and never had the opportunity to turn into negative influencers of their younger classmates, he said. 'The pandemic stopped the cycle of new kids coming in and being recruited to drug use,' Miech said. Mental health may also be a factor. There were increased reports of depression and anxiety in kids after the pandemic began. Depression is often associated with substance use, but some people with depression and anxiety are very wary of messing with drugs, said Dr. Duncan Clark, a University of Pittsburgh psychiatrist who researches substance use in kids. 'Some teens with anxiety are worried about the effects of substances. They may also be socially inhibited and have less opportunity to use drugs,' Clark said. 'It's a complicated relationship.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/survey-most-us-teens-are-abstaining-from-drinking-smoking-and-marijuana/7908093.html	2024-12-21T23:50:44-08:00	
Once overlooked, Brazilian caramel-colored stray dogs having a major moment	SAO PAULO — For decades, they have scrounged for food on streets across the country — undesired, abandoned and overlooked. But today, the caramel-colored mutts of Brazil are having a major moment. The 'vira-lata caramelo' (literally: caramel trashcan-tipper) is being exalted in memes, videos, petitions, an upcoming Netflix film, a Carnival parade and draft legislation to honor it as part of Brazilian culture. Caramelos' newfound cachet speaks to the value of resilience in Brazil — a melting pot of 213 million people known for weathering hard knocks with a smile — and inverts its supposed 'mongrel complex.' A scene from Netflix's Caramelo shot in October featured a beige puppy sitting beside a river in Sao Paulo watching picture-perfect families pass with their impeccable purebreds — a golden retriever, a miniature collie and a Doberman. At the director of photography's signal, a delivery boy cycled past and the plucky mutt gave chase, following the scent of pizza and seeking a way to get by. 'The caramelo ended up becoming the great symbol of Brazil, a symbol for the people,' Diego Freitas, the film's director and co-writer, said after the day's shooting. 'Netflix was sensitive to what's happening with the zeitgeist. The caramelo is the spirit of our time.' Caramelos escape from the internet The caramelo craze started online around 2019. People posted the tongue-in-cheek phrase, 'This represents Brazil more than soccer or samba,' along with photos of distinctively Brazilian phenomena, including caramelos galore. Social media accounts paid tribute to the caramelos' antics: One invaded a dance show and relieved itself on stage; another played dead while receiving chest compressions for a CPR training video. Online retailers started hawking caramelo-shaped throw pillows. A petition to replace the macaw on Brazil's 10-reais ($1.65) bill garnered 50,000 signatures in 2019. 'The caramelo has established itself as a landmark of the Brazilian people, being well loved and received in all states of the country, being an excellent representative of our culture,' it proclaimed. 'Therefore it deserves mention on our currency.' The next year, another petition to emblazon the medium-sized dog on the 200-reais note received triple the support. Many cite kindness as the caramelos' secret charm, but more often say it's that they're savvy survivors. Case in point is a caramelo in the northeastern city Joao Pessoa. Last year, Khelson Silva, 59, left the gym with a friend and found the stray waiting. It took Silva's friend's finger gingerly between its teeth and led them for three blocks. 'He got to my building, walked straight into the garage, went up the elevator and right into the house,' said Silva, who learned this caramelo, now named Persistent José, had attempted similar gambits before. 'It was him who chose us. He knew where we lived.' The 'crazy mixture' of Brazil Writer Nelson Rodrigues coined the now-infamous term 'mongrel complex' after the national soccer team's humiliating World Cup defeat in 1950, aiming to encapsulate what he perceived as Brazil's sense of inferiority compared to other nations. Today, many see Brazil's diverse roots — immigrants, enslaved Africans and Indigenous people — as a source of pride. Tina Castro, an English teacher in Rio de Janeiro, equates owning a caramelo with loving the 'crazy mixture' of Brazil and its people. 'It comes from a marginal place, like Brazil. It has a history of survival and marginalization,' said Castro, 32. 'We value the caramelo in the way we value our country, as it is.' 'Caramelos will dominate the world!' has become a jokey rallying cry online, and foreign allies are lending a hand. After touring Brazil in November, singer Bruno Mars posed with a caramelo in his viral farewell video. Staff of the British mission to Brazil overwhelmingly voted in July to christen their new digital mascot, a Welsh Corgi, 'Lord Caramelo.' 'The caramelo, a national icon' The budget for Netflix's Caramelo is part of 1 billion reais ($164 million) spent from 2023-24 on Brazilian productions to capture eyeballs in one of the world's biggest video streaming markets. Netflix hasn't set a release date. 'The movie is a big bet for Netflix, a superproduction,' Netflix Brasil's press office told The Associated Press. 'It's the first Brazilian film with a dog as a protagonist, and it couldn't be any other than the caramelo, a national icon.' Others catapulting the caramelo into the spotlight include Rio's Sao Clemente samba school. At its three-story workshop downtown on Nov. 28, seamstresses churned out strips of sheer yellow fabric for dozens of towering caramelo costumes. Each will feature a giant foam head in the school's 2025 Carnival parade, whose theme is animal abandonment and abuse. 'It's our starlet,' gushed workshop director Roberto Gomes. 'The caramelo is the beautiful, likeable little dog — not the purebred. It's the cutie, that dog that's always funny, always in our hearts.' A few blocks away, Lt. Col. Sidnei Robson Pazini says Brazilians are merely rediscovering long-lost devotion. He directs the Rio military police's museum and archive, and says the 'most iconic, most emblematic' piece — more than the muskets, cannon or painting worth almost $1 million — is a taxidermied caramelo that's about 150 years old. The dog often visited a Rio police battalion for food — earning the name Bruto — then joined officers shipping off to war in Paraguay, despite efforts to stop him boarding. Bruto alerted troops to approaching enemies, signaled where soldiers needed rescue and, after surviving a gunshot, returned to Rio a hero. When he died, police took up a collection to have him stuffed, with a silver collar bearing the words 'Constancy, Love and Fidelity.' Street dogs still find succor inside police battalions. One in Rio adopted a caramelo in 2018 and gave him the rank of corporal. At a ceremony in July, he was promoted to sergeant. Famous but homeless, caramelos still need help Amid this caramelo hype, one might think Brazilians would be jostling to adopt their own. But volunteers at two shelters told the AP they still get passed over for smaller, fluffier or whiter dogs. The Indefesos shelter in Rio had 217 dogs on Dec. 12 — about half caramelos. One clambers over a 6-foot wall to welcome visitors, his favorite ball in his mouth. Whenever Indefesos receives a litter with caramelos, volunteers scramble to post Instagram photos. Caramelo puppies are inevitably picked last. 'It's absurd. We rush because we know that animal, when it grows up, will never have the chance for a home,' said Rosana Guerra, the nonprofit's president. 'They end up staying, waiting for adoption that never comes.' In the Netflix film, the stray scampers into the hectic life of a career-driven chef and helps him find meaning in the present. Freitas, the director, said he aims for it to touch Brazilians' hearts and transform caramelo affinity into action. The puppy that pursued the delivery boy that gray October day had been found in a box beside a highway with its nine siblings. Four play the young version of the film's 1-year-old star that was also a stray. Since filming wrapped Nov. 26, six of the film's once-homeless canines were adopted by crew members and others. 'It's a story that I hope is worthy of the dogs, because they are incredible,' Freitas said, with his own caramelo — the film's inspiration — at his feet. 'They change our lives.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/once-overlooked-brazilian-caramel-colored-stray-dogs-having-a-major-moment/7906739.html	2024-12-21T23:48:51-08:00	
Nuclear bunker sales increase, despite expert warnings	When Bernard Jones Jr. and his wife, Doris, built their dream home, they didn't hold back. A grotto swimming pool with a waterfall for hot summer days. A home theater for cozy winter nights. A fruit orchard to harvest in fall. And a vast underground bunker in case disaster strikes. 'The world's not becoming a safer place,' he said. 'We wanted to be prepared.' Under a nondescript metal hatch near the private basketball court, there's a hidden staircase that leads down into rooms with beds for about 25 people, bathrooms and two kitchens, all backed by a self-sufficient energy source. With water, electricity, clean air and food, they felt ready for any disaster, even a nuclear blast, at their bucolic home in California's Inland Empire. 'If there was a nuclear strike, would you rather go into the living room or go into a bunker? If you had one, you'd go there too,' said Jones, who said he reluctantly sold the home two years ago. Global security leaders are warning nuclear threats are growing as weapons spending surged to $91.4 billion last year. At the same time, private bunker sales are on the rise globally, from small metal boxes to crawl inside to extravagant underground mansions. Critics warn these bunkers create a false perception that a nuclear war is survivable. They argue that people planning to live through an atomic blast aren't focusing on the real and current dangers posed by nuclear threats, and the critical need to stop the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Meanwhile, government disaster experts say bunkers aren't necessary. A Federal Emergency Management Agency 100-page guide on responding to a nuclear detonation focuses on having the public get inside and stay inside, ideally in a basement and away from outside walls for at least a day. Those existing spaces can provide protection from radioactive fallout, says FEMA. But increasingly, buyers say bunkers offer a sense of security. The market for U.S. bomb and fallout shelters is forecast to grow from $137 million last year to $175 million by 2030, according to a market research report from BlueWeave Consulting. The report says major growth factors include 'the rising threat of nuclear or terrorist attacks or civil unrest.' Building bunkers 'People are uneasy and they want a safe place to put their family. And they have this attitude that it's better to have it and not need it then to need it and not have it,' said Atlas Survival Shelters CEO Ron Hubbard, amid showers of sparks and the loud buzz of welding at his bunker factory, which he says is the world's largest, in Sulphur Springs, Texas. Hubbard said COVID lockdowns, Russia's invasion of Ukraine and the outbreak of the Israel-Hamas war have driven sales. On Nov. 21, in the hours after Russia's first-ever use of an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile to attack Ukraine, Hubbard said his phone rang nonstop. Four callers ended up buying bunkers in one day, he said, and more ended up ordering doors and other parts for shelters they were already building. Hubbard said his bunkers are built for all disasters. 'They're good for anything from a tornado to a hurricane to nuclear fallout, to a pandemic to even a volcano erupting,' he said, sweeping his arms toward a massive warehouse where more than 50 different bunkers were under construction. A loaded shotgun at arm's length and metal mesh window shields to block Molotov cocktails nearby, Hubbard said he started his company after building his own bunker about 10 years ago. He says callers ask about prices — $20,000 to multimillions, averaging $500,000 — and installations — they can go just about anywhere. He said most days he sells at least one bunker. Under Hubbard's doomsday scenario, global tensions could lead to World War III, a situation he is prepared to live through. 'The good news about nuclear warfare,' he said, 'if there ever was any, that it's very survivable if you're not killed in the initial blast.' He's not wrong, say U.S. government disaster preparedness experts. 'You want to go to your most robust building' 'Look, this fallout exposure is entirely preventable because it is something that happens after the detonation,' said Brooke Buddemeier a radiation safety specialist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, where the U.S. government designs nuclear weapons. Buddemeier and his colleagues are tasked with evaluating what could happen after an attack and how best to survive. 'There's going to be a fairly obvious nuclear explosion event, a large cloud. So just getting inside, away from where those particles fall, can keep you and your family safe.' Buddemeier and others in the U.S. government are trying to get Americans — who decades ago hid under desks during nuclear attack drills — educated about how to respond. After a deadly and deafening blast, a bright flash and a mushroom cloud, it will take about 15 minutes for the radioactive fallout to arrive for those a mile or more away from ground zero, said Michael Dillon, a scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. 'It's going to literally be sand falling on your head, and you're going to want to get out of that situation. You want to go to your most robust building,' he said. In their models, they estimate people may need to stay inside for a day or two before evacuating. The government's efforts to educate the public were reinvigorated after a false alarm missile alert in Hawaii in 2018 caused widespread panic. The emergency alert, which was sent to cellphones statewide just before 8:10 a.m., said: 'BALLISTIC MISSILE THREAT INBOUND TO HAWAII. SEEK IMMEDIATE SHELTER. THIS IS NOT A DRILL.' For the next 40 minutes there were traffic jams, workers running into and out of buildings, families huddling in their bathrooms, students gathering in gyms, drivers blocking tunnels, all in an attempt to seek shelter, without any clear idea of what 'seek immediate shelter' actually meant. Today the federal government offers a guide to prepare citizens for a nuclear attack that advises people to find a basement or the center of a large building and stay there, possibly for a few days, until they get word about where to go next. 'Gently brush your pet's coat to remove any fallout particles' it says, adding that the 15-minute delay between bomb and fallout allows 'enough time for you to be able to prevent significant radiation exposure.' Jeffrey Schlegelmilch, who directs the FEMA-backed National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University, said 'the scenarios of a nuclear detonation are not all or nothing.' If a small number of weapons detonate rather than all-out war, he said, sheltering inside a large building to avoid the fallout could save lives. 'Underground bunkers aren't going to protect people' Nonproliferation advocates bristle at the bunkers, shelters or any suggestion that a nuclear war is survivable. 'Bunkers are, in fact, not a tool to survive a nuclear war, but a tool to allow a population to psychologically endure the possibility of a nuclear war,' said Alicia Sanders-Zakre at the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons. Sanders-Zakre called radiation the 'uniquely horrific aspect of nuclear weapons,' and noted that even surviving the fallout doesn't prevent long-lasting, intergenerational health crises. 'Ultimately, the only solution to protect populations from nuclear war is to eliminate nuclear weapons.' Researcher Sam Lair at the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies says U.S. leaders stopped talking about bunkers decades ago. 'The political costs incurred by causing people to think about shelters again is not worth it to leaders because it forces people to think about what they would do after nuclear war,' he said. 'That's something that very, very few people want to think about. This makes people feel vulnerable.' Lair said building bunkers seems futile, even if they work in the short term. 'Even if a nuclear exchange is perhaps more survivable than many people think, I think the aftermath will be uglier than many people think as well,' he said. 'The fundamental wrenching that it would do to our way of life would be profound.' That's been a serious concern of Massachusetts Congressman James McGovern for almost 50 years. 'If we ever get to a point where there's all out nuclear war, underground bunkers aren't going to protect people,' he said. 'Instead, we ought to be investing our resources and our energy trying to talk about a nuclear weapons freeze, initially.' Next, he said, 'we should work for the day when we get rid of all nuclear weapons.' Year after year he introduces legislation pushing for nonproliferation, but looking out his office window at the Capitol, he said he's disappointed by the lack of debate over what will be a $1 trillion expenditure to build and modernize the U.S. arsenal. 'The stakes, if a nuclear weapon is ever used, is that millions and millions and millions of people will die. It really is shocking that we have world leaders who talk casually about utilizing nuclear weapons. I mean, it would be catastrophic, not just for those that are involved in an exchange of nuclear weapons, but for the entire world.' McGovern pushed back against FEMA's efforts to prepare the public for a nuclear attack by advising people to take shelter. 'What a stupid thing to say that we all just need to know where to hide and where to avoid the most impacts of nuclear radiation. I mean, really, that's chilling when you hear people try to rationalize nuclear war that way,' he said. Nuclear war was far from a couple's mind when they went house-hunting in Southern California a few years ago. They wanted a home to settle down and raise their family, and they needed extra garage space. They spotted an online ad for a home with at least eight parking spots. On the basketball court, there was a metal hatch. Beneath it was a bunker. This was Jones' former home, which Jones said he put up for sale for family reasons. The husband, who spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns about his family's privacy, went ahead and bought Jones' home, bunker and all. They aren't particularly worried about nuclear war, and haven't spent a night in the bunker, but they have stored food and medical supplies down there. 'We have told some of our friends, if something goes crazy and gets bad, get over here as fast as possible,' the husband said. 'It does provide a sense of security.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nuclear-bunker-sales-increase-despite-expert-warnings-/7906658.html	2024-12-21T23:48:20-08:00	
US says 2 Navy pilots shot down over Red Sea in apparent 'friendly fire' incident	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Two U.S. Navy pilots were shot down Sunday over the Red Sea in an apparent 'friendly fire' incident, the U.S military said, marking the most serious incident to threaten troops in over a year of America targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels. Both pilots were recovered alive after ejecting from their stricken aircraft, with one suffering minor injuries. But the shootdown underlines just how dangerous the Red Sea corridor has become over the ongoing attacks on shipping by the Iranian-backed Houthis despite U.S. and European military coalitions patrolling the area. The U.S. military had conducted airstrikes targeting Yemen's Houthi rebels at the time, though the U.S. military's Central Command did not elaborate on what their mission was and did not immediately respond to questions from The Associated Press. The F/A-18 shot down had just flown off the deck of the USS Harry S. Truman aircraft carrier, Central Command said. On Dec. 15, Central Command acknowledged the Truman had entered the Mideast, but hadn't specified that the carrier and its battle group was in the Red Sea. 'The guided missile cruiser USS Gettysburg, which is part of the USS Harry S. Truman Carrier Strike Group, mistakenly fired on and hit the F/A-18,' Central Command said in a statement. From the military's description, the aircraft shot down was a two-seat F/A-18 Super Hornet fighter jet assigned to the 'Red Rippers' of Strike Fighter Squadron 11 out of Naval Air Station Oceana, Virginia. It wasn't immediately clear how the Gettysburg could mistake an F/A-18 for an enemy aircraft or missile, particularly as ships in a battle group remain linked by both radar and radio communication. However, Central Command said that warships and aircraft earlier shot down multiple Houthi drones and an anti-ship cruise missile launched by the rebels. Incoming hostile fire from the Houthis has given sailors just seconds to make decisions in the past. Since the Truman's arrival, the U.S. has stepped up its airstrikes targeting the Houthis and their missile fire into the Red Sea and the surrounding area. However, the presence of an American warship group may spark renewed attacks from the rebels, like what the USS Dwight D. Eisenhower saw earlier this year. That deployment marked what the Navy described as its most intense combat since World War II. On Saturday night and early Sunday, U.S. warplanes conducted airstrikes that shook Sanaa, the capital of Yemen that the Houthis have held since 2014. Central Command described the strikes as targeting a 'missile storage facility' and a 'command-and-control facility,' without elaborating. Houthi-controlled media reported strikes in both Sanaa and around the port city of Hodeida, without offering any casualty or damage information. In Sanaa, strikes appeared particularly targeted at a mountainside known to be home to military installations. The Houthis did not acknowledge the aircraft being shot down in the Red Sea. The Houthis have targeted about 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023 after Hamas' surprise attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw 250 others taken hostage. Israel's grinding offensive in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, local health officials say. The tally doesn't distinguish between combatants and civilians. The Houthis have seized one vessel and sunk two in a campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by separate U.S.- and European-led coalitions in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have also included Western military vessels. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The Houthis also have increasingly targeted Israel itself with drones and missiles, resulting in retaliatory Israeli airstrikes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-2-navy-pilots-shot-down-over-red-sea-in-apparent-friendly-fire-incident/7910062.html	2024-12-21T20:16:30-08:00	
Trump threatens to take back control of Panama Canal	WASHINGTON — Incoming U.S. President Donald Trump on Saturday slammed what he called unfair fees for U.S. ships passing through the Panama Canal and threatened to demand control of the waterway be returned to Washington. He also hinted at China's growing influence around the canal, a worrying trend for American interests as U.S. businesses depend on the channel to move goods between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. 'Our Navy and Commerce have been treated in a very unfair and injudicious way. The fees being charged by Panama are ridiculous,' he said in a post on his Truth Social platform. 'This complete 'rip-off' of our Country will immediately stop.' The Panama Canal, which was completed by the United States in 1914, was returned to the Central American country under a 1977 deal signed by Democratic President Jimmy Carter. Panama took full control in 1999. 'It was solely for Panama to manage, not China, or anyone else,' Trump said. 'We would and will NEVER let it fall into the wrong hands!' He continued that if Panama could not ensure 'the secure, efficient and reliable operation' of the channel, 'then we will demand that the Panama Canal be returned to us, in full, and without question.' Authorities in Panama did not immediately react to Trump's post. Although he does not officially take office until next month, Trump has nevertheless been flexing his political influence in the waning days of President Joe Biden's administration. The real estate mogul boasted on the campaign trail that as an entrepreneur, he was uniquely positioned to fight for U.S. business interests. An estimated 5% of global maritime traffic passes through the Panama Canal, which allows ships traveling between Asia and the U.S. East Coast to avoid the long, hazardous route around the southern tip of South America. The main users of the passage are the United States, China, Japan and South Korea. The Panama Canal Authority reported in October that the waterway had earned record revenues of nearly $5 billion in the last fiscal year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-threatens-to-take-back-control-of-panama-canal/7910058.html	2024-12-21T19:35:35-08:00	
France supports Ethiopia’s quest for sea access through discussion	ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — French President Emmanuel Macron said his country supports Ethiopia’s quest for access to the sea through discussion and respecting international laws and neighboring countries. Macron spoke on Saturday after a one-day visit to Addis Ababa, where he held bilateral talks with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. During a news conference, Macron welcomed the Ankara Declaration reached by the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia and the Federal Republic of Somalia on Dec. 11. In the declaration, brokered by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, 'the leaders of Somalia and Ethiopia reaffirmed their respect and commitment to one another’s sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity, as well as the principles enshrined in international law, the Charter of the United Nations and the Constitutive Act of the African Union.' The two sides also agreed to start 'technical negotiations' by February on details of Ethiopia's sea access, and that those negotiations would be facilitated by Turkey and be 'concluded and signed' within four months. The breakthrough came after an almost yearlong dispute between Somalia and Ethiopia that began Jan. 1 when Somaliland’s former president, Muse Bihi Abdi, and Ethiopia’s Abiy signed a memorandum of understanding to lease 20 kilometers of Somaliland seafront to Ethiopia for 50 years, in return for diplomatic recognition. The Somali government rejected the deal and accused Ethiopia of a 'blatant violation' of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. On Saturday, President Macron expressed his readiness to support Ethiopia's legitimate quest for sea access. He said France is interested in playing its part in facilitating ways in which sea access can be achieved responsibly through talks, in a way that recognizes international laws and respects neighboring countries. Abiy said the two leaders have thoroughly discussed his country's pursuit of peaceful access to the Red Sea. He said the French president accepted Ethiopia's request for support in its quest for sea access through international law, peacefully and diplomatically. 'The ties between our two nations continue to be strengthened and I look forward to our discussions during his stay in Ethiopia,' Abiy said of Macron in a post on X. Macron also touched on a domestic issue in Ethiopia: the implementation of the Pretoria agreement signed in November 2022 by Ethiopia’s federal government and the Tigray People's Liberation Front that ended a deadly two-year war. Macron said France is keen to support those affected by the conflict and would like to see the rule of law upheld through the transitional justice process. Abiy and Macron also toured Ethiopia’s newly renovated National Palace in Addis Ababa, the former home of emperor Haile Selassie that was restored with the help of 25 million euros provided by the French Development Agency. The Ethiopian government plans to open it to the public as a museum. French architects and other professionals have also participated in the renovation process, Macron said. According to Macron, France is also providing funding and technical support for ongoing renovation at the Rock-Hewn Churches at Lalibela in the Amhara region. The site was added to UNESCO’s World Heritage list in 1978. It’s the second time Macron has visited Ethiopia in six years. Before traveling to Ethiopia, Macron visited the cyclone-hit Indian Ocean island of Mayotte, where residents demanded more support in light of the cyclone that devastated the island and claimed dozens of lives. Macron also stopped by Djibouti, which hosts the largest French military base in the continent, where he dined with his troops. After meeting with President Ismail Omar Guelleh, Macron described relations with Djibouti as a solid, deep-rooted and forward-looking partnership.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-supports-ethiopia-s-quest-for-sea-access-through-discussion/7910045.html	2024-12-21T18:54:02-08:00	
Former Syrian soldiers seek amnesty, return to civilian life	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Hundreds of former Syrian soldiers on Saturday reported to the country's new rulers for the first time since Bashar al-Assad was ousted to answer questions about whether they may have been involved in crimes against civilians in exchange for a promised amnesty and return to civilian life. The former soldiers trooped to what used to be the head office in Damascus of Assad's Baath party that had ruled Syria for six decades. They were met with interrogators, former insurgents who stormed Damascus on December 8, and given a list of questions and a registration number. They were free to leave. Some members of the defunct military and security services waiting outside the building told The Associated Press that they had joined Assad's forces because it meant a stable monthly income and free medical care. The fall of Assad took many by surprise as tens of thousands of soldiers and members of security services failed to stop the advancing insurgents. Now in control of the country, and Assad in exile in Russia, the new authorities are investigating atrocities by Assad's forces, mass graves and an array of prisons run by the military, intelligence and security agencies notorious for systematic torture, mass executions and brutal conditions. Lieutenant Colonel Walid Abd Rabbo, who works with the new Interior Ministry, said the army has been dissolved and the interim government has not decided yet whether those 'whose hands are not tainted in blood' can apply to join the military again. The new leaders have vowed to punish those responsible for crimes against Syrians under Assad. Several locations for the interrogation and registration of former soldiers were opened in other parts of Syria in recent days. 'Today I am coming for the reconciliation and don't know what will happen next,' said Abdul-Rahman Ali, 43, who last served in the northern city of Aleppo until it was captured by insurgents in early December. 'We received orders to leave everything and withdraw,' he said. 'I dropped my weapon and put on civilian clothes,' he said, adding that he walked 14 hours until he reached the central town of Salamiyeh, from where he took a bus to Damascus. Ali, who was making about $45 a month in Assad's army, said he would serve his country again. Inside the building, men stood in short lines in front of four rooms where interrogators asked each a list of questions on a paper. 'I see regret in their eyes,' an interrogator told AP as he questioned a soldier who now works at a shawarma restaurant in the Damascus suburb of Harasta. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not allowed to talk to the media. The interrogator asked the soldier where his rifle was, and the man responded that he left it at the base where he served. He then asked for and was handed the soldier's military ID. 'He has become a civilian,' the interrogator said, adding that the authorities will carry out their own investigation before questioning the same soldier again within weeks to make sure there are no changes in the answers that he gave on Saturday. The interrogator said after nearly two hours that he had quizzed 20 soldiers, and the numbers are expected to increase in the coming days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-syrian-soldiers-seek-amnesty-return-to-civilian-life-/7910051.html	2024-12-21T18:26:50-08:00	
Syria's new rulers appoint defense, foreign ministers	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Syria's new rulers have appointed Murhaf Abu Qasra, a leading figure in the insurgency that toppled Bashar al-Assad, as defense minister in the interim government, an official source said on Saturday. Abu Qasra, who is also known by the nom de guerre Abu Hassan 600, is a senior figure in the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham group that led the campaign that ousted Assad this month. He led numerous military operations during Syria's revolution, the source said. Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa discussed 'the form of the military institution in the new Syria' during a meeting with armed factions on Saturday, state news agency SANA reported. Abu Qasra during the meeting sat next to Sharaa, also known by the nom de guerre Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, photos published by SANA showed. Prime Minister Mohammed al-Bashir said this week that the defense ministry would be restructured using former rebel factions and officers who defected from Assad's army. Bashir, who formerly led an HTS-affiliated administration in the northwestern province of Idlib, has said he will lead a three-month transitional government. The new administration has not declared plans for what will happen after that. Earlier on Saturday, the ruling General Command named Asaad Hassan al-Shibani as foreign minister, SANA said. A source in the new administration told Reuters that this step 'comes in response to the aspirations of the Syrian people to establish international relations that bring peace and stability.' Shibani, a 37-year-old graduate of Damascus University, previously led the political department of the rebels' Idlib government, the General Command said. Sharaa's group was part of al-Qaida until he broke ties in 2016. It had been confined to Idlib for years until going on the offensive in late November, sweeping through the cities of western Syria and into Damascus as the army melted away. Sharaa has met with a number of international envoys this week. He has said his primary focus is on reconstruction and achieving economic development and that he is not interested in engaging in any new conflicts. Syrian rebels seized control of Damascus on December 8, forcing Assad to flee after more than 13 years of civil war and ending his family's decades-long rule. Washington designated Sharaa a terrorist in 2013, saying al-Qaida in Iraq had tasked him with overthrowing Assad's rule and establishing Islamic law in Syria. U.S. officials said on Friday that Washington would remove a $10 million bounty on his head. The war has killed hundreds of thousands of people, caused one of the biggest refugee crises of modern times and left cities bombed to rubble and the economy hollowed out by global sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-s-new-rulers-appoint-defense-foreign-ministers-/7910040.html	2024-12-21T17:34:15-08:00	
Trump taps 'Apprentice' producer as special envoy to United Kingdom	WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. — Mark Burnett, the power producer who helped reintroduce Donald Trump to a national television audience with The Apprentice, is being tapped by the president-elect as special envoy to the United Kingdom in his upcoming administration. 'With a distinguished career in television production and business, Mark brings a unique blend of diplomatic acumen and international recognition to this important role,' Trump announced Saturday. Burnett, who was born in London, helped produce hits like Survivor and The Voice, but is perhaps best known for teaming up with Trump for The Apprentice, which first aired on NBC in 2004. Trump had been well-known in real estate and pop culture circles for decades. But the show helped again make him a household name. Trump severed ties with NBC in 2015, the same year he launched his first White House run. The selection of Burnett continues Trump's trend of filling out his incoming administration with people who have high-profile backgrounds in television or politics, or both, including his choice to be defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, a former co-host of Fox & Friends Weekend, and ex-television doctor and unsuccessful Senate candidate in Pennsylvania, Mehmet Oz. Trump's first campaign in 2016 was rocked by allegations about his conduct on The Apprentice and other appearances during his association with NBC, notably in footage in which he said he could sexually assault women and get away with it because he was a 'star.' Almost a decade after he left his reality TV role, Trump's television career remains central to his biography and political rise. The show presented Trump Tower to tens of millions of people as a symbol of power and success before Trump launched his first campaign from the building's lobby. 'Mark is known for creating and producing some of the biggest shows in Television History,' Trump wrote in his statement on Burnett, listing many of his biggest hits including, 'most notably, The Apprentice' and noting that Burnett 'has won 13 Emmy Awards!' Special envoys are usually picked by presidents for the world's traditional hotspots, including the Middle East, where Trump has said he'd like Steven Witkoff to fill the role. The United Kingdom, which has long enjoyed a 'special relationship' with the U.S. that makes it one of Washington's strongest global allies, is not typically a candidate for such posts. But Trump has announced a series of special envoy positions to several top loyalists ahead of his inauguration on Jan. 20, including his former ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell who he chose as envoy for special missions. That announcement joined previous ones including Adam Boehler as special presidential envoy for hostage affairs, and Keith Kellogg to serve as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. The president-elect said Burnett 'will work to enhance diplomatic relations, focusing on areas of mutual interest, including trade, investment opportunities, and cultural exchanges.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-taps-apprentice-producer-as-special-envoy-to-united-kingdom/7910042.html	2024-12-21T17:19:33-08:00	
Stolen base king Rickey Henderson dies at 65	OAKLAND, Calif. — Hall of Famer Rickey Henderson, who shattered stolen base records and redefined baseball's leadoff position, has died. He was 65. Henderson died on Friday. The Athletics said Saturday they were 'shocked and heartbroken by his passing,' but did not specify a cause of death. Known as baseball's 'Man of Steal,' Henderson had a lengthy list of accolades and accomplishments over his 25-year career — an MVP, 10 All-Star selections, two World Series titles and a Gold Glove award. But it was stealing bases where Henderson made his name and dominated the sport like no other. He broke through with 100 steals in his first full season in the majors in 1980, topping Ty Cobb's AL single-season record with the Oakland Athletics. He barely slowed, playing for nine franchises over the next two decades. He broke Lou Brock's single-season record of 118 by stealing 130 bases in 1982 and led the league in steals for seven straight seasons and 12 overall. He broke Brock's career record when he stole his 939th base on May 1, 1991, for Oakland. He famously pulled third base out of the ground and showed it off to the adoring crowd before giving a speech that he capped by saying: 'Lou Brock was a great base stealer, but today I am the greatest of all time.' Henderson finished his career with 1,406 steals, a 468-steal edge over Brock. Henderson said in September he would have had many more steals in his career and in the record-breaking 1982 season if rules introduced in 2023 to limit pickoff throws and increase the size of bases had overlapped with his career. 'If I was playing today, I would get 162, right now, without a doubt,' he said. Henderson’s accomplishment that record-breaking day in 1991 was slightly overshadowed that night when Nolan Ryan threw his record seventh career no-hitter. Henderson had been Ryan’s 5,000th career strikeout victim, which led him to say, 'If you haven’t been struck out by Nolan Ryan, you’re nobody.' That was clearly not the case for Henderson. He is also the career leader in runs scored with 2,295 and in leadoff home runs with 81, ranks second to Barry Bonds with 2,190 walks and is fourth in games played (3,081) and plate appearances (13,346). He finished his career with 3,055 hits over 25 seasons spent with Oakland, the New York Yankees, Toronto, San Diego, Anaheim, the New York Mets, Seattle, Boston and the Los Angeles Dodgers. He fittingly finished his career with the Dodgers at age 44 in 2003 by scoring a run in his final play on a major league field. Henderson is the third prominent baseball Hall of Famer with ties to the Bay Area who died this year, following the deaths in June of former Giants stars Willie Mays and Orlando Cepeda. Henderson was the rare position player who batted from the right side and threw with his left arm — but then again, everything about Henderson was unique. He batted out of an extreme crouch, making for a tighter strike zone that contributed to his high walk total. He struck fear in opponents with his aggressive leads off first, his fingers twitching between his legs as he eyed the pitcher and the next base. Born on Christmas Day in 1958 in Chicago in the back of his parents' Chevy, Henderson grew up in Oakland and developed into a star athlete. He played baseball, basketball and football at Oakland Tech High School and was a highly sought-after football recruit who could have played tailback at Southern California, where he could have played eventually with football Hall of Famer Marcus Allen. But Henderson said his mother loved baseball and thought it would be the safer career in a decision that proved to be prescient. 'She didn’t want her baby to get hurt,' Henderson told the San Francisco Chronicle in 2019. 'I was mad, but she was smart. Overall, with the career longevity and the success I had, she made the right decision. Some of the players in football now have short careers and they can barely move around when they’re done.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/stolen-base-king-rickey-henderson-dies-at-65/7910038.html	2024-12-21T17:11:21-08:00	
Quake strikes near battered Vanuatu; no major damage reported	SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA — A magnitude 6.1 earthquake rattled buildings on Vanuatu's main island early Sunday but did not appear to have caused major damage, just days after a massive, deadly quake wreaked havoc on the Pacific archipelago. The nation's most populous island, Efate, is still reeling from the 7.3-magnitude quake that struck Tuesday. It killed 12 people as it toppled concrete buildings in the capital, Port Vila, and set off landslides. The quake on Sunday occurred at a depth of 40 kilometers and was located about 30 km west of the capital. Unlike the earlier quake, no tsunami alerts were triggered when it struck at 2:30 a.m. local time. Port Vila businessman Michael Thompson told AFP the quake woke up his family. 'It gave a better bit of a shake, and the windows rattled a little bit, it would have caused houses to rattle,' he said. 'I'd describe this one as one of the bigger aftershocks, and we've had a fair few of them now,' he added. Thompson said there was no sign of further damage in his immediate vicinity. Mobile networks remained knocked out from earlier in the week, making outside contact with Vanuatu difficult. In addition to disrupting communications, the first quake damaged water supplies and stopped operations at the capital's main shipping port. The South Pacific nation declared a seven-day state of emergency and a nighttime curfew following the first quake. It announced on Saturday that it would begin to allow commercial flights in an effort to restart its vital tourism industry, which accounts for about a third of the economy. On Friday, rescuers said they had expanded their search for trapped survivors to 'numerous places of collapse' beyond the capital. Australia and New Zealand this week dispatched more than 100 people, along with rescue gear, dogs and aid supplies, to help hunt for trapped survivors and make emergency repairs. There were 'several major collapse sites where buildings are fully pancaked,' Australia's rescue team leader Douglas May said in a video update on Friday. 'We're now starting to spread out to see whether there's further people trapped and further damage. And we've found numerous places of collapse east and west out of the city.' More than 1,000 people were displaced as a result of the first quake, many now with other households or in evacuation centers, the latest United Nations report said, citing Vanuatu disaster management officials. Thompson said power had been restored to his home on Saturday but said many others were still waiting. 'We're hearing a lot of the major businesses are still down, supermarkets are trying to open back up,' he said. Vanuatu, an archipelago of about 320,000 inhabitants, sits in the Pacific's quake-prone Ring of Fire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/strong-quake-strikes-off-battered-vanuatu-no-major-damage-reported-/7910033.html	2024-12-21T16:57:02-08:00	
Albania to shut down TikTok for 1 year, says platform promotes violence among children	TIRANA, ALBANIA — Albania's prime minister said Saturday the government will shut down the video service TikTok for one year, blaming it for inciting violence and bullying, especially among children. Albanian authorities held 1,300 meetings with teachers and parents following the stabbing death of a teenager in mid-November by another teen after a quarrel that started on TikTok. Prime Minister Edi Rama, speaking at a meeting with teachers and parents, said TikTok 'would be fully closed for all. ... There will be no TikTok in the Republic of Albania.' Rama said the shutdown would begin sometime next year. It was not immediately clear if TikTok has a representative in Albania. In an email response Saturday to a request for comment, TikTok asked for 'urgent clarity from the Albanian government' on the case of the stabbed teenager. The company said it had 'found no evidence that the perpetrator or victim had TikTok accounts, and multiple reports have in fact confirmed videos leading up to this incident were being posted on another platform, not TikTok.' Albanian children comprise the largest group of TikTok users in the country, according to domestic researchers. There has been increasing concern from Albanian parents after reports of children taking knives and other objects to school to use in quarrels or cases of bullying promoted by stories they see on TikTok. TikTok's operations in China, where its parent company is based, are different, 'promoting how to better study, how to preserve nature ... and so on,' according to Rama. Albania is too small a country to impose on TikTok a change of its algorithm so that it does not promote 'the reproduction of the unending hell of the language of hatred, violence, bullying and so on,' Rama's office wrote in an email response to The Associated Press' request for comment. Rama's office said that in China TikTok 'prevents children from being sucked into this abyss.' Authorities have set up a series of protective measures at schools, starting with an increased police presence, training programs and closer cooperation with parents. Rama said Albania would follow how the company and other countries react to the one-year shutdown before deciding whether to allow the company to resume operations in Albania. Not everyone agreed with Rama's decision to close TikTok. 'The dictatorial decision to close the social media platform TikTok ... is a grave act against freedom of speech and democracy,' said Ina Zhupa, a lawmaker of the main opposition Democratic Party. 'It is a pure electoral act and abuse of power to suppress freedoms.' Albania holds parliamentary elections next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/albania-to-shut-down-tiktok-for-1-year-says-platform-promotes-violence-among-children-/7910029.html	2024-12-21T16:29:15-08:00	
Pope describes Israeli airstrikes of Gaza as 'cruelty'	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis on Saturday again condemned Israeli airstrikes in Gaza, a day after an Israeli government minister publicly denounced the pontiff for suggesting the global community should study whether the military offensive there constitutes a genocide of the Palestinian people. Francis opened his annual Christmas address to the Catholic cardinals who lead the Vatican's various departments with what appeared to be a reference to Israeli airstrikes on Friday that killed at least 25 Palestinians in Gaza. 'Yesterday, children were bombed,' the pope said. 'This is cruelty. This is not war. I wanted to say this because it touches the heart.' The pope, as the leader of the 1.4-billion-member Roman Catholic Church, is usually careful about taking sides in conflicts, but he has recently been more outspoken about Israel's military campaign against Palestinian militant group Hamas, which has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. In book excerpts published last month, the pontiff said some international experts said that 'what is happening in Gaza has the characteristics of a genocide.' Israeli Minister of Diaspora Affairs Amichai Chikli criticized those comments in an unusual open letter published by Italian newspaper Il Foglio on Friday. Chikli said the pope's remarks amounted to a 'trivialization' of the term genocide. On Saturday, Francis also said that the Catholic bishop of Jerusalem, known as a patriarch, had tried to enter the Gaza Strip on Friday to visit Catholics there, but was denied entry. The patriarch's office told Reuters it was not able to comment on the pope's remarks about the patriarch being denied entry. The Israeli military said on Saturday the patriarch's entry had been approved, and he would enter Gaza on Sunday, barring any major security issues. Aid from the patriarch's office entered last week, the military said. Israel allows clerics to enter Gaza and 'works in cooperation with the Christian community to make it easier for the Christian population that remains in the Gaza Strip — including coordinating its removal from the Gaza Strip to a third country,' a statement from the military said. The war began when Hamas-led Palestinian militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking more than 250 hostages back to Gaza, according to Israeli authorities. Israel's retaliatory campaign, which it says is aimed at eliminating Hamas, has killed more than 45,000 people, mostly civilians, according to authorities in the Hamas-run Gaza Strip. The campaign has displaced nearly the entire population and left much of the enclave in ruins. Israel says that at least a third of the dead have been militants and says it tries to avoid harm to civilians, but that it is battling militants who it accuses of embedding among the population in dense urban areas. Hamas rejects this accusation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-describes-israeli-airstrikes-of-gaza-as-cruelty-/7909858.html	2024-12-21T15:50:48-08:00	
More than 20 civilians killed in central Mali village attacks	BAMAKO, MALI — Suspected Islamic militants killed more than 20 people in a string of attacks on villages in central Mali's insurgency-hit Mopti region on Friday, two local sources said. The unidentified assailants struck during the day and into the evening, ransacking and burning six villages in the Bandiagara area, the sources said on Saturday, speaking on condition of anonymity. One of the sources said the assailants had come in large numbers on motorcycles and attacked a village, where they killed everyone and destroyed everything. There was no immediate comment from the ruling military junta. The West African nation is battling armed groups with links to al-Qaida and Islamic State, which took root in its arid north following a Tuareg separatist rebellion in 2012. Militants have since spread to other countries in the Sahel region south of the Sahara, seizing territory, killing thousands of people, and uprooting millions in the process.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-20-civilians-killed-in-central-mali-village-attacks/7909857.html	2024-12-21T15:26:51-08:00	
US military strikes Houthi targets in Yemen's capital	CAIRO — The U.S. military said it conducted precision airstrikes on Saturday against a missile storage facility and a command-and-control facility operated by Iran-backed Houthis in Yemen's capital, Sanaa. In a statement, the U.S. military's Central Command said the strikes aimed to 'disrupt and degrade Houthi operations, such as attacks against U.S. Navy warships and merchant vessels in the Southern Red Sea, Bab al-Mandeb, and Gulf of Aden.' The U.S. military also said it struck multiple Houthi one-way drones and an anti-ship cruise missile over the Red Sea. Saturday's strike followed a similar attack last week by U.S. aircraft against a command-and-control facility operated by the Houthis, which control much of Yemen. On Thursday, Israel launched strikes against ports and energy infrastructure in Houthi-held parts of Yemen and threatened more attacks against the group, which has launched hundreds of missiles at Israel over the past year. The Iran-backed group in Yemen has been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea for more than a year to try to enforce a naval blockade on Israel, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel's year-long war in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-military-strikes-houthi-targets-in-yemen-s-capital-/7909854.html	2024-12-21T15:11:07-08:00	
Venezuela releases journalist detained during post-election protests	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Venezuelan authorities released a journalist accused of terrorism and arrested in the aftermath of President Nicolas Maduro's disputed July reelection, the country's press union announced Saturday. Ana Carolina Guaita, arrested on August 2, is a reporter for La Patilla, an outlet that is often critical of the government. 'Ana was imprisoned for more than four months' in La Guaira, a coastal city north of the capital, Caracas, the National Union of Press Workers said in a post on social media. 'She was accused of terrorism, incitement to hatred and obstruction of public roads,' the union said. Before her arrest, Guaita had covered the toppling of a statue of late president Hugo Chavez, whose legacy Maduro claims as Chavez's heir, during post-election protests. Demonstrations across the country erupted after Maduro was proclaimed the winner of the July 28 election, despite results published by the opposition appearing to show their candidate won by a landslide. The protests left 27 dead, 200 injured and more than 2,400 under arrest. Only a handful of countries, including key Venezuela ally Russia, have recognized Maduro's reelection to a third six-year term. Guaita's release came hours after authorities announced the release of 200 detainees. According to the government's count, 733 people have been released, though the Foro Penal human rights group says the true number is lower.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-releases-journalist-detained-during-post-election-protests-/7909833.html	2024-12-21T14:03:18-08:00	
Airports reopen following Ukrainian drone attack on Russia's Kazan	MOSCOW — The airport in the Russian city of Kazan reopened on Saturday after temporarily closing earlier in the day following a Ukrainian drone attack, Russia's aviation watchdog said. Russian state news agencies reported the drone attack on a residential complex and other areas in Kazan, some 800 kilometers east of Moscow. The Defense Ministry said the city had been attacked by three waves of drones between 7:40 a.m. and 9:20 a.m. (0440 and 0620 GMT). It said three drones were destroyed by air defense systems and three others by electronic warfare systems. There were no casualties reported, agencies said, citing local authorities. The mayor of Kazan said on Telegram that all planned mass events in the city would be canceled over the weekend and that authorities would offer temporary accommodation to evacuees. The Baza Telegram channel, which is close to Russia's security services, published unverified video footage showing an aerial object crashing into a high-rise building, producing a large fireball. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova condemned the attack, saying Ukraine was 'taking out its impotent anger for real military defeats on the peaceful population of Russia.' Airports in Izhevsk, a smaller city northeast of Kazan, and Saratov, some 650 kilometers south of Kazan, had also temporarily halted flight arrivals and departures, Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said via Telegram. Restrictions at the airports were later lifted, Rosaviatsia said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/airports-reopen-following-ukrainian-drone-attack-on-russia-s-kazan/7909817.html	2024-12-21T13:35:47-08:00	
Senate review of Supreme Court ethics finds more luxury trips	WASHINGTON — A nearly two-year investigation by Democratic senators of Supreme Court ethics details more luxury travel by Justice Clarence Thomas and urges Congress to establish a way to enforce a new code of conduct. Any movement on the issue appears unlikely as Republicans prepare to take control of the Senate in January, underscoring the hurdles in imposing restrictions on a separate branch of government even as public confidence in the court has fallen to record lows. The 93-page report released Saturday by the Democratic majority of the Senate Judiciary Committee found additional travel taken in 2021 by Thomas but not reported on his annual financial disclosure form: a private jet flight to New York's Adirondacks in July and jet and yacht trip to New York City sponsored by billionaire Harlan Crow in October, one of more than two dozen times detailed in the report that Thomas took luxury travel and gifts from wealthy benefactors. The court adopted its first code of ethics in 2023, but it leaves compliance to each of the nine justices. 'The highest court in the land can't have the lowest ethical standards,' the committee chairman, Illinois Senator Dick Durbin, said in a statement. He has long called for an enforceable code of ethics. Republicans protested the subpoenas authorized for Crow and others as part of the investigation. No Republicans signed on to the final report, and no formal report from them was expected. Attorney Mark Paoletta, a longtime friend of Thomas who has been tapped for the incoming Trump administration, said the report was aimed at conservatives whose rulings Democrats disagreed with. 'This entire investigation was never about 'ethics' but about trying to undermine the Supreme Court,' Paoletta said in a statement posted on X. The court did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Thomas has said he was not required to disclose the trips that he and his wife, Ginni, took with Crow because the big donor is a close friend of the family and disclosure of that type of travel was not previously required. The new ethics code does explicitly require it, and Thomas has since reported some earlier travel. Crow has maintained that he has never spoken with his friend about pending matters before the court. The report traces back to Justice Antonin Scalia, saying he 'established the practice' of accepting undisclosed gifts and hundreds of trips over his decades on the bench. The late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsberg and retired Justice Stephen Breyer also took subsided trips but disclosed them on their annual forms, it said. The investigation found that Thomas has accepted gifts and travel from wealthy benefactors worth more than $4.75 million by some estimates since his 1991 confirmation and failed to disclose much of it. 'The number, value, and extravagance of the gifts accepted by Justice Thomas have no comparison in modern American history,' according to the report. It also detailed a 2008 luxury trip to Alaska taken by Justice Samuel Alito. He has said he was exempted from disclosing the trip under previous ethical rules. Alito also declined calls to withdraw from cases involving Donald Trump or the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol after flags associated with the riot were seen flying at two of Alito's homes. Alito said the flags were raised by his wife. Thomas has ignored calls to step aside from cases involving Trump, too. Ginni Thomas supported Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election that the Republican lost to Democrat Joe Biden. The report also pointed to scrutiny of Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who, aided by her staff, has advanced sales of her books through college visits over the past decade. Justices have also heard cases involving their book publishers or involving companies in which justices owned stock. Biden has been the most prominent Democrat calling for a binding code of conduct. Justice Elena Kagan has publicly backed adopting an enforcement mechanism, though some ethics experts have said it could be legally tricky. Justice Neil Gorsuch recently cited the code when he recused himself from an environmental case. He had been facing calls to step aside because the outcome could stand to benefit a Colorado billionaire whom Gorsuch represented before becoming a judge. The report also calls for changes in the Judicial Conference, the federal courts' oversight body led by Chief Justice John Roberts, and further investigation by Congress.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senate-review-of-supreme-court-ethics-finds-more-luxury-trips-/7909809.html	2024-12-21T13:01:50-08:00	
Children among at least 13 killed in stampedes at charity events in Nigeria	ABUJA, NIGERIA — At least 13 people, including four children, were killed in two separate stampedes in Nigeria as large crowds gathered to collect food and clothing items distributed at annual Christmas events, the police said Saturday. The two accidents came days after another such stampede in Africa's most populous country, amid a growing trend by local organizations, churches and individuals to organize charity events ahead of Christmas, as the country struggles with the worst cost-of-living crisis in a generation. Ten people were killed in the first stampede in the early hours at the Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Maitama, an upmarket part of the capital, Abuja, police spokesman Josephine Adeh said in a statement, adding that more than 1,000 people have been evacuated from the church. There was a crowd surge at one of the church gates, as dozens tried to enter the premises around 4 a.m. local time, hours before the gift items were to be shared, witnesses said. Some in the crowd had been waiting since the previous night. 'The way they were rushing to enter, some people were falling and some of them were old,' Loveth Inyang, a witness, said. Inyang said he managed to rescue one baby as his mother struggled in the surge. Crush starts before event begins Three people died in a similar crush later in the southeastern Anambra state's Okija town at a charity event organized by a philanthropist, the state police said. 'The event had not even started when the rush began,' police spokesman Tochukwu Ikenga said. There could be more deaths recorded as officers investigate the incident, he said. Viral footage that appeared to be from the Abuja scene showed lifeless bodies lying on the ground as people shouted for help. Some of the injured have been treated and discharged while others continue to receive medical care, police said. The church canceled the charity event with bags of rice and clothing items still arranged within the premises. The church held a marriage ceremony after the crowd was evacuated, but the agony and sadness remained palpable even as families and friends gathered for wedding pictures. Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu expressed his sympathy for the victims' families and asked states and relevant authorities to enforce strict crowd control measures. Disasters lead to change The recent stampedes in Nigeria have raised questions about safety measures in such events. Several children were killed on Wednesday when a local foundation organized a well-attended fair to distribute gift items and food to kids in southwestern Oyo state. After the latest disaster, the police in Abuja announced that permission must be obtained before such charity events are organized. The current economic hardship under President Tinubu, who promised 'renewed hope' when he was sworn into office in May 2023, is blamed on surging inflation, which is at a 28-year high, and the government's economic policies that have pushed the local currency to a record low against the dollar. Frustration over the cost-of-living crisis has led to mass protests in recent months. In August, at least 20 people were shot to death and hundreds of others were arrested at protests demanding better opportunities and jobs for young people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/children-among-at-least-13-killed-in-stampedes-at-nigeria-christmas-charity-events-/7909801.html	2024-12-21T12:20:05-08:00
