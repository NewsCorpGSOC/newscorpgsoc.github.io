Former CIA analyst pleads guilty of leaking information on Israeli plans to attack Iran	A former CIA analyst pleaded guilty Friday in federal court in Virginia to charges that he leaked classified information about Israeli plans to strike Iran. Asif William Rahman, 34, of Vienna, Virginia, was arrested last year in Cambodia and later taken to Guam. He faces a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison on each of the two charges: retention and transmission of classified information related to the national defense. Rahman had worked for the intelligence agency since 2016 and had a top-secret security clearance. Prosecutors said Rahman illegally downloaded and printed classified documents at work and then took the documents home, where he altered the items to cover up the source of the information before distributing it. The secret information was eventually published on the Telegram social media platform. A Justice Department statement said that beginning in the spring of 2024 and lasting until November, Rahman shared the 'top-secret information' he learned at his job with 'multiple individuals he knew were not entitled to receive it.' 'Government employees who are granted security clearances and given access to our nation's classified information must promise to protect it,' Robert Wells, executive assistant director of the FBI’s National Security Branch, said Friday in a statement. 'Rahman blatantly violated that pledge and took multiple steps to hide his actions. The FBI will use all our resources to investigate and hold accountable those who illegally transmit classified information and endanger the national security interests of our country,' Wells said. The Justice Department said Rahman destroyed journal entries and written work products on his personal electronic devices 'to conceal his personal opinions on U.S. policy and drafted entries to construct a false narrative regarding his activity.' He also destroyed several other electronic devices, including an internet router that the Justice Department said Rahman 'used to transmit classified information and photographs of classified documents, and discarded the destroyed devices in public trash receptacles in an effort to thwart potential investigations into him and his unlawful conduct.' The Associated Press reported that Rahman was born in California but grew up in Cincinnati and graduated from Yale University after only three years. Rahman is scheduled to be sentenced May 15. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-cia-analyst-pleads-guilty-of-leaking-info-on-israeli-plans-to-attack-iran/7941453.html	2025-01-17T19:23:41-08:00	
The role of Kurdish women in the new Syria	Kurdish women in Syria, who played a vital role during the civil war, are now advocating for gender equality in a post-Assad Syria.

Russia adds VOA, Current Time, BBC journalists to register of 'foreign agents'	WASHINGTON — Russia's Justice Ministry on Friday added more journalists to its list of so-called foreign agents, including reporters for Voice of America, Current Time and the BBC. Six journalists were named to the registry, including Ksenia Turkova, who works for VOA's Russian language service in Washington, and Iryna Romaliiska, who works for Current Time, a Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty program in partnership with VOA. Others designated by Russia include Anastasia Lotareva and Andrey Kozenko, who work for BBC Russian; Alexandra Prokopenko, a journalist and research fellow at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center in Berlin; and Anton Rubin, a journalist at exiled media outlet Ekho Moskvy, who is also the director of a nongovernmental organization that helps orphans. Authorities use law to target critics Russia's foreign agent law came into effect in 2012. Since then, say watchdogs, it has been used by authorities to target groups and individuals who are critical of the Kremlin. Hundreds of media outlets, journalists and civil society groups have been listed by the Justice Ministry. Those named as foreign agents have to mark any online content, even personal social media posts, as having come from a foreign agent, and to share financial details. Failure to comply can lead to fines or even imprisonment. Both VOA and its sister network RFE/RL have been designated as so-called foreign agents. Turkova is the first VOA journalist to be named individually. In a statement, VOA director Mike Abramowitz said that VOA and its journalists, by law, provide 'a consistently reliable and authoritative source of news around the world.' 'We stand with our journalists who often face repercussions for providing this vital public service and we remain committed to ensuring that audiences can access the vital content that VOA provides,' he said. Turkova told VOA that she considers the designation by Russia a 'meaningless label.' 'For the authorities, it's a synonym for 'traitor,' 'enemy of the people,' ' she said. 'For those whom the Russian authorities are targeting, it's, in general, an empty sound, a word that means absolutely nothing.' Previously, Turkova worked in Ukraine, where she reported on Russia's occupation of Crimea, the war in Donbas and repressive actions by Moscow. Since moving to Washington, Turkova said, 'I continued to write and speak about the topics that I consider very important. First of all, it's the war in Ukraine. It's repression in Russia and it's the role of propaganda.' Current Time's Romaliiska said she did not care about the designation. 'This only means that the Current Time channel is working great, that our team is doing a good job, which is what we will continue to do, regardless of any lists and statuses,' she told Current Time. 30 journalists behind bars Russia has a dire media freedom record, ranking 162nd out of 180, where 1 shows the best environment on the World Press Freedom Index. It is also a leading jailer of journalists, with 30 behind bars, according to data released Thursday by the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. The report noted that as well as the high number of journalists in custody, Russia in 2024 'took its transnational repression to new levels.' Foreign correspondents and Russian reporters in exile faced in absentia arrest warrants or sentences. The CPJ report described the action as 'an intimidatory tactic,' adding that it 'serves as a chilling illustration of Moscow's determination to control the narrative of its war in Ukraine.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalists-at-voa-current-time-bbc-added-to-russia-s-so-called-foreign-agent-register/7941382.html	2025-01-17T17:15:57-08:00

SpaceX says fire could have caused Starship to break, spew debris near Caribbean	SpaceX says a fire might have caused its Starship to break during liftoff and send trails of flaming debris near the Caribbean. SpaceX's Elon Musk said preliminary indications are that leaking fuel built up pressure in the cavity above the engine firewall. The resulting fire would have doomed the spacecraft. On Friday, the Federal Aviation Administration ordered SpaceX to investigate what went wrong. The FAA said there were no reports of injuries from Starship debris. The 400-foot Starship — the world's biggest and most powerful rocket — launched from the southern tip of Texas on a test flight early Thursday evening. The booster made it back to the pad for a catch by giant mechanical arms, only the second time in Starship history. But the engines on the still-ascending spacecraft shut down one by one, and communication was lost 8-1/2 minutes into the flight. Dramatic video taken near the Turks and Caicos Islands showed spacecraft debris raining down from the sky in a stream of fireballs. Flights near the falling debris had to be diverted, the FAA said. SpaceX said Starship remained in its designated launch corridor over the Gulf of Mexico and then the Atlantic. Any surviving wreckage would have fallen along that path over water, the company said on its website. Starship had been shooting for a controlled entry over the Indian Ocean, halfway around the world. Ten dummy satellites, mimicking SpaceX's Starlink internet satellites, were on board so the company could practice releasing them. It was the seventh test flight of a Starship, but it featured a new and upgraded spacecraft. The FAA said it must approve SpaceX's accident findings and any corrective actions. SpaceX said the booster and spacecraft for the eighth demo are already built and undergoing testing. Musk said on X the loss was 'barely a bump in the road' in his plans to build a fleet of Starships to carry people to Mars. NASA already has booked two Starships to land astronauts on the moon later this decade under its Artemis program, the successor to Apollo. 'Spaceflight is not easy. It's anything but routine,' NASA Administrator Bill Nelson posted on X after the accident. 'That's why these tests are so important.' Earlier Thursday, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin company also had mixed results with the debut of its massive New Glenn rocket. It achieved orbit on its first try, putting a test satellite thousands of miles above Earth. But the booster was destroyed after failing to land on a floating platform in the Atlantic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spacex-says-fire-could-have-caused-starship-to-break-spew-debris-near-caribbean/7941177.html	2025-01-17T16:01:11-08:00	
Kurdish leaders seek unity amid Syria's shifting landscape	WASHINGTON — Kurdish leaders in Iraq and Syria are pledging to collaborate closely to advance Kurdish rights in Syria following the fall of President Bashar al-Assad’s regime last month. In a rare meeting near Irbil, the capital of the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, Masoud Barzani, the longtime leader of the Kurdistan Democratic Party (KDP), the ruling party in Iraqi Kurdistan, held talks Thursday with Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The meeting has renewed hopes for unity among Syrian Kurdish factions, which have long been divided by political and ideological differences. 'The two leaders discussed the current situation in Syria, including the latest security and political developments,' Barzani’s office said in a statement following the Thursday meeting. Both leaders emphasized the importance of establishing a unified Kurdish front in Syria, the statement added. Abdi, whose SDF controls nearly one-third of Syria’s territory, said his discussions with the Iraqi Kurdish leader centered on the transitional process in Syria following the ouster of Assad’s regime by rebel forces. 'Together, we reaffirmed that the Kurdish position in Syria must be unified and that dialogue with Damascus must peacefully protect the rights of Kurdish people,' he wrote on the social media platform X on Friday. The Kurdish region in northeast Syria has largely been governed by political groups affiliated with the SDF since 2012, after government forces withdrew to fight rebel groups elsewhere in the country. Since then, a Kurdish-led autonomous administration has expanded into some Arab-majority areas in eastern Syria, particularly as the SDF, with support from a U.S.-led global coalition, played a key role in defeating the Islamic State terror group. There is also the Kurdish National Council in Syria (ENKS), which is a coalition of Kurdish parties that are opposed to SDF’s political affiliates. ENKS has ties with Barzani’s KDP and Turkey. Experts suggest that the evolving dynamics in the Middle East present a valuable opportunity for Kurdish groups to advance their cause. 'As regional powers face mounting challenges — Syria’s future remains uncertain, Iran’s military influence and its axis of resistance continue to wane, and tensions between Turkey and Israel escalate — the prospects for Kurdish unity are growing,' said Loqman Radpey, a research fellow at the Middle East Forum. He told VOA by email that the recent meeting in Irbil mirrors those shifting dynamics in the region. However, these Kurdish efforts for unity come amid persistent threats by Turkey against the SDF. Ankara views the Kurdish group as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers’ Party (PKK), designated as a terrorist organization by Turkey, the U.S. and the European Union. Turkish officials have threatened military action to eliminate the SDF if it refuses to disarm. Syria’s new authorities, which are backed by Turkey and led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, have also called for the disbandment of the SDF and the integration of its members into the country’s new Defense Ministry. However, the SDF has stated it will not lay down its arms without a genuine political process in Syria, one in which it can play a key role in shaping the country’s future military. Barzani, the former president of the Kurdistan Region, holds substantial influence among Syrian Kurds and maintains ties with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Experts say this positions him to play a pivotal role in mediating between Syrian Kurdish groups and Turkey. 'For quite a long time, President Barzani has leveraged his personal and political relationships with key actors in both the Kurdish and Turkish camps when the time was right to defuse tension and broker peace,' said Yerevan Saeed, director of the Global Kurdish Initiative for Peace at American University in Washington. 'I think what sets Barzani apart is not just his diplomatic acumen, but his deep understanding of the Kurdish cause and the regional power dynamics at play,' he told VOA by email. Saeed noted that the Kurdish question is inherently transnational, and addressing it demands a comprehensive approach. 'This is why Kurdish leaders across borders must meet, coordinate and strategize together to ensure that rare opportunities are not squandered,' he said.

L.A. fires have scorched largest urban area in California in at least 40 years	Two wildfires still burning in Los Angeles have torched more urban area than any other fire in the state since at least the mid-1980s, an Associated Press analysis shows. The Eaton and Palisades fires that erupted last week have collectively burned almost 4 square miles of highly dense parts of Los Angeles, more than double the urban acreage consumed by the region's Woolsey fire in 2018, according to the AP's analysis of data from the Silvis Lab at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Experts say several factors could lead to wildfires reaching cities more often. Urban areas continue to sprawl into wildland. Climate change is raising global temperatures that lead to more severe weather, including droughts, especially in the western United States. 'If these conditions get worse or more frequent in the future, it wouldn’t be surprising, in my opinion, if there were more events that threaten densely populated places,' said Franz Schug, a researcher studying the boundaries between the wildland and urban areas at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. The Eaton and Palisades fires’ rampage through Los Angeles has killed at least 27 people, destroyed more than 12,000 structures and put more than 80,000 under evacuation orders. The fires are likely to be among the most destructive in California history, according to the state agency CalFire. The Woolsey fire eventually grew to about twice the current size of the Eaton and Palisades fires but most of the area it burned was uninhabited. Silvis, and AP, defined urban areas as those that are 'high density,' where the land has at least three housing units for every acre, calculated with U.S. Census data. The Great Chicago Fire of 1871 burned about 3.3 square miles of the downtown area of the city, according to the Chicago Architecture Center. San Francisco’s Great Fire of 1906 destroyed 4 square miles of the city, according to the Museum of the City of San Francisco. Besides burning the most urban area, the Eaton and Palisades fires are the largest ever for California in January. Alexandra Syphard, a senior research scientist at the Conservation Biology Institute, said their timing and path through the city 'may have no precedent in history.' Authorities haven't determined a cause for the major blazes in California. But experts have noted the extreme weather that created more favorable conditions: heavy rains that drove vegetation growth, then extreme drought that turned much of that vegetation into good fire fuel. Scientists say such extreme weather events are a hallmark of climate change. Then there’s the human element. Across California, about 1.4 million homes were built in areas where residential areas and vegetation intermingle between 1990 and 2020, a 40% increase, the Silvis Lab found. Fires that begin close to populated areas are often caused by people, and their proximity to people means that they are usually extinguished sooner. As David Helmers, a data scientist and geographer at the Silvis Lab, put it, 'Humans tend to ignite fires, but they also fight fires.' But that wasn't the case with the Eaton and Palisades fires, which were whipped by fierce Santa Ana winds to overwhelm fire crews. The 2017 Tubbs fire in northern California's wine country came under similar high winds. That blaze, sparked by a residential electrical system, tore through suburban areas of Santa Rosa, killing 22 people and destroying more than 5,600 homes, businesses and other structures. Overnight, the rubble of the Coffey Park neighborhood became a symbol for how quickly a wildfire can reach a populated area. Some 53 years prior, another fire — the Hanly fire — burned through almost the exact same area. Winds helped it spread with furious speed. But with little development at the time, nobody died and only 100 homes were lost.	https://www.voanews.com/a/l-a-fires-have-scorched-largest-urban-area-in-california-in-at-least-40-years-/7941169.html	2025-01-17T15:23:08-08:00

Biden says Equal Rights Amendment should be considered ratified	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden announced Friday that the Equal Rights Amendment should be considered a ratified addition to the U.S. Constitution, making a symbolic statement that’s unlikely to alter a decadeslong push for gender equality. 'The Equal Rights Amendment is the law of the land,' Biden said, even though presidents have no role in the constitutional process. He did not direct the leader of the National Archives to certify the amendment, as some activists have called for, sidestepping a legal battle. It was the latest in a collection of pronouncements that Biden has made in the waning days of his presidency as he tries to tie up loose ends and embroider his legacy despite leaving after only one term. He’s also called for a ban on stock trading for members of Congress and proposed term limits for Supreme Court justices — ideas that lingered for years before Biden endorsed them. With his popularity low and political influence running dry before he’s replaced by Donald Trump on Monday, Biden’s statements have stirred aggravation among some allies who believe he should have acted more swiftly and spoken out earlier. The Equal Rights Amendment, which would ban discrimination based on gender, was sent to the states for ratification in 1972. Virginia became the 38th state to ratify it in 2000, although years past the deadline set by Congress, leading to a legal standoff over whether it could be considered valid. Democrats and activists have long pressed to consider the amendment as ratified, but Biden did not say he agreed until Friday. 'I wish it was done sooner because it’s so important,' said Christian F. Nunes, leader of the National Organization for Women. 'The fact that it’s getting done now is more important than the fact that it took long, but we can’t continue to delay women’s protections and equal rights in this country.' Noreen Farrell, executive director of Equal Rights Advocates, said she wished Biden’s statement had come earlier in hopes of influencing the leader of the National Archives, who has declined to certify the amendment because of the expired deadline for ratification. 'But we remain hopeful' that it would help build momentum 'even at this late date,' Farrell said. Biden defended his decision not to weigh in until the end of his term by telling reporters that he 'needed all the facts.' Earlier in the day, Biden issued a statement saying that 'it is long past time to recognize the will of the American people.' 'In keeping with my oath and duty to Constitution and country, I affirm what I believe and what three-fourths of the states have ratified: the 28th Amendment is the law of the land, guaranteeing all Americans equal rights and protections under the law regardless of their sex.' It’s unlikely that Biden’s support will have any impact. On Friday, the National Archives reiterated its position by saying 'the underlying legal and procedural issues have not changed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-says-equal-rights-amendment-should-be-considered-ratified/7941130.html	2025-01-17T14:23:57-08:00	
UNRWA chief: Israel’s planned dismantling of aid agency would be ‘catastrophic’	UNITED NATIONS — The head of the United Nations agency that assists Palestinian refugees, UNRWA, warned Friday that the expected implementation later this month of Israeli legislation aimed at shuttering the agency would be 'catastrophic' to humanitarian efforts in Gaza. 'A chaotic dismantling of UNRWA will irreversibly harm the lives and future of the Palestinians,' said Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini. 'I believe it will obliterate their trust in the international community and any solution it attempts to facilitate.' On Oct. 28, Israel’s parliament adopted legislation to ban the agency in Israel and forbid Israeli officials from having any contact with UNRWA representatives. Israel says some UNRWA staff participated in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack inside Israel. The United Nations investigated the accusations and fired nine staffers. Israel's U.N. envoy, Danny Danon, has said that 'UNRWA Gaza has become a front for Hamas.' Lazzarini told reporters that full implementation of the legislation could potentially cripple UNRWA’s ability to reach millions of Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank. He said they are still waiting for Israel to issue some guidance on how the two laws will be implemented, but nothing has come down so far, and they plan to stay and deliver, opening their schools and clinics as normal. Israel has suggested that other U.N. and international aid agencies take over UNRWA’s work. But Lazzarini said UNRWA’s services, mainly health care and education, can be transferred only to a functioning state — ideally a Palestinian one. 'A ceasefire in Gaza must be followed by a political transition that includes an orderly conclusion of UNRWA’s mandate and the handover of its public-like services to empowered Palestinian institutions,' he said. U.N. officials have repeatedly stressed that if the Knesset legislation is enforced and UNRWA dismantled, then Israel, as the occupying power, would have the legal responsibility for providing essential services to the Palestinian population. Lazzarini was in New York to brief U.N. Security Council members on the situation. He said he asked them to prevent implementation of the Israeli legislation, insist on a political path forward that clearly delineates UNRWA’s role as a provider of essential services, and ensure the agency’s financial crisis does not end its work. UNRWA has long had funding shortfalls. However, the commissioner-general says those shortfalls have been exacerbated by what he calls a politically driven disinformation campaign by Israel to drive donors away from UNRWA, as well as the growing needs in Gaza over the last 15 months. With a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal struck this week that includes a provision for 600 aid trucks a day to enter the enclave, diplomats say UNRWA’s infrastructure and expertise are even more necessary. 'UNRWA remains absolutely indispensable in Gaza, in the West Bank, everywhere,' French Ambassador Nicolas de Riviere told reporters Friday. 'It would be quite a contradiction to close UNRWA while implementing the ceasefire agreement,' he added. 'Because on the one hand, you will try to improve the situation in Gaza — to improve the humanitarian situation — and on the other hand, since there is no credible Plan B for UNRWA, Gazans would just suffer, and the situation will further deteriorate.' The U.N. General Assembly created UNRWA in 1949 to assist Palestinian refugees who lost their homes and livelihoods because of the 1948 Arab-Israeli war that led to the creation of the State of Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unrwa-chief-israel-s-planned-dismantling-of-aid-agency-would-be-catastrophic-/7941105.html	2025-01-17T14:12:19-08:00

Journalists in Azerbaijan face trials, jailings, travel bans	WASHINGTON — An Azerbaijani court on Friday denied petitions by two jailed journalists to be released from house arrest, their lawyers said. The journalists, Aynur Elgunesh and Natig Javadli, work for Meydan TV, an independent outlet based in Germany. They were among six journalists arrested in the Azerbaijani capital, Baku, in early December. Azerbaijan is among the worst jailers of journalists in the world, with more than a dozen behind bars, according to a report released this week by the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. Azerbaijan is currently detaining at least 18 journalists for their work, according to CPJ. The group’s latest prison census, which acts as a snapshot of media workers in custody as of Dec. 1, listed 13 journalists in the Azerbaijani prison. One of those was released after the census was taken, but authorities then jailed six more journalists, including Elgunesh and Javadli. The arrests are a concern for local activists and reporters. 'Independent and critical media in Azerbaijan is going through its most difficult period,' Azerbaijani activist Samir Kazimli told VOA. 'If this policy of repression does not stop, if it continues, independent media in Azerbaijan may completely collapse.' The annual CPJ report found 361 journalists behind bars around the world. Azerbaijan ranked eighth worst in the census, behind countries such as China, Israel, Myanmar, Belarus and Russia. 'Azerbaijan has been cracking down on independent media for well over a decade,' CPJ’s CEO, Jodie Ginsberg, told VOA. 'It doesn’t often get the attention that it deserves.' Local journalists like Shamshad Agha are worried that Azerbaijani authorities are trying to stamp out independent media. Agha is editor of Argument.az, a news website covering democracy, corruption and human rights. 'The lives of all independent journalists are in danger,' he told VOA. Agha said he has been banned from leaving the country since July 2024. Azerbaijan’s Washington embassy did not immediately reply to VOA’s email requesting comment. Many of the journalists jailed in Azerbaijan are accused of foreign currency smuggling, which media watchdogs have rejected as a sham charge. Many of those currently detained work for the independent outlets Abzas Media and Meydan TV. Farid Mehralizada, an economist and journalist with the Azerbaijani Service of VOA’s sister outlet, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, is among those currently imprisoned. Jailed since May, Mehralizada is facing charges of conspiring to smuggle foreign currency, as well as 'illegal entrepreneurship, money laundering, tax evasion and document forgery.' He denies the charges, which carry a combined sentence of up to 12 years behind bars. On Thursday, Ulviyya Guliyeva, a journalist who has been a contributor to VOA’s Azerbaijani Service since 2019, was summoned to a police station in Baku for questioning. The journalist said she was questioned about Meydan TV, even though she is not an employee there. Guliyeva said she was also placed under a travel ban that blocked her from leaving the country. 'This is a very disturbing situation for me,' Guliyeva said. 'I see this as pressure on my journalistic activities.'

Ethnic attacks, hate speech surging in Sudan, UN rights office says	GENEVA — U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk warned on Friday that Sudanese civilians were in greater peril than ever as ethnically motivated attacks and hate speech by the warring parties becomes 'increasingly common.' 'As the Sudanese Armed Forces [SAF] and Rapid Support Forces [RSF] battle for control at all costs in the senseless war that [has] raged for close to two years now, direct and ethnically motivated attacks on civilians are becoming increasingly common,' he said in a statement. 'The situation for civilians in Sudan is already desperate, and there is evidence of the commission of war crimes and other atrocity crimes,' Türk said. 'I fear the situation is now taking a further, even more dangerous turn.' Since the rival forces and generals went to war in mid-April 2023, the United Nations has said, more than 24,000 people have been killed and more than 14 million have been displaced — 11 million inside the country and over 3 million as refugees in neighboring countries. Widespread hunger The World Food Program has reported that nearly 24.6 million people — nearly half the population — suffer from acute hunger and an estimated 1.5 million are on the verge of famine. The World Health Organization has said around 90% of health facilities are not functional, and that cholera, malaria, dengue and measles have been reported in over 12 states. 'This is an extremely dire situation which deserves all the attention it can get to put whatever pressure the international community can to bring this conflict to an end,' Türk’s spokesperson, Ravina Shamdasani, told journalists Friday at a briefing in Geneva. In the last week alone, she said, the U.N. Human Rights Office documented at least 21 deaths in two attacks in Al Jazirah state, 'although the actual numbers of attacks directed at civilians and of civilians killed are very likely much higher.' 'The reason why we felt we had to speak out today is because of reports of an imminent battle for Khartoum,' she said. 'We are worried about the kinds of violations that we may see as the parties to the conflict battle for control at all costs for Khartoum, and we are worried that this is taking us further away from peace and further into a horrific situation for civilians.' Türk expressed concern about retaliatory attacks of 'shocking brutality' on entire communities based on real or perceived ethnic identity and hate speech, which he said were on the rise and were acting as 'an incitement to violence.' 'This must, urgently, be brought to an end,' he said. Shamdasani reported that the human rights office has received three videos that document scenes of violence, including summary executions that were hailed by perpetrators as 'a cleaning operation.' The victims were referred to as animals and dirt before being killed. 'The videos reportedly were filmed in Wad Madani with men in SAF uniforms visibly present,' the spokesperson said. 'Serious concerns also persist for civilians in North Darfur, where ethnically motivated attacks by the RSF and its allied Arab militias against African ethnic groups, particularly the Zaghawa and Fur, continue to exact a horrific toll,' she said. Effects on neighbors Aid workers in the region have reported that the multiplying horrors of the war in Sudan are having serious effects on neighboring countries, particularly South Sudan. Speaking from the South Sudanese capital, Juba, Florence Gillette, head of the International Committee of the Red Cross delegation in South Sudan, said ICRC’s mobile surgical team in the town of Renk had treated more than 230 patients wounded by weapons in just one month. She said more than 120,000 people from Sudan had fled to South Sudan since early December — this on top of 800,000 people who already had sought safety in South Sudan since the war began. 'Dozens of them, wounded by the violence, have required urgent medical care by ICRC doctors,' she said. 'The ongoing influx of Sudanese refugees and South Sudanese returnees is straining resources throughout Renk communities,' she said. 'This is particularly worrying as South Sudan continues to face a cholera outbreak with more than 20,000 cases recorded in the country so far.' Meanwhile, Türk renewed his call for both warring parties to abide by international humanitarian and human rights law. 'Attacks must never be directed against civilians,' he said Arms embargo Shamdasani said the high commissioner also was calling on all states to abide by a U.N. arms embargo and 'to refrain from providing all types of military support in Sudan.' Just as nations fail to abide by the U.N. arms embargo, she acknowledged, sanctions imposed by individual countries often are not respected. This was a reference to the United States, which declared sanctions on army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Thursday, a week after the U.S. slapped sanctions on RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. Sudan’s army-aligned foreign ministry has rejected the U.S. sanctions, calling them 'immoral.' Shamdasani said her office generally opposed broad sanctions because they can damage human rights in a country. 'But targeted sanctions can be effective in exerting pressure on specific individuals and organizations that are responsible for the perpetration of conflict,' she said. 'So we are calling on states to use whatever measures they can, to use whatever leverage they have to pressure the parties to the conflict to bring this war to an end.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethnic-attacks-hate-speech-surging-in-sudan-un-rights-office-says-/7940973.html	2025-01-17T12:39:12-08:00	
Malawi takes steps to end cholera outbreaks by 2030	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Malawi’s government launched a plan Thursday to stop cholera outbreaks by 2030. Officials say that if the government and international partners can effectively cooperate, they can greatly reduce the prevalence of cholera in the southern African country, where it has killed at least 1,700 people over the past three years. Partners include the World Health Organization, or WHO, and UNICEF. Minister of Health Khumbize Kandodo-Chiponda said, 'The goal of the plan is to reduce the annual cholera rate by 90% and achieve the case fatality rate of less than 1% by the year 2030, as recommended by WHO.' Kandodo-Chiponda said there are several ways to achieve the goal, all of which involve the government, development partners, civil society organizations and other stakeholders supplying expertise and funding to support prevention and control efforts. She said those efforts will be 'to increase access to safe water and sanitation facilities and promote improved hygiene practices; to raise awareness and promote community-led initiatives to prevent and to respond to outbreaks.' Malawi has experienced cholera outbreaks over the past three years, with the most severe occurring in 2022, resulting in over 1,700 deaths nationwide. During Thursday’s event, the Malawian government launched an oral cholera vaccine campaign targeting four districts — Mzimba, Karonga, Balaka and Machinga — to address a recent resurgence of cholera there. Statistics from the Presidential Task Force on Cholera show the disease has caused 14 deaths since September. Shadrack Omol, UNICEF’s representative in Malawi, said the 2024 resurgence of cholera shows that root causes of the infectious bacterial disease persist. 'Health interventions ... are complimentary in support,' Omol said. 'The key to addressing the root causes is in provision of safe drinking water across our country, improving sanitation and improving hygiene practices.' Malawi’s public health experts say goals to eradicate the disease within five years will depend on stakeholder commitments. George Jobe, executive director of the Malawi Health Equity Network, said, 'If financial investments [and] technical investments from partners are done, we believe we can win this battle. It should not be a document that should grow dust on the shelves.' Kandodo-Chiponda said the operational plans will be reviewed at least once every year to keep ahead of any possible cholera outbreaks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-takes-steps-to-end-cholera-outbreaks-by-2030/7940991.html	2025-01-17T12:30:12-08:00	
Crews improve containment of LA fires	WASHINGTON — Firefighters have contained more of the Palisades and Eaton fires in Southern California, the state’s Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said Friday morning. For the time being, the strongest winds have calmed, but the National Weather Service said dangerous conditions are expected again next week. The strongest winds are expected Tuesday night. The Palisades fire, which has burned through nearly 10,000 hectares, is now 31% contained, according to the forestry department. That fire broke out more than a week ago on the western edge of Los Angeles. The second-biggest fire, the Eaton fire, is now 65% contained, according to the forestry department. It has burned through more than 5,600 hectares. Those two fires have killed at least 27 people and destroyed more than 12,300 structures. The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department said Thursday that 18 people remained missing after the fires. A smaller third fire, known as the Auto fire, is 85% contained and has burned through 24 hectares, according to the forestry department. With calmer winds, some residents have been allowed back into neighborhoods affected by the Eaton and Palisades fires. About 82,000 people remained under mandatory evacuation orders and 90,000 others were under evacuation warnings. Curfews were still in effect for the Palisades and Eaton fire zones from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crews-improve-containment-of-la-fires/7940931.html	2025-01-17T12:01:58-08:00	
Taiwan faces decline in troop numbers, report reveals	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan's military has announced new recruitment and retention measures to help sustain troop levels, as the island faces continued threats from China amid a shrinking number of volunteer soldiers. According to Taiwan’s Central News Agency, the Ministry of National Defense unveiled measures Wednesday that call for pay raises for volunteer enlistees among other incentives. According to data from the Budget Center of Taiwan’s Legislative Yuan, the number of volunteer troops has dropped by 12,000 over the past three years. The military currently has 152,885 soldiers, compared with 164,884 soldiers in 2021. Additionally, more Taiwanese soldiers are choosing to discharge from their service commitments early, according to the data. Some 1,565 troops took early leave in 2024, a sharp increase from the nearly 400 personnel who did so in 2020. The decline has prompted Taiwanese authorities to reinstate a one-year conscripted service requirement for Taiwanese males and make efforts to improve the military’s defense training infrastructure and provide higher salaries to its troops. Still, some analysts are worried that these reforms might not be enough to ensure Taiwan’s combat-readiness. Yu-Ping Chou is a former director of the planning division at the Air Defense Missile Command under the General Staff Headquarters of Taiwan's Ministry of National Defense. He told VOA’s Mandarin Service that so far reforms have not been enough to ease the challenges of troop recruitment and retention. Current active-duty personnel find themselves taking on extended hours of training and service work to offset the impact of depleted troop enrollment, which drives more troops to seek discharge, Chou said. More frequent aggressive maneuvers from China have also required Taiwan’s military to increase surveillance and patrol missions, adding to the burden put on already overworked soldiers, he said. Chou said the military is also facing a type of 'brain-drain.' This problem is particularly prominent within the air force, with many skilled pilots deciding to leave and seek higher salaries in the commercial airline industry. Experienced soldiers are essential to operate advanced weapons systems, which makes the heightened discharge numbers especially challenging for the island’s efforts to modernize its defense force. 'The defense force is currently in the process of upgrading its equipment and weapons systems, and needs quality manpower to operate these new, advanced weapons,' Chou said. 'If there’s no one to operate the best equipment, can it perform at its full potential?' A final reason for the fall in enrollment, Chou said, stems from the perceived heightened danger of serving as a soldier at this time. He said the current 'danger of war' has made some families reluctant to send their children into service. A-Wei, a 32-year-old volunteer officer who has served for 11 years in Matsu, an island off the southeastern coast of mainland China, says he has never considered early retirement. While Wei admits that many units are troubled with a salary mismatch and understaffing, with some even operating with 50% or 60% of the desired manpower, he says that the capacity of Taiwan’s fighting forces has not faltered. For Wei, these present challenges have, on the contrary, pushed the military to become more efficient. He asserts that, despite issues with the military budget and troop recruitment, the capacity of Taiwan’s military has not faltered, and that troops remain steadfast despite the looming threat of war. 'Many of the military's current equipment is actually very advanced. I don't think the decrease in personnel has a big impact. In the past, there were actually some surplus personnel. Now, the training has become much more enhanced and streamlined, eliminating some unnecessary procedures,' Wei told VOA. Upgrades in equipment and a stable, good-enough salary have kept Wei at his position in the military. Wei says that with his salary and bonuses for participating in combat-related missions, he is earning more than some office workers on the island. As for talk online and in the media about whether Taiwanese soldiers are willing or afraid to go to war, Wei said that this is likely a Chinese 'information warfare' tactic. 'The most common reason people leave the military, or why a unit may struggle to keep personnel, is because they feel the task distribution is unfair or the workload is too heavy,' Wei said. 'I've never heard of anyone wanting to leave the military just because they think mainland China is going to attack.' Su Tzu-yun, director of the division of defense strategy and resource under the Institute for National Defense and Security Research in Taipei, blamed demographic factors for the fall in recruitment, and pointed out that many advanced democracies are also facing challenges in military recruitment. The number of men eligible for military recruitment is falling, dropping below 100,000 in 2024 for the first time in Taiwan’s history, according to the Ministry of the Interior. By 2031, it is predicted that there will be fewer than 75,000 recruitable men on the island. Taiwan is looking to meet this challenge with its reinstatement of one-year compulsory service requirement, Su said, adding that he has faith in the program’s ability to increase manpower and ease the burden on volunteer troops. 'I think that during this transition period, with the addition of conscription soldiers, around 6,900 people, for example, joined the military last year, and more will join this year. After supplementing the manpower, the workload of the voluntary service members will be reduced, which will help decrease their overall discharge rate, thus avoiding this vicious cycle,' Su told VOA. Aside from lengthening the conscription requirement and improving salaries and benefits, Taiwan’s Defense Ministry is looking at a variety of other measures to combat the recruitment and retention problem. These programs include adopting more tolerant management practices within the service and liberalizing entry restrictions to recruit foreign personnel.

Media advocates say jailing of journalists in Venezuela, Cuba stifles reporting	MADRID — Venezuela and Cuba this week released political prisoners, including a free speech advocate, but analysts say the threat of legal action in authoritarian countries stifles media freedom. In Venezuela on Thursday, Carlos Correa, director of the free speech organization Espacio Publico, was freed after a week in custody, his group reported. Authorities had arrested Correa along with at least six others, including opposition politicians, ahead of President Nicolas Maduro’s inauguration last Friday. 'We thank all the people, organizations, governments and groups that joined the voice for [Correa’s] liberation. We continue to defend human dignity,' Espacio Publico said in a post on social media X. Correa’s legal situation remained unclear. The journalist has appeared before an anti-terrorism court, his wife, Mabel Calderin, told reporters Thursday. Calderin said she had no information on the charges brought against her husband. The Venezuelan Communications Ministry did not reply to an email from VOA asking for a comment about the release of Correa. Correa has not replied to messages on social media from VOA. Also, this week, Cuba released 127 activists as part of a deal with outgoing U.S President Joe Biden, who pledged to remove Havana from the U.S. list of terrorism sponsors. Cash-strapped Cuba promised to free up to 553 people, many of whom the U.S. government considers as 'political prisoners.' Most were arrested for taking part in anti-government demonstrations in July 2021 over a series of power cuts, food shortages and price increases. Prisoners Defenders International, a Madrid-based opposition group, estimates Cuba is holding 1,161 political prisoners. Five reporters remain behind bars and another five face legal restrictions on their freedom, Prisoners Defenders said. These restrictions vary from not being able to leave the island to serving sentences under house arrest. None of those released on Wednesday are journalists, Prisoners Defenders International told VOA. Civil society groups welcomed the releases in both countries but warn that the threat of legal action or jailing intimidates independent media. In its annual report of jailed journalists, the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ noted that while few Latin American countries are detaining media workers, even a small number of arrests can create a repressive environment. 'That increased criminalization that we’re seeing of journalists is a deliberate tactic by governments to silence journalists, because they know that if there is a threat of being labelled a criminal or there is threat of imprisonment, many journalists will back off from that reporting,' Jodie Ginsberg, who heads CPJ, told VOA. Globally, CPJ found 361 journalists behind bars for their work, the second highest number recorded by the organization since it began recording data in 1992. Ginsberg said that in authoritarian Latin American countries, not many journalists have been jailed but this may show the success of repressive policies. 'So, in some cases, a low number of jailed journalists in a repressive regime is actually an indication of how successful that regime has been in repressing them. In Latin America and the Caribbean, what we see more often is physical attacks on journalists,' added Ginsberg. The leader of Venezuela’s neighbor, Colombia, celebrated the release of Correa and called for all political prisoners to be freed in Latin America. 'When Cuba has released more than 500 prisoners, it is important for peace in the Americas that Venezuela releases all the people detained in the framework of the [presidential] election and the post-election, including the 12 Colombians detained in its territory,' Colombian President Gustavo Petro wrote in a post on X. 'May the Americas be a land of freedom without political prisoners,' he added. Petro declined to attend Maduro’s inauguration amid widespread accusation that last year's Venezuelan election was rigged. Days before Maduro was sworn in for a third term, Caracas detained seven individuals that it described as 'mercenaries,' including two Americans. However, the political party Popular Will said authorities have detained up to 19 people. Witnesses saw Correa being bundled into a car by hooded figures, Espacio Publico said. The same week that he was detained, authorities arrested Enrique Marquez, a politician who ran in the 2024 presidential elections and later backed Edmundo Gonzalez as the victor. Marquez, who is accused of trying to stage a coup against Maduro, remains behind bars. The Venezuelan government is investigating major opposition leaders for alleged conspiracy, among other charges, and has repeatedly accused the opposition of inciting violence with its claims of victory in the presidential election in July. The opposition published ballot box-level tallies which, it says, show a resounding victory for its candidate Gonzalez. Gonzalez is recognized as president-elect by several countries, including the U.S. The Venezuelan government is offering a $100,000 reward for his capture.

UK leader condemns 'poison of antisemitism' on Auschwitz visit	WARSAW, POLAND — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday condemned what he called 'the poison of antisemitism rising around the world' after a visit to Auschwitz-Birkenau, the former German Nazi concentration camp. His visit came as many international delegations are expected to attend the Jan. 27 ceremony commemorating 80 years since the Soviet Red Army liberated the death camp built in occupied Poland. King Charles III will be among those attending the ceremony, Buckingham Palace said Monday, in his first visit to the former camp. 'Time and again we condemn this hatred, and we boldly say, 'never again,'' Starmer said in a statement following his visit. 'But where is never again, when we see the poison of antisemitism rising around the world' in the aftermath of October 7th, he said. The Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas staged the deadliest attack in Israeli history. The attack resulted in the deaths of 1,210 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of official Israeli figures. Israel's retaliatory campaign has left 46,876 people dead, the majority civilians, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza, figures the United Nations has described as reliable. Last week, the Polish government said it would grant free access to Israeli officials wanting to attend the commemoration, despite a warrant issued in November by the International Criminal Court for the arrest of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said he had information from the Israeli Embassy that the country would be represented by its education minister. The International Criminal Court issued the warrant in November over the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, prompting outrage from Israel and its allies. Auschwitz has become a symbol of Nazi Germany's genocide of 6 million European Jews, 1 million of whom died at the site between 1940 and 1945, along with more than 100,000 non-Jews.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-leader-condemns-poison-of-antisemitism-on-auschwitz-visit/7940776.html	2025-01-17T10:23:24-08:00	
US fortifying Indo-Pacific air bases against potential attacks from China	Washington — The United States has been ramping up its Indo-Pacific region air bases to ensure they are protected against attack, a spokesperson for the U.S. Pacific Air Forces told VOA this week, amid concerns over vulnerabilities they face in countries such as Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea against potential Chinese strikes. 'While we are continually improving our theater posture, warfighting advantage, and integration with allied and partners, Pacific Air Forces stands ready every day to respond to anything that poses a threat to a free and open Indo-Pacific,' the spokesperson said. 'We continue to invest in infrastructure and technology to enhance the resilience and survivability of our bases and facilities across the theater including hardening airfields and buildings while investing in advanced security systems to protect our personnel and assets,' the spokesperson told VOA on Tuesday. The Air Force was authorized with '$916.6 million to improve logistics, maintenance capabilities, and prepositioning of equipment, munitions, fuel, and material in the Indo-Pacific' through the fiscal 2024 Pacific Deterrence Initiative, the spokesperson added. The Pacific Deterrence Initiative is a set of defense priorities set up in 2021 by congress to support U.S. goals in the Indo-Pacific, primarily to counter China. The comments were made in response to a report last week by the Hudson Institute claiming that U.S. aircraft at allied Indo-Pacific country bases could suffer major losses from Chinese attacks unless those bases are fortified. If left unfortified, the U.S. air power in the region would be significantly reduced compared to China’s, according to the report, Concrete Sky: Air Based Hardening in the Western Pacific. One of the reasons, according to the report, is that the U.S. is lagging behind China in the number of shelters that could hide and protect the aircraft from attacks. China more than doubled the number of aircraft shelters since the early 2010s, having more than 3,000, according to the report. Across 134 Chinese air bases located within 1,000 nautical miles from the Taiwan Strait, China has more than 650 hardened aircraft shelters and nearly 2,000 nonhardened individual aircraft shelters. A hardened shelter is a reinforced structure made of steel, concrete, and other materials to protect military aircraft from enemy strikes. In comparison, the U.S. has added two hardened shelters and 41 nonhardened ones within 1,000 nautical miles of the Taiwan Strait and outside South Korea since the 2010s, continues the report. This means if a war breaks out over Taiwan, U.S. aircraft could suffer more damage than China’s if they attacked each other’s bases in the region, which would prevent U.S. air operation for a duration of time, said analysts. According to Kelly Grieco, a senior fellow at the Stimson Center’s Reimagining U.S. Grand Strategy Program, attacks on U.S. bases in the Pacific region, including Japan could 'prevent the U.S. Air Force from conducting fighter operations for about the first 12 days of a conflict from U.S. bases in Japan.' Grieco continued, based on her own report published by the Stimson Center, that Chinese missiles could also take out runways and aerial refueling tankers, rendering them unusable over a month at U.S. bases in Japan and over half week at U.S. military bases in Guam and other Pacific locations. 'It’s not possible to harden a runway or taxiway,' that is exposed as easy targets to destroy, disabling aircraft from taking off, she said. This begs the question of whether it is worth investing in hardening facilities, she adds. The Hudson Institute report says within the 1,000 nautical miles of Taiwan, China has added 20 runways and 49 taxiways since the 2010s while the U.S. added one runway and one taxiway. Unhardened airfields Among U.S. air bases in allied countries of Japan, the Philippines, and South Korea, those in the Philippines are the least protected, Timothy Walton, one of the authors of the Hudson report, told VOA. 'In Japan, Kadena and Misawa Air Bases are the most fortified U.S. bases, while the remainder are largely unfortified,' said Walton, a senior fellow at Hudson’s Center for Defense Concepts and Technology. 'In the Republic of Korea, the two U.S. Air Force bases, Osan and Kunsan, are hardened. Airfields in the Philippines are unhardened,' he said. Grieco said the U.S. would mostly rely on its bases in Japan, Guam, and other Pacific locations as South Korea would 'restrict the use of U.S. bases in its territory in a Taiwan contingency out of concern about North Korean aggression and to avoid a rupture with Beijing.' U.S. Representative John Moolenaar, the chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, Senator Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for secretary of state, and 13 other lawmakers underlined last year the importance of hardened shelters to protect against Chinese attacks. In a letter sent to Air Force Secretary Frank Kendall and Navy Secretary Carlos Del Toro in May, they said, 'U.S. bases in the region have almost no hardened aircraft shelters compared to Chinese military bases,' leading to U.S. air assets being 'highly vulnerable to Chinese strikes.' Aside from hardened shelters, analysts pointed to dispersing airfields as important. Steven Rudder, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council and former commanding general of U.S. Marine Corps Forces, Pacific, said, 'When you look at the number of aircraft in the Asia Pacific, I am not sure that the ability to harden every single aircraft parking space would be as effective as a distributed force.' Bruce Bennett, a senior defense researcher at Rand Corporation, said dispersing airfields are important against nuclear strikes. Against conventional warhead missiles, shelters are 'key to the protection,' said Bennett. 'But if there’s a nuclear threat, you’ve got to have different airfields' as alternative locations to park and land aircraft and to provide logistic support such as fueling, maintenance, and repair, he said. Bennett added the disparity in the number of aircraft shelters between the China and U.S. seems to stem from U.S. air superiority. 'What the U.S. Air Force tends to perceive is that we’ve got the ability to deal with the Chinese air force in an air-to-air combat' where China traditionally felt it would lose air-to-air combat against the U.S. and therefore wants to take U.S. aircraft on the ground before engaging in air while sheltering theirs heavily on the ground, Bennett said. 'The question becomes, as the Chinese aircraft get better and as they start fielding fifth generation fighter, will the U.S. need the ability to attack Chinese airfields with conventional weapons? I don’t think the Defense Department has considered it as one of important tasks,' Bennett said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-fortifying-indo-pacific-air-bases-against-potential-attacks-from-china-/7940739.html	2025-01-17T10:06:59-08:00

Trump’s inauguration swearing-in to be moved indoors due to cold	resident-elect Donald Trump’s swearing-in ceremony is to be moved inside the U.S. Capitol on Monday because of expected freezing cold temperatures, according to media reports. On Inauguration Day, temperatures in the U.S. capital are expected to hit a low of 11 degrees Fahrenheit (-11 degrees Celsius) and a high of just 23 degrees Fahrenheit (-5 degrees Celsius). The frigid temperatures mean Trump’s inauguration is expected to be the coldest in 40 years, according to meteorologists. With such cold weather, Trump will take the oath of office inside the U.S. Capitol, rather than outside, according to The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal, both of which cited unnamed people familiar with the matter. President Ronald Reagan’s second inauguration in 1985 was the last time a swearing-in ceremony was moved indoors. The news that Trump’s inauguration is moving inside comes soon after confirmation that China is sending Vice President Han Zheng to attend the ceremony. This will be the first time a senior Chinese leader is scheduled to attend a U.S. president’s swearing-in.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-inauguration-swearing-in-to-be-moved-indoors-due-to-cold-/7940721.html	2025-01-17T09:41:08-08:00	
US Treasury sanctions Chinese company over Salt Typhoon hack	Washington — The U.S. Treasury department on Friday sanctioned Singaporean Yin Kechen and cybersecurity company Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co., accusing both of being involved in a series of hacks against American telecom companies. The intrusions, known under the name 'Salt Typhoon,' have allegedly exposed a huge swathe of Americans' call logs to Chinese spies and rattled the U.S. intelligence community. In some cases, the hackers are alleged to have intercepted conversations, including between prominent U.S. politicians and government officials. Some lawmakers have described them as the worst telecom hack in America's history. In a statement, the Treasury described Sichuan Juxinhe Network Technology Co. as a hacking company with 'strong ties' to China's Ministry of State Security (MSS), an intelligence agency. It said that Yin Kechen had worked as a hacker for over a decade and also had ties to the MSS. It further alleged that he was tied to the recent breach at the U.S. Treasury.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-treasury-sanctions-chinese-company-over-salt-typhoon-hack-/7940682.html	2025-01-17T09:11:58-08:00	
Supreme Court upholds law banning TikTok if it's not sold by its Chinese parent company	Washington — The Supreme Court on Friday unanimously upheld the federal law banning TikTok beginning Sunday unless it's sold by its China-based parent company, holding that the risk to national security posed by its ties to China overcomes concerns about limiting speech by the app or its 170 million users in the United States. A sale does not appear imminent and, although experts have said the app will not disappear from existing users' phones once the law takes effect on Jan. 19, new users won't be able to download it and updates won't be available. That will eventually render the app unworkable, the Justice Department has said in court filings. The decision came against the backdrop of unusual political agitation by President-elect Donald Trump, who vowed that he could negotiate a solution and the administration of President Joe Biden, which has signaled it won't enforce the law beginning Sunday, his final full day in office. Trump, mindful of TikTok’s popularity, and his own 14.7 million followers on the app, finds himself on the opposite side of the argument from prominent Senate Republicans who fault TikTok’s Chinese owner for not finding a buyer before now. It’s unclear what options are open to Trump once he is sworn in as president on Monday. The law allowed for a 90-day pause in the restrictions on the app if there had been progress toward a sale before it took effect. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar, who defended the law at the Supreme Court for the Democratic Biden administration, told the justices last week that it's uncertain whether the prospect of a sale once the law is in effect could trigger a 90-day respite for TikTok. At arguments, the justices were told by a lawyer for TikTok and ByteDance Ltd., the Chinese technology company that is its parent, how difficult it would be to consummate a deal, especially since Chinese law restricts the sale of the proprietary algorithm that has made the social media platform wildly successful. The app allows users to watch hundreds of videos in about half an hour because some are only a few seconds long, according to a lawsuit filed last year by Kentucky complaining that TikTok is designed to be addictive, and it harms kids' mental health. Similar suits were filed by more than a dozen states. TikTok has called the claims inaccurate. The dispute over TikTok's ties to China has come to embody the geopolitical competition between Washington and Beijing. The U.S. has said it’s concerned about TikTok collecting vast swaths of user data, including sensitive information on viewing habits, that could fall into the hands of the Chinese government through coercion. Officials have also warned the algorithm that fuels what users see on the app is vulnerable to manipulation by Chinese authorities, who can use it to shape content on the platform in a way that’s difficult to detect. TikTok points out the U.S. has not presented evidence that China has attempted to manipulate content on its U.S. platform or gather American user data through TikTok. Bipartisan majorities in Congress passed legislation, and President Joe Biden signed it into law in April. The law was the culmination of a yearslong saga in Washington over TikTok, which the government sees as a national security threat. TikTok, which sued the government last year over the law, has long denied it could be used as a tool of Beijing. A three-judge panel made up of two Republican appointees and a Democratic appointee unanimously upheld the law in December, prompting TikTok’s quick appeal to the Supreme Court. Without a sale to an approved buyer, the law bars app stores operated by Apple, Google and others from offering TikTok beginning on Sunday. Internet hosting services also will be prohibited from hosting TikTok. ByteDance has said it won’t sell. But some investors have been eyeing it, including Trump’s former Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and billionaire businessman Frank McCourt. McCourt’s Project Liberty initiative has said it and its unnamed partners have presented a proposal to ByteDance to acquire TikTok’s U.S. assets. The consortium, which includes 'Shark Tank' host Kevin O’Leary, did not disclose the financial terms of the offer. Prelogar told the justices last week that having the law take effect 'might be just the jolt' ByteDance needs to reconsider its position.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-upholds-law-banning-tiktok-if-it-s-not-sold-by-its-chinese-parent-company-/7940533.html	2025-01-17T07:41:10-08:00	
Trump's homeland security pick faces scrutiny on immigration plans	WASHINGTON — South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem, Donald Trump's pick to lead the agency central to his vision of cracking down on illegal immigration, is facing senators Friday at a confirmation hearing that is her first chance to lay out her vision for the sprawling Department of Homeland Security. Noem, a two-term governor and former U.S. congresswoman, was chosen by the president-elect to lead the department responsible for key immigration and border-related actions that will be central to his plans for mass deportations and tightened access at the border. The immigration and border-related agencies Noem would oversee include U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and Citizenship and Immigration Services. Beyond those agencies, the department is also responsible for securing airline transportation, protecting high-profile dignitaries, responding to natural disasters. She would replace outgoing DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who was so vilified by Republicans angry at the number of migrants crossing the country's southern border that they impeached him in early 2024. Noem would be entering a job that was a pressure cooker under the first Trump administration. Six people cycled through the homeland security secretary position during his four years in office. So far, she appears to have strong backing from Republican senators, who will be crucial to her confirmation. Senator Rand Paul, the Republican chair of the Senate Homeland Security Committee where Noem will testify, said he expected a straightforward hearing. 'I'm not aware of any real specific complaints from the Democrats on Kristi Noem,' Paul said. 'I think there's a reasonable chance that she gets some Democrat support.' Still, Democrats are likely to question whether she is qualified to lead a department that is crucial to the country's safety. Senator Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat on the committee, said he had 'serious doubts' about her ability to manage 'this huge organization of such serious consequence to national security.' Noem in recent years became a regular presence in Trump's orbit and at one point was even considered to be his running mate. After becoming governor, Noem started working closely with Corey Lewandowski, Trump's 2016 campaign manager. Then, during the pandemic, she rose to prominence in conservative circles for resisting most government regulations to slow the spread of infections. The South Dakota governor has echoed Trump's tough immigration talk. 'Now, the situation at our southern border is nothing short of an invasion. And over the last four years, America's border security has been purposely weakened and ignored. Our laws have not been enforced,' Noem said during her State of the State address Tuesday. Noem joined other Republican governors who sent troops to Texas to assist Operation Lone Star, which sought to discourage migrants. The decision was met with criticism because Noem covered most of the deployment cost with a $1 million donation from a Tennessee billionaire who has often donated to Republicans.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-homeland-security-pick-faces-scrutiny-on-immigration-plans/7940464.html	2025-01-17T07:01:27-08:00	
Report: 67 journalists jailed for their work across Africa	WASHINGTON — At least 67 journalists are imprisoned across Africa, reflecting the continent’s ongoing struggle for a free press, according to a report released Thursday. The cases in Africa contribute to a global total of 361 journalists jailed as of Dec. 1, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. It is the second-highest number ever recorded by CPJ. Muthoki Mumo, the Africa program coordinator at CPJ, said the report highlights a global trend in which authoritarian regimes weaponize laws against journalists, using national security, anti-terror and cybercrime legislation to justify crackdowns. While these trends are not confined to Africa, the continent has seen alarming cases of journalists facing prosecution under such laws, said Mumo. Countries such as Burundi, Ethiopia and Nigeria are using legislation intended for public safety to criminalize journalism, Mumo said. In Nigeria, 'You have four journalists behind bars being prosecuted under cybercrime legislation in connection to their reporting on corruption,' Mumo told VOA in a video interview. And in Ethiopia, six journalists are behind bars. 'Five of them are facing prosecution under anti-terrorism laws. They could potentially face very harsh penalties if they are convicted,' said Mumo. Another trend, the media advocacy group says, is the use of vague and broad laws to target journalists. In Burundi, Sandra Muhoza, a reporter for the online media outlet La Nova Burundi was convicted under national security laws after posting a WhatsApp message. The case, said Mumo, is a clear example of the criminalization of journalism. Muhoza was convicted recently of trying to 'undermine the ‘integrity of the national territory’ — which is a mouthful — but it's essentially, a provision in Burundian laws about national security, and this was turned against this journalist,' Mumo said. VOA sent messages to Burundi’s government spokesperson, Jerome Niyonzima, along with the Ethiopian communication services minister, Legesse Tulu, and Eritrea’s information minister, Yemane Gebremeskel, requesting comment, but inquiries went unanswered. The Washington embassy of Nigeria has not yet responded to VOA requests for comment. The continent’s top jailers are familiar names, with Egypt topping the list as the worst jailer of journalists, with 17 held. 'In Egypt, we’ve seen anti-state laws being turned against the media,' Mumo said. Eritrea, known for its long-standing detention of journalists, follows closely behind, with 16 journalists behind bars — some since 2001. Eritrea is home to the longest-detained journalists in the world, many of whom have never been tried in court. 'That's a very dubious honor on the part of Eritrea that the journalists who have been behind jail the longest in the world are actually Eritreans,' Mumo said. Jodie Ginsberg, the head of CPJ, said it is important to keep advocating for those imprisoned in Eritrea. The country 'falls off the radar internationally,' she told VOA, 'Because of how little press freedom and media freedom there is to report on what's happening inside.' 'It's very easy sometimes to forget some of those longer cases. They go out of the public eye,' Ginsberg told VOA, adding that it is important to talk about 'places where journalists have been in jail for a very, very long time and still need to be fought for.' Ethiopia, where journalists have been held without trial for extended periods, is another major offender, along with Cameroon, Rwanda and Tunisia. In these countries, journalists are often detained under 'anti-state regulation, the use of false news regulations to throw a journalist behind bars and to prosecute them.' Mumo said. CPJ’s report highlights press freedom issues in Angola, where Carlos Raimundo Alberto, an editor who was arrested on Sept. 29, 2023, remains detained. Raimundo qualified for parole in November 2024 but has yet to comply with a court order to publicly apologize to a government official. And in Senegal, journalist Rene Capain Bassene has been jailed for life for a crime that witnesses said he could not have committed, the report said. Mumo said CPJ faces challenges accessing information in some regions about the state of media freedom. But, she said, 'It could also be about intimidation; family members and others who are aware of arrest may not always want to speak out about them.' Despite obstacles, she said, CPJ strives to keep the names of detained journalists alive. The media advocacy group calls on governments to respect the rights of journalists and make sure that their work is not criminalized. While the prison census offers a snapshot of the situation on a specific date, Mumo said the report alone cannot fully capture the often-fluid reality journalists face. The report offers a small window into the larger picture of press freedom, Mumo said, 'because there are journalists who go in and out of prison during other times of the year. They’re not reflected in this number.' VOA's Liam Scott contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-67-journalists-jailed-for-their-work-across-africa/7939697.html	2025-01-17T06:15:26-08:00	
Gaza is in ruins, and it's unclear how it will be rebuilt	Palestinians in the Gaza Strip are eager to leave miserable tent camps and return to their homes if a long-awaited ceasefire agreement halts the Israel-Hamas war, but many will find there is nothing left and no way to rebuild. Israeli bombardment and ground operations have transformed entire neighborhoods in several cities into rubble-strewn wastelands, with blackened shells of buildings and mounds of debris stretching away in all directions. Major roads have been plowed up. Critical water and electricity infrastructure is in ruins. Most hospitals no longer function. And it's unclear when — or even if — much will be rebuilt. The agreement for a phased ceasefire and the release of hostages held by Hamas-led militants does not say who will govern Gaza after the war, or whether Israel and Egypt will lift a blockade limiting the movement of people and goods that they imposed when Hamas seized power in 2007. The United Nations says that it could take more than 350 years to rebuild if the blockade remains. Two-thirds of all structures destroyed The full extent of the damage will only be known when the fighting ends and inspectors have full access to the territory. The most heavily destroyed part of Gaza, in the north, has been sealed off and largely depopulated by Israeli forces in an operation that began in early October. Using satellite data, the United Nations estimated last month that 69% of the structures in Gaza have been damaged or destroyed, including over 245,000 homes. The World Bank estimated $18.5 billion in damage — nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022 — from just the first four months of the war. Israel blames the destruction on Hamas, which ignited the war with its Oct. 7, 2023, attack into Israel, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 46,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were fighters. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The military has released photos and video footage showing that Hamas built tunnels and rocket launchers in residential areas, and often operated in and around homes, schools and mosques. Mountains of rubble to be moved Before anything can be rebuilt, the rubble must be removed — a staggering task in itself. The U.N. estimates that the war has littered Gaza with over 50 million tons of rubble — roughly 12 times the size of the Great Pyramid of Giza. With over 100 trucks working full time, it would take over 15 years to clear the rubble away, and there is little open space in the narrow coastal territory that is home to some 2.3 million Palestinians. Carting the debris away will also be complicated by the fact that it contains huge amounts of unexploded ordnance and other harmful materials, as well as human remains. Gaza's Health Ministry says thousands of people killed in airstrikes are still buried under the rubble. No plan for the day after The rubble clearance and eventual rebuilding of homes will require billions of dollars and the ability to bring construction materials and heavy equipment into the territory — neither of which is assured. The ceasefire agreement calls for a three- to five-year reconstruction project to begin in its final phase, after all the remaining 100 hostages have been released and Israeli troops have withdrawn from the territory. But getting to that point will require agreement on the second and most difficult phase of the deal, which still must be negotiated. Even then, the ability to rebuild will depend on the blockade, which critics have long decried as a form of collective punishment. Israel says it is needed to prevent Hamas from rebuilding its military capabilities, noting that cement and metal pipes can also be used for tunnels and rockets. Israel might be more inclined to lift the blockade if Hamas were no longer in power, but there are no plans for an alternative government. The United States and much of the international community want a revitalized Palestinian Authority to govern the West Bank and Gaza with the support of Arab countries ahead of eventual statehood. But that's a nonstarter for Israel's government, which is opposed to a Palestinian state and has ruled out any role in Gaza for the Western-backed authority. International donors are unlikely to invest in an ungoverned territory that has seen five wars in less than two decades, which means the sprawling tent camps along the coast could become a permanent feature of life in Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-is-in-ruins-and-it-s-unclear-how-it-will-be-rebuilt-/7940413.html	2025-01-17T05:59:25-08:00	
Army expects to meet recruiting goals, in dramatic turnaround, and denies 'wokeness' is a factor	The Army expects to meet its enlistment goals for 2025, marking a dramatic turnaround for a service that has struggled for several years to bring in enough young people and has undergone a major overhaul of its recruiting programs. In an interview with The Associated Press, Army Secretary Christine Wormuth said the Army is on pace to bring in 61,000 young people by the end of the fiscal year in September and will have more than 20,000 additional young people signed up in the delayed entry program for 2026. It's the second straight year of meeting the goals. 'What’s really remarkable is the first quarter contracts that we have signed are the highest rate in the last 10 years,' Wormuth said. 'We are going like gangbusters, which is terrific.' Wormuth, who took over the Army four years ago as restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic were devastating recruitment across the military, also flatly rejected suggestions that the Army is 'woke.' Critics have used the term to describe what they call an over-emphasis on diversity and equity programs. Some Republicans have blamed 'wokeness' for the recruiting struggles, a claim repeated by President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, during his confirmation hearing this week. Wormuth dismissed the claims. 'Concerns about the Army being, quote, woke, have not been a significant issue in our recruiting crisis,' she said. 'They weren’t at the beginning of the crisis. They weren’t in the middle of the crisis. They aren’t now. The data does not show that young Americans don’t want to join the Army because they think the army is woke — however they define that.' Hegseth has vowed to remove 'woke' programs and officers from the military. And during his hearing Tuesday, he told senators that troops will rejoice as the Trump administration takes office and makes those changes. 'We’ve already seen it in recruiting numbers,' he said. 'There’s already been a surge since President Trump won the election.' In fact, according to Army data, recruiting numbers have been increasing steadily over the past year, with the highest total in August 2024 — before the November election. Army officials closely track recruiting numbers. Instead, a significant driver of the recruiting success was the Army's decision to launch the Future Soldier Prep Course, at Fort Jackson, South Carolina, in August 2022. That program gives lower-performing recruits up to 90 days of academic or fitness instruction to help them meet military standards and move on to basic training. In the fiscal year that ended Sept. 30, 2024, the Army met its recruiting goal of 55,000 and began to rebuild its delayed entry pool. About 24% of those recruits came out of the prep course. Wormuth said she expects it will contribute about 30% of this year's recruits. The Army and the military more broadly have struggled with recruiting for about a decade, as the unemployment rate shrank, and competition grew from private companies able and willing to pay more and offer similar or better benefits. Just 23% of young adults are physically, mentally and morally qualified to serve without receiving some type of waiver. Moral behavior issues include drug use, gang ties or a criminal record. And the coronavirus pandemic shut down enlistment stations and in-person recruiting in schools and at public events that the military has long relied upon. Wormuth said a private survey along with more recent data show that the key impediments to joining the military are concerns 'about getting killed or getting hurt, leaving their friends and family, and having a perception that their careers will be on hold.' That survey, done in 2022, found that 'wokeness' was mentioned by just 5% of respondents. Wormuth acknowledged that the latest data show one element mentioned by Hegseth — that the number of white men enlisting is a bit lower. She said the persistent criticism about wokeness could be one reason. 'Any time an institution is being inaccurately criticized and demeaned, it’s going to make it harder to recruit. And I think that is what we have seen,' she said. 'In terms of ‘is the Army woke’ — which I will take to mean focused on things that don’t make us more lethal or effective or better able to defend this nation — I would say the Army is absolutely not woke.' As an example, she said recruits get one hour of equal opportunity instruction in basic training and 95 hours of marksmanship. She also said there has been an increase in minority enlistment. The service brought in the highest number ever of Hispanic recruits in 2024 and saw a 6% increase in Black recruiting. In 2022, the Army fell 15,000 short of its enlistment goal of 60,000. The following year, the service brought in a bit more than 50,000 recruits, widely missing its publicly stated 'stretch goal' of 65,000. The Navy and the Air Force all missed their recruitment targets in 2023, while the Marine Corps and the tiny Space Force have consistently hit their goals. Critics have also charged that the military has lowered standards under President Joe Biden's administration. Asked if that was true for the Army, Wormuth said the service actually resolved not to do that to meet its recruiting goals. Instead, she said, the prep course helps recruits meet the standards. Other changes that have helped the recruiting turnaround, she said, include an overhaul of the system used to select recruiters, which now chooses soldiers more suited to the task, as well as an increased use of data analytics to improve marketing and ads. The Army also increased the number of medical personnel being used to help process routine waivers to move them more quickly through the system. A consistent complaint across the military has been that it took too long to get a waiver approved and that recruits were moving on to other jobs as a result of the delays.	https://www.voanews.com/a/army-expects-to-meet-recruiting-goals-in-dramatic-turnaround-and-denies-wokeness-is-a-factor-/7940367.html	2025-01-17T05:17:19-08:00	
Biden sets record by commuting sentences of nearly 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug charges	Washington — President Joe Biden announced Friday that he was commuting the sentences of almost 2,500 people convicted of nonviolent drug offenses, using his final days in office on a flurry of clemency actions meant to nullify prison terms he deemed too harsh. The recent round of clemency gives Biden the presidential record for most individual pardons and commutations issued. The Democrat said he is seeking to undo 'disproportionately long sentences compared to the sentences they would receive today under current law, policy, and practice.' 'Today's clemency action provides relief for individuals who received lengthy sentences based on discredited distinctions between crack and powder cocaine, as well as outdated sentencing enhancements for drug crimes,' Biden said in a statement. 'This action is an important step toward righting historic wrongs, correcting sentencing disparities, and providing deserving individuals the opportunity to return to their families and communities after spending far too much time behind bars.' The White House did not immediately release the names of those receiving commutations. Still, Biden said more could yet be coming, promising to use the time before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated Monday to 'continue to review additional commutations and pardons.' Friday's action follows Biden's commutations last month of the sentences of roughly 1,500 people who were released from prison and placed on home confinement during the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the pardoning of 39 Americans convicted of nonviolent crimes. That was the largest single-day act of clemency in modern history. All of this comes as Biden continues to weigh whether to issue sweeping pardons for officials and allies who the White House fears could be unjustly targeted by Trump's administration. Though presidential pardoning powers are absolute, such a preemptive move would be a novel and risky use of the president's extraordinary constitutional power. Last month, Biden also commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people on federal death row, converting their punishments to life imprisonment just weeks before Trump, an outspoken proponent of expanding capital punishment, takes office. Trump has vowed to roll back that order after his term begins. Biden also recently pardoned his son Hunter, not just for his convictions on federal gun and tax violations but for any potential federal offense committed over an 11-year period, as the president feared Trump allies would seek to prosecute his son for other offenses. If history is any guide, meanwhile, Biden also is likely to issue more targeted pardons to help allies before leaving the White House, as presidents typically do in some of their final actions. Just before midnight on the final night of his first term, Trump, a Republican, signed a flurry of pardons and commutations for more than 140 people, including his former chief strategist, Steve Bannon, rappers Lil Wayne and Kodak Black and ex-members of Congress. Trump's final act as president in his first term was to announce a pardon for Al Pirro, ex-husband of Fox News Channel host Jeanine Pirro, one of his staunchest defenders. Al Pirro was convicted of conspiracy and tax evasion charges and sentenced to more than two years in prison in 2000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-sets-record-by-commuting-sentences-of-nearly-2-500-people-convicted-of-nonviolent-drug-charges-/7940333.html	2025-01-17T04:44:56-08:00	
Iranian president arrives in Moscow for treaty signing with Putin	MOSCOW — Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian arrived in Moscow on Friday for talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the signing of a strategic partnership treaty involving closer defense cooperation that is likely to worry the West. Pezeshkian, on his first Kremlin visit since winning the presidency last July, will hold talks with Putin focusing on bilateral ties and international issues before signing the treaty. Ahead of the talks, the Kremlin hailed its ever closer ties with Tehran. 'Iran is an important partner for us with which we are developing multifaceted co-operation,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters. Moscow has cultivated closer ties with Iran and other countries hostile towards the U.S., such as North Korea, since the start of the Ukraine war, and already has strategic pacts with Pyongyang and close ally Belarus, as well as a strategic partnership agreement with China. The 20-year Russia-Iran agreement is not expected to include a mutual defense clause of the kind sealed with Minsk and Pyongyang, but is still likely to concern the West which sees both countries as malign influences on the world stage. Moscow and Tehran say their increasingly close ties are not directed against other countries. Russia has made extensive use of Iranian drones during the war in Ukraine and the United States accused Tehran in September of delivering close-range ballistic missiles to Russia for use against Ukraine. Tehran denies supplying drones or missiles. The Kremlin has declined to confirm it has received Iranian missiles, but has acknowledged that its cooperation with Iran includes 'the most sensitive areas.' Pezeshkian visit to Moscow also comes at a time when Iranian influence across the Middle East is in retreat after Islamist rebels seized power in Syria, expelling ally Bashar al-Assad, and after Iran-backed Hamas has been pounded by Israel in Gaza. Israel has also inflicted serious damage on the Tehran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon. Russia too finds itself on the backfoot in Syria where it maintains two major military facilities crucial to its geopolitical and military influence in the Middle East and Africa but whose fate under Syria's new rulers is now uncertain. Putin met Pezeshkian on the sidelines of a BRICS summit in the Russian city of Kazan in October and at a cultural forum in Turkmenistan the same month. Pezeshkian, who is holding talks with Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin before meeting Putin, is accompanied to Moscow by his oil minister, and Western sanctions on the sector and the subject of how to circumvent them are likely to be discussed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iranian-president-arrives-in-moscow-for-treaty-signing-with-putin/7940267.html	2025-01-17T03:26:21-08:00	
Kyiv says Ukraine missiles hit army radars in Russia	Kyiv — Ukraine said Friday it had launched a missile strike one day earlier on the western Belgorod region targeting air defense systems and damaging military radars. Kyiv has stepped up its cross-border drone and missile attacks on Russian territory and said this week it had launched its largest barrage of the war on military sites and energy installations over the border. The Ukrainian General Staff wrote on social media that missile units had carried out 'precision strikes' on Russian military targets in Belgorod, which borders Ukraine. It said it had attacked air defense systems under the 568th anti-aircraft missile regiment and claimed that an S-400 radar had been damaged alongside equipment linked to another brigade. There was no immediate response from Moscow to the claims, which could not be verified by AFP. Moscow in turn has been targeting Ukrainian energy facilities and this week launched dozens of missiles and drones at sites mainly in western Ukraine near the border with Poland. Kyiv said Friday that its air defense systems had shot down 33 Russian drones over 11 Ukrainian region at night.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kyiv-says-ukraine-missiles-hit-army-radars-in-russia-/7940254.html	2025-01-17T03:15:42-08:00	
Russia upholds jail term for ex-US Consulate worker	MOSCOW — A Russian court on Friday upheld the jail term of Robert Shonov, a former U.S. Consulate worker sentenced to almost five years for 'secret collaboration with a foreign state.' Shonov, a Russian citizen, worked for more than 25 years at the U.S. Consulate in the far eastern city of Vladivostok until 2021, when Moscow imposed restrictions on local staff working for foreign missions. He was arrested in 2023 on suspicion of passing secret information about Russia's military offensive against Ukraine to the United States in exchange for money and sentenced to four years and 10 months prison in November 2024. 'The judicial act was upheld,' a court in the Siberian city of Novosibirsk ruled, according to its website, rejecting an appeal Shonov had made against his sentencing. The United States strongly condemned the conviction last year, calling it an 'egregious injustice' based on 'meritless allegations.' In September 2023, Russia expelled two U.S. diplomats it accused of acting as liaison agents for Shonov. In recent years, several U.S. citizens have been arrested and sentenced to long jail terms in Russia. Others are being held pending trial. Washington, which supports Ukraine militarily and financially against Russia's military offensive, accuses Moscow of arresting Americans on baseless charges to use as bargaining chips in prisoner exchanges. Even after a landmark prisoner swap in August, several U.S. nationals and dual nationals remain in detention in Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-upholds-jail-term-for-ex-us-consulate-worker/7940245.html	2025-01-17T02:57:35-08:00	
Russia sentences Navalny lawyers to years behind bars	PETUSHKI, RUSSIA — Russia on Friday sentenced three lawyers who had defended Alexey Navalny to several years in prison for bringing messages from the late opposition leader from prison to the outside world. The sentences come as Russia -- in the midst of a massive crackdown during its Ukraine offensive -- seeks to punish Navalny's associates since his unexplained death in an Arctic prison colony last February. Vadim Kobzev, Alexei Liptser and Igor Sergunin -- who were arrested in October 2023 -- were found guilty of participating in an 'extremist organization,' a court in the Russian town of Petushki ruled. Kobzev, the most high-profile member of Navalny's legal team, was given 5.5 years, while Liptser was handed five years and Sergunin 3.5 years. While serving his 19-year sentence, Navalny communicated with the world by transmitting messages through his lawyers which his team then published on social media. Authorities had moved him to a harsher prison regime that limited outside contact, before sending him to a remote colony above the Arctic Circle where he died. 'We are on trial for passing Navalny's thoughts to other people,' Kobzev said in court last week. The court said the men had 'used their status as lawyers while visiting convict Navalny ... to ensure the regular transfer of information between the members of the extremist community, including those wanted and hiding outside the Russian Federation, and Navalny.' 'Outrageous' It said this allowed Navalny to continue 'planning the preparation and creating conditions for committing crimes with an extremist character.' Navalny had condemned the arrests of the lawyers as 'outrageous' and part of a campaign to further isolate him in jail. The court proceedings, which opened in September in Petushki, a town about 115 kilometers east of Moscow, have been held behind closed doors. The verdicts come several days before four independent journalists accused of helping Navalny will be back in court, facing up to six years in prison. In his messages to the outside world, Navalny denounced the Kremlin's Ukraine offensive as 'criminal' and told supporters 'not to give up.' The texts from prison were also full of tongue-in-cheek dispatches of daily life behind bars. In his speech last week, Kobzev compared Moscow's current crackdown on dissent to Stalin-era mass repression. 'Eight years have passed... and in the Petushki court, people are once again on trial for discrediting officials and the state agencies,' he said, in a speech published by the Novaya Gazeta newspaper. 'Savage' sentences Another member of Navalny's former legal team, Olga Mikhailova, who is in exile, denounced the requested sentences as 'savage,' saying the men had 'honestly and professionally defended Navalny for many years.' Navalny's wife Yulia Navalnaya has vowed to continue his work. Last week, she said Russia has refused to remove her dead husband from its list of terrorists and extremists. She published a Dec. 16 letter from Russia's financial watchdog Rosfinmonitoring addressed to Navalny's mother that said that the late opposition leader was still being investigated for money laundering and 'financing terrorism.' 'Why does Putin need this? Obviously not to stop Alexei from opening a bank account. That is now impossible,' Navalnaya said. 'Putin is doing this to scare you. He wants you to be scared of even mentioning Alexei and for you to gradually forget his name.' Russia has added Navalnaya to the 'terrorists and extremists' blacklist. In 2021, Moscow banned Navalny's Anti-Corruption Foundation, known for investigations into the alleged corruption of Putin's officials, labeling it 'extremist.' He nearly died in 2020 after being poisoned on a campaign trip to Siberia ahead of regional elections. The West and Moscow were in talks about freeing Navalny in a prisoner exchange when he died. Several of his associates were later freed in the eventual deal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-sentences-navalny-lawyers-to-years-behind-bars/7940230.html	2025-01-17T02:31:17-08:00	
Report: Pakistan court sentences ex-PM Imran Khan to 14 years in land graft case	ISLAMABAD — A Pakistani court sentenced former Prime Minister Imran Khan to 14 years imprisonment on Friday in a land corruption case, local broadcaster ARY News reported. The verdict in the case, the largest in terms of financial wrongdoing faced by Khan, was delivered by an anti-graft court in a prison in the garrison city of Rawalpindi, where Khan has been jailed since August 2023. The former cricket star, 72, had been indicted on charges that he and his wife were gifted land by a real estate developer during his premiership from 2018 to 2022 in exchange for illegal favors. Khan and his wife, Bushra Bibi, had pleaded not guilty. The announcement of the verdict was delayed three times, most recently on Monday, amid talks between the government and Khan's party. Bushra Bibi, who is in her late 40s and was out on bail, was taken into custody after she was also convicted in the case, Geo News reported. 'Whilst we wait for detailed decision, it's important to note that, the Al Qadir Trust case against Imran Khan and Bushra Bibi lacks any solid foundation and is bound to collapse,' Khan's Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insafparty's foreign media wing said in a statement. The verdict is the biggest setback for Khan and his party since a surprisingly good showing in the 2024 general election when its candidates -- who were forced to contest as independents -- won the most seats but fell short of the majority needed to form a government. Jailed since August 2023, Khan has been facing dozens of cases ranging from charges of graft and misuse of power, to inciting violence against the state after being removed from office in a parliamentary vote of confidence in April 2022. He has either been acquitted or his sentences suspended in most cases, except for one on charges of inciting supporters to rampage through military facilities to protest against his arrest on May 9, 2023. His supporters have led several violent protest rallies since the May 9 incidents. He has been tried inside a jail on security grounds.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-pakistan-court-sentences-ex-pm-imran-khan-to-14-years-in-land-graft-case/7940194.html	2025-01-17T00:19:53-08:00

South Korea's Yoon refuses questioning as deadline looms on detention	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol on Friday again refused investigators' efforts to question him over his failed martial law bid, as the deadline on his detention neared. Yoon threw the nation into chaos on Dec. 3 when he attempted to impose martial law, citing the need to combat threats from 'anti-state elements.' But his bid lasted just six hours, as the soldiers he directed to storm parliament failed to stop lawmakers from voting to reject martial law. In the following weeks, Yoon was impeached by parliament and resisted arrest while holed up at his guarded residence, before becoming South Korea's first sitting president to be detained. The arrest warrant executed in Wednesday's dawn raid on Yoon's residence allowed investigators to hold Yoon for just 48 hours. But they are expected to seek a new warrant Friday that will likely extend his detention by 20 days, allowing prosecutors time to formalize an indictment against him. The Corruption Investigation Office is investigating him on possible charges of insurrection, which if found guilty could see him jailed for life or executed. The new warrant, if filed Friday, would keep Yoon in detention until at least a court hearing and ruling for its approval over the weekend. If the court rejects it after the hearing, he would be released. The CIO had called Yoon for questioning at 10 a.m. local time (0100 GMT) Friday, Yonhap news agency reported, but his lawyer Yoon Kab-keun told AFP he had refused to appear for the second consecutive day. CIO officials did not immediately respond to AFP requests for comment. Another lawyer, Seok Dong-hyeon, told reporters Friday Yoon had already explained his position to investigators and had no reason to answer their questions. 'The president will not appear at the CIO today. He has sufficiently expressed his basic stance to the investigators on the first day,' he said. Yoon was questioned for hours Wednesday but exercised his right to silence before refusing to appear for interrogation the next day. Yoon's supporters gathered outside the court Friday where investigators were expected to file for the new warrant, linking arms in an apparent attempt to block them, the Yonhap news agency reported. Impeachment trial Yoon had evaded arrest for weeks by remaining in his residential compound, protected by loyal members of the Presidential Security Service (PSS). Hundreds of CIO investigators and police surrounded his compound on Wednesday in a second, and ultimately successful, effort to arrest him. When he was detained, Yoon said he had agreed to leave his compound to avoid 'bloodshed,' but that he did not accept the legality of the investigation. The opposition Democratic Party celebrated Yoon's arrest, with a top official calling it 'the first step' to restoring constitutional and legal order. In a Facebook post on Wednesday after his detention, Yoon repeated unfounded election fraud claims and referred to 'hostile' nations threatening the country, alluding to North Korea. Although Yoon won presidential elections in 2022, the Democratic Party won parliamentary elections in April last year by a landslide. In a parallel probe, the Constitutional Court is deciding whether to uphold Yoon's impeachment. If that happens, Yoon would lose the presidency and fresh elections would have to be held within 60 days. He did not attend the first two hearings this week. The trial is continuing in Yoon's absence and proceedings could last for months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-s-yoon-refuses-questioning-as-deadline-looms-on-detention-/7940189.html	2025-01-17T00:03:22-08:00	
Chinese economic growth among slowest in decades	BEIJING — China recorded one of its slowest rates of economic growth in decades last year, data showed Friday, as leaders nervously eye a potential trade standoff with incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Beijing has in recent months announced its most aggressive support measures in years in a bid to reignite an economy that has suffered on multiple fronts, including a prolonged property market debt crisis and sluggish consumer spending. But the economy grew 5% last year, official data from Beijing's National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) showed Friday, slightly above the 4.9% forecast in an AFP survey of analysts. Still, the figure was lower than the 5.2% recorded in 2023. The growth took place in the face of a 'complicated and severe environment with increasing external pressures and internal difficulties,' the NBS said. The economy was still facing 'difficulties and challenges,' officials admitted. Retail sales, a key gauge of consumer sentiment, rose 3.5% -- a major slump from the 7.2% growth seen in 2023 -- though industrial output increased 5.8%, from 4.6% the previous year. However, the 5.4% jump in economic growth seen in the final four months far outpaced the 5% forecast in a Bloomberg survey and was much better than the same period in 2023. The data provided 'mixed messages,' Zhiwei Zhang, president of Pinpoint Asset Management, said. Beijing's recent policy shift had 'helped the economy to stabilize in (the fourth quarter), but it requires large and persistent policy stimulus to boost economic momentum and sustain the recovery,' he said. Zichun Huang, China economist at Capital Economics, said she expected growth to 'continue accelerating in the coming months.' 'The government's property support measures seem to be providing some relief, with the pace of house price falls slowing and new home sales showing some recovery,' she said. Trouble ahead? The GDP growth rate is the lowest recorded by China since 1990, excluding the financially tumultuous years of the COVID-19 pandemic. And the analysts surveyed by AFP estimated growth could fall to just 4.4% in 2025, and even drop below 4% the following year. China has so far failed to rebound from the pandemic, with domestic spending mired in a slump and indebted local governments dragging on growth. In a rare bright spot, official data showed earlier this week that exports reached a historic high last year. But gathering storm clouds over the country's massive trade surplus mean Beijing may not be able to count on overseas shipments to boost an otherwise lackluster economy. Trump, who will begin his second term next week, has promised to unleash heavy sanctions on China. 'We still expect growth to slow for 2025 as a whole, with Trump likely to follow through on his tariff threats soon and persistent structural imbalances still weighing on the economy,' Huang said. Beijing has introduced a series of measures in recent months to bolster the economy, including cutting key interest rates, easing local government debt and expanding subsidy programs for household goods. Confidence 'crisis' Observers were closely watching Friday's data release for signs those measures succeeded in reviving activity. 'With a package of incremental policies being timely rolled out ... social confidence was effectively bolstered and the economy recovered remarkably,' the NBS said. China's central bank has indicated in recent weeks that 2025 will see it implement further rate cuts, part of a key shift characterized by a 'moderately loose' monetary policy stance. But analysts warn more efforts are needed to boost domestic consumption as the outlook for Chinese exports becomes more uncertain. 'Monetary policy support alone is unlikely to right the economy,' Harry Murphy Cruise of Moody's Analytics told AFP. 'China is suffering from a crisis of confidence, not one of credit; families and firms do not have the confidence in the economy to warrant borrowing, regardless of how cheap it is to do so,' he wrote. 'To that end, fiscal supports are needed to grease the economy's wheels.' One component of Beijing's newest policy toolbox is a subsidy scheme -- now expanded to include more household items including rice cookers and microwave ovens -- that it hopes will encourage spending. But recent data shows that government efforts have not yet achieved a full rebound in consumer activity. China narrowly avoided a slip into deflation in December, statistics authorities said last week, with prices rising at their slowest pace in nine months. China emerged from a four-month period of deflation in February, a month after suffering the sharpest fall in prices for 14 years. Deflation can pose a threat to the broader economy as consumers tend to postpone purchases under such conditions, hoping for further reductions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-economic-growth-among-slowest-in-decades/7940184.html	2025-01-16T23:49:40-08:00	
Chinese vice president to attend Trump inauguration	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China said Friday that Vice President Han Zheng will attend U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration Monday. Beijing said the move follows 'the principles of mutual respect, peaceful coexistence and win-win cooperation in viewing and growing its relationship with the United States.' 'We stand ready to work with the new U.S. government to enhance dialogue and communication, properly manage differences, expand mutually beneficial cooperation, jointly pursue a stable, healthy and sustainable China-U.S. relationship and find the right way for the two countries to get along with each other,' a Foreign Affairs Ministry spokesperson said in a Friday morning statement. The announcement comes more than a month after Trump invited Chinese President Xi Jinping and other foreign leaders to attend his inauguration. It is an unprecedented move that marks a break from tradition, since foreign ambassadors have historically attended presidential inaugurations. Analysts say Beijing is showing 'goodwill' toward the new Trump administration by sending Han. 'China has no established tradition of letting the president attend other heads of state’s inauguration ceremonies,' said Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at the Center for International Security and Strategy at Tsinghua University in Beijing. 'Sending the vice president to attend Trump’s inauguration ceremony is the best option and it shows Beijing’s goodwill to President-elect Trump,' he told VOA by phone. While Beijing tries to respond positively to Trump’s invitation, other experts say Han’s attendance will remain largely ceremonial. 'I don’t expect anything concrete out of Han’s trip to Washington,' said Zhiqun Zhu, an expert on Chinese foreign policy at Bucknell University in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. Despite the ceremonial nature of Han’s attendance at the inauguration, Zhu said Beijing’s move could still 'lay a good foundation' for U.S.-China relations under the second Trump administration. 'Hopefully, a friendly atmosphere will be built and can be sustained in the weeks and months ahead, so when the two sides sit down to discuss substantive issues, maybe a deal could be struck,' he told VOA by phone. Trump’s return to the White House has created uncertainties for China, which has faced a persistent economic downturn in recent years. During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to impose tariffs up to 60% on Chinese products. Zhou said the possibility of high tariffs has made Beijing cautious about the prospect of U.S.-China relations under the second Trump administration. 'We don’t know how Trump will play his cards, so I believe China will wait to see how his policies towards China play out,' he told VOA. Despite threatening to impose tariffs on Chinese imports, Trump said the two could have a good relationship and that he has been in contact with the Chinese leaders through representatives. 'And I think we will probably get along very well, I predict,' he said during an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Jan. 6, adding that the relationship has to be 'a two-way street.' Additionally, Trump wants to appoint several politicians known for hawkish stances on China, including Sen. Marco Rubio as secretary of state and Rep. Mike Waltz to be White House national security adviser. Rubio, during his Senate confirmation hearing Wednesday, described China as 'the most potent and dangerous near-peer adversary this nation has ever confronted.' 'They have elements that the Soviet Union never possessed. They are a technological adversary and competitor, an industrial competitor, an economic competitor, a geopolitical competitor, a scientific competitor,' he said. Despite Rubio’s seemingly tough rhetoric on China during the hearing, Zhu said it is too early to tell whether that language will translate into actual policies toward China in the new administration. 'Some of the appointees by Trump seem hawkish on China but since they work for Trump, I don’t think they will override Trump’s policies,' he told VOA. Zhu said since it remains unclear how Trump will shape his policies toward China, Washington and Beijing will 'move ahead cautiously. 'Both sides had a terrible experience during Trump’s first term so it looks like they want to start afresh this time,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-vice-president-to-attend-trump-inauguration/7940175.html	2025-01-16T23:24:29-08:00

Israel agrees to hostage deal with Hamas	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu says a deal to return hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip has been reached, clearing a hurdle toward a ceasefire aimed at ending the 15-month war between the two sides. A statement released early Friday by the prime minister’s office said Netanyahu 'was informed by the negotiating team that agreements have been reached on a deal to release the hostages.' It said Netanyahu’s political-security Cabinet will meet Friday to approve the deal. If approved, the ceasefire agreement would begin Sunday with the exchange of Israeli hostages for Palestinian prisoners, after which the terms of a permanent end to the conflict would be finalized. Two developments Thursday appeared to threaten the start of the ceasefire and the initial release of hostages. First, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused the militants of backtracking on parts of the agreement. A statement from Netanyahu’s office said Hamas was trying to 'extort last-minute concessions.' Netanyahu's office accused Hamas of backtracking on an understanding that he said would give Israel a veto over which Palestinian prisoners convicted of murder would be released in exchange for hostages held by the U.S.-designated terror group. A short time later, Izzat al-Rishq, a senior Hamas official denied the claim, saying the militant group 'is committed to the ceasefire agreement, which was announced by the mediators.' Second, Israel’s far-right National Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir said he would resign from Netanyahu’s government if it ratified the ceasefire deal. In a televised statement, he said the deal was 'reckless' and would 'erase the achievements of the war.' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Thursday he is confident that a Gaza ceasefire and hostage release deal agreed to by Israel and Hamas will start as scheduled on Sunday. 'I am confident, and I fully expect that implementation will begin, as we said, on Sunday,' Blinken told reporters in Washington at his farewell news conference as America’s top diplomat. 'It's not exactly surprising that in a process and negotiation that has been this challenging and this fraught, you may get a loose end,' Blinken said. 'We're tying up that loose end as we speak.' Even with the prospective ceasefire days away, Palestinian medics said Israeli forces carried out multiple airstrikes Thursday in Gaza, killing at least 77 people. If the ceasefire takes hold, U.N. agencies said they were ready to surge humanitarian aid to Palestinians in Gaza, where the United Nations says at least 1.9 million of the 2.3 million people living there have been displaced and 92% of housing units have been destroyed. Israeli President Isaac Herzog offered his strong support for the ceasefire after the deal was announced Wednesday. 'As the president of the State of Israel, I say in the clearest terms: This is the right move,' he said. 'This is an important move. This is a necessary move. There is no greater moral, human, Jewish, or Israeli obligation than to bring our sons and daughters back to us — whether to recover at home, or to be laid to rest.' The first phase of the agreement includes a 42-day ceasefire, the release of 33 hostages from Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israel, a phased Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and an increased flow of aid for Palestinian civilians. During the first phase, there will be negotiations on the details of a second phase focused on bringing a permanent end to the conflict with the release of the remaining hostages and a full Israeli troop withdrawal. A final phase concerns rebuilding Gaza, with a new governing and security structure. The war in Gaza began when Hamas sent its fighters into Israel in an Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed more than 1,200 people and led to the abduction of about 250 hostages. Of those hostages, just under 100 are thought to remain in Hamas custody but about one-third are believed to be dead. Gaza authorities say nearly 47,000 Palestinians – most of them children and women – have been killed in Israeli military operations. Israel, without providing evidence, says the death toll includes 17,000 militants it has killed. In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which includes the families of 98 hostages, said Wednesday it welcomes 'with overwhelming joy and relief the agreement to bring our loved ones home.' 'However, deep anxiety and concerns accompany us regarding the possibility that the agreement might not be fully implemented, leaving hostages behind,' the statement continued. 'We urgently call for swift arrangements to ensure all phases of the deal are carried out.' A senior official with the outgoing administration of U.S. President Joe Biden told reporters that two of the living American hostages – Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen – will be among the first hostages released. The official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, as is customary in such briefings. Some information for this story came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-agrees-to-hostage-deal-with-hamas/7940136.html	2025-01-16T20:40:32-08:00

Inaugural balls, protests planned in Washington	washington — Washington has been bracing for lots of things this week, including several more days of frigid temperatures and hordes of people and police for the presidential inauguration and related protests around the city next week. Officials said this week that they expected about 250,000 ticketed people to descend on the U.S. capital as Donald Trump takes the oath of office as president again. He last served from 2017 to 2021. Fewer visitors are expected for next Monday's ceremony than were present at Trump’s first inauguration, local and federal officials said at a press conference. In 2017, they prepared for more than 1 million people. Temperatures are expected to be particularly low in Washington on Monday. The temperature at noon, when Trump will be sworn in, is predicted to be in the low 20s F, which is about 20 degrees below normal. Enhanced security Even though a lower turnout is expected this time around, recent acts of violence — like the New Year’s Day attack in New Orleans — mean there will be an enhanced security presence, the officials said. On Inauguration Day, 25,000 law enforcement and military personnel will be in the District of Columbia to provide security, including the full activation of D.C. police, 7,800 National Guard troops and about 4,000 officers from around the country, according to William McCool, the special agent in charge of the Secret Service’s Washington Field Office. Leading up to the inauguration, Washington will be home to both celebratory events and protests. A Trump victory rally is planned for Sunday afternoon at Capital One Arena, where the Village People, an American band, will perform. The arena has 20,000 seats, Monumental Sports & Entertainment, the company that operates the arena, told a D.C. news station. The company said in a statement to News4 that the arena has been offered to every administration, 'irrespective of party,' for decades. 'We are happy that President Trump has accepted our offer, and we will welcome him and his guests to Capital One Arena on January 19,' the statement said. While there will be three official inaugural balls, more than a dozen unofficial inaugural balls are scheduled throughout the weekend in Washington. However, protests are scheduled, too. On Saturday, a demonstration called the People’s March is expected to draw tens of thousands of people to downtown Washington. The demonstration is organized by various civil rights, racial justice and reproductive health groups. 'As Trump assumes the presidency in January, we are gathering to mobilize our collective power and stand against his efforts to roll back our rights and freedoms,' Analilia Mejia, co-executive director of the Center for Popular Democracy, said in a statement. On Monday, the Answer Coalition’s National Day of Action will feature a rally and march, according to media reports. Accustomed to crowds Washington officials said they’re used to managing crowds and protests. 'Here in the city, we allow peaceful protests all the time,' D.C. Police Chief Pamela Smith said at a press conference this week. 'But when it comes to violating the law, we’re just not going to tolerate it.' On Monday night, after the inauguration, Trump is expected to shuttle among the three official inaugural balls. But inauguration celebrations won’t be limited to Washington. For instance, in Florida, where Trump resides at his Mar-a-Lago resort, the pro-Trump Villages M.A.G.A. Club is hosting an inaugural party on Monday evening, about 60 miles northwest of Orlando. The celebration has already sold out, according to an Eventbrite listing advertising the party.	https://www.voanews.com/a/inaugural-balls-protests-planned-in-washington/7940103.html	2025-01-16T19:17:35-08:00

Siberian air to make Trump swearing-in coldest in 40 years	The vast majority of Americans are about to get an extended taste of frigid Siberian weather. Another polar vortex disruption will stretch Arctic air across the top of the globe and make Donald Trump's second inauguration the coldest in 40 years, meteorologists said. After starting in the Rockies Thursday night, the cold will blast eastward and as far south as the upper Florida peninsula over several days. Up to 280 million Americans will have a day or two where it's colder than Anchorage, Alaska, said private meteorologist Ryan Maue. 'This would be one of the coldest outbreaks certainly of the past 10 years, 15 years,' said winter weather expert Judah Cohen of Atmospheric Environmental Research. 'It's pulling air out of Siberia. And, you know, that's consistent with these stretches, because when the polar vortex stretches, the flow starts in Siberia and ends in the United States.' It will arrive in Washington well before Trump's inauguration Monday outside the U.S. Capitol. The National Weather Service is predicting the temperature to be around minus 6 degrees Celsius at noon during the swearing-in, the coldest since Ronald Reagan's second inauguration saw temperatures plunge to minus 14 Celsius. The temperature for Barack Obama's 2009 swearing-in was minus 2 Celsius. But that's not all - the wind is forecast to be 48 to 56 kilometers per hour. 'The wind chills would be in the single digits for sure,' the NWS's Weather Prediction Center meteorologist Zack Taylor said. 'That's going to be cold, blustery, basically right up the National Mall. And it can get pretty breezy on the mall there with the west-northwest wind right in the face.' Washington could see single digits later; Wednesday morning might get near zero, Maue said. There could be a record low in Baltimore, Taylor said. He said most of the records that will be broken in this cold outbreak are not likely to be overnight lows, but still chilly daytime highs. About 80 million people are likely to have subzero temperatures at some point, Maue said. 'The coldest will be Tuesday morning for the Lower 48 overall,' Maue said. The average low that morning for the entire Lower 48 will be around minus 14 degrees Celsius, he said. Maue said a stretch from Chicago to Indianapolis to Columbus, Ohio, to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, will get the most brutal cold compared with their normal temperatures. 'That's like a corridor of extreme cold, calm winds at night over snow cover. Temperatures could really drop like a rock there,' Maue said. Freezes could go as far as the Gulf Coast and northern Florida, meteorologists said. Earlier this month, long-range forecasts hinted at worst-in-30-years type of cold for the year's first week, but those predictions eased as the cold outbreak got closer. It was cold, but not near record levels. This time, it's the opposite. Each day's computer models show it colder than the previous one, Maue said. There's some possibility of snow squalls here and there, but it's mostly just going to be cold, Taylor said — what Maue called a dry cold. As happened earlier this month, this cold snap comes from a disruption in the polar vortex, the ring of cold air usually trapped about the North Pole. That ring is being stretched south across North America like a rubber band, Cohen said. These stretching events are happening more often in the past decade or so, Cohen said. He and others have linked these polar vortex outbreaks to human-caused climate change and decreasing pressure and temperature differences between the Arctic and the rest of the globe. Those also trigger changes in the jet stream — the river of air that usually brings weather from west to east — that make cold air and weather systems plunge from north to south like a roller coaster. On the east side of that plunge is cold air and potentially record high pressure, Taylor and others said. On the west side, in Southern California, is not only warmer air but also the extreme pressure differences that could goose the already high winds that are fanning fires around Los Angeles, meteorologists said. Get used to it. There's some debate among meteorologists about how long this extreme cold outbreak will last but below-normal temperatures may stick around through the end of the month for much of the country, said University of Oklahoma meteorology professor Jason Furtado, who organized winter weather workshops at the American Meteorological Society's annual conference in New Orleans. And Cohen said long-range forecasts suggest the same polar vortex conditions could return in early February.	https://www.voanews.com/a/siberian-air-to-make-trump-swearing-in-coldest-in-40-years-/7940067.html	2025-01-16T18:49:54-08:00

Under current law, the service's parent company, China-based ByteDance, must either sell TikTok to a non-Chinese firm or see it banned in the U.S. Representative Mike Waltz, who has been tapped to serve as Trump's national security adviser, told Fox News on Thursday that the president-elect has options available to postpone enforcement of the law while a possible deal is worked out to sell the company. That includes a section of the law allowing the president to give ByteDance a 90-day extension to finalize a sale. 'We will put measures in place to keep TikTok from going dark,' Waltz said, 'as long as a viable deal is on the table. Essentially that buys President Trump time to keep TikTok going.' Executive action reportedly considered Also on Wednesday, several media outlets reported that Trump is considering issuing an executive order that would protect TikTok. The legality of such a move is unclear and is thrown further into doubt by the fact that the Supreme Court is poised to rule on a request by the company to overturn the law. The high court heard arguments in the case last week and is expected to rule shortly. The outcome is not certain. However, in oral arguments, a majority of the justices appeared to favor upholding the law. Trump's attitude toward TikTok has evolved considerably over the years. During his first term in office, he attempted to shut the service down in the U.S. Since then, though, he has used the service, with considerable success, to connect with his supporters. In a press conference in Florida last month, Trump said, 'I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,' and credited the app with helping him get his message out to younger American voters. Trump has denied that his change of heart about TikTok was influenced by a brief meeting in March with Republican megadonor and ByteDance investor Jeff Yass. Lobbying disclosure reports from 2024 show that ByteDance paid a former Trump campaign aide to lobby lawmakers in Washington in favor of TikTok, and that former senior Trump aide Kellyanne Conway has been paid to advocate for TikTok in Congress via the Yass-funded conservative group Club for Growth. Trump also said TikTok was not mentioned during his meeting with Yass. Economic concerns In the years since TikTok took off, thousands of U.S.-based content creators have developed large audiences on the app, and in many cases have been able to monetize their TikTok feeds. Many small businesses have found success advertising their products to TikTok users. Other TikTok personalities have parlayed fame on the app into broader celebrity that has led to lucrative product endorsements and other deals. Some members of Congress have expressed concern that abruptly shutting the app down could have economic consequences. On Monday, Democratic Senator Edward Markey introduced legislation that would delay the TikTok ban by 270 days. 'Let me be clear: TikTok has its problems,' Markey said in a statement released by his office. 'Like every social media platform, TikTok poses a serious risk to the privacy and mental health of our young people. I will continue to hold TikTok accountable for such behavior. But a TikTok ban would impose serious consequences on millions of Americans who depend on the app for social connections and their economic livelihood. We cannot allow that to happen.' Viability of sale unclear As the Sunday deadline nears, there have been a number of rumors about a possible sale of the company. Bloomberg reported on Wednesday that Chinese officials were considering the possibility of selling the service to billionaire Elon Musk, a close Trump adviser who already owns the social media service X, formerly Twitter. Another U.S. billionaire, real estate developer Frank McCourt, told Reuters on Thursday that a consortium of investors he had formed has already made a formal offer to purchase TikTok, valuing the service at $20 billion. However, it is far from clear that a sale is something the Chinese government is prepared to allow. Any sale worth the buyer's investment would have to include the 'recommendation engine,' TikTok's name for the algorithm that makes the service so popular and, many would say, addictive. Last year in a court filing, TikTok characterized such a deal as unavailable. 'Just as the United States restricts the export of U.S.-origin technologies (e.g., certain computer chips), the Chinese government regulates the transfer of technologies developed in China,' the company argued in a court filing. 'The Chinese government has made clear in public statements that it would not permit a forced divestment of the recommendation engine.' Privacy, national security worries A wildly popular service for sharing short videos, TikTok has an estimated 170 million U.S. users. Federal officials have been concerned about TikTok for years because it collects vast amounts of information about its user base. They have argued that Chinese laws compelling domestic companies to cooperate with intelligence agencies could be used to force the company to share that data with the Chinese Communist Party. U.S. officials have expressed concern that China could misuse the private information about U.S. users of the service. They have also warned that Beijing could use TikTok's powerful recommendation algorithm to shape public discourse in the U.S. to the benefit of China. In December, when a federal appeals court upheld the law mandating the company's sale or shutdown, Democratic Representative Raja Krishnamoorthi, one of the original sponsors of the law, released a statement expressing the thoughts of many of the law's supporters. 'With today's opinion, all three branches of government have reached the same conclusion: ByteDance is controlled by the Chinese Communist Party, and TikTok's ownership by ByteDance is a national security threat that cannot be mitigated through any other means than divestiture,' Krishnamoorthi said. 'Every day that TikTok remains under the Chinese Communist Party's control is a day that our security is at risk,' Krishnamoorthi added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-team-might-step-in-to-save-tiktok-from-pending-us-ban-/7940010.html	2025-01-16T17:11:14-08:00

Cuba releases prominent dissident from prison	Jose Daniel Ferrer, one of Cuba’s most prominent political prisoners and leader of Patriotic Union of Cuba, was released Thursday from prison after 3½ years. 'I am fine, surrounded by family and friends,' he told The Associated Press by phone. Ferrer, 54, is the director of the Patriotic Union of Cuba. 'I am going to continue the nonviolent struggle for freedom and democracy.' Ferrer’s release was secured by a deal between Cuba, the Vatican and the Biden administration. On Tuesday, the White House announced it would lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism. The move was designed to expedite a Vatican-brokered deal to release Cuban political prisoners. Havana told Pope Francis it would gradually free 553 convicts. It added that the gesture was unrelated to the U.S. announcement. The releases began on Wednesday, and so far more than 30 people have been freed, according to Cuban civilian groups. The lifting of Cuba’s terrorism designation could be reversed by the incoming Trump administration. Senator Marco Rubio, Trump’s choice to lead the U.S. State Department, is an advocate of sanctions on Cuba. Rubio’s family is Cuban, but they left the country before the communist revolution. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cuba-releases-prominent-dissident-from-prison-/7940009.html	2025-01-16T16:28:51-08:00	
Britain, Ukraine sign 100-year agreement	Britain and Ukraine signed a 100-year agreement Thursday, with Britain pledging to provide Ukraine with $3.6 billion in military aid this year. The deal was announced during a joint news conference in Kyiv, Ukraine, at the presidential palace where British Prime Minister Keir Starmer joined Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Starmer is on his first trip to Ukraine since he took office. Starmer called the agreement historic and said the new partnership 'reflects the huge affection that exists between our two nations.' The partnership will include cooperation in the areas of culture, education, science and technology. Regarding military assistance for Kyiv's war against Russia, Starmer said Britain plans to provide Ukraine with a loan of more than $2.6 billion. He said the loan 'will be paid back not by Ukraine, but from the interest on frozen Russian assets.' Starmer also announced that Britain was providing Ukraine with 150 artillery gun barrels and a new mobile air defense system. In his comments, Starmer credited Ukraine's allies, particularly the United States, for contributing to the success Ukraine has had against 'aggression from Russia.' He said he wanted to pay tribute to the U.S. for 'the work that the U.S. has done here, the support that they have put in, because it's been a vital component of what has been quite an incredible achievement by Ukraine.' The comments came just days before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, a critic of U.S. support for Ukraine, takes office and a day after the new president's pick to be the U.S. secretary of state, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, told a Senate panel the war must end. Speaking at his confirmation hearing, Rubio called the conflict a 'war of attrition' and a 'stalemate' that must be ended. He said the first step should be a ceasefire that halts ground fighting, which has for more than a year mostly occurred in eastern Ukraine. Rubio called the destruction in Ukraine 'extraordinary,' saying it will 'take a generation to rebuild.' 'The truth of the matter is that in this conflict, there is no way Russia takes all of Ukraine,' Rubio said. 'It's also unrealistic to believe that somehow, a nation the size of Ukraine ... is also going to push these people all the way back to where they were on the eve of the invasion.' Even as he argued for a negotiated settlement to end the fighting that started with Russia's invasion in February 2022, Rubio said it was unlikely that there would be much change in the current battle lines. Russia currently holds about a fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian land mass. Democrats, and some Republicans on the committee, continued to voice their support for more military aid to Ukraine, saying it was important to give Kyiv leverage in any eventual peace talks with Moscow. But Rubio said that one of Ukraine's key problems was not a shortage of ammunition or money but its inability to train and recruit enough troops. At Thursday's news conference in Kyiv, Zelenskyy refused to speculate on what U.S. support for Ukraine will look like under a Trump administration. 'It is too early to talk about the details, because we have not yet had a detailed conversation with the new U.S. administration about security guarantees,' he said. Trump has voiced skepticism about continued U.S. military support for Kyiv and repeatedly vowed that he would end the war when he assumed the presidency on Monday. In recent days, his aides have said the new timeline is ending the war in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be by the end of April. Ken Bredemeier and Chris Hannas contributed to this report.

US sanctions Sudan army leader, citing atrocities	washington — Washington has slapped sanctions on Sudan's army leader, citing his responsibility for war crimes in a conflict that has bled the oil-rich country dry over the last year — sparking a famine, killing tens of thousands of people and driving millions from their homes — just a week after the U.S. sanctioned his opponent for acts it described as genocide. Thursday's sanctions on Sudanese Armed Forces leader Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and a Hong-Kong-based weapons supplier block them from entering or transiting the United States and restrict their access to any U.S. assets. This leaves both sides economically restrained in this brutal conflict that the State Department has described as the world's worst humanitarian crisis, but where Washington's options are limited because of its strained diplomatic ties to the large African nation. This conflict also has drawn in outside players, with Egypt and the United Arab Emirates arming the rivals. During his final press conference on Thursday, Secretary of State Antony Blinken accused the SAF of war crimes. In last week's sanctions, the State Department accused the opposing Rapid Support Forces of genocide. 'The SAF has also committed war crimes, and it continues to target civilians,' Blinken said. 'It's obstructed the advancement of the peace process. It's refused to participate on numerous occasions in ceasefire talks that we've sought to convene, and together with the RSF, it's caused what is the world's worst humanitarian crisis that people are suffering through every day. And we believe strongly, as we said, there's no military solution to this conflict.' 'Flawed' action, Sudan says Sudan's government expressed its objection to the sanctions, calling them 'flawed,' 'unethical' and 'dubious.' 'This decision lacks the basic principles of justice and objectivity, relying on implausible pretexts,' read its statement, which was posted on social media platform X. 'It also reflects a blatant disregard for the Sudanese people, who stand firmly united behind General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan as a symbol of their sovereignty and armed forces, and as a courageous leader in the battle for dignity against the terrorist Janjaweed militias.' Blinken did not address U.S. media reports citing anonymous U.S. officials that the SAF has used chemical weapons at least twice. VOA's query to the National Security Council went unanswered Thursday. When asked by reporters whether both sides were equally responsible, Blinken replied, 'The actions we took on the RSF, as you know, found a determination of genocide. The actions that we're looking at for the SAF go to war crimes. So there are gradations in these things, and we follow the law.' And Blinken expressed regrets that this conflict has escalated. It has followed many of the same contours as the Darfur conflict at the turn of the century. 'It is, for me, yes, another real regret that when it comes to Sudan, we haven't been able on our watch to get to that day of success,' he said. He added, 'We'll keep working it for the next three days, and I hope the next administration will take that on as well.' Hemedti sanctioned Last week's sanctions targeted RSF leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo, whom the White House named as the leader of a wave of renewed ethnic cleansing, rape and systematic atrocities. Daglo, who is better known by his nickname, Hemedti, was a commander in the Janjaweed militia considered largely responsible for the brutal Darfur conflict, in which Sudanese Arab Janjaweed militias used scorched-earth tactics on the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa people of Western Sudan, killing at least 200,000. The scale and savagery of the violence prompted the International Criminal Court to issue its first-ever warrant for genocide to Sudan's then-president, Omar al-Bashir. Hemedti led the RSF as a paramilitary unit until the April 2023 clash with government forces that sparked the current conflict. The violence has plunged nearly 640,000 people into the misery of famine, the State Department said. And the United Nations estimates that 30 million people — more than half of the nation's population — need humanitarian assistance. Daniel Volman, director of the African Security Research Project, told VOA it's 'unlikely' that the incoming Trump administration will impose further sanctions. He said the U.S. and its allies bear some responsibility for 'the conflict escalating to genocidal heights.' 'I think that the United States, under both Democratic and Republican administrations, bears a major responsibility for failing to take effective action against the Bashir regime [which created the RSF and carried out the first genocide in Darfur] and for failing to take effective action to support the civil society groups fighting for a democratic government, which led to the current civil war,' he said by email. 'The United States is not alone in bearing responsibility. Russia, Iran and other countries are also arming the rival forces and prolonging the conflict.' Complicating factor And, Volman said, the Biden administration's decision to sanction some of Hemedti's foreign backers by targeting companies based in the United Arab Emirates is also a complicating factor. 'The involvement of Egypt and the UAE in arming the rival forces and prolonging the civil war will complicate the Trump administration's relations with these two key allies and may lead them to expand and escalate their military intervention in Sudan,' he said. Andrew Payne, a lecturer in foreign policy and security at City, University of London, told VOA that for now, sanctions are the main tool that Washington has to constrain Khartoum. 'Sanctions are an easy tool that make it appear like an administration is doing something, regardless of whether that is an appropriate tool to use. It's relatively cost-free to the United States. If the alternative is something that requires political will, then that will has to be there. ... Sanctions are always the tool of cheapest resort, in a sense. So, it's a way of seeming like you're engaged, seeming like you're active, without considering more tougher measures,' Payne said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sanctions-sudan-army-leader-citing-atrocities/7939740.html	2025-01-16T15:34:32-08:00	
US CDC recommends faster testing for bird flu in hospitalized patients	People hospitalized for flu should be tested for bird flu within 24 hours, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said on Thursday, in an expansion of the agency's efforts to tackle increasing infections in humans. The advisory is intended to prevent delays in identifying human cases of avian influenza A (H5N1) viruses amid high levels of seasonal influenza. The risk to the general public from bird flu is low, and there has been no further evidence of person to person spread, the agency said. Still, influenza A-positive patients, particularly those in an intensive care unit, should be tested ideally within 24 hours of hospitalization to identify the viral subtype and determine whether they have bird flu, the agency said. Prior to Thursday's guidance, hospitals generally sent batches of samples to labs for subtyping every few days. Faster testing also aims to help doctors identify how people became infected and provide their close contacts with testing and medicine more quickly, if needed, said Nirav Shah, the agency's principal deputy director, on a call with reporters. The CDC does not believe it has been missing bird flu infections in people, Shah said. No surveillance system detects 100% of cases, he added later. 'The system is working as it should,' said Shah, adding that health officials want results sooner in case any public health action is needed. 'What we need is to shift to a system that tells us what's happening in the moment.' Nearly 70 people in the United States, most of them farmworkers, have contracted bird flu since April, as the virus has circulated among poultry flocks and dairy herds. Three people have tested positive without a clear source of exposure to the virus, according to CDC. Most infections in humans have been mild, but one fatality was reported in Louisiana last week. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has more than 300 personnel working on its bird flu response and has spent $1.5 billion on its efforts to curb the spread among poultry and dairy cattle, said Eric Deeble, a deputy undersecretary at the agency. The USDA last week said it would rebuild a bird flu vaccine stockpile for poultry. USDA officials have met several times with the transition team of the incoming Donald Trump administration to try to ensure a smooth handoff on agency actions to curb the spread of the virus, including a tabletop exercise at the White House on Wednesday, Deeble said. Officials at the Department of Health and Human Services, which encompasses CDC, also have repeatedly met with the transition team on Zoom calls and have shared their bird flu playbook, officials said on the press call. HHS said on Thursday it plans to put $211 million toward mRNA-based vaccine technology to better respond to emerging infectious diseases such as bird flu.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-cdc-recommends-faster-testing-for-bird-flu-in-hospitalized-patients-/7939688.html	2025-01-16T14:26:19-08:00	
Standoff in South Africa ends with 87 miners dead, anger at police tactics	STILFONTEIN, South Africa — The death toll in a monthslong standoff between police and miners trapped while working illegally in an abandoned gold mine in South Africa has risen to at least 87, police said Thursday. Authorities faced growing anger and a possible investigation into their initial refusal to help the miners and instead 'smoke them out' by cutting off their food supplies. National police spokesperson Athlenda Mathe said 78 bodies were retrieved in a court-ordered rescue operation, with 246 survivors also pulled out from deep underground since the operation began on Monday. Mathe said nine other bodies had been recovered before the rescue operation, without giving details. Community groups launched their own rescue attempts when authorities said last year that they would not help the hundreds of miners because they were 'criminals.' The miners are suspected to have died of starvation and dehydration, although no causes of death have been released. South African authorities have been fiercely criticized for cutting off food and supplies to the miners in the Buffelsfontein Gold Mine last year. That tactic to 'smoke them out,' as described by a prominent Cabinet minister, was condemned by one of South Africa's biggest trade unions. Police and the mine owners also were accused of taking away ropes and dismantling a pulley system the miners used to enter the mine and send supplies down from the surface. A court ordered authorities last year to allow food and water to be sent down to the miners, while another court ruling last week forced them to launch a rescue operation. 'A disgrace' Many say the unfolding disaster underground was clear weeks ago, when community members sporadically pulled decomposing bodies out of the mine, some with notes attached pleading for food to be sent down. 'If the police had acted earlier, we would not be in this situation, with bodies piling up,' said Johannes Qankase, a local community leader. 'It is a disgrace for a constitutional democracy like ours. Somebody needs to account for what has happened here.' South Africa's second biggest political party, which is part of a government coalition, called for President Cyril Ramaphosa to establish an independent inquiry to find out 'why the situation was allowed to get so badly out of hand.' 'The scale of the disaster underground at Buffelsfontein is rapidly proving to be as bad as feared,' the Democratic Alliance party said. Authorities now believe that nearly 2,000 miners were working illegally in the mine near the town of Stilfontein, southwest of Johannesburg, since August. Most of them resurfaced on their own over the last few months, police said, and all the survivors have been arrested, even as some emerged this week badly emaciated and barely able to walk to waiting ambulances. A convoy of mortuary vans arrived at the mine to carry away the bodies. Mathe said at least 13 children had also come out of the mine before the official rescue operation. Police announced Wednesday that they were ending the operation after three days and believed no one else was underground. To be sure, a camera was sent down Thursday in a cage that was used to pull out survivors and bodies. Two volunteer rescuers from the community went down in the small cage during the rescue operation to help miners. Authorities had refused to allow any official rescue personnel to go into the shaft because it was too dangerous. 'It has been a tough few days. There were many people who [we] saved but I still feel bad for those whose family members came out in body bags,' said Mandla Charles, one of the volunteer rescuers. 'We did all we could.' The two volunteers were being offered trauma counseling, police said. The mine is one of the deepest in South Africa. It's a maze of tunnels and levels and has several shafts leading into it. The miners were working up to 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) underground in different groups. Exits possible, police say Police have maintained that the miners were able to come out through several shafts but refused out of fear of being arrested. That’s been disputed by groups representing the miners, who say hundreds were trapped and left starving in dark and damp conditions with decomposing bodies around them. Police Minister Senzo Mchunu denied in an interview with a national TV station that the police were responsible for any starvation and said they had allowed food to go down. The initial police operation last year to force the miners to come out and give themselves up for arrest was part of a larger nationwide clampdown on illegal mining called Vala Umgodi, or Close the Hole. Illegal mining is often in the news in South Africa and a major problem for authorities as large groups go into mines that have been shut down to extract leftover deposits. Gold-rich South Africa has an estimated 6,000 abandoned or closed mines. The illicit miners, known as 'zama zamas' — 'hustlers' or 'chancers' in the Zulu language — are usually armed and part of criminal syndicates, the government says, and they rob South Africa of more than $1 billion a year in gold deposits. They are often undocumented foreign nationals, and authorities said that the vast majority who came out of the Buffelsfontein mine were from Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Lesotho, and were in South Africa illegally. Police said they seized gold, explosives, firearms and more than $2 million in cash from the miners and have defended their hardline approach. 'By providing food, water and necessities to these illegal miners, it would be the police entertaining and allowing criminality to thrive,' Mathe said Wednesday. But the South African Federation of Trade Unions questioned the government's humanity and how it could 'allow anyone — be they citizens or undocumented immigrants — to starve to death in the depths of the earth.' While the police operation has been condemned by civic groups, the disaster hasn't provoked a strong outpouring of anger across South Africa, where the mostly foreign zama zamas have long been considered unwelcome in a country that already struggles with high rates of violent crime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/standoff-in-south-africa-ends-with-87-miners-dead-anger-at-police-tactics-/7939664.html	2025-01-16T14:10:25-08:00	
US Customs agents intercept contraband cars headed overseas	SPARROWS POINT, MARYLAND — Most Americans and visitors to the United States encounter Customs and Border Protection agents when they enter or return to the country at land crossings or airports. But CBP also is responsible for inspecting goods leaving the country, which creates a nearly impossible assignment of trying to intercept all stolen automobiles being shipped out of the U.S. At the Port of Baltimore, CBP scrutinizes several hundred vehicles every day, and on average will find one illegal export — nearly all headed to a particular region of the world, says Adam Rottman, CBP’s director at the Port of Baltimore. He acknowledges that CBP has neither the time nor manpower to inspect every shipping container. 'I’d say 90 to 95% of every one of our stolen automobiles is headed to West Africa,' he tells VOA. Alex Piquero, a professor of criminology at the University of Miami, said, 'There are people who are stealing cars and car parts to sell them very quickly in the local markets. And then there are people literally stealing cars and putting them on containers and selling them, shipping them all over the world, not just to Africa, but also to the Middle East and to Asia.' On any given day at the Port of Baltimore, CBP’s manifest of seized vehicles resembles the inventory of a small used car lot: a Kia purchased fraudulently at auction in New Jersey is bound for Ghana; a Mercedes-Benz valued at $48,000, purchased with a stolen identity in Ohio, is slated for shipment to Togo; a $75,000 Ford Raptor inside a container with one or two additional stolen vehicles and boxes of new power tools is headed for West Africa. Rottman peeks inside one container for which no vehicles are listed. 'It’s supposed to be only household goods in there,' he says. 'In this example, there’s at least three, probably four cars in that container.' Rottman walks to another container opened for inspection. 'This container, we just opened today. The vehicle on the top there, that Honda, we’ve already verified through the VIN (vehicle identification number) that the car is stolen. There’s two [vehicles], more in the back,' he says. CBP operates giant mobile X-ray trucks, the VACIS M6500s, which in minutes can scan shipping containers and determine if they should be opened for a closer inspection. A growing problem Auto theft is a problem accelerating across the United States. While the early part of the 2010s saw a decline in vehicle thefts, there has been a notable increase since 2020, influenced by factors that include the coronavirus pandemic and social media videos demonstrating how certain car models can easily be stolen. The criminals frequently rent cars for a 30-day period and immediately drive them into a nearby container and paste a fake VIN over the real one. The car will not be reported stolen by the rental agency for a month. By then, it may already be on a ship. Rottman stands in front of the container that has the expensive Ford Raptor inside. 'They’ll take the VIN number on the dashboard on your windshield. They’ll make a fake VIN. They’ll put it over the top, glue it on, so it would come up [on computer databases] clean, or it’s not on file when we look it up,' he explains. 'But right away, we noticed the checked digit on the VIN doesn’t match what’s supposed to be on a Ford truck.' For some buyers in Africa or on other continents, unwittingly acquiring a car stolen in the U.S. may seem like a good deal, but some of the vehicles are known to have been in accidents and could be unsafe, including airbags that no longer work. 'You could be putting your family members in danger by driving some of these stolen cars,' says Rottman. There is also a moral hazard. 'When they purchase a car like this that’s been stolen, they’re funding these transnational criminal organizations. And criminal organizations are willing to do anything to make money,' Rottman says, noting that such activities by car theft gangs include human trafficking, drug smuggling and even terrorism. Authorities in some African countries are working with Interpol and other transnational law enforcement agencies to seize some of the stolen vehicles that slip through American ports. Cooperation is not consistent because of government corruption in some countries. 'Some governments will play nicer, and other governments won't, and you can't search every container. And that's why the security at the port is so critically important,' Piquero of the University of Miami told VOA. With so many buyers seeking a deal on a used car — often with no questions asked — there is unlikely to be a slowdown anytime soon in the global traffic of stolen vehicles.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-customs-agents-intercept-contraband-cars-headed-overseas/7939673.html	2025-01-16T14:08:02-08:00	
Zimbabwe ruling party to push for third term for President Mnangagwa	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Zimbabwe's ruling party says it will initiate steps to amend the constitution so President Emmerson Mnangagwa can run for a third term in the 2028 elections. The opposition is strongly opposed to amending the 2013 constitution, which limited presidents to two five-year terms. In an interview Thursday with VOA, Ziyambi Ziyambi, Zimbabwe's minister of justice, legal and parliamentary affairs, said the government is ready to move forward once lawmakers introduce the bill to amend the constitution. 'Is there a prohibition in amending anything in the constitution?' Ziyambi said. 'The only prohibition, the only clause that I know in the constitution, it says any electoral amendments have to be done six months before an election for that amendment to be used in the coming election. Anything else I'm not aware.' Lovemore Madhuku, a law professor at the University of Zimbabwe and an opposition leader, said it will be difficult though not impossible for the ruling Zanu-PF party to change the constitution in time for its leader to run in the 2028 election. 'Legally, yes you can go through the steps,' Madhuku said. 'The steps will require a publication of the first bill, give Zimbabweans a 90-day period to debate it. Thereafter, take it to parliament. It must get a two-thirds majority, and thereafter there must be a referendum. That alone tells you that it is very difficult. It cannot be assumed that since Zanu-PF has a two-thirds majority [in parliament], they will obtain the two-thirds majority.' Douglas Mwonzora, leader of the Movement for Democratic Change party, said the MDC will campaign vehemently against the bid to have Mnangagwa stand for a third term. Mwonzora, who is a lawyer, said one referendum will not suffice for Mnangagwa to stand in 2028. 'They will need another referendum,' Mwonzora said. 'This time specifically, stating whether or not President Mnangagwa must stand again and these two referendums must not be within six months of one another. 'We will campaign for a no vote again not because we have anything personal against President Mnangagwa, we think that President Mnangagwa after his term should go and rest, we think it’s time for other leaders, so we will campaign no in that regard.' But Ziyambi said Zanu-PF will overcome all obstacles in the way of Mnangagwa’s third term. 'Zanu-PF is a mass party. Our structures are to the grassroot from village level, so when we are doing resolutions, that's where they start,' Ziyambi said. 'It’s not the top leadership that say that they want anything.' Ziyambi said Mnangagwa said he has been clear that he wants to abide by the constitution, but the push for the resolution to allow him to run for a third term is coming from the grassroots level. President Robert Mugabe ruled Zimbabwe for 37 years before Mnangagwa, a former army general and Mugabe’s vice president took power in a 2017 coup. Mnangagwa is 82 years old and is currently the fifth oldest head of state in Africa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-ruling-party-to-push-for-third-term-for-president-mnangagwa-/7939642.html	2025-01-16T13:32:40-08:00

David Lynch, filmmaker behind 'Twin Peaks' and 'Mulholland Drive,' dies at 78	LOS ANGELES — David Lynch, the filmmaker celebrated for his uniquely dark vision in such movies as 'Blue Velvet' and 'Mulholland Drive' and the TV series 'Twin Peaks,' has died just days before his 79th birthday. His family announced the death in a Facebook post on Thursday. The cause of death and location was not immediately available, but Lynch had been public about his emphysema. 'We would appreciate some privacy at this time. There's a big hole in the world now that he's no longer with us. But, as he would say, 'Keep your eye on the donut and not on the hole,'' the post read. 'It's a beautiful day with golden sunshine and blue skies all the way.' Lynch was a onetime artist who broke through in the 1970s with the surreal 'Eraserhead' and rarely failed to startle and inspire audiences and peers in the following decades. His notable releases ranged from the neo-noir 'Mulholland Drive' to the skewed Gothic of 'Blue Velvet' to the eclectic and eccentric 'Twin Peaks.' His other credits included the crime story 'Wild at Heart,' winner of the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival; the biographical drama 'The Elephant Man' and the G-rated, straightforward 'The Straight Story.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/david-lynch-filmmaker-behind-twin-peaks-and-mulholland-drive-dies-at-78/7939447.html	2025-01-16T11:11:59-08:00

Ukraine's Zelenskyy seeking continued US support under Trump	As Russia’s war with Ukraine approaches the three-year mark in February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is emphasizing his country’s hope for continued U.S. support under the incoming Trump administration. 'We are waiting for the inauguration of the U.S. president. I think the whole world is waiting because the United States is a strategic partner in global stability,' Zelenskyy said this week during a joint press conference in Warsaw with Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk. Zelenskyy described the U.S. as 'the largest donor supporting Ukraine in its war for survival against Russian aggression' and expressed optimism for deepened cooperation under the principle of 'peace through strength.' He also said his administration is already coordinating with Washington regarding possible meetings with President-elect Donald Trump, who assumes office on Monday. 'Our teams are working on the details of this crucial discussion. We want to end this war, but on the terms of a just peace,' he said. The key focus for Ukraine in future peace negotiations will be securing robust and comprehensive security guarantees to prevent any future Russian aggression. Trump has voiced skepticism of continued U.S. military support for Kyiv, repeatedly vowing that he would end the war before assuming the presidency on Jan. 20. In recent days, however, his aides have said the new timeline for ending the war is in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be by the end of April. Trump's nominee for secretary of state, Marco Rubio, said during his confirmation hearing on Wednesday: 'Even if the conflict ends, Ukraine must have the ability to defend itself.' He added that this is a matter of long-term security and stability for Ukraine. Tusk, standing alongside Zelenskyy in Warsaw, said Ukraine's best security guarantee would be membership in Euro-Atlantic institutions. But, he pointed out, the thought of Ukraine joining NATO remains 'controversial among some states,' making it vital for the Western alliance to provide Ukraine with a tangible solution to secure peace in Europe. Ukrainian military troop strength Ukraine cannot engage in 'games' by reducing the size of its military, Zelenskyy also said, rejecting any proposals to do so. He said a strong defense force is 'the only security guarantee' ahead of potential peace negotiations with Russia. His remarks referred to Bloomberg News reports that Russian President Vladimir Putin is expected to push for Ukraine to sever ties with NATO and adopt a 'neutral state' status with a limited military during any discussions with Trump. Highlighting the current strength of Ukraine's military, Zelenskyy said that it now comprises 880,000 soldiers tasked with countering an estimated 600,000 Russian troops concentrated in specific regions. According to the president, Ukraine produces more than 30% of its military equipment, mainly drones. He has called for allies and partners to invest in military production in Ukraine. Russia and Ukraine target each other daily with aerial strikes. Thousands of Ukrainian civilians have been killed in the Russian attacks, alongside vast casualties among both Ukrainian and Russian troops since Russia’s February 2022 invasion. European security initiatives Part of the proposed option for security guarantees involves French President Emmanuel Macron’s idea of deploying European forces to Ukraine. During his visit to Warsaw, Zelenskyy confirmed that he had discussed the proposal. Answering questions from VOA, the Ukrainian president said that even though the idea remains in early stages, the initiative, in his view, could be part of Ukraine’s broader security guarantees. 'We support the idea of a contingent involving our allies and strategic partners as part of the security guarantees. However, this alone will not suffice,' Zelenskyy said. As a first step, the Ukrainian president said it would be effective to send Western instructors to Ukraine with a comprehensive training plan to strengthen forces on the ground. Zelenskyy also said he plans to discuss the idea with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who arrived in Kyiv on Thursday with a pledge to help guarantee Ukraine’s security. Britain and Ukraine agreed on a '100-Year Partnership' treaty covering defense, science, energy and trade. The other security guarantees Zelenskyy noted involve additional sanctions, continued weapons shipments, and investments in its military production. He called for urgent international action, including utilizing frozen Russian assets to support Ukraine’s defense. 'The strongest support for the Ukrainian army would be to allocate $250 billion from frozen Russian assets to purchase weapons Ukraine urgently needs,' he said. EU aspirations Polish and Ukrainian leaders embraced Ukraine's European Union aspirations as part of the peace process. Poland, which holds the rotating EU presidency, reaffirmed its commitment to accelerating Ukraine’s European integration. Tusk described the EU presidency as an opportunity to break the impasse and expedite Ukraine’s accession. 'We will work unconditionally with Ukraine and our European partners to speed up this big and essential task,' he said. Tusk noted that Ukraine's EU membership will add to European security, and he promised to make the issue a priority. 'We will break the standstill we have in this issue,' he said during the joint press conference. 'We will accelerate the accession process.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-s-zelenskyy-seeking-continued-us-support-under-trump/7939430.html	2025-01-16T10:55:24-08:00	
Brazilian court denies Bolsonaro's request to travel to Trump inauguration	SAO PAULO — Brazil's Supreme Court on Thursday denied a request by former President Jair Bolsonaro to temporarily restore his passport so that he could attend the inauguration in Washington of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump next week. Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who Bolsonaro frequently has called his personal foe, said in the ruling that Bolsonaro currently holds no position that would allow him to represent Brazil at the event and that the former president did not adequately prove to the court that he had been invited. Federal police seized Bolsonaro’s passport last February because he was considered a flight risk. He is the subject of several wide-ranging investigations, including over an alleged attempt to stay in office despite his electoral defeat. He denies the allegations against him. The former Brazilian president requested permission to leave the country from Jan. 17 to 22 to attend the inauguration ceremony on Jan. 20 and a Hispanic inaugural ball. Bolsonaro, an outspoken admirer of Trump, said on his social media channels on Jan. 8 that he was 'very happy with this invitation.' 'I'll be representing the conservative, the right-wing, the good, the Brazilian people there in the United States, God willing,' Bolsonaro said. His lawyer did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press after the court ruling. When de Moraes asked Bolsonaro's lawyers for evidence of his invitation on Saturday, they forwarded an invitation letter signed by inauguration committee co-chairs Steve Witkoff and Kelly Loeffler. Still, de Moraes argued that Bolsonaro had not adequately proven that he was invited to the inauguration. In the ruling, de Moraes followed the recommendation of Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet, who said Wednesday that Bolsonaro's private interest in the trip did not outweigh the public interest in prohibiting from traveling abroad. De Moraes said Bolsonaro remains a flight risk and added that he has advocated that his supporters who face legal troubles in cases involving their political allegiance should leave the country and seek asylum. Hundreds of Bolsonaro's supporters involved in the Jan. 8, 2023, riots in capital Brasilia have left Brazil to avoid prosecution. Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva will not attend Trump's inauguration. Federal police seized Bolsonaro's passport during a raid related to the investigation into whether he and top aides plotted to ignore the 2022 election results and stage an uprising to keep the defeated right-wing leader in power. Brazil's Supreme Court previously has denied a Bolsonaro request to retrieve his passport, in March 2024, following an invitation from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. In November, federal police formally accused Bolsonaro and 36 others, including high-ranking military officers, of attempting a coup. Gonet, the prosecutor-general, will decide whether to charge Bolsonaro or toss the investigation. Legal experts believe Bolsonaro could be charged and stand trial in the second half of 2025 at the Supreme Court for allegedly falsifying his COVID-19 vaccination status. Analysts also say there's a reasonable chance he stands trial before 2026 over allegedly embezzling jewels gifted by Saudi Arabian authorities. The former president denies that he tried to stay in office after his narrow electoral defeat in 2022 to his leftist opponent, Lula. The Brazilian ambassador to the United States, Maria Luiza Viotti, will attend Trump's inauguration, the government told The Associated Press on Thursday. President Lula was not officially invited to the ceremony. Trump has invited some global leaders to his inauguration, including Chinese President Xi Jinping and Argentinian President Javier Milei.	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazilian-court-denies-bolsonaro-s-request-to-travel-to-trump-inauguration/7939400.html	2025-01-16T10:50:15-08:00	
US Treasury nominee Scott Bessent faces sharp questions from Democrats at confirmation hearing	WASHINGTON — U.S. Treasury nominee Scott Bessent on Thursday faced sharp questions from Democrats on tax policy, tariffs, China, Russia sanctions and the future of an IRS tax filing system that Republicans have called to be cut. Bessent sat in front of the Senate Finance Committee for his confirmation hearing, where he told lawmakers that President-elect Donald Trump has an opportunity to unleash 'a new economic golden age.' He was introduced by a fellow South Carolinian, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who said the U.S. needs a treasury secretary 'who knows what he's doing, has the trust of the president and loves his country.' Graham added: 'Your ship came in with this guy.' But Democrats, including senators Ron Wyden of Oregon and Michael Bennet of Colorado, expressed frustration that Trump's promise to extend provisions of his 2017 tax cuts would benefit the wealthiest taxpayers and add to the growing national debt that has surpassed $36 trillion. Bennet assailed Bessent for shedding 'crocodile tears' over the debt and spending, while the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act drove up the debt. 'There's so many things I think you owe the American people after we have seen the catastrophe' from the tax cuts. Bessent is a billionaire who, before becoming a Trump donor and adviser, donated to various Democratic causes in the early 2000s, notably Al Gore's presidential run. He also worked for George Soros, a major supporter of Democrats. In his testimony, Bessent committed to maintaining the IRS's Direct File program — which allows taxpayers to file their returns directly to the IRS for free — at least for the 2025 tax season, which begins Jan. 27. Republican lawmakers say the program is a waste of money because free filing programs already exist, although they are not popular. Bessent was one of several people Trump considered for the position. Trump took his time before settling on Bessent as his nominee. He also mulled over billionaire investor John Paulson and Howard Lutnick, whom Trump tapped as his nominee for commerce secretary. The treasury secretary is responsible for serving as the president's fiscal policy adviser and managing the public debt. He would also be a member of the president's National Economic Council. If confirmed, Bessent will oversee massive agencies within the Treasury Department, including the Internal Revenue Service. The IRS received a massive boost in funding from Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, though that money has been in constant threat of being cut. Trump expects him to help reset the global trade order, enable trillions of dollars in tax cuts, ensure inflation stays in check, manage a ballooning national debt and still keep the financial markets confident. 'Productive investment that grows the economy must be prioritized over wasteful spending that drives inflation,' Bessent testified. Senators were expected to question the money manager for hours on his views on cryptocurrency, the Trump-era tax cuts and potential conflicts of interest. Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat from Massachusetts, a member of the finance committee, sent Bessent more than 100 written questions in advance, interrogating him on such topics as agency independence, housing, treasury workforce issues and financial stability oversight. In addition, Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee are circulating a document that alleges Bessent has avoided paying roughly $1 million in taxes related to his hedge fund. He will be asked about this during his hearing. Bessent has backed extending provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which Trump signed into law in his first year in office. Estimates from various economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts range from nearly $6 trillion to $10 trillion over 10 years. He calls for spending cuts and shifts in existing taxes to offset the costs that extending the tax cuts would add to the federal deficit.	https://www.voanews.com/a/treasury-nominee-scott-bessent-faces-sharp-questions-from-democrats-at-confirmation-hearing/7939346.html	2025-01-16T10:45:11-08:00	
Pope Francis hurts right arm after falling for 2nd time in just over a month	ROME — Pope Francis fell Thursday and hurt his right arm, the Vatican said, just weeks after another apparent fall resulted in a bad bruise on his chin. Francis didn’t break his arm, but a sling was put on as a precaution, the Vatican spokesman said in a statement On Dec. 7, the pope whacked his chin on his nightstand in an apparent fall that resulted in a bad bruise. The 88-year-old pope, who has battled health problems including long bouts of bronchitis, often must use a wheelchair because of bad knees. He uses a walker or cane when moving around his apartment in the Vatican's Santa Marta hotel. The Vatican said that Thursday’s fall also occurred at Santa Marta, and the pope was later seen in audiences with his right arm in a sling. At one of the meetings, Francis apologetically offered his left hand for a handshake when he greeted the head of the U.N. fund for agricultural development, Alvaro Lario. 'This morning, due to a fall at the Casa Santa Marta, Pope Francis suffered a contusion to his right forearm, without fracture. The arm was immobilized as a precautionary measure,' the statement said. Speculation about Francis' health is a constant in Vatican circles, especially after Pope Benedict XVI broke 600 years of tradition and resigned from the papacy in 2013. Benedict's aides have attributed the decision to a nighttime fall that he suffered during a 2012 trip to Mexico, after which he determined he couldn't keep up with the globe-trotting demands of the papacy. Francis has said that he has no plans to resign anytime soon, even if Benedict 'opened the door' to the possibility. In his autobiography Hope released this week, Francis said that he hadn't considered resigning even when he had major intestinal surgery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-hurts-right-arm-after-falling-for-2nd-time-in-just-over-a-month/7939360.html	2025-01-16T10:30:15-08:00	
UN appeals for $3.2 billion to support 8.2 million Ukrainian war victims	GENEVA — The United Nations is appealing for $3.2 billion to provide humanitarian assistance for 8.2 million Ukrainians whose lives have been upended by Russia’s invasion of their country nearly three years ago. 'This has been a period of huge tragedy and despair, destruction and disruption,' Tom Fletcher, U.N. undersecretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told journalists in Kyiv at the launch of the U.N. appeal with the government of Ukraine. 'We must be here at the side of the Ukrainian people as they respond to the consequences of a devastating war,' he said, noting that 'the needs are great.' 'We have to respond by showing a real, genuine, sustained international engagement. We have to respond with heart. And when I say sustained, I mean that we will be here with the Ukrainian people for as long as it takes to meet these needs,' Fletcher said. The lion’s share of the twin humanitarian and refugee response plans for 2025 — $2.62 billion — will be used to support 6 million people out of more than 12 million people inside Ukraine who need humanitarian aid. 'We are prioritizing the most vulnerable. This is vulnerability driven and needs driven, and our aim is to support people wherever they are,' Matthias Schmale, U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in Ukraine, said. 'It is not geography-based. It is vulnerability and needs-based. Inevitably, a big part of the needs are along the front line. We are supporting those who have chosen to stay near the front line … particularly people with disabilities and older people who find it difficult to move,' he said. A smaller amount of money — $ 1.2 billion — will provide relief and protection over the next two years for more than 2 million Ukrainians who have been forced to flee their homes and have taken refuge in 11 eastern European host countries bordering Ukraine. 'There are almost 7 million Ukrainian refugees outside the country,' said Filippo Grandi, U.N. high commissioner for refugees. He explained that the current appeal does not cover all host countries because national governments, mainly in western Europe, are able to support the Ukrainian refugees. But the 11 border states of asylum such as Poland and Moldova, 'really need extra support from the international community.' 'So, we are very grateful for what all governments hosting refugees — these 11 countries and others — have done to give refugees access to health services, to education, to the labor market,' he said. 'But of course, we are about to enter the fourth year of this hospitality, and it is important that this generosity continues.' At the same time, Grandi stressed that 'the objective is not to make sure that these people are refugees forever. The objective is for this to create the conditions for these people to return to Ukraine. This is what the majority of the refugees want.' Last July and August, the UNHCR surveyed more than 11,150 refugee households across Europe and inside Ukraine among internally displaced people and returnees. It found that 61% of Ukrainian refugees and 73% of internally displaced people surveyed 'still plan and hope to return home one day.' Fletcher urged the international community to 'stay the course with the people of Ukraine.' 'The needs we have described are great. We are conscious, obviously, that the president, the government, are seeking negotiations, seeking ways to try to end this war. But just because you end a war does not mean the needs go away,' Fletcher said. 'We recognize the needs will change. But even if we get progress, even if we get good news in the period ahead, we will still need to be here alongside our Ukrainian partners supporting the Ukrainian people,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-appeals-for-3-2-billion-to-support-8-2-million-ukrainian-war-victims/7939357.html	2025-01-16T10:27:02-08:00	
Pakistan deports Afghans with UNHCR papers	As part of its drive to expel Afghan citizens from the nation’s capital, Pakistan has deported dozens bearing UNHCR-issued documents, the agency told VOA Thursday. Authorities in Islamabad deported 285 Afghans between Jan. 1 and 15, according to the refugee agency. Its Pakistan representative, Philippa Candler, told VOA that 80 of those deported were in possession of preliminary documents the agency had given them. Although initial documentation issued by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees does not give legal cover to Afghans, it can show the agency may be determining their refugee status, or that a person may be in the early stages of the resettlement process, Candler explained. Candler said that in the past, Pakistani authorities generally refrained from deporting those possessing any agency-issued papers. 'We could by and large get Afghans with our documents released,' Candler said, referring to actions against Afghans since Pakistan launched a nationwide drive in October 2023 to expel undocumented residents amid rising terrorism. Candler attributed past leniency to goodwill. Expulsion order The tougher action comes after Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi announced in November that all Afghan citizens would require a no-objection certificate, or NOC, from the city administration to stay in the capital past the end of the year. The minister alleged Afghan citizens took part in a protest that saw thousands of supporters of incarcerated former Prime Minister Imran Khan descend on Islamabad between Nov. 24 to 26. At least four security personnel were killed before authorities launched a crackdown that Khan’s party says killed at least 12 supporters. Raids 'It’s not a nice experience,' said Enayatuallah Omid, who said he was detained for hours along with others at a police station in Islamabad after law enforcement authorities raided his neighborhood Jan. 5. An Afghan journalist, Omid arrived in Pakistan in July 2022 on a medical visa to flee Taliban repression. He said the constant fear of deportation is deeply hurting his family. 'My wife has attempted suicide three times. Every time the pressure builds up, she tries to kill herself.' Quoting her, Omid said, ‘What kind of a life is this?’' Amnesty International has decried the requirement of NOC for Afghan refugees as an 'onerous obligation.' Omid said, though, that the process of applying for a no-objection certificate was easy. 'They behaved nicely,' he said, referring to the officials at Islamabad district commissioner’s office. But Omid has only a receipt showing he has applied for the NOC. He said he did not know if he would receive any more documentation allowing him to stay in the capital. International pressure Candler told VOA that her office is working with Pakistani authorities to help Afghans who are registered with UNHCR. However, she said the Afghan Taliban’s claim that Pakistan detained more than 800 Afghans in the first week of the year could not be confirmed. The Afghan Taliban’s envoy in Islamabad, Mawlawi Sardar Ahmad Shakib, met Wednesday with Candler to convey concerns about Pakistan’s detention and deportation of registered Afghan refugees from Islamabad and neighboring Rawalpindi. Islamabad authorities deny targeting documented refugees and registered Afghan citizens, or those awaiting third country repatriation. Responding to reports of mistreatment, officials have said teams abide by the law during raids. Recent press releases from Pakistan’s interior ministry show that envoys from Washington and London discussed the expulsion of Afghans from the capital with Naqvi. Thousands of Afghans in Islamabad are awaiting repatriation to the United States and Britain. 'Mohsin Naqvi stated that no illegal foreigner will be allowed to stay in Pakistan,' according to a handout issued Thursday after the minister’s meeting with the outgoing U.S. Ambassador to Pakistan Donald Blome. 'Minister highlighted that no action is being taken against any foreign national holding valid documents,' said an interior ministry statement after Naqvi met Saturday with the British high commissioner to Pakistan, Jane Marriott. Pakistan is home to 3.1 million Afghans. More than 800,000 are undocumented. This includes Afghans born in Pakistan, as well as those who fled their country after the Taliban’s return to power in 2021. More than 813,000 Afghans have returned to their home country since September 2023, including about 300,000 last year. More than 38,000 have been deported in almost 15 months, according to the U.N.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-deports-afghans-with-unhcr-papers/7939282.html	2025-01-16T09:52:47-08:00

HRW report: Governments, armed groups intensify abuses in Africa	NAIROBI, KENYA — Human Rights Watch has found that African governments continue to crack down and wrongly arrest political opponents, critics, activists and journalists. The rights group also says armed forces and armed groups in some African countries have targeted civilians, killing them and driving them from their homes. The conflicts in Sudan and Ethiopia feature prominently in a Human Rights Watch report released Thursday. The report says that in Sudan, the war between the armed forces and the rebel Rapid Support Forces has displaced 12 million people, destroyed infrastructure and blocked humanitarian assistance. In Ethiopia, rights group investigators found that government forces in the Amhara region committed widespread attacks against medical professionals, patients and health facilities. Mausi Segun, head of the Human Rights Watch Africa Division, said armed conflict is not the only form of rights violation on the continent. 'On top of all of that, you have civic space restriction abuses, including intolerance for freedom of expression, intolerance for freedom of association and assembly,' Segun said. 'Protests are being clamped down on, and people who are pushing for their rights or even commenting on government policies and measures are being hunted down. Here in East Africa, we are seeing very disturbing trends towards abductions.' Kenya has captured the attention of human rights groups for recent alleged abductions of anti-government protesters and activists from foreign countries, some of whom have been deported to Turkey and Uganda. The HRW report also focuses on the seemingly endless conflict in the Congo, where civilians are killed, women raped, and attacks on camps for the internally displaced push more people into neighboring countries. Congo has accused Rwanda of supporting M23 rebels, an allegation Rwanda denies. Clementine de Montoye, Human Rights Watch senior researcher, said the expansion of conflict worsens civilians' harm, adding, 'we are not seeing significant signs of pressure on the different parties to the conflict to reduce violations and harms to civilians.' The report says that countries in West Africa ruled by the military — like Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger — have cracked down on opposition and dissent, freedom of expression, and backsliding in the fight against corruption. It notes that in Southern Africa, Mozambique is grappling with post-election violence in which hundreds of people have been killed. Elizabeth Kamundia, deputy director of disability rights at Human Rights Watch, said conflict and violence are causing a rise in physical and psychological issues. 'We have seen a rise in the number of people acquiring injuries that lead to disabilities,' Kamundia said. 'We've seen increased psychological distress and mental health impacts on people, families and communities as a result of war and conflict. We've seen difficulties with access to medication for people who have mental health conditions, and therefore, they are forced to stop their treatment.' Human Rights Watch’s newly-released World Report reviewed human rights records of more than 100 countries, including 25 in Africa. Despite the widespread abuses and violence against people in Africa, HRW notes that, like the rest of the world, African people are resisting and pushing back against autocratic rule and abuse of their rights. It notes they are mobilizing on social media and streets to demand an end to the abuses and bad governance that has contributed to divisions and conflict among communities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hrw-report-governments-armed-groups-intensify-abuses-in-africa/7939208.html	2025-01-16T08:31:36-08:00	
Florida attorney general chosen to fill Marco Rubio's open Senate seat	TALLAHASSEE, FLORIDA — Florida Attorney General Ashley Moody will take Marco Rubio 's seat in the U.S. Senate, Governor Ron DeSantis announced Thursday, making Moody only the second woman to represent Florida in the chamber. Elected as the state's top law enforcement officer in 2018, Moody campaigned on a pledge to voters that she'd be a prosecutor, not a politician. Along with DeSantis, Moody boosted her political profile during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, calling on the federal government to 'hold China responsible' for the outbreak. Before running for statewide office, Moody worked as a federal prosecutor. In 2006, she was elected to the post of circuit judge in Hillsborough County, home to Tampa. As the state's attorney general, Moody has been instrumental in defending DeSantis' conservative agenda in court and has joined other Republican-led states in challenging the Biden administration's policies, suing over changes to immigration enforcement, student loan forgiveness and vaccine mandates for federal contractors. Under Florida law, it's up to the Republican governor to pick Rubio's replacement, after President-elect Donald Trump picked the three-term senator to be his next secretary of state. Moody will serve in the Senate until the next general election, in 2026, when the seat will be back on the ballot. Moody fought unsuccessfully to keep an abortion rights measure off the ballot in Florida in 2024, saying proponents were waging 'a war' to protect the procedure. The measure did go before voters but ultimately failed to get the 60% approval needed to pass. She was also among the state attorneys general to sign on to the lawsuit backed by Trump aimed at overturning Joe Biden's election victory in 2020. Republican state Senator Joe Gruters, a key Trump ally in Florida, was among those who had pushed the president-elect's daughter-in-law Lara Trump as their top pick for the Senate seat. Lara Trump removed herself from consideration in December. Still, Gruters praised Moody, calling her 'a winner here in Florida.' 'She's very popular. And I think people see the job that she does, and they appreciate her work and her effort at trying to ... keep Florida safe,' Gruters said ahead of the announcement. Moody's appointment opens a key vacancy in Florida's Cabinet, giving DeSantis another shot at expanding his influence in the state. DeSantis will also get to pick a replacement for outgoing Chief Financial Officer Jimmy Patronis, who's leaving his post to run for former Representative Matt Gaetz's open seat in Congress.	https://www.voanews.com/a/florida-attorney-general-chosen-to-fill-marco-rubio-s-open-senate-seat/7939181.html	2025-01-16T08:13:08-08:00	
WHO appeals for $1.5 billion to tackle 'unprecedented' global health crisis	GENEVA — The World Health Organization appealed Thursday for $1.5 billion for emergency operations this year, warning that conflict, climate change, epidemics and displacement had converged to create an 'unprecedented global health crisis.' The U.N. health agency estimated that health crises would leave 305 million people in need of urgent humanitarian assistance this year. 'WHO is seeking $1.5 billion to support our lifesaving work for the emergencies we know about and to react swiftly to new crises,' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said as he launched the appeal. The agency's emergency request, which was for the same amount as last year's request, outlined the critical priorities and resources needed to address 42 ongoing health emergencies. 'Conflicts, outbreaks, climate-related disasters and other health emergencies are no longer isolated or occasional — they are relentless, overlapping and intensifying,' Tedros said in a statement. He pointed to the emergency health assistance provided in conflict zones ranging from the occupied Palestinian territories to the Democratic Republic of Congo to Sudan, as well as its work conducting vaccination campaigns, treating malnutrition and helping control outbreaks of diseases like cholera. 'Without adequate and sustainable funding, we face the impossible task of deciding who will receive care and who will not this year,' Tedros said at Thursday's event. 'Your support helps to ensure that WHO remains a lifeline, bridging the gap between sickness and health, despair and hope, life and death for millions of people worldwide.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-appeals-for-1-5-billion-to-tackle-unprecedented-global-health-crisis/7939148.html	2025-01-16T08:00:51-08:00	
China reaches out to US allies ahead of Trump’s inauguration	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — China initiated a new round of diplomatic outreach to Japan and the European Union this week as Washington prepares for President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration. A delegation of Japanese lawmakers traveled to Beijing and a Chinese military delegation went to Japan for the first time in five years. Meanwhile, the European Council’s new president held his first phone call with China’s leader, Xi Jinping. Analysts say China is trying to test the alliance between Washington and its allies through the diplomatic efforts. 'Senior Chinese officials believe the incoming Trump administration will be more hawkish toward China, so Beijing needs to try to take U.S. allies out of Washington’s orbit,' Chen Yuhua, a China studies professor at Akita International University, told VOA in a video interview. Other experts, however, say the effectiveness of Beijing’s strategy remains unclear. While China is 'improving relations with everyone, they are not willing to fundamentally change their external behavior. We don’t know how long [this trend] will last,' said Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo's International Christian University. Seafood and soldiers On Monday, lawmakers from Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party, or LDP, and its coalition partner Komeito began a three-day visit to China. During the trip, Japanese lawmakers met with top Chinese leaders, including Premier Li Qiang and Foreign Minister Wang Yi. The Japanese side urged China to lift import bans on Japanese seafood 'at an early date' and ensure the safety of Japanese nationals living in China. Hiroshi Moriyama, the secretary general of the LDP, said during his keynote speech on Tuesday that China and Japan 'need to boost mutual understanding between their peoples and strengthen dialogue at various levels to improve their ties.' Moriyama also reiterated Tokyo’s concern about rising tensions in the East China Sea and Beijing’s detention of several Japanese nationals under espionage charges. During his meeting with the Japanese delegation Tuesday, Wang said Japan and China 'face important opportunities' to improve and develop bilateral relations. On Wednesday, Li said Beijing and Tokyo should focus on exploring economic cooperation in areas such as the digital economy and green development, while increasing people-to-people exchanges at the sub-national level. At the same time lawmakers were visiting Beijing, a Chinese military delegation started a five-day visit to Japan. During the trip, the Chinese delegation was expected to meet their Japanese counterparts and visit some military units, according to a statement from China’s Defense Ministry. Japanese government spokesperson Yoshimasa Hayashi said during a press conference on Tuesday that the Chinese delegation’s visit helped to resume 'exchanges among troops' and 'contributes to the peace and stability of the region.' China’s Defense Ministry said the visit 'is expected to strengthen mutual understanding and trust while advancing defense exchanges between the two countries.' The latest bilateral exchanges between Japan and China follow Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya’s trip to Beijing on Dec. 25, during which Tokyo and Beijing agreed to facilitate Wang’s trip to Japan and hold high-level economic and security dialogues. Despite Japan and China’s attempts to improve bilateral relations, Nagy said the efforts can’t be sustained. 'China thinks Japan and other countries’ growing alignment on issues such as the South China Sea dispute, economic security and resilience policy are against its core interests,' he told VOA by phone. So 'while they can have exchanges with Japan, it doesn’t take away their concerns about these issues,' Nagy said. Driving a wedge Apart from mending ties with Japan, China has also been trying to improve relations with the European Union amid rising trade tensions in recent months. During his first phone call with European Council President Antonio Costa on Tuesday, Xi said there are 'no clash of fundamental interests or geopolitical conflicts' between China and the EU, 'making them partners that can contribute to each other's success.' 'China remains confident in the EU and hopes the EU will also prove to be a trustworthy cooperation partner for China,' he said, adding that both sides should 'expand mutual openness, consolidate existing cooperation mechanisms and foster new growth points in their cooperation.' Costa said he had a 'constructive' phone call with Xi, during which he highlighted how Russia’s war against Ukraine threatens global peace and agreed with Xi that China and the EU should work together to 'tackle global challenges.' 'The EU and China are important trading partners. Our relations need to be balanced and based on a level-playing field,' Costa wrote in a post on the social media platform X. The call between Xi and Costa comes amid rising trade tensions between China and the EU. Last October, the EU decided to impose tariffs of up to 45.3% on imported Chinese electric vehicles. The move prompted Beijing to impose 'temporary anti-dumping measures' on brandy imported from the EU. Experts say China’s outreach to the EU is part of Beijing’s attempt to weaken the alliance between Washington and Brussels ahead of Trump’s return to office. 'China always has this anxiety that the U.S. and EU would work together to deal with China, so the upcoming regime change in Washington presents an opportunity [for Beijing] to exploit the anxiety that European countries have about the second Trump administration,' Matej Simalcik, executive director of the Central European Institute of Asian Studies, told VOA in an interview in Taipei. In his view, while China’s approach is unlikely to soften the EU’s tough trade approach against Beijing, it could present challenges to the bloc’s foreign policy agenda by leveraging its influence over certain EU member states. 'There are a lot of policy areas where EU member states have to agree on them unanimously and China could use its friendly relationship with certain member states to veto certain parts of the EU’s foreign policy agenda,' Simalcik said. While the effectiveness of Beijing’s diplomatic outreach to U.S. allies remains unclear, Chen in Japan said these efforts show China’s foreign policy approach has become 'more sophisticated.' 'Compared to their ‘wolf warrior diplomacy’ during the first Trump administration, China’s current diplomatic approach has become more delicate,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-reaches-out-to-us-allies-ahead-of-trump-s-inauguration/7939122.html	2025-01-16T07:43:33-08:00	
Human Rights Watch sees some encouraging signs in Asia in 2024	BANGKOK — In an uneven year for democracy and rights globally, the Asia-Pacific region saw some encouraging signs, Human Rights Watch says in its World Report 2025, released today. The organization cited citizen action by Indian voters against Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the toppling of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by students, and a people’s protest blocking a bid by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol to disempower political opponents by using martial law. However, at the same time, Myanmar’s junta continued to jail and bomb its opponents nearly four years after it seized power from the elected government; in Afghanistan the Taliban rolled back years of gains on women’s rights; and China, under President Xi Jinping, continued its descent into repression, the New York-based group said in the report. Taken together the message is clear, according to HRW Executive Director Tirana Hassan. 'When rights are protected, humanity flourishes,' she said in her introductory essay. 'When they are denied, the cost is measured not in abstract principles but in human lives. This is the challenge — and the opportunity — of our time,' she said. Bangladesh In Bangladesh, Hasina was ousted and fled the country amid student-led protests in August after 15 years of increasingly repressive government. Supporters of her Awami League party and police attacked peaceful demonstrations by students initially aimed at a government job quota plan, the HRW report said. The crackdown imposed an internet blackout and a curfew with a 'shoot-on-sight' order. 'Nearly 1,000 people, including over 100 children, were reportedly killed in the violence in July and in reprisal violence after Hasina’s ouster,' the report said. The report adds that since Hasina fled, the interim government of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has released thousands of people who were detained during the protests, restored order and set the country back on the path toward democratic elections. Accountability is at the heart of Yunus’ efforts, with the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights invited to send a fact-finding team to investigate abuses during the protests and their root causes, HRW reported. India and South Korea Another example of what the rights organization called 'meaningful democratic resistance' occurred in June in neighboring India, the rights organization said, as voters turned away from the populist and often anti-Muslim rhetoric of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, denying him an electoral majority. That showed 'that even in the face of systemic challenges, democracy can still put a check on power,' Hassan said. As the year ended, South Korea’s president, Yoon, stunned the world with a declaration of martial law to fend off mounting discontent with his administration, but the move backfired as thousands marched on the National Assembly, which overturned the decree a few hours later as the specter of a coup quickly evaporated. 'These resistance movements highlight a crucial reality,' Hassan said. 'The fight for rights is often driven by ordinary people, fed up with injustice and corruption, bringing together their collective power to compel governments to uphold basic rights and serve the people, instead of their own interests.' China and Hong Kong Xi’s China took the opposite turn in 2024, according to HRW, which said a slumping economy has seen 'heightened repression throughout the country,' from the jailing of hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs to the decline in civil liberties in Hong Kong. 'There is no independent civil society, no freedom of expression, association, assembly or religion, and human rights defenders and other perceived critics of the government are persecuted,' the report said. As China’s economy loses steam, Xi has intensified his smothering of dissent, including by the arbitrary detention of economists, artists and civil society leaders, the study said. Hong Kong’s handpicked judiciary tightened controls, HRW said, with 14 activists and former lawmakers jailed for four to 10 years for 'conspiracy to commit subversion' because of organizing an unofficial primary poll in 2020. Media freedom took more hits with the ongoing trial of outspoken 76-year-old tycoon Jimmy Lai, under national security laws and the jailing of two journalists in September for 21 and 11 months, respectively, for alleged sedition. 'While foreign governments recognize the Chinese government’s worsening rights record, they have not confronted Beijing,' the report said. Afghanistan Rights were stripped from women and girls in Afghanistan last year, as a resurgent Taliban banned secondary and university education and restricted employment and free movement of women. An August law promoting 'virtue and preventing vice' banned women from traveling or using public transport without a male companion. 'Under the law, women and girls are required to cover their faces in public and are prohibited from singing in public or letting their voices be heard outside the house,' the report said, adding women and girls had been detained for alleged breaches of draconian new dress codes. Myanmar and Singapore Meanwhile, in Myanmar, the junta continued to pound civilian areas with airstrikes and artillery and jail opponents, while it forced young conscripts into an army facing heavy losses across the country. HRW noted the International Criminal Court’s issuance of an arrest warrant for junta leader Min Aung Hlaing for crimes against humanity committed in a crackdown on Rohingya Muslims in 2017. But enforcement of ICC warrants is 'an ever-present hurdle' making 'consistent support of ICC member countries, [which] is critical for securing justice, almost always a long game,' the report said. Across Southeast Asia, HRW underlined Singapore’s continued use of the death penalty, mainly for drug offenses, and the limits of Thailand’s democracy after the 2023 election-winning Move Forward Party was dissolved by the courts in August. 'Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra has done little to improve respect for fundamental freedoms and resolve outstanding human rights problems,' the report said, although it pointed to Thai recognition of same-sex marriages, the first such move in the region, as 'one positive step.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/human-rights-watch-sees-some-encouraging-signs-in-asia-in-2024/7939027.html	2025-01-16T06:57:11-08:00

Analysts weigh in on what 2nd Trump term means for Africa	NAIROBI, KENYA — As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares to be sworn into office, African analysts weigh in on what governing for the second term-president may feel like for the continent compared to his first term. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s first term included the launch of some initiatives for Africa. However, many people remember him for referring to the continent using degrading language. Edgar Githua is a professor of international relations at Strathmore University in Kenya. 'He called Africa a shithole, excuse my French,' said Githua. Estimated at over 1 billion people, Africa’s population is growing fast and expected to reach 2.5 billion by 2050, according to various estimates. It’s a big market that plays a key role in the global economy, Githua said, and in terms of business and trade, Trump may be interested in Africa but only because of the inroads China has made here. 'Since China is hellbent on capturing Africa as a business destination, Trump will come to Africa not so much because he cares about Africa but because he’s coming to counter Chinese influence on the African soil. So that fight, that proxy war, that geopolitical repositioning, in my view, is what could probably benefit Africa,' he said. But Trump’s first term saw the birth of initiatives such as Prosper Africa, aimed at facilitating economic engagement between the U.S. and African nations. Since its launch in 2019, the U.S. has helped close nearly 3,000 deals across 49 countries for a value of more than $120 billion, according to figures shared on the initiative’s website. While every American president establishes his own policies, many programs - including Prosper Africa; AGOA or the African Growth and Opportunity Act; and PEPFAR or the U.S. President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief – continue beyond the end of presidents’ terms because they have solid bipartisan support in Congress. No matter who’s in power in Washington, countries need to redefine what they want and how they want to work with the new administration, Rwandan economic analyst Teddy Kaberuka told VOA. And while Trump’s America First policy may suggest more focus on America, some emerging economies in Africa still can benefit, he said. 'Because, if he’s focused on boosting domestic production, obviously, the U.S. will import a lot of raw material from all over the world and most likely in Africa, being in minerals, being in agriculture,' he said. Kaberuka said the Ukraine war has hurt African economies, especially the grain supply disruption it caused, triggering a shortage of about 30 million metric tons of grain in Africa in the first year of the war alone, according to the Atlantic Council, a policy research organization based in Washington. He said Trump didn’t engage in wars during his first term and complimented the president-elect for publicly stating he aimed to help end to the Ukraine war shortly after he takes office. 'As an African and someone who has that overview of the global economy, of the African economy, the war we are facing, the consequences, I would say that people like me are excited because from the experience, [during] the Trump administration, there were less wars,' said Kaberuka. In the Sahel, a region recently plagued by coups, the U.S. closed two military bases and withdrew from Niger last year at the request of a junta that staged a coup the prior year. Their presence, U.S. officials said, was to help the region’s counterterrorism efforts. Analyst Rida Lyammouri, who’s done field work in the Sahel/Lake Chad Basin, is a senior fellow at the Policy Center for the New South, a Moroccan-based policy research firm in Washington. 'We are increasingly seeing this narrative, this perception that is changing, toward the West, accusing the West of being one of the problems why Africa has not seen significant ... economic development. The priority for the Trump administration is to find ways to … keep a positive image toward the U.S. and avoid what is currently happening, for example, to France in Francophone Africa,' he said. Lyammouri said he doesn’t think the Sahel will be a priority for this new administration but if that was to be, what happened in Niger should be a lesson. 'It’s … a message to the U.S. going forward not to take things for granted. I think Niger has been a reliable partner in the region, but this decision shows that it doesn't mean it’s guaranteed that the partnership is going to be forever,' he said. Trump will take the oath of office January 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-weigh-in-on-what-2nd-trump-term-means-for-africa/7939026.html	2025-01-16T06:30:03-08:00

Bezos' Blue Origin reaches orbit in first New Glenn launch, misses booster landing	CAPE CANAVERAL, Florida — Blue Origin's giant New Glenn rocket blasted off from Florida early Thursday morning on its first mission to space, an inaugural step into Earth's orbit for Jeff Bezos' space company as it aims to rival SpaceX in the satellite launch business. Thirty stories tall with a reusable first stage, New Glenn launched around 2 a.m. ET (0700 GMT) from Blue Origin's launchpad at the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, its seven engines thundering for miles under cloudy skies on its second liftoff attempt this week. Hundreds of employees at the company's Kent, Washington headquarters and its Cape Canaveral, Florida rocket factory roared in applause as Blue Origin VP Ariane Cornell announced the rocket's second stage made it to orbit, achieving a long-awaited milestone. 'We hit our key, critical, number-one objective, we got to orbit safely,' Cornell said on a company live stream. 'And y'all we did it on our first go.' The rocket's reusable first stage booster was due to land on a barge in the Atlantic Ocean after separating from its second stage, but failed to make that landing, Cornell confirmed. Telemetry from the booster blacked out minutes after liftoff. 'We did in fact lose the booster,' Cornell said. The culmination of a decade-long, multi-billion-dollar development journey, the mission marks Blue Origin's first trek to Earth's orbit in the 25 years since Bezos founded the company. Bezos told Reuters on Sunday, before Blue Origin's first launch attempt, that he was most nervous about landing the booster. But he added that sticking the landing would be the 'icing on the cake' if they could achieve the milestone of getting the payload to its intended orbit. Secured inside New Glenn's payload bay for the mission is the first prototype of Blue Origin's Blue Ring vehicle, a maneuverable spacecraft the company plans to sell to the Pentagon and commercial customers for national security and satellite servicing missions. The rocket's first attempt to launch on Monday was scrubbed around 3 a.m. ET because ice had accumulated on a propellant line. On Thursday, the company cited no issues ahead of launch. Bezos monitored the launch from a few miles away in Blue Origin's mission control room, wearing a large headset and flanked by dozens of launch staff. The company's CEO, Dave Limp, was next to him. New Glenn is expected to press ahead with a backlog of dozens of missions worth hundreds of millions of dollars, including up to 27 launches for Amazon's Kuiper satellite internet network that will rival SpaceX's Starlink service. New Glenn is the latest U.S. rocket to debut in recent years as governments and private companies beef up their space programs and race to challenge Elon Musk's SpaceX and its workhorse Falcon 9. NASA's giant Space Launch System rocket had a successful debut in 2022, as did the Vulcan rocket last year from United Launch Alliance, Boeing and Lockheed Martin's joint launch venture. New Glenn is roughly twice as powerful as Falcon 9, the world's most active rocket, with a payload bay diameter two times larger to fit bigger batches of satellites. Blue Origin has not disclosed the rocket's launch pricing. Falcon 9 starts at around $62 million. The development of New Glenn has spanned three Blue Origin CEOs and faced numerous delays as SpaceX grew into an industry juggernaut. SpaceX's giant, next-generation Starship rocket in development, which New Glenn will also compete with, is expected to further rattle the industry with cheap rides to space and full reusability. Bezos in late 2023 moved to speed things up at Blue Origin, prioritizing the development of New Glenn and its BE-4 engines. He named Limp, an Amazon veteran, as CEO, who employees say introduced a sense of urgency to compete with SpaceX.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bezos-blue-origin-reaches-orbit-in-first-new-glenn-launch-misses-booster-landing/7938901.html	2025-01-16T04:29:34-08:00	
Bollywood star Saif Ali Khan out of danger after stabbing at Mumbai home	MUMBAI — Bollywood actor Saif Ali Khan was stabbed repeatedly by an intruder at his home in Mumbai on Thursday, but doctors treating him said he was out of danger after surgery. Khan, 54, was 'on the path to complete recovery' after receiving stab wounds on his spine, neck and hand, the doctors told reporters. 'He sustained a major injury to the thoracic spinal chord due to a lodged knife in the spine. Surgery was performed to remove the knife and also repair the leaking spinal fluid,' said Nitin Dange, one of the doctors operating on Khan. Khan was attacked just after midnight when he tried to stop the intruder, believed to be a burglar, from entering his apartment in the upscale neighborhood of Bandra, police and local media said. A female employee at the apartment was also attacked and was being treated, police said. Among the country's most bankable stars, Khan, 54, is the son of India's former cricket captain Mansur Ali Khan Pataudi and actress Sharmila Tagore. He is married to actor Kareena Kapoor, and his daughter from a previous marriage, Sara, is also a Bollywood actor. Police had identified the perpetrator and had launched a search for him, senior police official Dikshit Gedam told reporters. 'The accused attempted to enter through a fire escape. It appears to be a robbery attempt,' he said. Khan, who has featured in more than 70 films and television series, is a regular on the red carpet. He and Kapoor have two young sons and are one of Bollywood's most well-known couples. Khan has acted in several notable films and series, including Sacred Games, Netflix's first Indian production, which released in 2018. Film stars and opposition leaders called for police to beef up security measures in the city. 'If such high-profile people with ... security can be attacked in their homes, what could happen to common citizens?' Clyde Crasto, spokesperson of the Nationalist Congress Party, asked on X. India's ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and its allies won November elections in the western state of Maharashtra, the capital of which is Mumbai. Actor and filmmaker Pooja Bhatt also called for a greater police presence in the suburb home to many in the film industry. 'The city, and especially the queen of the suburbs, have never felt so unsafe before,' she said on X, using a popular description for the trendy Bandra area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bollywood-star-saif-ali-khan-out-of-danger-after-stabbing-at-mumbai-home/7938896.html	2025-01-16T04:16:43-08:00	
Congo court sentences Chinese nationals to 7 years in prison in illegal mining crackdown	UVIRA, THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF THE CONGO — A court in the Democratic Republic of Congo has sentenced three Chinese nationals to seven years in prison for engaging in activities related to illegal mining. The court, in Congo’s eastern city of Bukavu, the capital of Congo’s gold-rich South Kivu province, sentenced the men late Tuesday for the illegal purchase and possession of minerals, money laundering and other offenses. The suspects were found in possession of $400,000 in cash and a substantial amount of gold on Sunday, raising concerns about the scale of their operations and the potential involvement of organized networks. Speaking to reporters on Monday, the governor of South Kivu province, Jean Jacque Purusi, said people there are tired of those who plunder the country's resources. 'This is only one-tenth of what they have already taken from us. We will not let it go. This is the wealth of the people of South Kivu. We are determined to go all the way because enough is enough,' Purusi said. Jean Paul Kasinga a local official, told VOA that it was unusual for someone to be moving around with that much money. 'They didn’t have any official document allowing them to work and without government knowledge.' Etienne Mutware, a lecturer at the Evangelical University in Africa in Panzi, Bukavu, said that illegal mining activities rob the local community of potential revenue. 'Partnerships are meant to bring mutual benefits like infrastructure, schools, and development. However, fraud, corruption, and illegal mining in the Congo have thwarted these expectations, resulting in a significant loss for both the population and the nation,' Mutware told VOA. Purusi halted mineral mining in July to curb illegal mining and ensure that mining operations are conducted in a regulated and sustainable manner. In December religious groups and civil society members in South Kivu’s Mwenga territory took to the streets, voicing their concerns over the activities of Chinese mining companies. Protesters demanded infrastructure development and accountability from foreign companies. 'These Chinese companies in (the towns of) Lugusha, Kitutu, Kaboke, Suguru, and Mitobo have failed to fulfill their promises. They promised to build schools, bridges, roads, hospitals, and a stadium, and to provide scholarships for our students. But they have done nothing,' one protester told VOA’s Central Africa Service.

Indian space agency achieves satellite docking milestone	BENGALURU — India became the world's fourth nation on Thursday to achieve the feat of space docking, a technological milestone that underscores its ambitions to expand its share of a rapidly growing $400-billion global space market. Target and Chaser, two satellites of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) that are each roughly the size of a large refrigerator, successfully latched onto each other Thursday morning, an agency spokesperson said. The indigenous technology, crucial for satellite servicing, space station operations, and interplanetary missions, positions India for a key role in commercial and exploratory space efforts. 'India has ambitious missions planned and to achieve those, this is an important technology,' astrophysicist Jayant Murthy said. 'Various missions, like building a space station, need assembly in space, which is not possible without space docking.' ISRO said the two satellites participating in its Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX), will now be controlled as a single object, with power transfer checks made in the next few days. The mission had been postponed twice, first because the docking process needed further validation through ground simulations, and then to resolve an issue stemming from excess drift between the satellites. SpaDeX, launched on Dec. 30 from India's main spaceport, deployed the satellites in orbit with an Indian-made rocket. Among 24 payloads and experiments were eight cowpea seeds, sent to space to study plant growth in microgravity conditions, which germinated within four days of the mission's launch. Scientists say this is a critical step demonstrating that food can eventually be grown in space during long missions. The mission also will demonstrate the transfer of electric power between docked spacecraft, key to applications such as in-space robotics, composite spacecraft control and payload operations after undocking. Such techniques are essential for missions requiring multiple rocket launches. Space exploration and commercialization is a key part of Prime Minister Narendra Modi's efforts to position India as a global superpower. The successful SpaDeX mission 'is a significant stepping stone for India's ambitious space missions in the years to come,' Modi said on X. On Thursday, India approved the setting-up of a third launch pad in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, to be completed in four years at a cost of $461 million, giving a further boost to its space plans. ISRO is focused on deep-space exploration and enabling private companies to commercialize the sector, with projects ranging from solar studies to orbital astronaut missions and planetary defense, in collaboration with NASA. With the global commercial space market expected to reach $1 trillion by 2030, India aims to grow its share to $44 billion by 2040, up from $8 billion, or a slice of just 2%, now.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-space-agency-achieves-satellite-docking-milestone/7938864.html	2025-01-16T03:32:25-08:00	
Cyprus says US decree on security affirms island's stabilizing role in region	NICOSIA, Cyprus — Cyprus on Thursday hailed a U.S. memorandum allowing military sales, including arms, to the island as a milestone affirming recognition of the island as a pillar of stability in the east Mediterranean region which has been fraught with conflict. U.S. President Joe Biden boosted security ties with Cyprus on Wednesday by issuing a memorandum that makes the island eligible to receive American defense articles, military sales and training. Cyprus has over the years played a key role in evacuating people out of conflict zones and established a maritime corridor for aid to war-ravaged Gaza last year. 'This (memorandum) is a clear recognition of the Republic of Cyprus as a pillar of stability and security in the Eastern Mediterranean, with the potential to further contribute to peace and the management of humanitarian challenges,' the Cypriot presidency said in a statement. The foreign ministry of the breakaway Turkish Cypriot administration in northern Cyprus said the U.S. decision showed Cyprus' internationally recognized Greek government would 'continue its arms race as if it were preparing for war.' 'We call on the countries that support the warmongering of the Greek Cypriot side to act by calculating the consequences of these actions and to be sensible,' the statement said, adding it would keep taking steps with Turkey to protect the security of its citizens. Cyprus was close to Russia for decades, but there has been a marked shift in allegiances in recent years. Many in Cyprus have drawn parallels between Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Turkey's invasion of Cyprus in 1974, and EU-member Cyprus has followed its peers in adopting sanctions on Moscow. It is now getting FBI expertise in countering illicit finance. The U.S. embassy in Nicosia said access to U.S. programs would enable greater interoperability to respond to regional humanitarian crises, counter malign influence, and combat terrorism and transnational organized crime. The deepening in ties between the U.S. and Cyprus has been closely followed by Turkey, which in September criticized the pair's signing of a roadmap to boost defense co-operation. The 1974 Turkish invasion of Cyprus followed a brief Greek-inspired coup after years of sporadic violence between Greek and Turkish Cypriots that had led to the collapse of a power-sharing administration in 1963.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyprus-says-us-decree-on-security-affirms-island-s-stabilizing-role-in-region/7938840.html	2025-01-16T02:53:26-08:00	
China reports problems at 5 reservoirs in Tibet after earthquake	BEIJING — Chinese authorities in Tibet have detected problems, including cracks, at five out of 14 hydropower dams that they have inspected since a magnitude 6.8 earthquake rocked the southwest region last week, an emergency official said Thursday. Of the five affected dams, three have since been emptied, the Tibet emergency management official told a news conference. In the county of Tingri, the quake's epicenter, the walls of one hydrodam have tilted, prompting the evacuation of about 1,500 people from six villages downstream to higher ground, he said. At another hydrodam, monitoring devices have been installed as it is being drained. The earthquake, which has killed at least 126 people and injured hundreds, was a reminder of the risks from a hydropower-building spree by China and India in one of the world's most remote, quake-prone regions. Earthquakes have damaged dams in the past, particularly by setting off landslides and rockfalls. A massive earthquake in Nepal in 2015 shuttered almost a fifth of its hydropower for more than a year. The Jan. 7 quake in Tibet, the fifth-deadliest in China since the 2008 Sichuan temblor, destroyed more than 3,600 houses and damaged religious structures, with aftershocks of up to 5.0 in magnitude still shaking the area. Southwestern parts of China, Nepal and northern India are often hit by earthquakes caused by the collision of the Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates. Tingri, which sits atop the zone where the Indian plate pushes under Tibet, is particularly vulnerable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-reports-problems-at-5-reservoirs-in-tibet-after-earthquake/7938832.html	2025-01-16T02:48:11-08:00	
US experts question reason for probe of loudspeaker broadcasts into North Korea	A move by South Korean opposition leaders to launch an independent probe of embattled President Yoon Suk Yeol over Seoul’s use of loudspeaker broadcasts into North Korea is raising questions among some U.S. experts about the future direction of Seoul’s approach toward Pyongyang. Yoon, who was impeached and suspended from his duties last month for imposing emergency martial law on his unsuspecting country, was arrested Wednesday after a weeks-long standoff with investigators at the presidential compound. Yoon, the first sitting president of South Korea to be under criminal investigation, faces a trial at the country’s Constitutional Court, which has the final say on whether he should be completely removed from his presidential responsibilities. The country’s opposition Democratic Party, which holds a majority in parliament, and other smaller opposition parties introduced a revised bill last week to launch a special counsel investigation into Yoon’s alleged insurrection attempt during his short-lived declaration of martial law on Dec. 3, 2024. The revised bill accuses Yoon of blasting loudspeaker broadcasts toward North Korea and sending propaganda leaflets to Pyongyang. They were cited as cases of provoking aggression from outside the country. The South Korean Defense Ministry rejected the opposition’s allegations that the country’s military activities, including the use of loudspeakers, are intended to provoke North Korea. 'Our military has deterred North Korea’s provocations through a consistent policy toward North Korea while maintaining firm military readiness,' the ministry said Monday in a statement, adding that some people are 'distorting the normal activities of our military.' VOA Korean sought comment from the U.S. State Department on the latest controversy over South Korea’s information campaigns toward North Korea but did not receive a response. However, a State Department spokesman said in an email on June 10, 2024, to VOA Korean that the United States supports the North Korean people’s right to access information from outside. 'We continue to promote the free flow of information into, out of, and within the DPRK [North Korea],' the spokesperson said, a day after the South Korean military resumed loudspeaker broadcasts on the inter-Korean border for the first time in six years in response to North Korea’s trash balloon offensive. 'It is critical for the people of North Korea to have access to independent information not controlled by the DPRK regime,' the spokesperson said. Gittipong Paruchabutr, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council, told VOA Korean by phone Wednesday that loudspeaker broadcasts are 'a low-risk, effective tool' for communicating with North Koreans. 'Absolutely, it’s a critical capability. It’s a low-risk capability that when we want to communicate to North Koreans, not just soldiers, but anybody within audio range. And I say low risk because it doesn’t really put Korean soldiers’ lives at risk,' Paruchabutr, who also served as chief of psychological operations for U.S. Forces Korea, said. Paruchabutr added that in the past, South Korean loudspeaker broadcasts usually played K-pop songs and rebroadcasts of South Korean domestic news that included social topics promoting human rights, rather than information that 'directly criticize North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and his family.' Controversy over accusation Sydney Seiler, former national intelligence officer for North Korea at the National Intelligence Council, pointed out that the allegations that Yoon provoked North Korea’s aggression is a political claim that ignores the threats North Korea is posing to South Korea. 'The accusation that these are treason is ludicrous, nothing short of ludicrous,' Seiler said Tuesday by phone. 'This is a democratically elected government taking seriously its responsibilities for the national security of the Republic of Korea. This is not treason. This is just political maneuvering on the opposition parties’ part,' Seiler said, using the official name to refer to South Korea. David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, said the opposition parties’ assertion stokes concerns of 'an extreme naivete about the strategy of the Kim family regime.' 'This is really troubling. They are sending the message that they do not think South Korea should be sending information into North Korea. That’s fundamentally what they’re talking about,' Maxwell, a former U.S. Special Forces colonel, told VOA Korean by phone on Tuesday. Others shared more cautious views, saying more details are needed before determining whether Yoon’s policy decisions were legitimate or not. Evans Revere, a former acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, highlighted the need for an investigation. 'The idea of propaganda balloons going into North Korea. The idea of loudspeakers blasting music and news and propaganda into North Korea — that’s been going on for many years, and it hasn't been regarded by most people as an attempt to instigate a conflict or a confrontation,' Revere told VOA Korean by phone on Tuesday. 'But now, the opposition is using that as one of the charges against [Yoon], and it needs to be looked into. It needs to be investigated,' Revere said. 'The question that’s probably weighing on the minds of a lot of policymakers in the United States right now is the question of whether there was some effort on the part of the Yoon administration to provoke a confrontation with North Korea. That’s a very serious charge,' he added. Meanwhile, Bruce Klingner, senior research fellow for Northeast Asia at the Heritage Foundation, said South Korea’s Democratic Party’s criticism of the information warfare reflects its thinking on policy toward North Korea. 'The main impact will be that if a Democratic Party government came in as a result of a special election, the Democratic Party would indeed have very different foreign security policies, would be much more conciliatory, if not concessionary, towards China and North Korea,' Klingner said Tuesday by phone. VOA’s Sangjin Cho contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-experts-question-reason-for-probe-of-loudspeaker-broadcasts-into-north-korea/7938830.html	2025-01-16T02:34:36-08:00	
Netanyahu accuses Hamas of backtracking on Gaza ceasefire deal	Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu accused Hamas of backtracking on parts of a Gaza ceasefire deal Thursday and said his Cabinet would not meet to give necessary approval to the agreement until the militant group accepts all of the elements. A statement from Netanyahu’s office said Hamas was trying to 'extort last minute concessions.' The multiphase ceasefire, announced Wednesday after months of negotiations, was due to go into effect Sunday if fully approved. Palestinian medics said Israeli forces carried out multiple deadly airstrikes Thursday in the Gaza Strip. U.N. agencies said they were ready to surge humanitarian aid into Gaza, where the United Nations says at least 1.9 million of the 2.3 million population have been displaced and 92% of housing units have been destroyed. Israeli President Isaac Herzog offered his strong support for the ceasefire after the deal was announced Wednesday. 'As the President of the State of Israel, I say in the clearest terms: This is the right move,' he said. 'This is an important move. This is a necessary move. There is no greater moral, human, Jewish, or Israeli obligation than to bring our sons and daughters back to us — whether to recover at home, or to be laid to rest.' But one of the main opponents of the deal in the government, minister of finance Bezalel Smotrich, called it 'a bad and dangerous deal for the national security of the State of Israel.' The first phase of the agreement includes a 42-day ceasefire, the release of 33 hostages from Gaza, the release of Palestinian prisoners from Israel, a phased Israeli military withdrawal from Gaza and an increased flow of aid for Palestinian civilians. During the first phase, there will be negotiations on the details of a second phase focused on bringing a permanent end to the conflict with the release of the remaining hostages and a full Israeli withdrawal. A final phase concerns rebuilding Gaza, with a new governing and security structure. The war in Gaza began when Hamas sent its fighters into Israel in a stunning Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack that killed more than 1,200 people and abducted more than 250 people. Of those hostages, just under 100 are thought to remain in Hamas custody and a third are believed to be dead. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Gazan authorities say more than 46,700 Palestinians – most of them children and women – have been killed in Israeli military operations. In a statement, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which includes the families of 98 hostages, said Wednesday they welcomed 'with overwhelming joy and relief the agreement to bring our loved ones home.' 'However, deep anxiety and concerns accompany us regarding the possibility that the agreement might not be fully implemented, leaving hostages behind,' the statement continued. 'We urgently call for swift arrangements to ensure all phases of the deal are carried out.' A senior Biden administration official told reporters that two of the living American hostages – Keith Siegel and Sagui Dekel-Chen – will be among the first hostages released. The official spoke to reporters on condition of anonymity, as customary in such briefings. 'Fighting in Gaza will stop, and soon the hostages return home to their families,' U.S. President Joe Biden said as he announced the ceasefire deal Wednesday at the White House. Biden urged his successor, President-elect Donald Trump, to implement the agreement, as Biden prepares to hand over power on Jan. 20. Trump said, on his social media network, that he was 'thrilled' and that his administration would build upon the success of this deal to expand U.S.-mediated Abraham Accords to normalize Arab-Israeli relations. 'This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,' he wrote on Truth Social. Analysts say Trump’s fiery threats last week – of 'all hell' breaking loose unless there was a deal before his inauguration – may have played a role. 'President-elect Trump has been very, very clear, he said he would unleash hell on Hamas if the hostages weren't released,' said Mirette Mabrouk, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. 'I mean, really, there isn't very much more hell that you could unleash on the current inhabitants of Gaza. They're already in hell, but there's also the feeling that he must have placed some pressure on [Israeli] Prime Minister [Benjamin] Netanyahu as well. And this is why we are now moving forward.' What about the day after? Some analysts looking to the proverbial 'day after' expressed doubt the next administration can reach the big goal, which is the U.S.’s vocal longtime support of a two-state solution. 'I don't see it under the Trump administration and that's not squarely a criticism of the Trump administration or anyone else,' said Jonathan Ruhe, director of foreign policy at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America. 'I think both the Israelis and Palestinians are so far off on making the sort of the hard agreements necessary to achieve a two-state solution – I don't think there's the political will on either the Israeli or Palestinian side.' But as Biden and Qatar’s prime minister laid out in explaining the newly inked agreements, the deal is complex enough. Biden on Wednesday also emphasized how arduous the negotiations have been, and he used that point to underscore his administration's strong support for Israel, which has provoked tension between the U.S. and its closest allies. 'This is one of the toughest negotiations I've ever experienced,' the president said. 'And it reached this point because of the pressure that Israel built on Hamas backed by the United States.'

Britain announces Ukraine pact with military collaboration	Britain announced Thursday a treaty with Ukraine that includes military collaboration, science and technology partnerships, and an effort to track stolen Ukrainian grain. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer is visiting Kyiv to sign the pact with Ukrainian leaders. Starmer is also announcing a new round of lethal military aid for Ukrainian forces, his office said. 'This is not just about the here and now, it is also about an investment in our two countries for the next century, bringing together technology development, scientific advances and cultural exchanges, and harnessing the phenomenal innovation shown by Ukraine in recent years for generations to come,' Starmer said in a statement. Starmer said Russian President Vladimir Putin has failed to 'wrench Ukraine away from its closest partners,' and instead has left Ukraine and its allies 'closer than ever.' The agreement includes cooperation on maritime security in the Baltic Sea, Black Sea and the Sea of Azov to deter Russian aggression, Starmer’s office said. Outside of military collaboration, the two countries will work together on agricultural technology, healthcare and space issues. Aerial attacks Ukraine’s military said Thursday that Russian drone attacks caused damage at a farm in the Chernihiv region, while debris from drones destroyed by Ukrainian air defenses damaged houses in Kharkiv and Poltava. Chernihiv Governor Vyacheslav Chaus said on Telegram the farm damage included a hangar used to store corn, and that there were no casualties from the attack. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram his region was targeted by Russian drones, missiles and heavy artillery, killing one person, injuring another and damaging about three dozen homes. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 34 of the 55 total drones Russia launched overnight, Ukraine’s air force said. Intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday its air defenses destroyed 27 Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod, Voronezh, Tambov and Kursk regions. Voronezh Governor Alexander Gusev said on Telegram that a Ukrainian drone attack caused a fire at an oil depot, but no casualties.

Dry, windy weather to ease as firefighters battle LA wildfires	Southern California firefighters made some progress in containing two major wildfires, while forecasters said weather conditions in the coming days could bring welcome relief from the days of dry air and high winds that have plagued the region. The relief will give firefighters a key window to battle the Palisades Fire on the west edge of Los Angeles and the Eaton Fire in the foothills east of the city before another potential turn to dangerous conditions next week. 'Good news: We are expecting a much-needed break from the fire weather concerns to close this week,' the National Weather Service said Wednesday. 'Bad News: Next week is a concern. While confident that we will NOT see a repeat of last week, dangerous fire weather conditions are expected.' The Palisades Fire was 21% contained late Wednesday after burning 96 square kilometers, according to the California Department of Foresty and Fire Protection. The agency said the Eaton Fire was 45% contained and had burned 57 square kilometers. More than 82,000 people were under evacuation orders, while 8,500 firefighters from the United States, Canada and Mexico were battling the two fires and several smaller ones in the region. The fires have killed at least 25 people and burned 12,000 homes and other structures, according to authorities. The wildfires ignited Jan. 7, fueled by strong Santa Ana winds in a region that has been largely without rain for eight months. Weather forecasts show little to no chance of rain in the next week.

Billionaires and foreign dignitaries to attend Trump’s inauguration	Elon Musk, the world’s richest person, will be among several billionaires attending Donald Trump’s second presidential inauguration. Tesla CEO Musk was instrumental in Trump’s reelection with his contribution of over a quarter of a billion dollars to Trump’s campaign coffers, according to Forbes. Musk is set to head Trump’s new Department of Government Efficiency, along with Vivek Ramaswamy, the biotech entrepreneur. Reports say that Musk is slated to be seated at the inauguration with fellow billionaires Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. While it is not customary to invite foreign leaders, Trump has invited several. Argentinian President Javier Milei is expected to attend, according to Bloomberg. Milei was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump after he won November’s election. Trump has also invited Chinese President Xi Jinping who is sending an envoy. Far-right Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni has also received an invitation, but she has said she is not sure her schedule will allow her to attend. It is customary for all the living presidents to attend the inauguration. Outgoing President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will attend Monday’s ceremony. When Biden was sworn in four years ago, following Trump’s losing reelection bid, Trump did not attend because he held on to the belief that he had won the election. Former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton will also attend Trump’s inauguration. Bush and Clinton are set to be there with their wives, Laura Bush and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. 'Former first lady Michelle Obama will not attend the upcoming inauguration,' the Office of Barack and Michelle Obama said in a statement. It will be the second time in recent weeks, following her absence at President Jimmy Carter’s funeral, that she has not attended a public ceremony with other former presidents and their wives. Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband, second gentleman Douglas Emhoff, are also expected to be at the ceremony Monday. Harris was the Democratic candidate in last year’s presidential election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/billionaires-and-foreign-dignitaries-to-attend-trump-s-inauguration/7938759.html	2025-01-15T21:43:54-08:00

Cuba begins freeing prisoners after US says it will lift terror designation	HAVANA — Cuba started releasing some prisoners Wednesday as part of talks with the Vatican, a day after President Joe Biden's administration announced his intent to lift the U.S. designation of the island nation as a state sponsor of terrorism. More than a dozen people who were convicted of different crimes — and some of them were arrested after taking part in historic 2021 protests — were released during the day, according to Cuban civil groups following the cases of detainees in the island. Among those freed was tattooist Reyna Yacnara Barreto Batista, 24, who was detained in the 2021 protests and convicted to four years in prison for attacks and public disorder. She was released from a prison in the province of Camagüey and told The Associated Press that eight men were freed along with her. On Tuesday, the Biden administration said it notified Congress of its intent to lift the designation of Cuba as part of a deal facilitated by the Vatican. Cuban authorities would release some of them before Biden's administration ends on Jan. 20, officials said. Hours later, the Cuban foreign ministry said the government informed Pope Francis it would gradually release 553 convicts as authorities explore legal and humanitarian ways to make it happen. Havana did not link the prisoners' release to the U.S. decision on lifting the designation but said it was 'in the spirit of the Ordinary Jubilee of the year 2025 declared by His Holiness,' referring to the Vatican's once-every-25-year tradition of a Jubilee, in which the Catholic faithful make pilgrimages to Rome. The Cuban Observatory of Human Rights, one of the civil groups, said that by 4 p.m. EST, 18 people had been released, including Barreto Batista. 'At three in the morning they knocked,' Barreto Batista told the AP over the phone. 'I was sleeping (in the cell) and they told me to gather all my things, that I was free.' She said that she and the eight men were warned it was not a pardon or a forgiveness and that they had to be on good behavior or they could be sent back to prison. 'I am at home with my mother,' she said. 'The whole family is celebrating.' In July 2021, thousands of Cubans took to the streets to protest widespread power outages and shortages amid a severe economic crisis. The government's crackdown on the demonstrators, which included arrests and detentions, sparked international criticism, while Cuban officials blamed U.S. sanctions and a media campaign for the unrest. In November, another Cuban nongovernmental organization, Justice 11J, said that 554 people remained in custody in connection with the protests. Biden's intention to lift the U.S. designation of Cuba as a state sponsor of terrorism is likely to be reversed as early as next week after President-elect Donald Trump takes office and Secretary of State-designate Marco Rubio assumes the position of America's top diplomat. Rubio, whose family left Cuba in the 1950s before the communist revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, has long been a proponent of sanctions on the communist island.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cuba-begins-freeing-prisoners-after-us-says-it-will-lift-terror-designation-/7938700.html	2025-01-15T18:34:04-08:00

House speaker removes chairman of House Intelligence Committee	WASHINGTON — House Speaker Mike Johnson on Wednesday removed the Republican chairman of the powerful House Intelligence Committee, who was a vocal supporter of assistance for Ukraine and held other views that put him at odds with President-elect Donald Trump. Johnson told reporters late Wednesday that Representative Mike Turner, an Ohio Republican, would no longer lead the committee, which oversees the nation's intelligence agencies and holds tremendous influence over law enforcement and foreign policy. Johnson last year also gave two Trump allies highly sought spots on the panel. Johnson said he made the decision to remove Turner because the 'intelligence community and everything related to (the committee) needs a fresh start.' The Republican speaker, who has aligned himself closely with Trump, said he would soon announce the new chairperson for the committee. Johnson went on to praise Turner and say he would play an important role in working with NATO. Turner's stances on foreign policy had run afoul of the incoming president, who will take the White House next week with a vision of reshaping the federal government's intelligence and law enforcement capabilities. Turner last year also pushed back on Trump's false claims that Haitian migrants in his Ohio district were eating pets. His office did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/house-speaker-removes-chairman-of-house-intelligence-committee/7938675.html	2025-01-15T17:44:22-08:00

Gaza ceasefire deal to pave way for Israeli hostage release, return of displaced Palestinians	Jerusalem — The prime minister of Qatar, Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, announced that Israel and Hamas had agreed to a ceasefire deal that promised the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas and the return of hundreds of thousands of people displaced in Gaza to their homes. The ceasefire deal was reached after mediation by Qatar and Egypt. U.S. President Joe Biden welcomed the deal. 'The deal is structured in three phases. Phase one will last six weeks. It includes a full and complete ceasefire, withdrawal of Israeli forces from all the populated areas of Gaza, and the release of a number of hostages held by Hamas, including women and elderly and the wounded. And I'm proud to say Americans will be part of that hostage release in phase one as well.' On the streets of Gaza, Palestinians celebrated the ceasefire, which will end the fighting for 42 days, see the release of dozens of Israeli hostages and hundreds of Palestinian prisoners, and provide more humanitarian aid to the people of Gaza who have been suffering a humanitarian crisis. The Palestinians in Gaza have paid the heaviest price for the war with Israel, which began almost 16 months ago when Hamas militants attacked Israel. The Hamas-run Health Ministry says Israel has killed more than 46,000 Palestinians since then. Moatasem al-Namrouti, a resident of Khan Yunis in southern Gaza, welcomed the ceasefire. 'We have been waiting for this joyful moment,' he said. 'We have been at war for a long time.' In a televised address, acting Hamas leader Khalil al Hayya said that Israel failed to achieve its goals in Gaza. On the streets of Tel Aviv, some also celebrated. The Hostage Family Forum called it a significant step forward that brings closer the return of all those held captive. However, they said in a statement, they also have deep anxiety and concern regarding the possibility the agreement might not be fully implemented, and hostages would be left behind. Demonstrator Nofar Honigman said she was cautiously optimistic. 'We really hope that no one will mess it up, not on our side, not on their side. And we really wait for this very, very needed thing to happen, for the war to stop, for the hostages to come home.' The Israeli government is expected to approve the deal on Thursday, and it will take effect on Sunday. Israeli press reports say that on Sunday, the first three hostages are to be released. Hamas has refused to say how many of the 33 women, children and elderly who are to be freed in the first stage of the deal, are still alive.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-ceasefire-deal-to-pave-way-for-israeli-hostage-release-return-of-displaced-palestinians/7938639.html	2025-01-15T16:25:08-08:00

Trump's pick to lead CIA promises more focus, firmer posture	WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the CIA signaled substantial changes are in store for America’s premier spy agency, telling lawmakers that it must be more aggressive both in collecting intelligence and pushing back against Washington’s adversaries. John Ratcliffe, who served as director of national intelligence at the end of Trump’s first term, told the Senate Intelligence Committee during his confirmation hearing Wednesday that the CIA’s human intelligence collection capability 'isn’t where it needs to be.' 'We will collect intelligence, especially human intelligence, in every corner of the globe no matter how dark or difficult,' Ratcliffe said of his plans for the spy agency, should he be confirmed. 'We will conduct covert actions at the direction of the president, going places no one else can go and doing things no one else can do,' he added. Ratcliffe promised the CIA would deliver insights and information free of personal and political bias, and said that if confirmed, he would hold accountable employees and analysts who fail to perform up to standard and eliminate programs that shift focus from the CIA’s key responsibilities. 'If you have a politically motivated, bureaucratically imposed social justice agenda that takes up part of your attention, that can distract from the core mission of collecting human intelligence that matter and providing it to you in a timely way,' he said. 'To the brave CIA officers listening around the world, if all of this sounds like what you signed up for, then buckle up and get ready to make a difference,' Ratcliffe said. 'If it doesn't, then it's time to find a new line of work.' Republican approval Ratcliffe’s comments were met with approval from Senate Intelligence Committee Republicans, who praised his experience and his plans to refocus the CIA. 'The CIA needs to get back to its roots,' said committee chairman Tom Cotton. 'Stealing secrets.' 'The nation needs a strong, capable and aggressive CIA,' Cotton said, calling Ratcliffe the right man for the job. 'I believe the men and women you will lead want to serve in just that kind of agency. They joined the CIA after all, not a church choir or a therapy session,' he added. Democrats on the committee were, at times, more skeptical, asking Ratcliffe for assurances that officers and analysts will not be subjected to political loyalty tests. 'Mr. Ratcliffe today is your opportunity to reassure the men and women of the CIA that they [need] not fear reprisal for speaking truth to power — the most critical role of the IC [intelligence community],' said Democrat Mark Warner, the committee’s vice chair. 'I need your commitment that you will not fire or force out CIA employees because of their perceived political views, and that you will not ask these employees to place loyalty to a political figure above loyalty to country,' he said. Ratcliffe responded, assuring lawmakers that he would not oversee a purge of the agency. CIA role 'If you look at my record, and my record as DNI, that never took place,' Ratcliffe said. 'That's not something anyone has alleged and something I would ever do.' Other lawmakers raised concerns about Trump’s history of mistrust of the CIA and other U.S. intelligence agencies, fueled in part by U.S. intelligence assessments that Russia sought to intervene in the 2016 U.S. presidential election to help Trump win. 'It seems to me you have an initial task that's a little unusual but also very important, and that is to restore the confidence of the president-elect in the intelligence community,' said Senator Angus King, an independent. 'You need to get him to a place where he does have confidence in the judgments that are coming to him,' King added. Ratcliffe said that was likely why he was chosen to lead the CIA. 'I think one of the reasons I have this opportunity for you all to consider me for confirmation is because President Trump knows and wants me to lead with integrity,' he told the committee. Still, some former U.S. intelligence officials have taken a dim view of Ratcliffe’s qualifications to lead the spy agency despite his time as the nation’s top intelligence official. Lingering doubts 'As DNI, Ratcliffe repeatedly demonstrated that his first priority was to advance Donald Trump's political interests rather than to function as an apolitical intelligence chief,' said Paul Pillar, a former senior CIA officer who now teaches at Georgetown University. As examples, Pillar pointed to Ratcliffe’s decision to release a Russian intelligence assessment that seemed to back Trump’s allegations about nefarious activity by his opponent in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Democrat Hillary Clinton. Pillar also noted that Ratcliffe also shunned transparency, refusing to attend Congress’ annual worldwide threats hearing 'because the previous year's assessment reported facts that Trump didn't like.' 'To politicize the role of CIA director in a similar manner is just as damaging to the proper role of intelligence as politicizing the role of DNI,' Pillar told VOA. 'There is no reason to expect Ratcliffe to perform any differently in this respect in the CIA job than he did as DNI.' But other former officials saw Ratcliffe’s performance during the hearing Wednesday as a positive step. 'Ratcliffe performed well and should rightly obtain an easy confirmation,' said Larry Pfeiffer, a former CIA chief of staff and former senior director of the White House Situation Room. 'He said all the right things about the importance of analytic and operational integrity and about the technical challenges facing CIA today,' Pfeiffer told VOA. 'More importantly, he offered assurances he would assiduously avoid and counter politicization of the agency. … This will be reassuring to anyone inside CIA today who is nervous about the incoming Trump administration.' Top threats Ratcliffe told lawmakers the list of threats and challenges facing the United States is long, topped by an ever more aggressive China that is 'committed to dominating the world economically, militarily and technologically.' He also cited threats from transnational criminal organizations and drug cartels, Iran and its proxies, North Korea and multiple terror groups. And he acknowledged the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine. 'The Russia-Ukraine war rages on, spreading devastation and increasing the risk of the United States being pulled into a conflict with a nuclear power,' Ratcliffe warned. But he also said that Russia, unlike China, is unable to confront the U.S. across multiple domains at once. Russia 'falls into that category' of 'countries that can't compete with the United States in terms of kinetic firepower across the board,' Ratcliffe said. 'The Russians have to decide where they're going to compete,' he said, noting that Moscow has chosen areas like hypersonic missile technology at the expense of overall troop readiness. Ratcliffe further promised lawmakers he would ensure the CIA seeks answers to the cause of Havana Syndrome — the name given to a series of brain injuries and other serious health ailments that have struck hundreds of U.S. diplomats and intelligence officials. And he voiced support for maintaining controversial U.S. surveillance authorities under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, calling it an indispensable tool, going as far to reject calls to require a warrant before accessing certain communications or data — a view that conflicts with positions previously espoused by other Trump nominees. 'You're going to need to share your experience and your wisdom with the nominees for FBI and director of national security,' Republican Senator John Cornyn told Ratcliffe, 'because we've had these conversations as well, and I think there's some confusion.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-pick-to-lead-cia-promises-more-focus-firmer-posture-/7938361.html	2025-01-15T15:09:08-08:00

Mozambique president sworn in amid tight security, protests	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — Under tight security measures, Mozambique’s new president, Daniel Chapo, was sworn in as the country’s fifth president on Wednesday. Around 2,500 guests, including the presidents of South Africa and Guinea-Bissau, endured intense heat as Chapo took his oath to become Mozambique’s president for the next five years. The ceremony took place as hundreds of demonstrators gathered on streets near the Maputo city hall, saying the election was rigged. Official results showed the 48-year-old winning the October election with about 65% of the votes. However, opposition parties rejected the results, and for close to 10 weeks, Mozambique has endured large street protests as well as a violent crackdown by security forces. Presidential runner-up Venancio Mondlane has been leading the push for protests on social media, demanding what he calls the 'restoration of the electoral truth.' The European Union and some Western countries, including the United States, also have questioned the credibility of the elections. The unrest has left at least 300 people dead, according to local and international human rights organizations. New leader faces challenges Chapo inherits a country ravaged by corruption and deep economic challenges, including high unemployment and frequent job strikes by civil servants such as teachers, nurses and doctors. In his speech Wednesday, Chapo called corruption a disease that has 'corroded the tissue of our state and our people.' 'This has to end,' said the new president. 'There is no place in this government — nor in this country — for anyone who puts his interests above those of the people. We will fight until the end to defend the interests of the Mozambican people in all sectors, public and private.' Chapo, whose Frelimo party has been in power for almost 50 years, promised a leaner government by reducing some ministries and senior government positions. He said that could save more than $260 million, which could be redirected toward improving the lives of people. 'It is just the beginning' Political analyst Evaristo Cumbane said the new president is facing an uphill climb, one that includes pacifying the country and winning the confidence of foreign investors. 'Now, a big challenge he has is how he will deal with this political instability, because taking over the government is not everything, it is just the beginning,' said Cumbane. 'He does not have popular support and his opponent, Venancio Mondlane, believing that their votes were stolen, will continue with their protests until the truth is revealed. So, let's see how he'll handle it. I believe he will invite Venancio to sit with him and that will be the way forward. If they can do that, the country will get back on track.' Fernando Lima, the political editor of the independent weekly Savana, says the only way to end the ongoing protests is for the new president to talk to Mondlane. Mondlane returned to the country last week after almost three months of self-imposed exile. 'He is the one who has the ability to help resolve the political bottlenecks that the country is facing, and is probably the most important political actor in entertaining the dialogue with the government and Frelimo,' said Lima. 'So, things are going to change from that point of view. And he said exactly that upon his arrival, that he is here to entertain the dialogue, it is not here to accept public positions, to receive financial benefits.' Along with the post-election protests, Chapo will have to contend with a jihadist insurgency in the oil- and gas-rich northern province of Cabo Delgado that has killed 6,000 people and left 2 million others internally displaced.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-president-sworn-in-amid-tight-security-protests/7939591.html	2025-01-15T15:00:43-08:00	
Trump's pick for top diplomat calls for ceasefire in Russia’s war on Ukraine	Russia’s nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine has become a 'war of attrition' and a 'stalemate' that must be ended, Senator Marco Rubio, President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to be secretary of state, told senators at his confirmation hearing on Wednesday. Rubio broke from the passive stance of the administration of outgoing President Joe Biden, which has said it was up to Kyiv to decide under what terms it would be open to peace talks with Moscow. In the meantime, the U.S., along with its European allies, has continued to send billions of dollars of armaments to Ukraine to continue the fight. Rubio instead said the first step in ending the war should be a ceasefire that halts ground fighting, which has for more than a year mostly occurred in eastern Ukraine. However, ongoing fighting is also raging in Russia’s Kursk region, which Ukraine captured in August, even as Moscow has attempted to retake it with the help of North Korean troops. Both countries also target each other daily with aerial strikes, drones and missiles, with thousands of Ukrainian civilians killed in the Russian attacks, along with vast numbers of both countries’ troops. 'This war has to end,' he said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Rubio called the destruction in Ukraine 'extraordinary,' saying it will 'take a generation to rebuild.' But even as he argued for a negotiated settlement to end the fighting that started with Russia’s invasion in February 2022, Rubio said it was unlikely that there would be much change in the current battle lines. Russia currently holds about a fifth of the internationally recognized Ukrainian land mass. 'The truth of the matter is that in this conflict, there is no way Russia takes all of Ukraine,' Rubio said. 'It’s also unrealistic to believe that somehow, a nation the size of Ukraine, no matter how incompetent and no matter how much damage the Russian Federation has suffered as a result of this invasion, there’s no way Ukraine is also going to push these people all the way back to where they were on the eve of the invasion.' Democrats, and some Republicans on the committee, continued to voice their support for more military aid to Ukraine, saying it was important to give Kyiv leverage in any eventual peace talks with Moscow. But Rubio said that one of Ukraine’s key problems was not a shortage of ammunition or money but its inability to train and recruit enough troops. 'The problem that Ukraine is facing is not that they’re running out of money, [it] is that they’re running out of Ukrainians,' he said. Trump has voiced skepticism of continued U.S. military support for Kyiv and repeatedly vowed that he would end the war before he assumed the presidency on Jan. 20. In recent days, his aides have said the new timeline is ending the war in the first 100 days of his administration, which would be by the end of April. On the battlefront, officials in western Ukraine said Wednesday that a Russian missile attack hit critical infrastructure facilities in the Lviv region, part of a series of attacks that President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said included more than 40 missiles and 70 drones. Zelenskyy said Russia’s targets included 'gas and energy facilities that sustain normal life for our people,' but that Ukrainian air defenses shot down 30 of the missiles. 'Thanks to our air defense forces and all involved units, we’ve managed to maintain the functionality of our energy system,' Zelenskyy said. 'However, we must continue strengthening the capabilities of Ukraine’s air shield. Promises made by partners at the NATO summit in Washington and within the Ramstein format still remain partially unfulfilled.' Ukraine’s military issued air alerts for regions across the country Wednesday, while the national power grid operator instituted power cuts in six regions. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that Russian forces attacked overnight with drones and missiles, with fragments from destroyed drones damaging two houses. In Dnipropetrovsk, Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that Russian attacks included artillery, drones and missiles that damaged an industrial site. Kirovohrad Governor Andriy Raikovich reported on Telegram what he described as a massive Russian drone attack that damaged several residential buildings. Officials in the Rivne region also said Russian missiles targeted the area overnight. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed two Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod area and another drone over the Tambov region. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that Ukrainian attacks injured one person, while Tambov Governor Yevgeny Pervyshov reported damage to a house.

US imposes export controls on biotech equipment over AI security concerns	On Wednesday the U.S. Department of Commerce announced it would implement new export controls on certain biotechnology equipment, citing national security concerns relating to artificial intelligence and data science. The Commerce Department warned that China could use the biotech equipment’s technology to bolster its military capabilities and help design new weapons using artificial intelligence. The department said the technology has many applications, including its ability to be used for 'human performance enhancement, brain-machine interfaces, biologically inspired synthetic materials and possibly biological weapons.' The sanctions effectively restrict shipments of the technology to countries without a U.S. license, such as China. The controls apply to parameter flow cytometers and certain mass spectrometry equipment, which according to the Commerce Department, can 'generate high-quality, high-content biological data, including that which is suitable for use to facilitate the development of AI and biological design tools.' Last week, the Chinese Embassy in Washington said Beijing 'firmly opposes any country's development, possession or use of biological weapons.' This latest move by the United States follows recent policy decisions that reflect Washington’s broad aim to limit Beijing’s access to U.S. technology and data. Washington announced on Monday that it would tighten Beijing’s access to AI chip and technology exports by implementing new regulations that cap the number of chips that can be exported to certain countries, including China, Russia, Iran and North Korea. This month, the ban on popular Chinese-owned social media TikTok is planned to go into effect due to U.S. concerns over its potential to share sensitive data with China’s government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-export-controls-on-biotech-equipment-over-ai-security-concerns/7938147.html	2025-01-15T12:40:07-08:00

US 'TikTok Refugees' migrate to another Chinese app as ban looms	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — As TikTok’s Sunday deadline to divest or face a U.S. ban approaches, hundreds of American users of the popular social media video app say they are migrating to another Chinese social media app, Xiaohongshu, or RedNote. Dubbing themselves 'TikTok Refugees,' some say they are making the move in search of a new home; others say their exodus is a form of protest against the ban. With just days to go before the deadline, users are facing growing uncertainty as they wait for a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on whether the ban will be upheld. Reports are now suggesting that TikTok may just shut down its operations in the United States if the ban goes through. 'Our government is out of their mind if they think we are going to stand for this TikTok ban,' said American user Heather Roberts in one video on Xiaohongshu. 'We are just going to a new Chinese app and here we are.' Sky Bynum, an 18-year-old makeup content creator in the eastern state of New Jersey, told VOA that she is joining Xiaohongshu because she wants to find another social media site with a sense of community. 'The best thing about TikTok is the community on there,' Bynum told VOA in a video interview via Zoom. 'When I posted my first few makeup videos, TikTok pushed them to the makeup people and I instantly found my community. I think [the potential ban on TikTok] is awful because I’m not going to have the same thing that I had on TikTok. 'Xiaohongshu is really cool because a lot of TikTok users were trying to find new communities on Xiaohongshu,' Bynum added. Founded in 2013, Xiaohongshu is similar to Instagram and Pinterest. It currently has around 300 million users, most of them in China, and is widely used to share travel tips, makeup tutorials, and fashion trends. The name literally means 'little red book' but the company says it’s not a reference to former Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong’s collection of sayings. Downloads surge With many promoting and talking about their exodus to Xiaohongshu on 'TikTok Refugees,' Xiaohongshu became the most downloaded app on Apple’s U.S. App Store this week. More than 700,000 new users have joined Xiaohongshu this week, according to Reuters. Downloads of the app rose more than 200% year-over-year this week, according to app data research firm Sensor Tower. With more American users expected to join Xiaohongshu, some Chinese users recorded English tutorials or welcome videos for American users. 'I guess [there has] never been a lifetime or history time [that] a platform has Chinese and Americans come together and have direct views. So welcome and we respect you,' Zhou Shu-Fu, a Chinese Xiaohongshu user from the southwestern province of Sichuan, said in a video released on Jan. 15. Compared to Chinese social media users’ enthusiasm, the Chinese government offered a more cautious comment on the influx of American TikTok users to Xiaohongshu, describing the phenomenon as a 'personal choice.' 'China has always supported and encouraged strengthening cultural exchanges and promoting mutual understanding among the peoples of all countries,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said during the regular press conference on Wednesday. The influx of American users has also prompted Xiaohongshu to build Chinese-English translation tools and hire English content moderators, according to the Reuters news agency and Chinese media outlets. Most of the posts on the app are in Chinese and RedNote does not have an auto-translate function. Some American users tell VOA that their interactions with Chinese users are helping to increase their curiosity about China. 'My experience on RedNote makes me realize how toxic American social media has gotten and I’m excited to learn some basic Chinese and learn about what it’s really like in China,' Kia Epley, a 44-year-old engineer from Las Vegas, told VOA in a video interview. TikTok content creators say they are looking for more than just a safe and welcoming community. One key concern for them is how they can keep making a living on social media. 'Most of my income is made on TikTok so if the ban comes into effect, a big chunk of my income will get taken away,' said Essence Whitaker, a 28-year-old makeup content producer in Michigan. 'A lot of content creators in the U.S. will be unemployed,' she told VOA in a video interview. VOA reached out to TikTok for comment on the exodus but has yet to receive a response. Tech media The Information reported on Tuesday that TikTok plans to shut the app for American users when the federal ban comes into effect on Sunday, citing anonymous sources with knowledge of the matter. Trend or temporary protest? While the migration of American users to Xiaohongshu continues, some users say it remains unclear whether the exodus is a temporary phenomenon or a long-term trend. TikTok has more than 170 million users and so far, less than a million have moved over to Xiaohongshu. 'I don’t think the move to Xiaohongshu is going to be long-term because the biggest thing that creators worry about is monetization. Xiaohongshu doesn’t have that feature so I think other creators are still looking for an alternative to TikTok,' Bynum in New Jersey told VOA. But others say similarities between TikTok and Xiaohongshu may help convince some American users to stay on the Chinese app. 'I like how real TikTok is because you get to see people’s natural reactions,' said Whitaker in Michigan, adding that Xiaohongshu has that same vibe. 'While I can’t tell whether people are going to stay on the app or not, I think the authenticity of the content will keep some users on there,' she told VOA in a video interview. While many American users are excited about the prospect of Xiaohongshu being an alternative to TikTok, some analysts describe the mass migration as 'going from the frying pan into the fire.' 'TikTok is owned by a Chinese company but it has international operations, which means there are theoretically several layers between TikTok and the Chinese Party-State,' said Bethany Allen, the head of China Investigations and Analysis at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute. But 'there are no layers of insulation between Xiaohongshu and Beijing,' she told VOA by phone, adding that issues such as political censorship or lack of data privacy protection could be 'far worse' on Xiaohongshu than TikTok. American users 'are going to have absolutely no power to pressure Xiaohongshu as a company to do anything,' Allen added. VOA has reached out to Xiaohongshu for comment but has yet to receive a response. And despite the friendly interactions between Chinese and American users on Xiaohongshu over the last few days, experts said the 'honeymoon period' may not last long. 'I think the Chinese government is probably going to get spooked [by the interaction between American users and Chinese users],' Sarah Cook, an independent China analyst, told VOA by phone. She added that Beijing could impose a temporary shutdown on Xiaohongshu to implement some moderation or initiate 'a mass cleanout' of accounts or content deemed inappropriate or sensitive on the app. VOA’s Katherine Michaelson contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-tiktok-refugees-migrate-to-another-chinese-app-as-ban-looms/7938164.html	2025-01-15T12:28:21-08:00	
White House says Biden leaving Ukraine in strongest position possible	While U.S. President Joe Biden views his response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine as a cornerstone of his foreign policy legacy, critics argue he missed a historic opportunity to help Ukraine win the war. Michael Carpenter, director for Europe at the National Security Council, spoke with VOA, defending the administration’s policies on Ukraine, stating they were undeterred by Russia’s nuclear threats, and attributing Ukraine’s lack of success in regaining lost territories to manpower shortages. The following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: Is President Biden leaving Ukraine in the strongest position possible? Michael Carpenter, Senior Director for Europe at the National Security Council: He is. Look, the United States has given Ukraine every capability militarily that they have asked for. We have secured through painstaking diplomacy with our G7 partners a $50 billion loan. We have lifted all restrictions on rules of engagement for our military systems, for our weapons that we have provided to Ukraine. And we have worked with the Ukrainian military and the Ukrainian leadership to devise a strategy for them to be able to defend themselves and ideally negotiate from a position of strength where they can achieve their aims to maintain a sovereign, independent, democratic Ukraine. That's always been our goal and it remains our goal. I fail to mention the sanctions and the costs that we have levied on the Russian Federation. Unprecedented sanctions in the energy sector and in the financial sector over the course of the last three months. So were handing things off, I think, on very good terms. VOA: Does it mean that Ukraine, in your view, is ready to enter any possible negotiations with Russia next year from the position of strength? Carpenter: Well, look, I think it's very important that Ukraine's leaders, that President Zelensky in particular, decide when he wants to negotiate with the Russians. And what I will say is, at this point in time, I do not assess the President Putin wants to enter into a negotiation on good faith on anything other than the terms for the capitulation of Ukraine. So Ukraine has to decide when it feels that it is empowered to enter into this negotiation. And it'll be up to the next administration to hold the Russians’ feet to the fire and ensure that they have the appropriate leverage to ensure that this is not a sellout of Ukraine's sovereignty, but that this is a negotiation that leads to a just, durable, lasting peace, that preserves Ukraine as a sovereign, democratic, independent state. VOA: But is Ukraine in the strongest possible position for that? Because that was one of the goals. Carpenter: It is, under the circumstances. Look, war is messy. War involves all kinds of suffering. And Ukraine has certainly suffered over the course of the more than 1000 days of Russia's brutal aggression against it. At the end of the day, Russia has occupied parts of Ukraine that I wish had not come to pass. But there are also realities in this war. And one of those realities has to do with manpower on the two sides of the front lines of this battle space. And Ukraine simply has fewer people on the battle space than Russia is able to muster. And that has resulted in the situation that we're in today. I think Ukraine is in a strong position. I think it's in a strong position financially. I think the capabilities that we have given, the investments we've made in things like Ukrainian production of unmanned aerial vehicles, in terms of the capabilities, the armored vehicles that we've provided, the HIMARS systems that have been highly effective, the air defense systems, including the Patriot, all of that has been, I think, incredibly useful for Ukraine. Of course, the situation remains tenuous in certain parts of the Donbass, and that is simply a reality of this war. VOA: You said that the Biden administration achieved its goals towards Ukraine, but wasn't, at some point, the goal a victory of Ukraine? Carpenter: Ideally, Ukraine would have been able to liberate its territory. I think there's still hope that Ukraine can continue to work towards not just defense but also liberating some of its land. But at the end of the day, this boils down to what I said earlier. This is a fundamentally a physics and a math problem in terms of the number of people on both sides of the front lines. And Russia is able to bring more soldiers to bear in this war than Ukraine has been able to. And we can give all the capabilities: from F-16s to Abrams tanks to HIMARS systems, ATACMS missiles, you name it. But without the manpower on the front lines, it's impossible to achieve what you have just outlined, which is complete liberation of all of Ukraine's territory. And so, look, it's up to Ukrainians again to decide when and under what circumstances they want to negotiate. But we have set them up for success, given the capabilities that we have provided, which I just want to remind your viewers, is close to $70 billion in security assistance. That is a significant amount of capability that the United States has provided. VOA: You mentioned the assistance. In December, you assured us that the United States and the Biden administration will use all of that approved funds to provide Ukraine military assistance. But now there is $3.8 billion that this administration is leaving for the next. Why didn't the Biden administration use those funds? And do you have any concern that the next administration might not want to use these funds to support Ukraine? Carpenter: Well, you know, I don't want to get into a complex discussion of the way our budgetary process works, but there is a difference between authorized funds and obligated funds. So we have provided all of the funds that Congress has obligated for Ukraine. That's not all the funds that have been authorized. But it takes coordination between the administration and Congress to be able to move all of that money. We have moved all of it that we had available to us. Yes, the next administration will now have the option to use some of that authorized money to continue to provide assistance to Ukraine. And some of what we have obligated is on contract, or is en route, and will arrive in the coming weeks. But all of that is available to the next administration to continue to support Ukraine. VOA: Before leaving office, Biden’s administration, as you said, imposed major energy sanctions against Russia. Do you think that these measures might be something that pushes Russia economy closer to a collapse and something that can actually stop Russia's war machine? Carpenter: Well, our hope is that this additional pressure, which is extraordinary because we have imposed full blocking sanctions on two of the largest Russian oil companies. Surgutneftegas and Gazprom Neft, together with over 180 vessels from Russia's shadow fleet. We hope that additional cost in position will bring Putin closer to a realistic and durable solution to this conflict when he sits down at the negotiating table eventually, whenever that happens. I think, of course, any type of sanctions that reduce the revenues available to the Russian Federation is less money in the hands of those who fuel Russia's war machine and Russia's aggression against Ukraine. And it provides more space for Ukraine to be able to negotiate from a position of strength. VOA: In his foreign policy speech yesterday, President Biden mentioned as one of his accomplishments that he was able to prevent a direct confrontation between two nuclear powers, the United States and Russia. Many analysts that we're talking to say that fears of nuclear escalation prevented President Biden from helping Ukraine win the war. Why was the United States deterred by Russia's 'red lines,' but not vice versa? Carpenter: Nobody was deterred. The United States provided every capability that Ukraine asked for. It is only logical that as the world's largest nuclear superpower, that the United States has to factor in escalation management. Anyone who says to the contrary is being irresponsible about foreign policy and does not sit in the Oval Office and have to make those weighty decisions. VOA: But does it send a signal that Russia's 'nuclear card' will always beat everything else? Carpenter: No, it does not, because the Ukrainians have done extraordinarily well at certain points on the battlefield. But this fundamentally gets back to what the question you raised earlier, which is manpower. And that's not a variable that the United States controls. VOA: How do you hope the next administration approaches the policy towards Ukraine? And how does President Biden feel about the fact that his legacy towards Ukraine will be largely defined by the policies of the next administration? Carpenter: I'm not going to speak to what the next administration will do or won't do. I will just say that, again, this administration, we have tried to hand off a situation where Russia is both on its back foot, thanks to our sanctions in the energy and financial spheres; [and] Ukraine is in a solid macro financial state thanks to the $50 billion loan that we negotiated together with our G-7 partners, and that Ukraine has the capabilities militarily to be able to continue to maintain the defense of its territory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/white-house-says-biden-leaving-ukraine-in-strongest-position-possible/7937892.html	2025-01-15T12:11:27-08:00	
Pakistan welcomes World Bank's $20 billion lending pledge	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan confirmed on Wednesday that the World Bank has pledged to lend $20 billion over the next decade, commencing in 2026 under its Country Partnership Framework, to help address the impoverished country's acute development challenges. Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif applauded what he described as the lender's 'first-ever' pledge of its kind, saying the program is intended to develop child nutrition, education, clean energy and climate resilience to boost private sector growth. The Country Partnership Framework 'reflects the World Bank’s confidence in Pakistan’s economic resilience and potential,' Sharif said on the social media platform X. 'We look forward to strengthening our partnership as we align our efforts for creating lasting opportunities for our people.' The cash-strapped South Asian nation has been struggling to tackle serious economic challenges for several years and is currently relying on a $7 billion bailout loan program from the International Monetary Fund. Persistent political instability in Pakistan, rising militant attacks, and devastating flooding in 2022 have further strained the troubled economy. 'Our new decadelong partnership framework for Pakistan represents a long-term anchor for our joint commitment with the government to address some of the most acute development challenges facing the country,' said World Bank Country Director Najy Benhassine. The U.S.-based lender stated that the country's annual commitments under the partnership 'are expected to remain in the $1.5 billion to $2 billion range' from 2026 onward. It added that the loans will depend on available funding and the fulfillment of project requirements. 'The pace of economic growth and structural transformation has been long stunted by distortive policies that benefit only a few, who have historically coalesced to oppose growth-oriented reforms as well as increases in progressive public spending in human capital and basic services for the poorest,' the World Bank partnership documented stated. It added that Pakistan must change its current development model to reduce poverty and achieve shared prosperity on a livable planet. 'We are focused on prioritizing investment and advisory interventions that will help crowd in much-needed private investment in sectors critical for Pakistan’s sustainable growth and job creation,' said Zeeshan Sheikh, International Finance Corporation country manager for Pakistan and Afghanistan. The ouster of Prime Minister Imran Khan from power in 2022 and his subsequent imprisonment over contested corruption charges have plunged Pakistan into a political crisis that experts say is hampering government attempts to attract domestic and foreign investments. The World Bank's document highlights that the South Asian nation, home to over 240 million people, ranks among the top 10 countries most affected by climate change and natural disasters worldwide. It noted that climate change will increasingly strain livelihoods, food security, productivity, and growth caused by rising extreme heat, air pollution, and altered water availability and precipitation. 'These risks can significantly compromise development in an already fiscally constrained environment and make sustained progress in poverty reduction and human development even more challenging than it is today,' the World Bank stated.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-welcomes-world-bank-s-20-billion-lending-pledge/7938025.html	2025-01-15T11:25:24-08:00	
Southern California faces new fire-spreading wind threats	Hundreds of thousands in Southern California faced new threats of fire-spreading high winds on Wednesday as firefighters continued to fight wildfires that have killed at least 25 people and left nearly 30 missing. A day after firefighters got a reprieve with lighter winds than expected, gusts were hitting up to 56 kilometers per hour on the Pacific coast and 88 kilometers per hour in the mountains before dawn, National Weather Service meteorologist Todd Hall said. 'This is really just the last push of these winds here today,' Hall said. 'Hopefully, if we get through today, we're going to have some better conditions for late week, especially into Friday and Saturday.' The National Weather Service issued a high-level 'particularly dangerous situation' warning through 3 p.m. local time Wednesday and extended a red-flag warning through Thursday for some areas north of the city. 'Please stay on guard for a fast-moving fire,' forecasters said. On Tuesday, weaker-than-expected winds had allowed firefighters to make some progress in containing the two largest blazes, the Palisades and Eaton fires, but they were far from fully controlled. Authorities said that the Palisades blaze was 19% contained and the Eaton fire 45%. But no more homes or major structures were reported burning in the two blazes, although officials said embers could still be lingering unseen and that it could take weeks to fully extinguish them. The wildfires, which ignited on January 7, have displaced more than 100,000 people and left thousands more on edge, wondering whether they could be forced to evacuate their homes and flee for safety on a moment’s notice. More than 82,000 people in Los Angeles County are under evacuation orders, with another 90,400 under evacuation warnings, county Sheriff Robert Luna told reporters. Diminishing winds will likely make it easier for firefighters to gain control of the blazes, though meteorologists have warned the dangerous Santa Ana windstorms may return early next week. Weather forecasts show little to no chance of rain. Utility companies have shut off power to more than 77,000 households to prevent their power lines from sparking new blazes. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour of the affected areas on Monday. 'The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually see it,' Bass said. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southern-california-faces-new-fire-spreading-wind-threats/7938048.html	2025-01-15T10:56:23-08:00	
World Economic Forum will highlight conflict, AI, climate change	GENEVA — More than 3,000 global leaders from upwards of 130 countries will make their annual pilgrimage next week to the World Economic Forum, meeting in the plush Swiss Alpine resort of Davos. Nearly 5,000 Swiss army personnel will be on hand to ensure security for thousands of the world’s top movers and shakers in government, business, technology, civil society, the humanities and art. They will convene between Jan. 20 and 24 to discuss and seek solutions for some of the most pressing issues of the day. Among the decision-makers expected to attend will be President-elect Donald Trump, who will be president of the United States when he makes a virtual appearance later next week at the yearly event. 'The same week as we are opening our annual meeting next week, there also will be an inauguration happening in the largest economy in the world, the United States,' Borge Brende, president and CEO of the WEF, told journalists at a news conference Tuesday. 'So, we are pleased that also the key leaders from the largest economies in the world — the United States, China, and European Union — will be with us in Davos,' he said, noting that Trump 'has joined us physically in Davos before as president' during his first term. 'He will on Thursday afternoon join us digitally, online live in the dialogue with our participants,' he said. 'We think that will be a very special moment also to learn more what the new administration’s policy priorities are.' Since the U.S. is likely to have confirmed a number of Trump’s picks for his Cabinet, he said that toward the end of the week, 'we do expect even additional high-level representation from the Trump administration.' 'So, we are very pleased by that because we know that there is a lot of interest among our participants and the rest of the world to decipher and understand the policies of the new administration,' Brende said. 'So, it will be a very interesting week.' Asked whether multibillionaire Elon Musk might be among those attending the forum, he replied, 'We don’t know. He is, of course, also welcome with Donald Trump when he, hopefully, comes physically also at our next annual meeting.' Brende noted that this year’s forum is taking place at a time of greater global uncertainty than has been seen in a generation. He asserted that geopolitical tensions, economic fragmentation and accelerating climate change demonstrate the critical need for dialogue. 'Within this more unsettled climate, the only way to address urgent challenges and unlock new opportunities is through innovative, cooperative approaches,' he said. Key topics on next week’s forum agenda include the conflicts raging in the Middle East. Special panels will explore the 'terrible humanitarian situation in Gaza,' the future governance and rebuilding of Syria, and concerns about the potential escalation of conflicts in the region, particularly between Israel and Iran. 'I don’t think we are out of the woods yet,' said Brende, noting that a strong Israeli delegation and Iran’s vice president, Mohammad Javar Zarif, will be in Davos. 'So, it should be possible for dialogue, and hopefully we can also find a path forward for peace and reconciliation, and address humanitarian sufferings.' He said the 'forgotten conflict in Sudan that, unfortunately, is also turning into a proxy war' will be debated, as will Myanmar and other areas of instability. 'We know that the war in Ukraine is, unfortunately, continuing with huge humanitarian consequences,' he said, noting that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy will give a special address at the forum. The overall theme of the annual meeting is 'Collaboration in the intelligent age.' Linked to this is the rapid technological advancements that hold both benefits and risks for society. 'AI, or artificial intelligence, and generative artificial intelligence, or Gen AI, obviously, is front and center of our agenda. It is this super technology, if you will, that interacts with a lot of the other technologies,' said Mirek Dusek, managing director of the WEF. 'Among the host of technologies that we are tracking with the notion of the intelligent age, AI, and particularly Gen AI, over the past few years is a game changer,' he said, underscoring the need for standards to assure the ethical use of that technology. 'We are quite clear-eyed about the opportunities of these technologies, particularly AI, but also quite clear-eyed about what are the risks and how important it is that we deploy those technologies with ethical, societal, and other considerations,' he said. 'There is no intelligent age if there is no healthy planet, and without collaboration, we will not be able to build and address the climate and nature emergency,' warned Gim Huay Neo, managing director of the WEF. 'The climate and nature crisis requires urgent attention and action,' she said, noting that annual global warming reached 1.54 degrees Celsius above the pre-industrial average last year. 'A lot of the focus of the annual meeting will thus be on what are the issues and the challenges … and in addressing the solutions that can help address the crisis,' she said. Klaus Schwab, founder and chairman of the board of trustees of the WEF, touted the importance of bringing together thousands of decision-makers from governments, business, and civil society at the beginning of the year 'to address the challenges of a world in deep transformation.' 'Despite divergent positions and great uncertainties, the annual meeting 2025 will foster a spirit of cooperation and constructive optimism with the objective of shaping the forthcoming Intelligent Age in a more sustainable and inclusive way,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-economic-forum-will-highlight-conflict-ai-climate-change/7937968.html	2025-01-15T10:19:01-08:00	
UN chief appeals for Gaza ceasefire, hostage deal	UNITED NATIONS — The U.N. secretary-general on Wednesday urged all parties to the Gaza war to finalize a ceasefire and hostage release, as mediators say they are in the final stages of a deal. 'For months, there has been no ceiling to the suffering and no bottom to the horrors,' Antonio Guterres told the U.N. General Assembly of the situation in Gaza during a speech laying out his 2025 United Nations priorities. A deal is expected to see Hamas release the hostages it has held captive since the group’s Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack in Israel. Israeli authorities would in turn release Palestinian prisoners and carry out a phased troop withdrawal from Gaza. The U.N. chief said we are seeing a 'reshaping' of the Middle East region, with uncertain outcomes, pointing to the future of Israel and the Palestinians but also a post-Assad Syria and a changed Iran. 'Throughout the region, we must deny extremists a veto over a peaceful future,' Guterres said of actors across the region. The secretary-general is scheduled to depart Wednesday night for what he is calling a 'solidarity' visit to Lebanon. The country, recovering from a destructive war between Hezbollah and Israel, just filled a lengthy political vacuum, electing a president who appointed a new prime minister. 'A window has opened for a new era of institutional stability, with a state fully able to protect its citizens and a system that would allow the tremendous potential of the Lebanese people to flourish,' he said. 'We will do everything to help keep that window open wide — a window that will allow both Lebanese and Israelis to live in security.' In a wide-ranging speech, Guterres warned that the world is in a period of 'turmoil and grave uncertainty.' He urged the international community to rein in major challenges that threaten to disrupt progress and even 'our very existence.' 'Runaway conflicts. Rampant inequalities. The raging climate crisis and out-of-control technology' are the main dangers to humanity, he said. 'The good news is that we have the plans to tackle these challenges,' he said. 'We don’t need to reinvent the wheel — we need to get the wheel moving.' On Monday, Guterres will face an additional challenge: the start of a second Trump administration in the United States. During Donald Trump’s first term as president, he withdrew hundreds of millions of dollars in funding to the world body, sought to leave the Paris Climate Accord, quit the Iran nuclear deal and pulled the U.S. out of some U.N. agencies and programs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-appeals-for-gaza-ceasefire-hostage-deal/7937897.html	2025-01-15T09:38:18-08:00	
Biden bids farewell with Oval Office address	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden gives his farewell address from the Oval Office Wednesday evening, five days before he ends his term and President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. In a letter released Wednesday morning, Biden reflected on how his administration began in the shadows of COVID-19 and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of Trump supporters intent on overturning the result of the 2020 election that Biden won. 'Four years ago, we stood in a winter of peril and a winter of possibilities,' he said in the letter. 'But we came together as Americans, and we braved through it. We emerged stronger, more prosperous, and more secure.' The president’s farewell address comes a day after Jack Smith, the special counsel who indicted Trump on charges of illegally trying to cling to power after the 2020 election, released his final report. Smith’s report said that the evidence would have been sufficient to convict the president-elect in a trial, had his 2024 election victory not made it impossible for the prosecution to continue. Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked the special counsel’s work as politically motivated. Biden’s speech follows remarks he made Monday at the U.S. State Department defending his foreign policy record and will be his fifth and final formal address from the Oval Office. In his previous Oval Office address six months ago, Biden explained his decision to step aside and endorse his vice president, Kamala Harris, to run against Trump in the 2024 election. Biden reflected on the 'battle for the soul of America' framework that he campaigned on in 2020 when he won against Trump. 'I ran for president because I believed that the soul of America was at stake,' Biden wrote, arguing that is still the case and that America is an idea based on the belief that 'we are all created equal, endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights, among them life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.' 'We’ve never fully lived up to this sacred idea, but we’ve never walked away from it either,' he said. 'And I do not believe the American people will walk away from it now.' Biden’s legacy Biden is leaving office with a 39% approval rating, according to Gallup. He has been using the final weeks of his administration to cement his legacy. Thomas Schwartz, presidential historian from Vanderbilt University in Tennessee, said that Biden’s legacy will be affected by how Trump governs in the next four years. 'If Trump ends up being a disaster … either ushering economic chaos, or if there's more world chaos from conflicts, Biden will be remembered more favorably,' he told VOA. 'If Trump really proves to be as dangerous to democratic norms as Biden and the Democrats suggested, then I think he may be seen as very prophetic.' Conversely, by inheriting a strong economy and a winding down of U.S. foreign entanglements, Trump has the potential to become a president in the caliber of Ronald Reagan, Schwartz said. In which case Biden will be noted by historians for his legislative achievements but 'won’t be remembered as fondly.' The White House also released an extensive fact sheet detailing the Biden-Harris administration’s achievements domestically and abroad. The sheet highlighted 'historic' economic progress that added 16.6 million jobs, grew the GDP by 12.6% and raised median household wealth by 37%. It underscored investments in infrastructure, clean energy, and semiconductors through Biden’s signature legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS Act. The White House argued that through targeted relief and fair taxation, the Biden administration rebuilt a 'stronger, fairer economy,' creating opportunity from the bottom up. On the foreign policy front, the administration insists it is leaving the incoming Trump administration with a 'very strong hand to play.' 'We're leaving an America with more friends and stronger alliances, whose adversaries are weaker and under pressure,' the president said in his foreign policy address Monday, 'an America that once again is leading, uniting countries, setting the agenda, bringing others together behind our plans and visions.' The president again defended his decision to withdraw the U.S. from Afghanistan in 2021. Republicans and some Democrats have criticized the manner with which Biden ended America's longest war as chaotic, costing the lives of 13 service members and dozens of Afghan civilians in a terrorist attack in Kabul. Biden said in the letter it has been 'the privilege of my life to serve this nation for over 50 years.' 'Nowhere else on Earth could a kid with a stutter from modest beginnings in Scranton, Pennsylvania, and Claymont, Delaware, one day sit behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office as President of the United States,' he added. 'I have given my heart and my soul to our nation. And I have been blessed a million times in return with the love and support of the American people.' Asked about his post-presidency role, Biden last week said, 'I’m not going to be out of sight or out of mind.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-bids-farewell-with-oval-office-address-/7937842.html	2025-01-15T09:18:29-08:00	
US steps up Russia sanctions, placing threat of more sanctions on businesses partnering with Russia	Washington — The U.S. Treasury Department said Wednesday that it is expanding the web of sanctions on companies and institutions supporting Russia's war efforts in Ukraine, re-designating about 100 entities for sanctions and placing sanctions on 15 new entities. A senior Treasury Department official said that under the sanctions, any company that does meaningful business with parts of Russia's military industrial complex also would face the risk of penalties. The official insisted on anonymity to preview the announcement on a call with reporters. The official said that removal of the sanctions would require congressional notification. That step could potentially make it harder for the incoming Republican Trump administration to adjust and change sanctions without drawing public scrutiny. The official stressed that there are new sanctions on 15 companies related to Russia and China that have worked together to avoid existing sanctions. Treasury is sanctioning the following Russian companies as being involved in this scheme: Herbarium Office Management, Atlant Torg, Sigma Partners, Tranzaktsii I Raschety, Arctur and Paylink Limited. It's also sanctioning Russian national Andrei Prikhodko, the general director of Herbarium. Additionally, there are sanctions on China-based companies: Anhui Hongsheng International Trade, Qingyuan Fo Feng Leda Supply Chain Service, Heilongjiang Shunsheng Economic and Trade Development, Qingdao Hezhi Business Service, Xinjiang Financial Import and Export, Hangzhou Xianghe Trading, Shaanxi Hongrun Jinhua Trading, Fujian Xinfuwang International Trade, and Jilin Province Shunda Trading Company. Separately, the Keremet Bank in Kyrgyzstan is being sanctioned for coordinating with Russian officials and a U.S. bank to evade sanctions. Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, an assault that led to aggressive sanctioning by the U.S. and its allies and efforts by Russia and its partners to get around the financial restrictions. The Democratic Biden administration sees recent changes in the global oil market as making it easier to crack down on Russia's oil revenues without hurting global supplies. The Treasury Department announced last week that it was expanding sanctions against the Russian energy sector for its nearly 3-year-old war in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-steps-up-russia-sanctions-placing-threat-of-more-sanctions-on-businesses-partnering-with-russia-/7937853.html	2025-01-15T08:56:47-08:00	
Chinese men jailed in east Congo over gold bars	BUKAVU, CONGO — Three Chinese nationals have been sentenced to seven years in prison in the Congo's east after being arrested in possession of gold bars and large sums of cash. The court sentenced the men late Tuesday for the illegal purchase and illegal possession of minerals in Bukavu, the capital of the gold-rich South Kivu province. The three men, who presented themselves during the trial as simple traders, were arrested in early January in a car. They were carrying 10 gold bars and $400,000 in cash, all of which was seized. The Bukavu court condemned the men to prison and handed them a fine of $600,000 for 'illegal purchase and possession of mineral substances, lack of transparency, traceability in the exercise of mining activities and money laundering.' The charge of 'illicit exploitation of minerals' was not retained, but they were found guilty of 'illegal stay' in the Congo. Their lawyer did not respond to comment when contacted by AFP. Hundreds of mining companies, most of which are Chinese, extract gold in the resource-rich province without declaring profits and often without valid permits, according to local authorities. Last year the local government declared it was suspending the activities of mining companies that did not comply with Congolese law. At the start of the year several hundred people in Bukavu protested against illegal mining in the region, demanding that the country's riches be used to help local communities. The eastern Congo is abundant with reserves of gold, diamonds and minerals which are widely used in manufacturing mobile phones and electric cars. This mineral wealth is at the heart of conflicts that have plagued the region for 30 years, which intensified at the end of 2021 with the resurgence of the M23 armed group. Kinshasa accuses Rwanda of supporting the M23 and of trying to get its hands on the region's resources.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-men-jailed-in-east-congo-over-gold-bars/7937791.html	2025-01-15T08:26:31-08:00	
France faces big challenges in rebuilding cyclone-hit Mayotte	The French government won praise last month for making good on its promise to rebuild the fire-hit Notre Dame cathedral in just five years. But authorities are facing a rockier time when it comes to rebuilding cyclone-hit Mayotte — France’s impoverished overseas territory off the coast of East Africa. Lawmakers this week began fractious hearings about how to speed up reconstruction of Mayotte, where Cyclone Chido last month killed dozens, injured thousands and flattened thousands of buildings, especially in shantytowns. On Sunday, another tropical storm triggered flooding in the archipelago, underscoring the fallout of extreme weather events that are becoming more intense and frequent with climate change. French Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville announced that there were only a few injuries and no deaths from the latest storm and that it was time to get back to work. Visiting days after Cyclone Chido, French President Emmanuel Macron vowed to swiftly rebuild Mayotte. But reconstructing Mayotte has dug up a raft of grievances and triggered hot political debate. The overseas territory — with an official population of about 320,000 — is the poorest and most underdeveloped department of France. Macron and his centrist government are accused of being too slow in delivering aid and water and restoring power after Cyclone Chido. Many of Mayotte’s residents are not French citizens, but rather undocumented immigrants, many from nearby Comoros. Top French ministers are now talking about cracking down on illegal immigration. So is far-right leader Marine Le Pen, whose National Rally party is the most popular in France. During a visit to the territory earlier this month, Le Pen got an enthusiastic welcome from many Mayotte citizens — who largely voted for her during 2022 presidential elections. She blames the government for poor public services like education — and for undercounting the number of migrants there illegally.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-faces-big-challenges-in-rebuilding-cyclone-hit-mayotte/7937756.html	2025-01-15T08:00:05-08:00	
Bondi faces skeptical reception from Democrats at confirmation hearing	WASHINGTON — Pam Bondi, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pick for attorney general, will face sharp questioning from Democratic senators at a confirmation hearing Wednesday expected to center on concerns that Trump will look to use the Justice Department's powers to seek retribution against his adversaries. Bondi, a former Florida attorney general who was part of Trump's legal team during his first of two Senate impeachment trials, encounters a skeptical reception from Democrats concerned by her perceived loyalty to Trump. Republicans, by contrast, eagerly welcome her as a course correction to a Justice Department they believe has pursued an overly liberal agenda and unfairly pursued Trump through investigations and a special counsel appointment resulting in two indictments. 'If confirmed, I will work to restore confidence and integrity to the Department of Justice — and each of its components,' Bondi said in her opening remarks. 'Under my watch, the partisan weaponization of the Department of Justice will end. America must have one tier of justice for all.' She did not elaborate on what she meant by 'one tier of justice.' The Justice Department under outgoing Attorney General Merrick Garland also investigated President Joe Biden over his mishandling of classified information — no charges were filed — and named a special counsel to investigate Biden's son, Hunter, who was charged with tax and gun crimes before being pardoned in December by his father. Democrats such as Senator Richard Durbin are expected to seize on Bondi's yearslong presence in Trump's orbit and her public defense of him on cable news appearances, including one on Fox News Channel last year in which she said: 'The Department of Justice, the prosecutors will be prosecuted — the bad ones. ... The investigators will be investigated.' Bondi has also said members of the so-called deep state were 'hiding in the shadows' during Trump's first term 'but now they have a spotlight on them, and they can all be investigated.' Such comments have raised alarms that the department under Bondi's watch could pursue investigations at Trump's behest. Although longstanding norms dictate that presidents have no role in individual criminal investigations, Trump was known during his first term to call for specific inquiries into adversaries and berated his first attorney general, Jeff Sessions, for having recused from an investigation into Russian election interference that ultimately shadowed much of his tenure. 'I need to know that you would tell the president no if you're asked to do something that's wrong, illegal or unconstitutional,' Durbin, the panel's top Democrat, told Bondi, noting how she had been his personal lawyer and had echoed his baseless claims that the 2020 election had been stolen. Senator Chuck Grassley, the Republican chair of the committee, offered a different take, laying out a laundry list of years of grievances against the Justice Department that includes the Russia investigation and, more recently, a Garland-era memo aimed at targeting threats from parents at school board meetings. Bondi, a corporate lobbyist who spent 18 years in the Hillsborough County State Attorney's Office in Florida, was named to the attorney general position after Trump's first pick, former Florida Representative Matt Gaetz, withdrew from consideration during fallout over a federal sex trafficking investigation that ended without charges. Bondi is likely to try to keep the focus of Wednesday's hearing on her own agenda for the department. In her opening statement, she pledged to protect the First Amendment rights of free speech and religion, as well as the Second Amendment right to bear arms, and to reform the federal Bureau of Prisons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bondi-faces-skeptical-reception-from-democrats-at-confirmation-hearing/7937780.html	2025-01-15T07:56:33-08:00	
Austin failed to tell Congress or White House about health problems as required, report says	WASHINGTON — Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin did not inform Congress or the White House as required when he was incapacitated due to treatment for prostate cancer or when complications worsened his condition last year, the Pentagon's watchdog concluded in a highly critical report released Wednesday. The inspector general's report faults Austin for the communications failures early last year in which he kept his hospitalization secret for days, even from President Joe Biden. The inspector general found that his strong desire for privacy likely influenced his staff in deciding not to prod further into his condition. In one example, he directed his staff that if anyone had questions, 'you're more than welcome to ask (me) directly' — likely chilling further inquiry, the report said. Austin did not inform either Congress or the White House of his initial treatment in December 2023 for prostate cancer or tell his staff or the White House of his worsening complications on Jan. 1, 2024, which led him to be taken by ambulance to Walter Reed Army National Military Medical Center. 'No one on Secretary Austin's staff knew the seriousness of his condition, including when his condition became worse and he was transferred to the Surgical Intensive Care Unit (SICU) the following day,' the report said. The report, signed by inspector general Robert Storch, comes just four days before Austin leaves the job and President-elect Donald Trump takes office. It provides new details on communications between Austin and members of his staff, but no real bombshells about the stunning lapse. The findings mirror much of the criticism in an internal review done about a month after Austin was admitted to Walter Reed. That internal review, done by Austin's subordinates, largely absolved anyone of wrongdoing for the secrecy surrounding his hospitalization. And it said flatly there was 'no indication of ill intent or an attempt to obfuscate.' Although he transferred decision-making authorities to Deputy Secretary Kathleen Hicks during his initial surgery and then again when he was in intensive care, he did not tell her why and he did not inform the White House. The incident angered the White House and infuriated members of Congress, who called him to Capitol Hill for a hearing, where he faced bipartisan criticism and demands that someone should have been held accountable. Austin himself, in a lengthy press conference after he returned to work, largely took the blame. He told reporters that he never told his staff to keep his surgery and hospitalization secret from the White House, but acknowledged that he should have handled it differently and apologized for keeping Biden and others in the dark. Austin was diagnosed with prostate cancer in early December 2023 and went to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for surgery on Dec. 22. On Jan. 1, 2024, he was taken back to Walter Reed by ambulance after experiencing significant pain and was moved to the intensive care unit the next day. Pentagon officials have acknowledged that public affairs and defense aides were told on Jan. 2 that Austin had been hospitalized, but did not make it public and did not tell the military service leaders or the National Security Council until Jan. 4. Only then did Biden find out. It took four more days before the reason for his hospitalization was disclosed. The internal review blamed privacy restrictions and staff hesitancy for their failure to quickly notify the president and other senior leaders about Austin's hospitalization. And it called for a number of procedural changes to improve communications and avoid similar problems in the future. The changes include better guidelines for the transfer of authorities and better reporting requirements during those incidents. And the White House also made changes in federal guidelines as a result of the incident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austin-failed-to-tell-congress-or-white-house-about-health-problems-as-required-report-says/7937754.html	2025-01-15T07:35:39-08:00	
From defeat to triumph: Leaders who returned to power against all odds	President-elect Donald Trump achieved an extraordinary comeback in the 2024 election, having lost his reelection bid in 2020.

Botswana records grim gender-based violence statistics	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Despite efforts by Botswanan authorities to combat gender-based violence, nearly 100 women were raped and 10 murdered during the late-December festive season, officials said Tuesday. Botswana Police Service Commissioner Dinah Marathe told reporters that 10 of the 25 murders recorded between Dec. 19 and Jan. 2 were related to gender-based violence. During the same period, 93 rapes were reported. Of all reported crimes, she said, 61% were related to gender-based violence. 'What comes out clear is that we are a nation with a culture of violence,' Marathe said. The government introduced laws and policies last year meant to combat gender-based violence, including courts dedicated to dealing with such cases and the establishment of a sex offender registry. Despite the measures, the violence persists. Minister of Youth and Gender Affairs Lesego Chombo called for what she described as a preventative approach. 'In the way we behave with each other, in our personal and professional spaces, we all take this as a priority to ensure that we inculcate a culture that is conducive for mental health and a culture that is conducive for gender equality, so that we can curb this issue,' she said. Local nonprofit Feminists Alliance Botswana argues the government has not done enough to stop the trend. Alliance spokeswoman Thembiso Nhlekisana said women remain vulnerable. 'These figures represent a grim reminder of the pervasive violence that women and girls in our society continue to face,' she said. 'This is not just a statistic; it is a reflection of lives lost, futures stolen and communities broken. These numbers underscore a profound failure in protecting women and girls from violence, despite repeated calls for systemic reforms and stronger preventive measures.' Nhlekisana called for swift prosecution and stiffer penalties for perpetrators of gender-based violence. 'We call on the Ministry of Justice and Correctional Services and the Botswana Police Service to prioritize cases of gender-based violence, ensuring timely investigations, prosecutions and convictions for perpetrators,' she said. A 2023 report by the World Bank said more than 42% of women in east and southern Africa experience physical and sexual violence in their lifetime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/botswana-records-grim-gender-based-violence-statistics/7937708.html	2025-01-15T07:12:56-08:00	
Poland's leader accuses Russia of planning acts of terror against 'airlines around the world'	WARSAW, POLAND — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk accused Russia on Wednesday of planning acts of sabotage worldwide that included 'acts of air terror' against airlines. Tusk spoke at a news conference in Warsaw alongside Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy. 'I will not go into details, I can only confirm the validity of fears that Russia was planning acts of air terror, not only against Poland, but against airlines around the world,' Tusk said. The Kremlin has dismissed previous Western claims that Russia sponsored acts of sabotage and attacks in Europe. Western security officials suspect Russian intelligence was behind a plot to put incendiary devices in packages on cargo planes headed to North America, including one that caught fire at a courier hub in Germany and another that ignited in a warehouse in England last year. The pro-European Union government in Warsaw says that Russia is pursuing acts of hybrid war against Poland and other Western countries in retaliation for their support for Poland's neighbor Ukraine in its struggle against Russia's full-scale invasion. The government has accused Russia, and its ally Belarus, of fomenting a migration crisis on the EU's eastern border with Belarus in order to create chaos and division in the EU. Last year, Poland's foreign minister ordered the closure of one of three Russian consulates in the country in response to acts of sabotage, including arson attacks that he said were sponsored by Moscow.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-s-leader-accuses-russia-of-planning-acts-of-terror-against-airlines-around-the-world-/7937704.html	2025-01-15T07:12:22-08:00	
WHO says suspected outbreak of Marburg disease kills 8 in remote part of Tanzania	ARUSHA, Tanzania — The World Health Organization said Wednesday an outbreak of suspected Marburg disease has killed eight people in a remote part of northern Tanzania. 'We are aware of 9 cases so far, including 8 people who have died,' WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a statement. 'We would expect further cases in coming days as disease surveillance improves.' Like Ebola, the Marburg virus originates in fruit bats and spreads between people through close contact with the bodily fluids of infected individuals or with surfaces, such as contaminated bed sheets. Without treatment, Marburg can be fatal in up to 88% of people who fall ill with the disease. Symptoms include fever, muscle pains, diarrhea, vomiting and in some cases death from extreme blood loss. There is no authorized vaccine or treatment for Marburg. WHO said its risk assessment for the suspected outbreak in Tanzania is high at national and regional levels but low globally. There was no immediate comment from Tanzanian health authorities. An outbreak of Marburg in Rwanda, first reported on Sept. 27, was declared over on Dec. 20. Rwandan officials reported a total of 15 deaths and 66 cases, with the majority of those affected healthcare workers who handled the first patients. An outbreak in 2023 of Marburg in Kagera, which shares a border with Rwanda, killed at least five people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-says-suspected-outbreak-of-marburg-disease-kills-8-in-remote-part-of-tanzania-/7937629.html	2025-01-15T06:00:30-08:00	
Europe mulls seizing Russia’s billions to aid Ukraine	London — Support appears to be growing in the West to fully seize hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of Russian assets that were frozen following Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, amid speculation that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will try to seek a peace deal between Moscow and Kyiv soon after he takes office next week. Nations, including the United States, Canada, Britain, several European Union members states and Japan, froze about $300 billion of assets owned by Russia’s Central Bank after Moscow’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. Some $200 billion of the assets are held in the Euroclear facility in Brussels, with approximately $5 billion frozen in the United States. U.S. media reported Tuesday that outgoing President Joe Biden is making a last-minute push for European allies to fully seize the assets so they can be used as leverage in any future peace negotiations. Some European lawmakers are pushing for the assets to be given to Ukraine, however, to buy weapons and help to rebuild the country. Others fear that seizing the assets would deter investors and destabilize Western currencies. Moscow has said that any seizure of its assets would be illegal and has pledged to retaliate. Ukraine reconstruction Ukraine’s reconstruction costs will reach at least $486 billion over the next decade, according to a February 2024 report by the Ukrainian government, the World Bank Group, the European Commission and the United Nations. Britain holds about $22 billion worth of Russian assets. Lawmakers voted last week in favor of a nonbinding motion to seize the assets and give the money to Kyiv. Member of Parliament Mike Martin, who brought the motion, cited uncertainty over future military aid for Kyiv under Trump. 'We do know that he feels differently about Ukraine. He feels differently about the security of Europe, and he feels differently about Russia. So, if we want to shift the dial on Ukraine, especially in the face of a drawdown or potential drawdown in U.S. support, we need to go further and faster, and we need to seize these $300 billions of frozen assets and send them to Ukraine,' Martin told lawmakers. Geopolitical signals 'It is not just about actions that lead to practical outcomes. It is also about signals that we send to our geopolitical opponents. ... Any potential small amount of financial instability that the G7 countries moving together will create will be miniscule as compared to the financial instability of Ukraine losing this war,' Martin said. The Liberal Democrat MP was among the signatories to a letter to The Times of London newspaper earlier this month calling for concerted European action to seize the assets. It also was signed by senior lawmakers from Germany, Poland, the Baltic countries and Finland. 'Previous loans and emergency funding are not enough — and leave Western taxpayers on the hook. Only using the assets themselves ensures that Russia pays for its crimes,' the letter said. G7 loans G7 nations already are providing Ukraine with $50 billion in loans, using the Russian assets as collateral. Additionally, the interest earned on the frozen assets is being used to fund aid for Kyiv. Any decision by the incoming Trump administration to cut U.S. aid for Kyiv could prompt Europe to seize the Russian assets, said Alexander Kolyandr of the Center for European Policy Analysis. 'We would have a fear of abandoning Ukraine to Putin's war machine. And honestly, I suspect if it comes to that, the decision would be to give this money to Ukraine.' US weapons Kyiv could pledge to use the assets to purchase American weapons and secure Trump’s support, Kolyandr added. 'It fits nicely into the America First idea. It helps Ukraine to get the arms. It helps Trump to score some victories at home,' he told VOA. There is some opposition in Europe, though, to seizing the assets. European fears 'The reservations are mostly coming from the European Central Bank and the national governments,' Kolyandr said. 'They are afraid that if they seize the Russian assets or practically nationalize them and give it to Ukraine, then it would thwart trust in the euro as a reserve currency — and foreign countries would be pretty afraid of investing their sovereign assets in European stocks, shares, bonds and currency. 'In my view, if a foreign country had any reservations about the safety of its sovereign assets, those reservations should have appeared ... when the assets were frozen,' Kolyandr said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/europe-mulls-seizing-russia-s-billions-to-aid-ukraine-/7937521.html	2025-01-15T05:40:30-08:00

Rubio vows to place US interests 'above all else' as Trump's top diplomat	Washington — Florida Sen. Marco Rubio is promising to implement President-elect Donald Trump's 'America First' vision as secretary of state, vowing in his confirmation hearing Wednesday that the incoming administration will forge a new path by placing American interests 'above all else.' 'Placing our core national interests above all else is not isolationism,' Rubio will tell the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, according to an opening statement obtained by The Associated Press. 'It is the commonsense realization that a foreign policy centered on our national interest is not some outdated relic.' 'The postwar global order is not just obsolete; it is now a weapon being used against us,' Rubio says. It's a remarkable opening salvo from Rubio, who was born in Miami to Cuban immigrants, and who, if confirmed, would become the first Latino ever to serve as the nation's top diplomat. The confirmation hearing begins a new chapter in the political career of the 53-year-old Florida Republican, whose relationship with Trump has evolved over the last decade. Once rivals trading schoolyard insults as they campaigned for president in 2016, the two men became close allies as Trump campaigned for another White House term last year. Rubio first came to Washington as part of the 'tea party' wave in 2010 and once advocated for allowing a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally. But like other Republicans, Rubio's views on immigration have shifted toward the hardline stance of Trump, who has pledged to aggressively pursue deportations once he takes office on Monday. Unlike many of Trump's Cabinet selections, Rubio is expected to easily win confirmation, notching support not only from Republicans but also Democrats who endorse him as a 'responsible' pick to represent the U.S. abroad. Many expect he will be among the first of Trump's Cabinet picks approved. Democratic Sen. Brian Schatz, who served alongside Rubio on the Foreign Relations Committee, said he has high hopes that the Florida Republican will reject the isolationist approach of other Trump allies. 'I think Marco is a hawk, but he's also an internationalist, and I think the challenge for him will be to maintain the long bipartisan tradition of America being indispensable in world affairs,' the Hawaii lawmaker told AP. 'And there are people in the Trump world who want us to run away from being the leaders of the free world. And I'm hoping that Marco's instincts towards American strength will win the day.' Rubio's approach to foreign affairs is grounded in his years of service on the Foreign Relations committee and the Senate Intelligence panel. In his speeches and writings, he's delivered increasingly stern warnings about growing military and economic threats to the United States, particularly from China, which he says has benefited from a 'global world order' that he characterizes as obsolete. China, Rubio will tell the committee, has 'lied, cheated, hacked, and stolen their way to global superpower status, at our expense.' If confirmed, Rubio will become the leader of U.S. foreign policy — though his role will surely remain secondary to Trump, who relishes the global stage and frequently uses the bully pulpit against America's allies. Even before taking office, Trump has stirred angst in foreign capitals by threatening to seize the Panama Canal and Greenland and suggesting he will pressure Canada to become the nation's 51st state. By winning another term, Trump has won an 'unmistakable mandate from the voters,' Rubio will say. 'They want a strong America. Engaged in the world. But guided by a clear objective, to promote peace abroad, and security and prosperity here at home.' A Biden administration decision to rescind Cuba's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism with just days left in office is likely to irk Rubio, who has long supported tough sanctions on the communist-run island. Rubio's office did not respond to multiple queries Tuesday about the senator's reaction to the move, which many believe will almost certainly be reversed by the Trump administration. Secretaries of state have played a key role in formulating the foreign policy of the country since its founding, starting with the first one, Thomas Jefferson, who served in the top Cabinet position under President George Washington. Since then, Jefferson, as well as his 19th century successors James Madison, James Monroe, John Quincy Adams, Martin Van Buren and James Buchanan, have all gone on to be elected president. More recent secretaries of state have been less successful in their political ambitions, including John Kerry, who lost the 2004 presidential election to President George W. Bush before becoming the top diplomat, and Hillary Clinton, who lost the 2016 election to Trump. The most successful secretaries of state have been known for their closeness to the presidents whom they serve, notably James Baker under George H.W. Bush, Condoleezza Rice under George W. Bush and, to some extent, Clinton under Barack Obama. Like Clinton, Rubio was once a political rival to the president-elect who nominated them. However, the Clinton-Obama relationship during the 2008 Democratic primaries was not nearly as hostile as that between Trump and Rubio in the 2016 GOP primaries, which was marked by name-calling and personal insults. Trump had an acrimonious relationship with his first secretary of state, Rex Tillerson. Trump fired him from the position via a social media post less than two years into his term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rubio-vows-to-place-us-interests-above-all-else-as-trump-s-top-diplomat-/7937510.html	2025-01-15T04:21:02-08:00	
India's defense minister cites power rivalry in Indian Ocean region	NEW DELHI — International power rivalry is playing out in the Indian Ocean region, India's Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said on Wednesday, adding that a strong naval presence in the key trade route was his country's biggest priority. While Singh did not name any country, analysts say that China, which commands the world's largest naval force with more than 370 ships, has been a security concern for India since ties nosedived in 2020 after 24 troops died in clashes along their Himalayan frontier. The UK and the U.S. also have a joint military base in the Indian Ocean island of Diego Garcia. Chinese and Indian troops have pulled back from two face-off points after a deal was struck in October following a series of talks, but India's army chief told reporters this week that 'a degree of standoff' still persists. 'A large part of the world's trade and commerce passes through the Indian Ocean region. Due to geo-strategic reasons, the region is also becoming a part of international power rivalry,' Defense Minister Singh said during the induction of one submarine and two navy ships in the city of Mumbai. He said 95% of India's trade, in terms of volume, is linked to the Indian Ocean region. 'In such a situation, the presence of a strong Indian Navy becomes our biggest priority,' he said. India has sought to counter China as Beijing grows its influence in India's neighborhood through investments and development projects in Bangladesh, Myanmar, Sri Lanka and Pakistan. New Delhi plans to build a 175-ship strong naval force by 2035 with an increasing emphasis on using domestically made components, but analysts say the pace of construction is slow as compared to China, which builds almost 14 warships a year, while India constructs just four.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-defense-minister-cites-power-rivalry-in-indian-ocean-region-/7937502.html	2025-01-15T04:04:53-08:00	
India steps up engagement with Taliban	New Delhi — The first high level diplomatic meeting held between India and the Taliban leadership marked a significant step in rebuilding New Delhi’s influence in Afghanistan, according to analysts. They say New Delhi’s growing engagement with the Taliban is prompted by strategic considerations in the Central Asian country that has important implications for its security and is likely to deepen amid growing tensions between the Taliban and Pakistan. In the meeting between Indian foreign secretary Vikram Misri and acting Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi, held in Dubai last week, India agreed to consider engaging in development projects in Afghanistan 'in the near future' and provide more support to the health sector and refugee rehabilitation. Both sides also discussed boosting trade ties. Calling India a 'significant regional and economic partner,' the Afghan foreign ministry said in a statement that 'we want to strengthen political and economic relations with India.' The engagement marked a major shift since the Taliban takeover of Afghanistan in 2021, which was seen as a huge diplomatic setback for India’s two-decade long efforts to build deeper ties with Kabul. 'New Delhi’s approach is a pragmatic one, grounded in the view that isolating the Taliban will make it tougher to achieve its goals in Afghanistan,' Michael Kugelman, director of the South Asia Institute at the Wilson Center, told VOA in emailed comments. The Taliban’s return had raised fears in New Delhi that Afghanistan will become a haven for militants from Pakistan who have been at the forefront of a three-decade violent separatist insurgency in Indian Kashmir. But analysts point out that the Taliban leadership has built confidence in New Delhi by not doing anything that goes against India’s security interests. 'They have observed their commitments to not allow anti-India terror activity on their soil quite scrupulously. So the level of engagement has been upgraded steadily,' said Sushant Sareen, senior fellow at the Observer Research Foundation. 'Afghanistan is seen as the epicenter of the arc of instability in this region and it is critical for India’s interests to be present there.' India’s détente with the Taliban began in 2022 when it started dispatching food and medicine as part of humanitarian aid to Afghanistan. In the same year, it reopened its mission in Kabul with a small 'technical team.' The engagement between the two countries likely will gain momentum amid tensions between Kabul and Islamabad over Pakistan’s allegations that the Taliban support militants linked to the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, in carrying out attacks against Pakistani civilians and security forces. 'India’s outreach to the Taliban is certainly easier given Pakistan’s messy ties with the Taliban,' Kugelman said. 'And given the reality of India-Pakistan rivalry, New Delhi likely sees an opportunity to exploit Pakistan’s tensions with the Taliban and pursue closer ties with the Taliban, to gain an upper hand in a longstanding competition between India and Pakistan for influence in Afghanistan.' During last week’s meeting between Misri and Muttaqi, India underlined 'its readiness to respond to the urgent developmental needs of the Afghan people.' Before the Taliban takeover in 2021, India was the largest regional provider of development aid to Kabul and had invested about $3 billion in projects that included schools, roads, dams and hospitals. Many of those projects had stalled after the Taliban takeover. Some could restart, analysts say. 'The Indian goal is to protect the good things India has done over the decades, and renew its developmental activities,' said Chintamani Mahapatra, founder of the Kalinga Institute of Indo Pacific Studies in New Delhi. 'Afghanistan is a very important country for us, so India is interested in engaging the Taliban rather than isolating it, no matter who is in the seat of power. And to achieve stability, there needs to be a modicum of economic development.' Both sides also agreed to promote the use of Iran’s Chabahar port for supporting trade and commercial activities – the port, which India is helping develop, is seen as crucial for both sides. India wants to strengthen connectivity via Afghanistan and Iran to Central Asia which it cannot access directly by land due to Pakistan's refusal of transit rights. For landlocked Afghanistan, which has to rely heavily on Pakistani land routes and seaports to conduct trade, the Chabahar port provides an alternate route. The Taliban also has urged New Delhi to issue visas to Afghan businessmen, patients and students — a process that virtually halted after its takeover because of the closure of Indian consulates, security concerns and because India, like most countries, does not officially recognize the Taliban. But New Delhi will take a calibrated approach toward potential visitors from Afghanistan, according to analyst Sareen. 'India is not ready to open the floodgates for Afghans coming into India. New Delhi will remain cautious, but it will continue to deepen the engagement. Because while India has reservations on some aspects of the Taliban’s policies towards women and its ideology, realism is guiding Indian policy. After all, it cannot pretend that Afghanistan does not exist anymore. We are virtually their next door neighbors,' Sareen said. India’s decision to build ties with the Taliban at a time when countries like Russia and China are strengthening relations with Kabul, is likely to find support in countries like the United States. 'As the U.S. contemplates how to approach the Taliban when it comes to sensitive but pressing issues, from Americans still being held captive in Afghanistan to concerns about Islamic State terrorism, it will likely find it useful that a key US partner has decided to opt for the path of engagement,' Kugelman said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-steps-up-engagement-with-the-taliban-/7937468.html	2025-01-15T03:24:01-08:00	
Negotiators push to finalize Israel-Hamas ceasefire deal	Mediators pushed Wednesday to finalize a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip, while Israel’s military reported carrying out airstrikes overnight in northern, central and southern Gaza. The Israel Defense Forces said it struck Hamas targets in Gaza City, Khan Younis and Deir al-Balah. U.S. and Qatari officials expressed optimism Tuesday that Israel and Hamas were close to a deal, while cautioning that some details remained to be worked out. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a Washington speech, 'I believe we will get a ceasefire,' but added that it was up to Hamas to give its final assent. 'It's right on the brink. It's closer than it's ever been before.' Qatari Foreign Ministry spokesperson Majed al-Ansari described the ongoing talks as in the 'final stages' and at the 'closest point' yet to an agreement. Hamas said it was awaiting maps from Israel showing which parts of Gaza it would withdraw its troops from in the initial stages of the ceasefire. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said Israel will not compromise on security and will intervene if it sees a threat from Gaza in the future. The basic parameters of the ceasefire proposal would see the process play out in several stages. Hamas would release hostages it has been holding since the militants carried out their October 2023 attack on Israel, while Israeli authorities would release Palestinian prisoners. Israeli troops would carry out a phased withdrawal from Gaza, and some Palestinians displaced by the conflict would be allowed to return, along with a surge in aid for Palestinian civilians. The United Nations said on Tuesday that it was preparing to increase humanitarian aid to Gaza under the potential ceasefire. But challenges — such as uncertainty surrounding border access and security — remain. Months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have failed to bring a halt to the fighting, but in recent weeks, the effort has gained momentum at a time when the United States is preparing for President-elect Donald Trump to take office January 20 as Biden's four-year term ends. Blinken made a last-minute case Tuesday for a plan for the post-war reconstruction and governance of Gaza. 'We have a responsibility to ensure that the strategic gains of the last 15 months endure and lay the foundation for a better future,' Blinken told the Atlantic Council, a Washington-based policy research organization. 'All too often in the Middle East, we've seen how the shoes of one dictator can be filled by another or give way to conflict and chaos.' Blinken said the plan envisions the Palestinian Authority inviting 'international partners' to create an interim governing authority to run critical services and oversee the territory. Other partners, notably Arab states, would provide forces to ensure security in the short term, he said. That security mission would depend on a pathway to an independent Palestinian state unifying Gaza and the West Bank and would be tasked with creating 'a secure environment for humanitarian and reconstruction efforts and ensuring border security,' Blinken said. Creation of a Palestinian state, which Israel has refused to support, has been a sticking point in the negotiations. Israel launched its assault on Hamas in Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed across its borders on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. Since then, more than 46,600 people have been killed in Gaza, with most of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, although Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants it has killed. Much of Gaza has been laid to waste during the fighting and gripped by a humanitarian crisis, with most of its 2.3 million population displaced, often multiple times.

Indonesia to push social media protections ahead of age-limit law	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesia will impose interim child protection guidelines on social media companies while the government carves out a law to set a minimum age for users of the platforms, a senior communications ministry official said on Wednesday. On Monday, communications minister Meutya Hafid said the government planned to issue a regulation to set a minimum age for social media users, after discussing the proposal to protect children online with President Prabowo Subianto. The plan follows Australia's decision to ban children under 16 from accessing social media, with fines for tech giants from Instagram and Facebook owner Meta to TikTok, owned by China's ByteDance, if they failed to prevent children from accessing their platforms. 'What the minister means is that the government is headed for the direction of a stronger regulation on age limit, which is through the formation of a law,' Alexander Sabar, a senior official at the communications and digital ministry, told Reuters. In the meantime, the government will issue a regulation for digital platforms, including social media companies, to adhere to child protection guidelines, he said, without providing details. 'The emphasis for the government regulation is child protection — how they are protected from physical, mental, or moral perils,' he said, adding the regulation would not totally limit children's access to social media. Meta and TikTok did not respond to requests for comment. Nurmayanti, a 46-year-old mother of three who goes by one name, said she agreed with the plan to curtail social media content, particularly content promoting pornography or discrimination. 'They now can freely open social media so that is concerning to us as parents,' she said, adding the law must be strict and clear. However, Anis Hidayah, a commissioner at Indonesia's main human rights body, said that limiting the internet for children was important but the government must be careful to not curb their right to information. Nearly 50% of children under 12 in tech-savvy Indonesia use the internet with some respondents of that age group using Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok, according to a survey by the Indonesia internet service providers' association.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-to-push-social-media-protections-ahead-of-age-limit-law/7937439.html	2025-01-15T01:53:48-08:00	
California firefighters battle wildfires as forecasters warn of dangerous winds	Warnings were in place again Wednesday in the Los Angeles area for the prospect of strong winds combining with dry conditions to spread wildfires as firefighters battled a series of blazes in the region that have already killed at least 25 people. After winds were weaker than expected during the day Tuesday, the National Weather Service said the region was 'not out of the woods yet,' with the potential for a surge in winds through early Wednesday afternoon. Utility companies shut off power to more than 77,000 households to prevent their power lines from sparking new blazes. The winds threatened to undermine incremental gains that firefighters have made in recent days as they try to control two main fires that have been burning since last week, as well as a smaller fire that sparked Monday. The California Department of Foresty and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) said the Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles had burned 96 square kilometers and was 18% contained as of early Wednesday. The Eaton Fire in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains on the east side of the city was 35% contained and has burned 57 square kilometers, Cal Fire said. About 88,000 people remained under evacuation orders with another nearly 85,000 being warned they might be ordered to evacuate. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna encouraged people to consider leaving when they get a warning without waiting for an order. He said deputies have had to rescue many people who waited until the last minute after receiving orders. Authorities said nearly 30 people remain missing, and that the death toll was likely to rise as search crews gain access to areas that have already burned. Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass told reporters she took an aerial tour of the affected areas on Monday. 'The massive, massive destruction is unimaginable until you actually see it,' Bass said. Some information for this report is from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-firefighters-battle-wildfires-as-forecasters-warn-of-dangerous-winds/7937431.html	2025-01-15T01:33:03-08:00	
Russian missile, drone attacks cause damage in multiple Ukrainian regions	Officials in western Ukraine said Wednesday a Russian missile attack hit critical infrastructure facilities in the Lviv region. Lviv Governor Maksym Kozytskyi said the missile strikes took place in two separate areas, and that there were no casualties. Ukraine’s military issued air alerts for regions across the country Wednesday, while the national power grid operator instituted power cuts in six regions. Cherkasy Governor Ihor Taburets said on Telegram that Russian forces attacked overnight with drones and missiles, with fragments from destroyed drones damaging two houses. In Dnipropetrovsk, Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that Russian attacks included artillery, drones and missiles that damaged an industrial site. Kirovohrad Governor Andriy Raikovich reported on Telegram what he described as a massive Russian drone attack that damaged several residential buildings. Officials in the Rivne region also said Russian missiles targeted the area overnight. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed two Ukrainian drones over the Belgorod area and another drone over the Tambov region. Belgorod Governor Vyacheslav Gladkov said on Telegram that Ukrainian attacks injured one person, while Tambov Governor Yevgeny Pervyshov reported damage to a house. Some information for this story came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-missile-drone-attacks-cause-damage-in-multiple-ukrainian-regions/7937425.html	2025-01-15T01:18:40-08:00	
Japan 'gravely concerned' about maritime tensions escalating, foreign minister says	Manila, Philippines — Japan is gravely concerned about actions in the South China Sea that are raising tensions, and strongly opposes any unilateral attempt to change the status quo, its foreign minister said on Wednesday. Speaking during a visit to the Philippines, Takeshi Iwaya also said Japan would continue to provide development and security assistance to Manila and support for its maritime security, adding that a trilateral mechanism which also includes the United States would be strengthened when a new administration takes over in Washington. Iwaya's visit follows a virtual call between Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden where the three leaders affirmed their 'trilateral arrangement' in deepening economic, security and technology cooperation in the face of growing tensions in the region. The transition to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's administration on Jan. 20 leaves Marcos as the only original leader out of those who established the trilateral initiative in 2024. Under Marcos, security engagements between the Philippines and Japan, two of the closest Asian allies of the U.S., have significantly deepened as both nations address shared maritime concerns over China's increasingly assertive actions in the region. 'Japan strongly opposes any attempt to unilaterally change the status quo by force or build up tension in the region. We strongly ask for easing of tensions,' Iwaya told a joint press conference with his Philippine counterpart in Manila, without mentioning China. China claims much of the South China Sea, a conduit for the bulk of northeast Asia's trade with the rest of the world. Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims on the waterway. The Chinese embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comments on Iwaya's remarks. Japan, which announced in 2023 its biggest military build-up since World War II in a step away from post-war pacifism, does not have any claims to the busy waterway. But it has a separate maritime dispute with China in the East China Sea, where the neighbors have repeatedly faced off. Last year, Japan signed a landmark military pact with the Philippines allowing deployment of forces on each other's soil. Manila also became one of the first recipients of Tokyo's official security assistance, a program aimed at helping boost deterrence capabilities of its partner countries. The Philippines has been embroiled in wrangles at sea with China in the past two years as the two countries face off regularly around disputed features in the South China Sea that fall inside Manila's exclusive economic zone. Both countries have accused each other of encroachment, while the Philippines has condemned Beijing over the presence and conduct of its coast guard fleet. 'I am gravely concerned that actions heightening tension in the South China Sea are repeated. Issue over South China Sea is a legitimate concern for the international community,' Iwaya said. Philippine Foreign Minister Enrique Manalo said his country's relationship with Tokyo was among the most resilient and dynamic in the region. The two ministers discussed the security situation in the East and South China Seas and their work together amid an evolving geopolitical landscape, he said, adding the two remain committed to a regional rules-based order.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-gravely-concerned-about-maritime-tensions-escalating-foreign-minister-says/7937428.html	2025-01-15T01:17:34-08:00

US, Japanese companies send landers on moon missions	Two moon landers built by private U.S. and Japanese companies are on their way to the moon after lifting off early Wednesday on a shared ride aboard a SpaceX rocket. The launch from NASA’s Kennedy Space Center in Florida is the latest in a public-private program that put a spacecraft from Intuitive Machines on the moon last year. Wednesday’s launch included a lander from Japanese space exploration company ispace that is carrying a rover with the capability of collecting lunar dirt and testing potential food and water sources on the moon. The spacecraft is also carrying a small red 'Moonhouse' built by Swedish artist Mikael Genberg. The ispace mission is expected to reach its destination on the moon’s far north in four to five months. The company is making its second attempt at a lunar landing, after a 2023 mission failed in the final stages. Also aboard the rocket heading toward the moon is a lander from U.S. company Firefly Aerospace that is set to carry out 10 experiments for NASA. The planned experiments include gathering dirt and measuring subsurface temperatures. The spacecraft is expected to arrive in about 45 days.

South African rescue operation brings illegal miners, bodies, to surface	Johannesburg — Rescue operations were underway at a gold mine in South Africa’s North West province where hundreds of illegal miners have been underground for months. More than 50 bodies were brought to the surface at the mine, police confirmed on Tuesday, as operations to rescue those still trapped underground continued. More than 100 people were brought up alive. The illegal miners, known in South Africa as 'zama zamas,' or 'those who take a chance,' have been down the unused mine shaft for more than two months, after police launched an operation to crack down on the illegal activity. At first, authorities said the miners were refusing to resurface to avoid arrest, but civil society groups say they are unable to get back to the surface as they are too weak from starvation. A court last week ordered the government to launch a rescue operation, which started Monday. But Mzukisi Jam, an activist who has been involved in rescue operations, said it was too little too late. 'Our volunteers confirmed with us yesterday that there are more than 400 live illegal miners who are still trapped, and our own volunteers confirmed — who went down there — that there are more than 100 dead bodies,' Jam said. Police have not confirmed how many miners, living or dead, remain trapped. But Jam said the tragedy could have been prevented. 'We literally begged the government to say, 'Could you please just save them? Take them and put them to the surface?’ Then, you can further process them in terms of [the] criminality you’re saying they’ve committed.' But the police minister and minister of mineral resources and energy, who visited the rescue site on Tuesday, defended the government’s actions. 'I’ve not changed my views that illegal mining is a criminal activity,' said Gwede Mantashe, mineral resources minister. Mantashe said illegal mining was an 'attack on the economy,' with the illicit precious metal trade estimated at over $3 billion in 2024. 'While there’s a criminal activity, there’s a crime scene. … It should be intensifying the fight against illegal mining,' Mantashe said. But for Zinzi Tom, whose 26-year-old brother is still down the mine, all that matters is that he comes out alive. 'They told us that he’s not in good condition — the guy who was with him was saying that he last saw him two weeks ago. It’s a very sad moment, but one thing that I told myself is that I pray to God to give me strength,' Tom said. 'I have to make sure that he’s OK, and pray to God.' Illegal miners like her brother are forced to eke out a dangerous living underground because of high unemployment, she said. Some are South African, but many others are from neighboring countries like Lesotho and Mozambique. Experts say that while the actual zama zamas taking the risks make little money, the criminal syndicates who run illegal operations are getting rich. The rescue operation is expected to take 10 days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-african-rescue-operation-brings-illegal-miners-bodies-to-surface/7937395.html	2025-01-14T23:09:02-08:00	
After cable damage, Taiwan to step up surveillance of flag of convenience ships	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan will step up the surveillance and management of ships carrying flags of convenience, including boarding them, after a Chinese-linked cargo vessel was suspected of damaging an undersea communications cable, the government said. Taiwan, which China views as its own territory, said a ship owned by a Hong Kong company but registered both in Cameroon and Tanzania, damaged a cable to the north of the island earlier this month, although it says it has not been able to verify the ship's intentions and was unable to board it due to bad weather. The ship's owner has denied involvement, and China's government has said Taiwan was making up accusations before the facts were clear. The incident has particularly alarmed Taiwan given it has repeatedly complained about 'gray zone' Chinese activities around the island, designed to pressure it without direct confrontation, such as balloon overflights and sand dredging. In a report to lawmakers ahead of ministers taking questions in parliament on Thursday, Taiwan's National Security Bureau said it plans to step up surveillance and management of ships carrying so-called flags of convenience, referring to those registered to other countries than their actual owner. Such ships, which previously have been found to misreport information, will be put on a list for priority inspection at ports, it said. If these ships enter within 24 nautical miles of Taiwan's coast and are close to where undersea cables are, the coast guard will be dispatched to board them and investigate, the bureau added. Taiwan will also promote greater international cooperation with the United States and Europe over suspected damage to undersea cables, it said. 'The bureau will continue to exchange intelligence with like-minded countries, collect threat alert information, analyze developing trends in sabotage techniques and false covers, and share prevention and response experience.' It did not give details. Taiwan, whose government rejects Beijing's sovereignty claims, has pointed to similarities between what it experienced and damage to undersea cables in the Baltic Sea following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Last week, Taiwan's government said Chinese ships flying flags of convenience have 'the mark of evil about them.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-cable-damage-taiwan-to-step-up-surveillance-of-flag-of-convenience-ships/7937390.html	2025-01-14T22:05:28-08:00

Why did US exclude India from unrestricted access to AI chips?	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden signed on Tuesday an executive order to boost development of artificial intelligence infrastructure in America. A day earlier, his administration announced sweeping measures to block access to the most advanced semiconductors by China and other adversaries. But the U.S. left India, its strategic partner in the Indo-Pacific, off a list of 18 countries that are allowed unrestricted access to advanced AI chips. Analysts say while a growing technological relationship between the two countries would likely make India eligible in the future to access advanced U.S. AI chips, New Delhi's existing ties with Moscow and the perception of a less robust technology regulatory framework led to its exclusion from the top list. Exclusion not a surprise The Commerce Department's policy framework divides the world into three categories. The first tier includes the U.S. and 18 countries with unrestricted access, followed by a list of more than 100 countries that will be subjected to new caps on advanced semiconductors with individual exemptions. The third tier includes adversaries such as China and Russia that face maximum restrictions. India falls in the second category, along with U.S. allies like Israel and close friends such as Singapore. Bhaskar Chakravorti, the dean of global business at The Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University in Massachusetts, said that India's relationship with Russia 'puts it outside a super safe category.' India has had close ties with Russia since the Soviet Union supported its desire for independence from Britain. It maintained those ties during the Cold War, when the U.S. sided with India's rival Pakistan. Scott Jones, a non-resident fellow at Washington's Stimson Center think tank, highlighted recent reports that accused a few Indian companies of aiding Russia's war on Ukraine, but stressed that while being excluded is a disappointment, it's 'not a setback for India.' He also pointed to the perception that 'India's ability to control and manage technology is perhaps not as robust as evidenced in some of the 18 countries.' While India may be off the unrestricted list for now, analysts say its growing technological cooperation with the U.S. may shield it from some curbs. Richard Rossow, senior adviser and chair on India and Emerging Asia Economies at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the presence of caveats in the new framework would ensure India's later participation. 'The fact that they have announced that there will be a pathway for some countries to get exemptions that are above what they're going to consider the standard cap, India, I imagine, would be on the short list of countries,' he told VOA. In early January, national security adviser Jake Sullivan traveled to India and met with Prime Minister Narendra Modi and other senior officials. During the trip, both sides reiterated their commitment to forge a 'strategic technology partnership' and strengthen cooperation under the U.S.-India initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), a bilateral mechanism focused on technology partnership. On semiconductors, the U.S. is facilitating investments in India's semiconductor manufacturing and intensifying R&D collaboration. During his trip, Sullivan highlighted the investment of $2.7 billion in India by U.S. chipmaker Micron to create semiconductor packaging facilities, which he hoped would contribute to establishing 'India as a new hub in the global chip ecosystem.' The Indian government too is investing billions of dollars through its dedicated program called the India Semiconductor Mission and Production Linked Incentive scheme. Rossow argued that the Indian government would not have been 'terribly surprised' that 'they were not included' in the list. Jones of the Stimson Center agreed. 'Jake Sullivan was in New Delhi last week, and I would be very surprised if he did not inform his Indian counterparts of what was going to happen,' he said. Ensuring America's leadership in AI The Biden administration has focused on the centrality of artificial intelligence to America's security and economic strength. According to a White House factsheet, the latest steps are part of its effort to prevent offshoring this critical technology and ensure that 'the world's AI runs on American rails.' Since October 2022, the U.S. government has enacted a series of export controls, blocking access of advanced semiconductors to China to prevent its use for military applications. While initially the measures adversely affected the Chinese semiconductor industry, Beijing has continued to advance its capabilities and is attempting to narrow the technology gap. According to Chakravorti of the Fletcher School, there are numerous implementation challenges of this expansive global strategy. 'From lobbying from the U.S. chipmakers that will start as soon as Trump takes office to potential leaks in the carefully calibrated list of countries. Will there be a secondary market? How does this affect where future data centers are built?' he asked. Jones of the Stimson Center argued that the policy is more a 'symbolic gesture than a practical consideration' but has a stern message for the rest of the world. 'The U.S. is clearly saying, if you want to participate in the U.S.-sponsored AI ecosystem, you have to pick now. You pick China or you pick us. You can't have it both ways. You can't play one off against the other. You have to choose,' he concluded.	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-did-the-us-exclude-india-from-unrestricted-access-to-ai-chips-/7936974.html	2025-01-14T19:57:54-08:00	
US SEC sues Elon Musk over late disclosure of Twitter stake	Elon Musk was sued on Tuesday by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, which accused the world's richest person of waiting too long to disclose in 2022 he had amassed a large stake in Twitter, the social media company he later bought. In a complaint filed in Washington, the SEC said Musk violated federal securities law by waiting 11 days too long to disclose his initial purchase of 5% of Twitter's common shares. An SEC rule requires investors to disclose within 10 calendar days, or by March 24, 2022, in Musk's case, when they cross a 5% ownership threshold. The SEC said that at the expense of unsuspecting investors, Musk bought more than $500 million of Twitter shares at artificially low prices before finally revealing his purchases on April 4, 2022, by which time he owned a 9.2% stake. Twitter's share price rose more than 27% following that disclosure, the SEC said. Tuesday's lawsuit seeks to force Musk to pay a civil fine and disgorge profits he didn't deserve. Musk eventually purchased Twitter for $44 billion in October 2022, and renamed it X. Alex Spiro, a lawyer for Musk, in an email called the SEC lawsuit the culmination of the regulator's 'multi-year campaign of harassment' against his client. 'Today's action is an admission by the SEC that they cannot bring an actual case,' he said. 'Mr. Musk has done nothing wrong and everyone sees this sham for what it is.' Spiro added that the lawsuit addresses a mere 'alleged administrative failure to file a single form — an offense that, even if proven, carries a nominal penalty.' Musk, an adviser to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, is worth $417 billion according to Forbes magazine, through businesses such as the electric car maker Tesla and rocket company. He is worth nearly twice as much as Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos, the world's second-richest person at $232 billion, Forbes said. The SEC sued Musk six days before Trump's January 20 presidential inauguration. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler is stepping down that day, and Paul Atkins, who Trump nominated to succeed him, is expected to review many of Gensler's rules and enforcement actions. Musk has also been sued in Manhattan federal court by former Twitter shareholders over the late disclosure. In that case, Musk has said it was implausible to believe he wanted to defraud other shareholders, and that 'all indications' were that his delay was a mistake. Musk has long feuded with the SEC, including after it sued him in 2018 over his Twitter posts about possibly taking Tesla private and having secured funding to do so. He settled that lawsuit by paying a $20 million civil fine, agreeing to have Tesla lawyers review some Twitter posts in advance, and giving up his role as Tesla's chairman. The SEC also sought sanctions from Musk after he missed court-ordered testimony last September for the Twitter probe so he could attend the launch of SpaceX's Polaris Dawn mission at Florida's Cape Canaveral. A federal judge in San Francisco rejected that request, because Musk later testified and agreed to pay the SEC's travel costs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-sec-sues-elon-musk-over-late-disclosure-of-twitter-stake/7937332.html	2025-01-14T19:10:57-08:00	
Biden announces 2 new national monuments in California	WASHINGTON — In an announcement postponed by the Los Angeles wildfires, President Joe Biden on Tuesday designated two sites in California as national monuments that will honor Native American tribes while shielding picturesque mountains and deserts from mining and energy development. Biden made the designations at an event at the White House, a week after and on the other side of the country from where he'd originally planned to do so with a speech in California's Eastern Coachella Valley. The president landed in California on January 6 but made it as far as Los Angeles before high winds — which helped spark the Los Angeles blazes — forced officials to scrap the event. It was a stark reminder that, even as Biden uses the last days of his administration to attempt to safeguard the environment, climate change is already helping to exacerbate natural disasters. Instead, Biden spoke next to screens featuring towering peaks, desert vistas and an array of plant and animal life. 'I was hoping we were going to do this in place,' the president said. 'This is as close as we could get.' Biden formally created the Chuckwalla National Monument, in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park, and the Sáttítla Highlands National Monument, in Northern California. The declarations bar oil and natural gas drilling, as well as mining and other exploration and production initiatives, on the 2,400-square-kilometer Chuckwalla site, and roughly 800 square kilometers near the California-Oregon border. The protected area encompasses natural wonders, including the Painted Canyon of Mecca Hills and Alligator Rock, and is home to 50-plus rare species of plants and animals like the desert bighorn sheep and the Chuckwalla lizard, which the monument is named for, the White House said in a statement. At the event, Biden talked about taking his children to national monuments around the country yearly when they were young to 'witness the majesty, the beauty.' 'Our national wonders are the heart and soul of this nation,' he said. 'It's a birthright we pass on from generation to generation.' The monuments becoming realities honor past tribal requests. Many Native American tribes and environmental groups have pushed for designation of the Chuckwalla National Monument, while the Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the Sáttítla Highlands National Monument. Biden joked about being careful not to mispronounce Sáttítla, then still struggled to pronounce it. When he sat down to sign the formal acts, he simply referred to it as the 'highlands' monument, so he didn't have to give it another try. The designations are part of a larger Biden administration effort to conserve at least 30% of U.S. lands and waters by 2030. They follow Biden's recent move banning new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, including in California. That was an attempt to thwart possible efforts by the incoming Republican administration to expand offshore drilling, but President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to quickly reverse the order.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-announces-2-new-national-monuments-in-california/7937323.html	2025-01-14T18:50:56-08:00	
Exodus continues from Ethiopia earthquake epicenter	AWASH FENTALE, AFAR REGION, ETHIOPIA — A semi-desert plain that lies between two rugged mountains has, for about five months, been the epicenter of volcanic activity in Ethiopia's Afar region. From a distance, it looks serene and peaceful. As you approach, however, you're met with rifts from the strong land vibrations that occur two to three times every week. Smoke billows from a deep hole beneath the ground. Nearby holes spit out hot mud and water. The water smells like sulfuric acid from a kilometer away. The locals call it 'Seganto,' which also means the name of the plant that commonly grows in this small area between the Dofan and Fentale mountains, located in Ethiopia's Afar region. Both mountains have volcanic activity and small lakes on their peaks. Fentale mountain is distinctive, with smoke billowing from the top. Nearly two weeks ago, an earthquake with a magnitude of 5.8 struck the region. The vibration from the quake was felt in nearby towns such as Awash Sebat Kilo and Awash Arba, about 220 kilometers from the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa. Many have been displaced so far, and Ado Ali, a resident in Awash Fentale and a mother of four, said it was time to go. 'We heard a big noise from the ground; it sounds like gun salute,' she said. 'Our animals get shocked. We were praying to get out safely.' It was the same story for Hassan Kamil, a Seganto resident who was particularly worried about the potential for a bigger eruption. 'Dofan mountain is the one behind me, and Fentale is the one in front of me; the rift created following the earthquake is now going from Dofan to Fentale mountain,' he said. 'The holes through which the explosion is being seen used to be few; now there are more than 10 in this place in Seganto Kebele alone.' Another resident of Awash Fentale; Ahmed Hisis, said his house was destroyed by volcanic eruptions. 'To this day, the vibration is demolishing homes, creating cracks,' he said. Hisis said he does not feel safe as the vibration is ongoing. Evacuations The explosions in December led to the exodus of the estimated 10,000 community members living in Seganto. Today, Seganto remains empty. Hassan Kamil Konte, a community elder, fled and now lives in a nearby shelter as the community relocates the residents. The earthquake activity has destroyed most local infrastructure. The shock following the ground shaking demolished 37 schools and forced 5,000 students from their classrooms, according to Moussa Adam, deputy head of the Afar National Regional State Education Bureau. A state-run sugar factory with more than 4,000 employees ceased operation as locals fled the area, the local administration said. Last week, the Ethiopian federal government announced plans to evacuate at least 80,000 residents from the spots of the active volcano sites in Afar and the nearby localities of the Oromia and Amhara regions. Officials say the majority of the targeted residents in the most affected Afar region have left the active volcanic sites. 'We have managed to evacuate at least 54,000 people so far, our aim is to relocate the victims from the active volcanic sites, and we are succeeding,' Moussa told VOA. Humanitarian needs Residents are now getting into local internally displaced centers at nearby Awash Arba town and waiting for help from the state and humanitarian agencies. Despite living in the shelter for more than a week, some say they still do not have their basic needs met. Fakir Mohammed is among them. 'The situation is tough as you can see. Many did not get shelters, drinking water is also not adequate,' he told VOA. He said the government is trying to provide resources but the number of the people in need exceeds resources available. Balli Hasan, a mother of three, also said she is happy to have escaped from the active earthquake spot, but as the shelter is not able to protect her children from the sun, the situation in the camp is still a challenge, she said. Officials try to meet needs Moussa, the Afar regional official said the state is trying to fill the need for the people in shelters. 'The Ethiopian Disaster and Risk Management Commission, together with other humanitarian NGOs are providing help. Newcomers may not be able to get food the day they arrive as they have to go through a process of registration, but, we have not encountered human death due to hunger,' Moussa said. The people displaced because of the earthquake said they still do not feel safe because they are not far from the epicenter of the active volcano. Some newly built shelters for the displaced are just 10 kilometers from the epicenter of the recent eruption. But the government said the displaced are being relocated to safer areas following strict review by experts from Samara University. The Ethiopian Disaster and Risk Management Commission said it is working to provide help for the communities affected by the recent active earthquake. According to a statement from the commission, more than $2.2 million (280 million Birr) in food and nonfood items has been dispatched to crisis sites in Afar, and the Oromia and Amhara regions to reach people in need.

South Korean investigators arrest impeached President Yoon	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean authorities arrested impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol on Wednesday over insurrection accusations related to his December 3 martial law declaration, investigators said. A motorcade was seen leaving the gates of his hillside residence where Yoon had been holed up for weeks behind barbed wire barriers and a small army of personal security. More than 3,000 police officers and anti-corruption investigators had gathered there before dawn, pushing through throngs of Yoon supporters and members of his ruling People Power Party protesting attempts to detain him. Yoon's lawyers have argued attempts to detain Yoon are illegal and designed to publicly humiliate him. The warrant investigators secured for his arrest is the first ever issued against an incumbent South Korean president. As local news broadcasters reported that Yoon's detention may come soon, some minor scuffles broke out between tearful pro-Yoon protesters and police near the residence, according to a Reuters witness at the scene. Yoon's declaration of martial law stunned South Koreans and plunged one of Asia's most vibrant democracies into an unprecedented period of political turmoil. Lawmakers voted to impeach Yoon on December 14 and remove him from duties. Separately, the Constitutional Court is deliberating over to uphold that impeachment and permanently remove him from office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-investigators-arrest-impeached-president-yoon/7937321.html	2025-01-14T18:21:48-08:00

Biden to lift state sponsor of terrorism designation on Cuba	U.S. President Joe Biden notified Congress on Tuesday that he intends to delist Cuba as a U.S.-designated state sponsor of terrorism in a deal facilitated by the Catholic Church to free political prisoners on the island. Speaking on the condition of anonymity before the announcement, senior administration officials told reporters that dozens of political prisoners and others deemed unjustly detained by U.S. officials would be freed by noon on January 20. The announcement also indicated the U.S. would aim to reduce economic pressure on the island nation. 'Today's actions demonstrate that President Biden's Cuba policy, which is focused on achieving practical results with respect to human rights in Cuba, will pay dividends for the Cuban people,' a senior official told reporters, acknowledging Havana's 'direct dialogue with the Catholic Church.' Hours after Biden's announcement, Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel said his government would gradually release 553 prisoners after talks with the church. Earlier, his government expressed gratitude. 'Despite its limited scope, this is a decision that points to the right direction and is in line with the sustained and firm demand by the government and the people of Cuba,' the country's foreign ministry said in a press release. 'The decision announced today by the United States, rectifies, in a very limited way, some aspects of a cruel and unjust policy,' it added. In Congress, the backlash to Biden's announcement was swift. 'Today's decision is unacceptable on its merits,' Republican Senator Ted Cruz said in a statement. 'The terrorism advanced by the Cuban regime has not ceased. I will work with President Trump and my colleagues to immediately reverse and limit the damage from the decision.' Fellow Republican Representative Carlos Gimenez also criticized the announcement, predicting a quick reversal on the policy by President-elect Donald Trump. 'President Biden is a pathetic coward,' Gimenez posted on X. 'Come January 20th, there will be a NEW SHERIFF in town & President Trump alongside Secretary of State @SenMarcoRubio will not only put #Cuba BACK on the list but PULVERIZE the regime once & for all!' According to The Associated Press, human rights groups and activists, including the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, have been pressing the Biden administration to lift the designation to ease the suffering of Cuban people who feel the impact of Cuba's economic isolation.

South Korean police raid Yoon's residence in fresh detention effort	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean authorities are making a fresh effort to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, days after he evaded the first attempt to enforce a court-approved warrant with the protection of presidential security and military forces. A team of investigators arrived before dawn Wednesday at the heavily fortified presidential compound in central Seoul. Yoon has been holed up there as he pushes against a government insurrection investigation related to his short-lived declaration of martial law. Reports suggest authorities are prepared to use a much larger force — consisting of about 1,000 police officers — and more forceful tactics to detain Yoon than they did in their previous attempt nearly two weeks ago. According to Yonhap News Agency, authorities are bracing for an operation that could last up to three days and may use loudspeakers for psychological warfare, as well as cranes and tow trucks to remove any barriers. The presidential residence, which lies in a sprawling, hilly compound in the Hannam-dong neighborhood, has been fortified with extra barbed wire fencing and tightly packed buses and other vehicles that block the path to Yoon's residence. Despite the predawn hour and subfreezing temperatures, police estimate that 6,500 Yoon supporters were gathered in the area early Wednesday. For weeks, the large street outside the compound has been filled with protesters — mostly supporters of the embattled conservative president, who has vowed to 'fight to the end.' According to Yonhap, some ruling party lawmakers formed a human chain early Wednesday outside the main entrance of Yoon's residence to prevent his detention. If Yoon is detained, authorities would have 48 hours to decide whether to file for a formal arrest warrant or release him. It would be the first time a sitting South Korean president has been taken into police custody. Yoon was impeached last month following his declaration of martial law. The country's Constitutional Court must uphold his impeachment for him to be removed from office. Separately, Yoon faces a criminal investigation into insurrection and abuse of power but has defied multiple requests to appear for questioning as part of that probe. Yoon's lawyers have slammed the detention effort as politically motivated. They also argue that the court that issued the detention warrant had no jurisdiction to do so, and that the anti-corruption agency leading the investigation has no mandate to investigate the president for insurrection. Earlier this week, South Korea's acting president, Choi Sang-mok, warned against the possibility of clashes between security forces, urging both sides to act in a 'peaceful and restrained manner.' The previous detention attempt on January 3 was suspended after a six-hour standoff, with the detention team citing the risk of violence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-police-raid-yoon-s-residence-in-fresh-detention-effort/7936934.html	2025-01-14T14:58:31-08:00	
New Orleans attacker had researched similar rampage, and how to access Bourbon Street balcony	BATON ROUGE — Before plowing a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year's revelers in New Orleans, killing 14 people, the man who carried out the Islamic State group-inspired attack had researched how to access a balcony on the city's famed Bourbon Street and looked up information about a similar recent attack at a Christmas market in Germany, the FBI said. Nearly two weeks after Shamsud-Din Jabbar's rampage, the FBI continues to uncover new information detailing the extensive planning by the 42-year-old Army veteran who scouted out the area multiple times in the months leading up to the attack. Authorities also have been piecing together a timeline of his radicalization. In the early hours of New Year's Day, Jabbar could be seen on video surveillance placing two containers with explosive devices, which would remain undetonated, in the French Quarter. Shortly after, about 3:15 a.m., Jabbar sped a white pickup truck around a police car blockading the entrance of Bourbon Street, where partygoers continued to wander around the street lined with bars. He drove through revelers before crashing and being killed by police in a shootout. Fifty-seven people were injured, authorities said. Just hours before the deadly onslaught, Jabbar had searched online for information about an attack at a busy outdoor Christmas Market in east Germany that occurred just 10 days earlier and where a car was also used as a mass weapon, the FBI said on Tuesday. The attack in Europe left five people dead and more than 200 injured after a car slammed into a crowd. Police arrested a 50-year-old doctor from Saudi Arabia who has renounced Islam and supports the far-right AfD party. In other online searches, Jabbar had looked up how to access a balcony on Bourbon Street, information about Mardi Gras, and several recent shootings in the city, the FBI said. But Jabbar's research ahead of the attack was not limited to online: He also made a one-day visit to New Orleans from Houston on Nov. 10, during which he looked for an apartment, the FBI said. While Jabbar applied to rent the apartment, he later told the landlord that he changed his mind. That was not his only visit to New Orleans, though. The FBI had previously reported that Jabbar had traveled to the city for a planning trip on Oct. 31, when he used glasses from Meta, the parent company of Facebook, to record video as he rode through the French Quarter on a bicycle. In a series of online videos, posted hours before he struck, Jabbar proclaimed support for the Islamic State militant group. The Bourbon Street attack was the deadliest Islamic State-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years. On Tuesday, the FBI continued to draft out a timeline of Jabbar's radicalization, saying that he began isolating himself from society and became a more devout Muslim in 2022. By the spring of 2024, he began following extremist views. While investigations into the attack are ongoing and additional information continues to trickle out about Jabbar's planning of the deadly rampage, city officials face questions about safety concerns. State and local authorities have launched probes into possible security deficiencies that left New Orleans vulnerable. The work is especially urgent since Carnival season, a monthslong celebration that attracts tens of thousands of visitors to the French Quarter, began last week. The city is also set to host the Super Bowl on Feb. 9.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-attacker-had-researched-similar-rampage-and-how-to-access-bourbon-street-balcony/7936963.html	2025-01-14T14:44:42-08:00	
Rights groups in Kenya blame police for increase in abductions of government critics	NAIROBI, Kenya — Human rights groups in Kenya are blaming police for a recent increase in the abductions of critics who have protested government policies. The activists say at least 29 people are missing after raising concerns about poor governance. Kenyan cartoonist Gideon Kibet said that unknown people trailed him to a bus on his way from a meeting in the capital, Nairobi, in December 2024. He said he was forced into a car by masked assailants, who tore his shirt and used it to cover his eyes and tie his hands. Kibet was eventually released. Kibet has drawn cartoons mocking government figures such as President William Ruto. One caricature, which depicted the president in a coffin, went viral. Kibet’s experience is among 82 cases of abductions and forced disappearances in just six months, according to the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights. Although Kibet and four others have been released, that has not been the case for dozens of others. From September 2023 to August 2024, Kenya saw a 44% increase in abductions compared to the same time period from the previous year, according to the national security report. Officials say there were 52 abductions in Kenya from September 2023 to August 2024, compared to 36 the previous year. Many of the victims are critics of bad governance, say rights groups. ''What we are seeing is essentially the use of extrajudicial power to course fear among those citizens that are legitimately protesting against bad governance or raising concerns with the government,'' said Irungu Houghton, executive director for Amnesty International Kenya. Some Kenyans have taken to social media to protest the government on issues including increases in taxes and corruption. However, at a public event Sunday, Interior Cabinet Secretary Kipchumba Murkomen referred to such critics as criminals. ''If the criminals and people with bad behavior have moved ... to the digital space, I want to tell you that we will follow you there because that is where we want to ensure that there is law and order,'' he said. Kenyan lawyers have petitioned the country’s high court to hold the inspector general of police responsible for the abductions. According to the lawyers, the state is evading accountability. ''Our question has been from July until today, no investigation has been done, no investigation has been cleared, we are not being told the people who are responsible,'' said Gloria Kimani, a member of the Law Society of Kenya. Inspector General of Police Douglas Kanja and Director of Criminal Investigations Mohammed Amin are to appear in court Friday regarding the abductions. The two have snubbed three previous court summonses in the abduction cases.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-groups-in-kenya-blame-police-for-increase-in-abductions-of-government-critics/7936898.html	2025-01-14T14:00:31-08:00	
US finalizes rules banning Chinese, Russian smart cars	The White House says it has finalized rules that crack down on Chinese and Russian automobile technology effectively banning all personal smart cars from the two countries from entering the U.S. market. In a White House fact sheet detailing the decision, the Biden administration Tuesday said that while connected vehicles offer advantages, the involvement of foreign adversaries such as China and Russia in their supply chains presents serious risks granting 'malign actors unfettered access to these connected systems and the data they collect.' 'The Department of Commerce has issued a final rule that will prohibit the sale and import of connected vehicle hardware and software systems, as well as completed connected vehicles, from the PRC and Russia,' the fact sheet said. PRC is the acronym for China’s official name, the People’s Republic of China. Connected vehicles are smart cars that are designed to be convenient for consumers and provide safety for drivers, passengers, and pedestrians through the use of many connected parts such as Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cellular, and satellite connectivity. 'Cars today aren't just steel on wheels; they're computers,' said Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo when speaking on the rule. 'This is a targeted approach to ensure we keep PRC- and Russian-manufactured technologies off American roads,' said Raimondo. The new rule is the 'culmination of a year-long examination' of potential risks posed by connected vehicles and will 'help the United States defend against the PRC’s cyber espionage and intrusion operations, which continue to pose a significant threat to U.S. critical infrastructure and public safety.' The crackdown on cars follows Washington’s announcement earlier this month that the U.S. consider new rules aimed at addressing risks posed by drones that utilize technology from China and Russia. The U.S. has repeatedly emphasized the need to balance technological progress with the protection of national security interests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-finalizes-rules-banning-chinese-russian-smart-cars/7936903.html	2025-01-14T13:59:13-08:00	
Huge challenges ahead for Lebanon's new leaders, analysts say	Lebanon has a new president and prime minister that many Lebanese and Gulf and Arab countries hope will bring the war-scarred Mediterranean nation out of its economic and political crisis. Lebanon’s new President Joseph Aoun vows to tackle corruption and wants only the national army to hold weapons and protect Lebanon’s borders, moves likely to challenge the Shiite militia Hezbollah and Israel. Many Lebanese see both Aoun and Prime Minister Nawaf Salam as being above the political infighting that has paralyzed Lebanon in recent times. Aoun headed Lebanon’s national army for years, winning the respect of citizens and foreign leaders, while Salam is a leading international judge who won parliament’s support. But as analyst Dania Koleilat Khatib, president of the Research Center for Cooperation and Peace Building in Beirut, told VOA, they face a mammoth task ahead fixing the country’s broken financial system and seeing the Hezbollah militia ultimately disarmed. 'Joseph Aoun has a lot of challenges. He raised the bar very high,' Khatib said. 'Returning the money of the depositors, removing the arms. But for him to deliver on his promises, he needs support. Unless Saudi [Arabia] and the UAE (United Arab Emirates) really keep the pressure on the Lebanese political structure, on the deputies, the political parties, he won’t be able to deliver.' Hezbollah’s political wing and other Shiite lawmakers have been accused of stymying necessary economic reforms and justice on issues, such as the disastrous 2020 Beirut port blast. Senior Hezbollah lawmaker Mohammed Raad accused Aoun of trying to exclude the group from power in Lebanon by not allowing their choice of caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati stay in the post. 'Hezbollah is weakened, but they still are there,' Khatib said. 'They still have a political bloc. So, they (Saudi Arabia and the UAE) have to pressure everyone on the political scene to make sure he (Aoun) can do reforms. Reforming means exposing all these guys because they are all involved in the corruption. Will they accept that? It’s a very much uphill battle.' Needed reforms include rooting out corruption from Lebanon’s state institutions, restructuring its public debt and overhauling the banking system to unlock financial aid from the International Monetary Fund and Gulf Arabs. Rebuilding south Lebanon and parts of Beirut are priorities following the Israel-Hezbollah fighting that stopped with a fragile truce in November. Israel has warned the ceasefire could collapse later this month if Hezbollah does not withdraw beyond the Litani River in the south. Nicholas Heras of the Washington-based New Lines Institute said Hezbollah still has weapons that could be viewed by some Lebanese as useful for protecting their territory from Israeli aggression. But he said Hezbollah has to be disarmed and integrated into the national military, or Israeli attacks will continue. 'President Aoun’s entire portfolio is how do you secure Lebanon’s borders and how do you return the sovereignty of the Lebanese state over all of its territory, which has the implied task to put Hezbollah on a process of disarmament,' Heras said. 'The Israeli interpretation of their ability to maneuver in Lebanon assumes that there will be an unsuccessful attempt by the Lebanese armed forces to subordinate Hezbollah or contain it.' Heras said Prime Minister Salam will be tasked with moving 'Lebanon on a path to recovery with getting its geopolitics squared away.' 'The prime minister is going to be judged on how effectively he can navigate the geopolitical currents,' Heras said, 'which is still uncertain in terms of the seeming rise of Turkish influence, how Iran reassesses its approach, how Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates decide to respond to the fall of the Assad government in Syria.' According to Lebanon’s sectarian power-sharing system, the president is a Maronite Christian, and the prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim. The president selects him in consultation with the Shiite parliament speaker based on support by the lawmakers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/huge-challenges-ahead-for-lebanon-s-new-leaders-analysts-say/7936701.html	2025-01-14T12:30:25-08:00	
US House Speaker orders Capitol flags raised to full height for Trump inauguration	U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Mike Johnson on Tuesday ordered that flags at the Capitol be raised to their full height on Inauguration Day, pausing a 30-day flag-lowering order following the death of former President Jimmy Carter. The Republican leader's decision means that President-elect Donald Trump will not take the oath of office for his second term under a half-staff flag, a prospect that he had previously complained about. It mirrors actions taken in recent days by some Republican governors who have announced that flags in their states would be raised on Inauguration Day to mark Trump's second term. Alabama Governor Kay Ivey and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee did so on Tuesday, noting in social media posts that U.S. flags across their states would be relowered on Jan. 21 in honor of Carter. Texas Governor Greg Abbott issued a similar notice on Monday. The 30-day flag-lowering period, set into motion with President Joe Biden's order, affects flags at federal government buildings and their grounds, as well as at U.S. embassies and other facilities abroad, including military installations and vessels. It runs through Jan. 28, which encompasses Trump's inauguration and first week in office. In line with Biden's order, governors throughout the country issued their own orders to govern flags in their respective states. The incoming president has expressed consternation that flags would still be lowered when he takes the oath, and it's possible that he could order the overall reversal of Biden's decision once he's installed as president on Jan. 20. 'Democrats are all 'giddy'' about the notion that flags will be lowered on Inauguration Day, Trump wrote Jan. 3 on social media. 'Nobody wants to see this,' Trump wrote. He added that 'no American can be happy about it. Let's see how it plays out. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!' Trump has already acted over the flags that he can control: at his home in Florida. In the days following Carter's burial, a large U.S. flag at Trump's private Mar-a-Lago club was observed flying at its full height, despite an order from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis that mirrors Biden's. As of Tuesday, DeSantis had not made alterations to the flag order in his own state. The U.S. flag code lays out parameters for lowering the U.S. flag to half-staff, including a 30-day period for current or former presidents to cover flags at federal government buildings and their grounds, as well as at U.S. embassies and other facilities abroad, including military installations and vessels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-speaker-orders-capitol-flags-raised-to-full-height-for-trump-inauguration/7936775.html	2025-01-14T12:05:29-08:00	
Cameroon says host villages attacked people displaced by Boko Haram	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Cameroonian officials said Monday five people are dead and several hundred are homeless in ongoing conflicts between host communities and people who arrived after being displaced by Boko Haram terrorism in the nation’s border area near Chad and Nigeria. Hundreds of irate host community members set fire to at least 60 government-built houses for internally displaced people in Yala Yalta, military officials said. Three displaced people died, and two host community residents died of injuries while being rushed to a local hospital. Government officials say it was the second burning of houses in the past five days. Residents of Yala Yalta, a village in Mayo-Sava, an administrative unit near Cameroon's border with Chad and Nigeria, say they no longer want the people who were displaced by Boko Haram Islamic terrorists in their village. They accuse the displaced people of kidnapping for ransom and provoking conflicts over scarce water, farm crops and fuel wood. Cameroon's Ministry of Territorial Administration and Infrastructure said at least 400 of about 2,000 people displaced by terrorism in Mayo-Sava live in Yala Yalta and surrounding villages. Local churches, including the Roman Catholic Church and the Cameroon Evangelical Church, say the abduction of members of the host community is the immediate cause of the ongoing conflicts. Cameroon's military said it freed four host community members abducted for ransom. Halidu Harouna, a pastor of the Cameroon Evangelical Church, told VOA via phone from Yala Yalta that villagers used bows and arrows, machetes and spears to attack the people seeking refuge in Yala Yalta. He said they torched houses after someone identified two members of a gang that kidnapped civilians for ransom as being among the displaced people. Villagers are also angry that theft of their cattle and crops has increased in recent months, Harouna said. Military officials said host community members have attacked and wounded at least 20 displaced persons for allegedly stealing from their plantations within the past two weeks. Captain Mark Nya Nanah, a commander of Cameroonian forces fighting Boko Haram in the central African state, said troops have been deployed to stop host communities from attacking displaced persons and their property. The military has asked people who have fled the violence to return and has assured communities they will get military protection. Some internally displaced people have acknowledged that some of their peers attack villagers and steal. They said a majority of the displaced people who attack villagers are either former fighters who surrendered or thieves hiding among displaced persons, a claim VOA could not independently verify. Cameroon's ministries of agriculture and livestock said conflicts between host communities and displaced persons are increasing because of a food shortage caused by floods in October. The government said several thousand goats, sheep and cows were either killed or swept away by flood waters, while several thousand hectares of farmland were destroyed. The United Nations says over 40,000 people have been killed and 3 million have fled their homes in Nigeria, Cameroon, Niger and Chad since 2009, when fighting between Nigerian government troops and Boko Haram militants spread to the other three countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-says-host-villages-attacking-people-displaced-by-boko-haram/7936741.html	2025-01-14T11:59:28-08:00	
Despite international concerns, doctors say China flu-like virus is no COVID-19	Reports of rising cases of a flu-like illness in China, where COVID-19 was first detected five years ago, sparked international concerns about the potential for another worldwide pandemic. But medical experts say the human metapneumovirus, known as HMPV, is no COVID-19. 'That’s a routine virus that commonly causes upper respiratory tract infections, such as bronchitis that might cause cough and sinuses,' says Dr. Paul Auwaerter, clinical director of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine’s division of infectious diseases. 'I don't feel we should be especially worried about it. It is not nearly as serious as influenza or COVID disease.' HMPV is a common virus that has been around at least since 2001. Children under five, particularly infants, and adults over 65 — especially those with health problems — can sometimes become seriously ill from HMPV. However, for most other people, the symptoms are generally mild. 'Almost everyone has been infected with this virus by the age of five,' Auwaerter says. 'HMPV has been here for, you know, a long time [and] has infected millions of people that already have immunity. It's not as though this is a brand-new virus that might cause devastating problems.' On Sunday, China said cases of HMPV had declined among residents in its northern provinces, where the respiratory infections were rising. Chinese health officials say the number of patients seeking medical help remains lower compared to the same period last year. Still, some health experts are calling for more transparency in order to reduce the spread of rumors and misunderstandings. 'International scholars are calling on China to disclose pathogen information and conduct genetic research to confirm that it is not a new virus. Even if it is an old virus, it could still be a new variant,' Dr. Ho Mei-Shang, a research fellow emeritus at the Institute of Biomedical Sciences in Taipei, told VOA’s Mandarin Service. Ho said China's COVID-19 prevention measures during the pandemic curbed the spread of diseases, which led to a decline in herd immunity, potentially causing the current surge in cases over a short time period. Auwaerter agrees. 'They stayed home, refrained from work, wore masks,' he says. 'So, the usual cycles of acquiring an infection, for example, during the respiratory season of winter, people didn't get infected. So, their specific immunity, they weren't boosted, and so there was a larger population that might be more susceptible.' There is no real treatment or vaccine for HMPV. Doctors say any patients who have trouble breathing should seek medical help.

Trump says he will create an 'External Revenue Service' agency to collect tariff income	Washington — President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday announced plans to create a new agency called the External Revenue Service to collect tariffs and other revenues from foreign nations. 'We will begin charging those that make money off of us with Trade, and they will start paying,' Trump said Tuesday on his social media site, Truth Social. He compared his planned creation to the Internal Revenue Service, which is the nation's domestic tax collector. The creation of a new agency requires an act of Congress, and Republicans hold the majority of both the House and the Senate. Trump, who has vowed to shrink the size of government, would be creating a new agency to perform functions already handled by existing agencies, including the Commerce Department and the Customs and Border Patrol, which collect duties and revenues from other nations. The president-elect has tapped two business titans to lead his Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental task force assigned to find ways to fire federal workers, cut programs and slash federal regulations, all part of what he calls his 'Save America' agenda for a second term in the White House. Billionaire Elon Musk and fellow entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy are leading the DOGE's ambitious efforts to reduce the size and scope of the federal government. Tariffs, with the threat of a potential 25% levy on all goods from allies like Canada and Mexico and 60% on goods from China, have become a benchmark of Trump's economic agenda as he heads into his second term. Economists have said the cost of the tariffs will be passed on to consumers, and are generally skeptical of them, considering them a mostly inefficient way for governments to raise money and promote prosperity. Democratic lawmakers were quick to criticize the External Revenue Service plan. 'No amount of silly rebranding will hide the fact that Trump is planning a multi-trillion-dollar tax hike on American families and small businesses to pay for another round of tax handouts to the rich,' Oregon Sen. Ron Wyden, the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee, said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-he-will-create-an-external-revenue-service-agency-to-collect-tariff-income/7936718.html	2025-01-14T11:01:55-08:00	
Hegseth vows a 'warrior culture' if confirmed as Trump's defense secretary	WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump's choice for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, vowed Tuesday to foster a 'warrior culture' at the Pentagon, portraying himself as a 'change agent' during a testy Senate confirmation hearing that drew protesters but also veterans in support. Hegseth did not initially address the allegations of sexual assault, excessive drinking or his derisive views on women in combat and minorities, as senators determine whether the veteran and TV news show host is fit to lead the U.S. military. Instead, he focused on his combat experience in the Army National Guard. 'It's time to give someone with dust on his boots the helm. A change agent,' Hegseth said in his opening remarks. 'This is not academic,' he declared, wearing an American flag pocket square on his suit coat. 'This is my life.' Asked directly about the sexual assault allegation, Hegseth dismissed it as a 'smear campaign' and unfair attack. But he did not specifically address any of the accusations, or tell the senators that he did not drink or womanize. Senators immediately began drilling down on the questions surrounding Hegseth, with the Republican chairman of the Armed Services Committee acknowledging the 'unconventional' choice and the top Democrat warning of 'extremely alarming' allegations against him. Senator Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, the chairman, compared Hegseth to Trump himself, dismissed the various allegations against him as unfounded and said he will 'bring energy and fresh ideas to shake up the bureaucracy.' But Senator Jack Reed, a Democrat from Rhode Island, said flatly: 'I do not believe that you are qualified to meet the overwhelming demands of this job.' Hegseth, 44, comes from a new generation of veterans from the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, and his military experience is widely viewed as an asset. But he also brings a jarring record of past actions and statements, including about women, minorities and 'woke' generals. He has vowed not to drink alcohol if he is confirmed to lead the Pentagon. Trump backed his pick, saying Hegseth has 'my Complete and Total support' in a morning post. The hearing at the Senate Armed Services Committee is the start of a weeklong marathon as senators begin scrutinizing Trump's choices for more than a dozen top administrative positions. Hegseth is among the most endangered of Trump's Cabinet choices, but GOP allies are determined to turn him into a cause célèbre for Trump's governing approach amid the nation's culture wars. Outside groups, including those aligned with the Heritage Foundation, are running costly campaigns to prop up Hegseth's bid. In the audience were cadres of men wearing clothing expressing support for veterans or service in the military, but also protesters who momentarily disrupted proceedings but were removed from the room. The Republican-led Senate is rushing to have some of Trump's picks ready to be confirmed as soon as Inauguration Day, Jan. 20, despite potential opposition to some from both sides of the aisle. With a narrow GOP majority, they need almost all Republicans to support Trump's pick if Democrats oppose. Hegseth faces perhaps the most difficult path to confirmation. He was forced to confront allegations of sexual assault, which he has denied, and his own comments that are far from the military mainstream. Pressed on his opposition to diversity initiatives in the military and women serving in combat roles, Hegseth agreed that the military 'was a forerunner in courageous racial integration.' But he argued that modern diversity and inclusion policies 'divide' current troops and don't prioritize 'meritocracy.' And Hegseth had to answer for his comments that women should 'straight up' not be in combat roles in the military, a view he has softened following recent meetings with senators. In one fiery exchange, Senator Kristen Gillibrand, a New York Democrat, told Hegseth: 'You will have to change how you see women to do this job.' Gillibrand said of Hegseth's comments: 'They are brutal, and they're mean, and they disrespect men and women' who fight for this country. Hegseth was combative at times, and scoffed as Reed asked him to explain what a 'jagoff' was. Only after further pressure from Reed did Hegseth say it was a military lawyer, a JAG officer, who 'put their own priorities in front of the warfighters.' Many senators have not yet met with Hegseth and most do not have access to his FBI background check, as only committee leaders were briefed on its findings. Reed said the background check on Hegseth was 'insufficient.' It did not probe or produce new information beyond what's already in the public realm about him, according to a person familiar with the situation who insisted on anonymity to discuss it. In many ways, the Hegseth hearing was following the template set during Trump's first term, when one of his choices for Supreme Court justice, Brett Kavanaugh, came under intense scrutiny over allegations of sexual assault but turned the tables on his critics and recouped to win confirmation to the high court. 'He will be ripped. He will be demeaned. He will be talked about,' said Senator Tommy Tuberville, a Republican from Alabama, at an event with former Navy SEALs, Army special forces and Marines supporting the nominee. 'But we're going to get him across the finish line.' Hegseth was largely unknown on Capitol Hill when Trump tapped him for the top Pentagon job. A co-host of Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends Weekend, he had been a contributor with the network since 2014 and apparently caught the eye of the president-elect, who is an avid consumer of television and the news channel, in particular. Hegseth attended Princeton University and served in the Army National Guard from 2002 to 2021, deploying to Iraq in 2005 and Afghanistan in 2011 and earning two Bronze Stars. But he lacks senior military and national security experience. In 2017, a woman told police that Hegseth sexually assaulted her, according to a detailed investigative report recently made public. Hegseth has denied any wrongdoing and told police at the time that the encounter at a Republican women's event in California was consensual. He later paid the woman a confidential settlement to head off a potential lawsuit. If confirmed, Hegseth would take over a military juggling an array of crises on the global stage and domestic challenges in military recruitment, retention and ongoing funding. Besides being a key national security adviser to the president, the defense secretary oversees a massive organization, with nearly 2.1 million service members, about 780,000 civilians and a budget of roughly $850 billion. The secretary is responsible for tens of thousands of U.S. troops deployed overseas and at sea, including in combat zones where they face attacks, such as in Syria and Iraq and in the waters around Yemen. The secretary makes all final recommendations to the president on what units are deployed, where they go and how long they stay. The secretary's main job is to make sure the U.S. military is ready, trained and equipped to meet any call to duty. But the secretary also must ensure that American troops are safe and secure at home, with proper housing, health care, pay and support for programs dealing with suicide, sexual assault and financial scams. Pentagon chiefs also routinely travel across the world, meeting with international leaders on a vast range of security issues including U.S. military aid, counterterrorism support, troop presence and global coalition building. And they play a key role at NATO as a critical partner to allies across the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hegseth-vows-a-warrior-culture-if-confirmed-as-trump-s-defense-secretary/7936614.html	2025-01-14T10:10:50-08:00	
Residents in violence-hit Pakistani district face malnutrition, depression	Islamabad — 'We are disturbed mentally. I have a son. I can’t even sleep at night. He says he will go and fight,' Laila Ibrahim of Pakistan’s Kurram tribal district tells VOA by phone. Surrounded by Afghanistan on three sides, the district in Pakistan’s northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province has been largely cut off from the country, the highway connecting it to the rest of Pakistan closed to traffic since a deadly wave of sectarian violence between Shiite and Sunni tribes erupted in mid-October. Medical staff tell VOA that Kurram’s besieged residents, facing severe shortages of food and medicine, are showing signs of malnutrition and deep mental distress. 'We saw that most of the population has gone toward malnutrition,' district health officer Dr. Qaiser Bangash, who led a survey of health conditions in the region’s hard-to-reach villages, told VOA by phone from Parachinar. 'They don’t have vegetables, fruits, lentils, clarified butter,' he said. 'They cannot find milk. There is no formula milk for children. Because of this, the situation is quite bad.' In the absence of regular food deliveries, he said, people mostly get by on boiled rice, plain wheat bread, tea without milk and sugar, and locally grown seasonal produce. Wave of violence Nearly 250 people were killed in Kurram’s sectarian violence between July and December of last year. After scores were killed over the summer and fall, Nov. 21 marked a sharp escalation, when a convoy of Shiite passengers was targeted, killing 52. No group claimed responsibility for the massacre, but retaliatory attacks saw nearly another 80 killed within a matter of days. Kurram’s violence is rooted in historic land disputes between Shiite and Sunni tribes but often takes a sectarian bent. More than a century of competing security interests coupled with militancy spilling over from wars in Afghanistan have pushed each side to heavily arm itself. The targeting of the Shiite convoy in November followed an Oct. 12 attack on Sunni residents. Supply shortages Since the deadly October attack, few trucks carrying essential supplies have entered the region from the major entry point in the south. A convoy carrying mostly fruits, vegetables, and poultry arrived Wednesday after being delayed for days over threats of violence. What arrived was expensive and partly spoiled because of the hold up. Few got their hands on the limited supplies. 'We could not buy anything. It was so busy, people were pushing each other,' Mehwish Shazad, a Parachinar-based mother of three told VOA on the phone. Villagers traveling to the city for supplies didn’t have much luck either. 'The vehicles arrived in the evening. There’s no diesel or petrol that could enable people from villages to come to the city to purchase the goods,' local journalist Hidayat Pasdar told VOA. 'By the time people arrived from the villages, locals living in the suburbs had bought everything,' said Pasdar. 'There was nothing left.' A 25-vehicle convoy carrying food supplies arrived Tuesday. Pasdar said that’s half the number of vehicles that were expected. Pharmacy shelves are almost empty. With smaller clinics unable to provide medicine, patients are increasingly turning to the district headquarters hospital in Parachinar. Bangash says the patient load has more than doubled. Although government and aid groups have delivered tranches of medicine via helicopter, the quantities, Bangash said, aren’t sufficient. 'Even with hundreds of trucks, it will be hard to cover the gap that has occurred,' said the physician. Psychological scars The violence is also causing deep psychological pain. 'Mostly there were cases of depression — anxiety, too — and phobia,' said psychologist Kalsoom Bangash. 'Children have become phobic. Those who have been displaced were worried about how they will set up everything again when they go back.' The psychologist was part of the team of medical professionals that surveyed the medical needs of local communities, providing mental health support to women and children displaced by violence. Even those not displaced by the violence are living in constant fear. 'I have noticed that when children play, they worry a bullet may come flying from somewhere,' psychologist Bangash told VOA. 'If they hear a sound, they say it’s the sound of a bullet.' Delicate peace On Jan. 1, warring Sunni and Shiite tribes reached a 14-point peace deal, after weeks of government-led negotiations. Despite a January 5 gun attack on a government convoy that injured the Kurram deputy commissioner, a tenuous peace has remained. On Monday, security forces began destroying bunkers that armed fighters from both sides have erected across the region. Rivals have also agreed to disarm. Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif expressed hope Tuesday the peace would hold. Successful implementation of the deal would mean people and goods will once again move across the district, likely under heavy security. For Ibrahim, peace means her 15-year-old son may have a future other than as a fighter. 'I want him to get a good education, but he can’t get it because the school is shut down again and again,' the mother said. 'His lessons get disturbed. I get disturbed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/residents-in-violence-hit-pakistani-district-face-malnutrition-depression/7936610.html	2025-01-14T10:07:24-08:00	
France's new prime minister announces renegotiation of contested plan to raise retirement age	PARIS — France's new prime minister, Francois Bayrou, announced Tuesday the renegotiation of a contested plan raising the retirement age from 62 to 64, in a crucial move to seek more stability for his minority government. In his first address to lawmakers at the National Assembly, Bayrou said: 'I'm choosing to put this subject back on the agenda, with the social partners, for a short time and under transparent conditions.' Bayrou vowed to seek 'a new path of reform, without any totems or taboos, not even the retirement age,' as long as the financing for the changes is guaranteed. President Emmanuel Macron's plan to raise the retirement age from 62 to 64 unleashed months of mass protests from January to June 2023 that damaged his leadership. Bayrou also outlined other top priorities, including key budget decisions, one month after he was appointed by Macron. What is Bayrou proposing? Bayrou urgently needs to pass a budget bill for 2025. Following the collapse of the previous government, an emergency law has been approved to enable the state to levy taxes from Jan. 1, pay basic expenses and avoid a shutdown. But only a proper budget would help reduce France's deficit and allow key expenses such as defense measures needed amid the war in Ukraine or aid promised to angry farmers. Financial markets, ratings agencies and the European Commission are pushing France to comply with EU rules limiting debt and keep France's borrowing costs from spiraling. That would threaten the prosperity of eurozone countries. France's deficit is estimated to reach 6% of its gross domestic product in 2024. Bayrou on Tuesday said the government was aiming for a deficit of 5.4% this year, with the goal to reduce it to 3% — in line with EU rules — by 2029. Can the government be toppled again? Bayrou's Cabinet relies on a fragile deal between Macron's centrist allies and conservatives of The Republicans party who even together have no parliamentary majority. The previous government was in place for only three months before being brought down by opposition lawmakers from both the left and the far right amid a budget dispute. To avoid a repetition of that scenario, Bayrou seeks to secure a nonaggression pact with the Socialists so that they wouldn't support any future move to topple the new government. The Socialists said they are open to talks on the condition that they would include negotiations on the pension reform. However, the possibility of another no-confidence vote is still looming. The hard-left France Unbowed party refused to enter into talks with the government and already announced it would file a no-confidence motion. A vote later this week would have little chance of succeeding as the far right appears unwilling to support such a move in the immediate term. Yet the question could be raised again during the future budget debate at parliament, with more uncertainty on the result. Why are pension reform talks key? The pension reform, which was enacted into law in April 2023 despite mass protests, has gradually started being implemented. It also requires people to work 43 years to receive a full pension. The Socialists urged Bayrou to announce a 'suspension' of the reform with the aim of backtracking on the age of 64 and introducing specific measures for those who have long careers and certain professions considered to be hard work. Bayrou on Tuesday stopped short of announcing such a move, yet his proposal to renegotiate it appears as a hand stretched out towards the left. He suggested the age of 64, which was the most criticized change, could possibly be decreased depending on the outcome of the negotiations. 'We cannot deteriorate the financial balance' of the pension system, Bayrou insisted. On the other side of the political spectrum, the conservatives had warned against any suspension of the pension changes. 'If we were to repeal the pension reform, the cost would be 3.4 billion euros ($3.47 billion) in 2025 and almost 16 billion ($16.3 billion) in 2032,' said the president of the Senate, Gerard Larcher, a conservative. Does the far right still have leverage? Far-right leader Marine Le Pen — Macron's fiercest rival — was instrumental in ousting the previous government. Bayrou consulted her when forming the new government, and Le Pen remains a powerful force. Her National Rally party has the largest single group in the National Assembly, France's powerful lower house of parliament. In recent days, Bayrou's government sought to sideline Le Pen by negotiating instead with the Socialists, the Greens and the Communists on budget issues. The president of the National Rally, Jordan Bardella, criticized those talks and warned Monday that his party would oppose any budget that would raise the cost of medication, provide more health care for migrants staying illegally in the country and impose new taxes on businesses. Such measures would justify a no-confidence vote, he said. But Le Pen faces her own headaches in the months to come — a March court ruling over alleged illegal party financing could see her barred from running for office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-new-prime-minister-announces-renegotiation-of-contested-plan-to-raise-retirement-age/7936437.html	2025-01-14T08:04:00-08:00

World Economic Forum says Trump to take part virtually in Davos meeting, days after inauguration	GENEVA — U.S. President Donald Trump will take part virtually in the World Economic Forum's annual meeting in Davos just days after his inauguration, the forum president said Tuesday. Borge Brende, a former Norwegian foreign minister who heads the Geneva-based organization, noted that Trump had twice attended the elite gathering of business, government and other leaders in person during his first term. 'On Thursday afternoon, he will join us digitally, online, live in a dialogue with our participants,' Brende told reporters Tuesday as he presented the five-day program that will start Monday — the day of Trump's inauguration. 'We think that will be a very special moment,' he added, notably to help learn the administration's 'policy priorities.' Brende said he didn't know whether Elon Musk, the multibillionaire who is poised to co-lead Trump's new Department of Government Efficiency, would attend, but said the forum expects 'additional, high-level representation' from the administration once confirmation processes for Trump's nominees get underway in the U.S. Senate as early as Monday. Forum organizers say a record of around 900 business leaders, including from important emerging markets, will take part in the annual meeting this year, which is expected to draw nearly 3,000 participants from over 130 countries. With climate change, war, global tensions, economic uncertainty and other issues in mind, Brende acknowledged that the 55th annual meeting of the forum will take place 'against the most complicated geopolitical backdrop in generations.' 'But still in that fragmented and partly polarized world, there are still areas where we can collaborate and ... we have big opportunities and responsibilities to find those areas where there is a possibility to improve the state of the world,' he said. The theme of this year's edition is 'Collaboration for the Intelligent Age' — a nod to the growing importance of technology in the world. The WEF has long been derided as a gathering of world elites who plot the future at a cushy, snow-bound powwow in the Swiss Alps. Critics often argue the developing world gets less attention than global powers and big business in the West or Gulf states. Forum managing director Mirek Dusek insisted that the number of businesses from developing countries in the 'Global South' was growing, and the attendance of their leaders was 'on parity' with the participation of leaders in the developed world. Ursula Von Der Leyen, president of the European Union's executive commission, plans to attend the opening day of meetings on Tuesday, after an introductory gala the night before. Other top envoys include President Javier Milei of Argentina, President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa, and Chinese Vice-Premier Ding Xuexiang. The vast array of topics will include the future of Syria — its new foreign minister is expected to attend — after the fall of President Bashar al-Assad last month; the fight against climate change; the threats and promise of artificial intelligence; global trade and economic growth; and wars in places like Ukraine, Sudan and beyond. 'We are ready to roll up our sleeves to make the best out of a situation where we are faced with many, many challenges,' Brende said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-economic-forum-says-trump-to-take-part-virtually-in-davos-meeting-days-after-inauguration-/7936369.html	2025-01-14T07:11:00-08:00

Chinese actor’s abduction to Myanmar sign of growing diversity of scams	Bangkok — The recent abduction of a Chinese TV actor to Myanmar and his subsequent release is shedding new light on the lengths to which human traffickers operating online scam centers in the war-torn country will go to in order to lure would-be victims. Chinese actor Wang Xing went missing on January 3, in Mae Sot, a city in northern Thailand, which borders Myanmar. Two days later his family reported him missing, and with growing cries on social media, the case prompted Thai and Chinese authorities to act. Last week, on January 7, Thai authorities say they found Wang in Myanmar and brought him back to Thailand. Thai police said Wang was trafficked across the Thai-Myanmar border and held captive at KK Park in Myawaddy, which is notorious for its illegal scam operations. According to local media reports, Wang was lured to Thailand under the false pretense of a film audition. He received the job offer via social media platform WeChat. Wang flew to Bangkok and was transported to Myanmar. Wang’s head was shaved. He was held captive and forced into training on how to perform online scams, according to media reports. He said there were 50 other Chinese nationals in similar circumstances. After his rescue and return to Thailand, Wang, 31, flew to Shanghai on Friday. Wang’s rescue has prompted others to speak out and according to state media in China, the families of some 174 individuals have been circulating a joint letter on Chinese social media asking for help. According to the letter, family members say their loved ones are trapped in northern and eastern Myanmar. Experts say Wang’s case highlights the growing sophistication of the masterminds of scam operations. 'This is a very deliberate form of kidnapping, of hostage taking, that you’re seeing these scam syndicates now go about. The means of trafficking people into these compounds is increasingly changing,' Jason Tower, the Myanmar country director at the United States Institute of Peace (USIP), told VOA. 'This shows how these criminal actors are adapting and going to greater lengths to lure people of a wide range of demographics into captivity, to either suck funds out of them directly or get them involved in forced labor criminality,' he said. At least one other Chinese national, Wu Jiaqi, 21, was also rescued from captivity in Myanmar in recent days, local media report. The targeting of Chinese citizens by criminal gangs in Southeast Asia has become a growing problem in recent years. Chen, a Chinese national who withheld his full name for security concerns, toldRadio Free Asia in 2023 that he was a trafficking victim in a scam compound in Myanmar, and that there were at least 1,000 Chinese nationals also trapped, with scam bosses demanding $30,000 per individual for their release. Many illegal scam centers in Southeast Asia are linked with Chinese criminal networks operating in the region, experts say. Individuals from all over the world are lured into false business opportunities and forced into scam compounds. A report in June by the United States Institute of Peace revealed that scam centers operating in Southeast Asia countries, including Laos, Cambodia and Myanmar have swindled billions of dollars. All three countries share borders with Thailand. 'This is becoming a greater and greater problem. These Chinese criminal syndicates are quite deeply embedded in all of Thailand’s neighboring countries, but they are in Thailand as well,' Tower added. Nikorndej Balankura, spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Thailand, said last week that combatting cross-border crimes is a national priority. 'Thailand has consistently emphasized the importance of regular cooperation to promote border peace and security and combat cross-border crimes, including illegal drug trafficking, human trafficking, cybercrime, telecom and online fraud. The Thai government attaches great importance to combatting cross-border crimes and considers it a national priority,' he told local media. But Thitinan Pongsudhirak, a Thai political scientist, told VOA that the fight against transnational crime needs more support from Thai law enforcement and officials. 'Thailand is the vortex and nexus of scam centers and other transnational crimes. It is also a country with endemic corruption and decayed institutions, particularly the police force,' he said. Scammers are a big problem for China and telecom fraud has been a persistent concern in recent years with Beijing passing a telecom and online fraud law in December 2022. Chinese authorities have increased public information campaigns and even tried to use draconian tactics to deter its citizens from visiting Southeast Asia, Tower said. 'In 2022, a narrative started to emerge that going to Thailand could result in getting trafficked into Myanmar and losing your kidneys,' he said. 'Later on, you started to see that the police will make phone calls to people when they book tickets to ask them what they're doing in Southeast Asia.' The Chinese language movie 'No More Bets,' released in August 2023, depicts Chinese tourists visiting an unnamed Southeast Asian country, only to be trafficked into a scam compound and forced into labor. Benedikt Hofmann, the deputy representative Southeast Asia and the Pacific for the U.N. Office for Drugs and Crime, said that despite warnings, individuals are still being fooled. 'We are still seeing a lot of this despite the massive efforts that have gone into raising awareness of the risks — things like the movie 'No More Bets' really brought a lot attention to this — which really shows how effective these groups are in creating incentives for young people to go there,' Hoffman said. Chinese tourism in Thailand could also be affected. Chinese nationals are the biggest visitors to Thailand, with more than 6 million arrivals in 2024. But reports in Hong Kong say many tourists from China are cancelling their trips ahead of the Lunar New Year celebrations which begin on January 27. Thailand’s tourism bureau has attempted to reassure Chinese visitors, publishing a press release in Mandarin on January 10, stating that Thailand 'attaches great importance to the safety of tourists.' On Sunday, Thai and Chinese authorities held a high-level meeting to discuss strengthening cooperation in combatting transnational crime and human trafficking. VOA reached out to the Chinese Embassy in Bangkok for comment on the case and growing concerns but did not receive a response. Vincent Vichit-Vadakan, a Bangkok-based travel analyst, said he doesn’t believe the recent cases will have a long-term impact on Thailand as a tourist destination. 'Hopefully these high-profile cases will prompt Thai and Chinese authorities to find more effective ways to prevent criminals from using Thailand as a hub for their activities,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-actor-s-abduction-to-myanmar-sign-of-growing-diversity-of-scams-/7936112.html	2025-01-14T04:44:37-08:00	
Washington braces for Trump inauguration with fortress-like fencing, extra police	WASHINGTON — With 48 km of tall black temporary fencing, 25,000 law enforcement officers and security checkpoints set up to process hundreds of thousands of spectators, Washington is braced for President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration next week. The Monday swearing-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol and parade to the White House will follow a weekend featuring protests by Trump's opponents and parties and rallies by the Republican's supporters. The inauguration follows a campaign marked by two attempts on Trump's life — including one from a would-be assassin who nicked his ear with a bullet — and a pair of New Year's Day attacks on ordinary Americans. In one, 14 people were killed and dozens injured when a U.S. Army veteran rammed a truck into a crowd of New Year's Eve revelers in New Orleans. The same day, an active-duty U.S. Army soldier detonated a Tesla Cybertruck outside a Trump-branded hotel in Las Vegas, killing himself. 'We are in a higher-threat environment,' said U.S. Secret Service Special Agent in Charge Matt McCool at a Monday press briefing. The inauguration itself, when Trump formally takes the oath of office with members of Congress, the Supreme Court, his incoming administration and tens of thousands of others looking on, will take place on the Capitol steps, facing the Washington Monument. That is the same spot where, on Jan. 6, 2021, thousands of Trump supporters smashed windows, fought with police and sent lawmakers running for their lives in an attempt to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democratic President Joe Biden. Trump's 2024 election rival, Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, conceded her defeat in the Nov. 5 contest, unlike Trump who continues to falsely maintain that his loss was the result of fraud. Fear of lone wolf Security officials said they were not aware of any specific, coordinated threats to the inauguration. What they are worried about is lone wolves, such as the New Orleans attacker, or two separate incidents last week. In one, a man was arrested for trying to bring a machete into the Capitol. In the other, a man was arrested for trying to ignite a fire near the Capitol, according to U.S. Capitol Police. 'That threat of the lone actor remains the biggest justification for us being at this heightened state of alert throughout the next week,' U.S. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger told the security briefing. The FBI and Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned police nationwide of the risk of copycat attacks similar to the New Orleans incident. A large chunk of downtown Washington — stretching about 3 km from the White House to the Capitol — will be closed to vehicular traffic, with entry points blocked with concrete barriers, garbage trucks and other heavy items. The 48 km of 2-meters-tall black fencing, designed to be unclimbable, will be the longest ever erected in Washington, officials said. Some 7,800 National Guard troops and 4,000 officers brought in from other police departments around the country will reinforce security. While some residents of the city, where 90% of voters cast ballots for Harris over Trump, were readying to leave for the holiday weekend or hunker down at home to avoid the gridlock, tens of thousands of people were expected to descend upon the city for celebrations and protests. About 70% of Washington's 34,500 hotel rooms were booked for the night of the inauguration and the night before as of last week, according to data from Smith Travel Research and shared with Reuters by Destination DC, Washington’s official tourism organization. Hotel occupancy was at about 95% for Trump's 2017 inauguration, and about 78% for former President Barack Obama’s second inauguration in 2013. Marches and rallies Trump's 2017 inauguration was marked by massive protests and counter-protests. His former spokesman, Sean Spicer, famously began his tenure by claiming — contrary to photographic evidence — that the crowd on the grassy National Mall was 'the largest audience ever to witness an inauguration — period.' The Women's March the following day drew hundreds of thousands of people onto the streets of Washington — and even more in pop-up solidarity events that took place around the country. A far smaller crowd of 25,000 people is expected to take part in the anti-Trump People's March on DC on Saturday, Metropolitan Police Chief Pamela Smith said on Monday. Thousands are expected to show up for nearly a dozen other protests or rallies that local officials have permitted between Saturday and Monday, including a Trump rally at the 20,000-seat Capital One Arena on Sunday. Juliette Kayyem, a professor at Harvard Kennedy School who served as a homeland security official during the Obama administration, said officials appeared to follow standard practice in planning for all possibilities. 'What you're planning for is a worst-case scenario, but my suspicion is you're not going to get it, which is good,' Kayyem said. 'In terms of planning, it's always easier to ratchet down than ratchet up.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/washington-braces-for-trump-inauguration-with-fortress-like-fencing-extra-police-/7936074.html	2025-01-14T03:59:39-08:00	
UN: More than one million people internally displaced in Haiti	Geneva — The number of people in Haiti who have fled their homes due to gang violence has risen threefold in the last year to over one million, the UN said on Tuesday. The United Nations' International Organization for Migration said its latest data 'reveals that 1,041,000 people, many displaced multiple times, are struggling amidst an intensifying humanitarian crisis.' 'In December 2023, we (recorded) around 315,000 people were displaced from the violence,' IOM spokesman Kennedy Okoth Omondi told reporters. 'One year since then, we have seen the number tripled to over a million people who have now been displaced because of gang violence in Haiti.' In the capital, Port-au-Prince, the IOM said displacement had risen by 87 percent 'fueled by relentless gang violence, the collapse of essential services — particularly healthcare — and worsening food insecurity.' The poor Caribbean country has been mired for decades by political instability, made worse in recent years by gangs that have grown in strength. Despite a Kenyan-led police support mission, backed by the United States and the UN, violence has continued to burgeon. Last week, the UN rights office said soaring gang violence in Haiti had left more than 5,600 people dead last year and thousands more injured or kidnapped. 'Haiti needs sustained humanitarian assistance right now to save and protect lives,' IOM director general Amy Pope said. 'We must work together to address the root causes of the violence and instability that has led to so much death and destruction.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-more-than-one-million-people-internally-displaced-in-haiti/7936052.html	2025-01-14T03:19:49-08:00	
UK's antitrust regulator to investigate Google's search services	LONDON — Britain's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it would investigate Google's search services using its new powers to see how they impact consumers and businesses, including advertisers, news publishers and rival search engines. The Competition and Markets Authority, which has gained new powers to examine big tech, said search was vital for economic growth and it was critical that competition was working well. 'Millions of people and businesses relied on Google's search and advertising services - with 90% of searches happening on their platform and more than 200,000 UK businesses advertising there,' CMA boss Sarah Cardell said in a statement. 'It's our job to ensure people get the full benefit of choice and innovation in search services and get a fair deal.' The CMA's move comes after U.S. prosecutors in November argued to a judge that Google must sell its Chrome browser, share data, and search results with rivals, and take a range of other measures to end its monopoly on online search. Google did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-antitrust-regulator-to-investigate-google-s-search-services/7936036.html	2025-01-14T02:53:11-08:00	
Baltic Sea nations seek to limit further incidents after cable breaches	HELSINKI — European nations must be prepared to face further incidents in the Baltic Sea following the recent damage to undersea infrastructure, leaders of NATO countries in the region said on Tuesday ahead of a security meeting in Helsinki. Baltic Sea nations are on high alert after a string of power cable, telecom link and gas pipeline outages in the wake of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, and are discussing an increased NATO presence. Some 2,000 ships are crossing the Baltic Sea every day, making it difficult to monitor it all, Latvian President Edgars Rinkevics said. 'Let's face it, we can't ensure 100% protection but if we are sending a bold signal then I think that such incidents are going to decrease or even to stop,' Rinkevics told reporters. Finnish police last month seized a tanker carrying Russian oil and said they suspected the vessel had damaged the Finnish-Estonian Estlink 2 power line and four telecoms cables by dragging its anchor across the seabed. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said on Tuesday that this and other recent incidents in the Baltic Sea must be assumed to be part of a hybrid strategy that is threatening European countries. 'It is important that we come together here now and talk about how we can work together to ensure greater security in the Baltic Sea region,' Scholz said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/baltic-sea-nations-seek-to-limit-further-incidents-after-cable-breaches/7936014.html	2025-01-14T01:51:28-08:00	
Negotiators to try to finalize Gaza ceasefire deal	Mediators were set to meet Tuesday in Qatar to try to finalize a proposed ceasefire between Israel and Hamas. The talks come after 15 months of fighting and what people familiar with the negotiations said was a breakthrough this week in the effort to bring an end to the war in Gaza. U.S. President Joe Biden said Monday that the deal was on 'the brink' of 'finally coming to fruition.' In a speech at the State Department to highlight his foreign policy achievements, Biden said the deal would 'free the hostages, halt the fighting, provide security to Israel and allow us to significantly surge humanitarian assistance to the Palestinians who suffered terribly in this war that Hamas started.' The basic parameters of the ceasefire proposal would see the process play out in several stages. Hamas would release hostages it has been holding since the militants carried out their October 2023 attack on Israel, while Israeli authorities would release Palestinian prisoners. Israeli troops would carry out a phased withdrawal from Gaza, and some Palestinians displaced by the conflict would be allowed to return along with a surge in aid for Palestinian civilians. Months of negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have failed to bring a halt to the fighting, but in recent weeks, the effort has gained momentum at a time when the U.S. is preparing to go through a change in its leadership. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told MSNBC on Monday that the sides were 'closer than we've ever been' to a deal, and said the ball was in Hamas' court. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan said Monday that Biden administration officials were keeping President-elect Donald Trump’s Mideast advisers abreast of the negotiations. Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, has been involved in the latest round of talks. Israel launched its assault on Hamas in Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed across its borders on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 46,500 people have been killed in Gaza, with most of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, although Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants it has killed. Much of Gaza, a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea, has been laid to waste during the fighting and gripped by a humanitarian crisis, with most of its 2.3 million population displaced, often multiple times. White House bureau chief Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report. Some material came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/negotiators-to-try-to-finalize-gaza-ceasefire-deal/7936002.html	2025-01-14T00:59:58-08:00	
German defense minister visits Ukraine in show of support	German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius visited Ukraine on Tuesday in a show of support for the country in its fight against the Russian invasion that began nearly three years ago. German officials said the visit was aimed at reassuring Ukraine it will continue to receive support, with Pistorius to meet with top Ukrainian officials. The visit comes less than a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration and the questions about how U.S. policy toward Ukraine might change under the new administration. Officials in multiple Russian regions said Tuesday their areas came under major Ukrainian drone attacks, including in Saratov, where Governor Roman Busargin said there was damage at two industrial enterprises in the neighboring cities of Saratov and Engels. That area is home to a base for Russian bomber planes. Last week, a Ukrainian attack hit an oil depot that serves the base. Oryol Governor Andrei Klychkov said on Telegram that Russian air defenses shot down 17 Ukrainian drones in his region. He reported no damage or casualties from the attacks. Rostov Governor Yury Slyusar said on Telegram 14 drones were destroyed overnight, while officials in Voronezh said several Ukrainian drones were shot down without causing damage. Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it destroyed 58 of 80 drones that Russian forces used to target 11 different regions. The Ukrainian air force reported damage to apartment buildings, commercial buildings and cars in the Cherkasy, Kharkiv, Kyiv, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions as a result of falling debris from downed drones. Ukrainian air defenses also destroyed Russian drones over the Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa and Poltava regions, the Ukrainian air force said.

153 winners of Nobel and World Food prizes seek new ways to grow food	DES MOINES, Iowa — More than 150 recipients of the Nobel and World Food prizes released an open letter Tuesday calling for a dramatic increase in research and a commitment to new food distribution efforts with a goal of producing more crops and avoiding a global hunger crisis in coming decades. The letter notes that an estimated 700 million people now are 'food insecure and desperately poor' but that without a 'moonshot' effort to grow more and different kinds of food, far more people will be in dire need of food because of climate change and population growth. 'As difficult and as uncomfortable as it might be to imagine, humanity is headed towards an even more food insecure, unstable world by mid-century than exists today, worsened by a vicious cycle of conflict and food insecurity,' states the letter, signed by 153 recipients of the two prizes. 'Climate change is projected to decrease the productivity of most major staples when substantial increases are needed to feed a world which will add another 1.5 billion people to its population by 2050.' Corn production in Africa is expected to decline and much of the world could see more soil degradation and water shortages, the letter says. 'We are not on track to meet future food needs. Not even close,' it adds. The letter grew from a meeting of food accessibility experts last fall. Despite the potential gloom, it holds out hope for an optimistic vision of the future if people take needed actions. The letter says that a dramatic increase in research funding coupled with more effective ways to share information and distribute food could prevent a hunger crisis. Brian Schmidt, who won the Nobel Prize in physics in 2011, said the need to dramatically increase food production in the coming decades is a huge challenge. He calls it a 'destination with destiny,' but one that can be achieved with proper funding to enhance existing knowledge as well as global leadership. 'It is an imminently solvable problem. It is a problem that will affect billions of people in 25 years. It is a problem that to solve it, there are no losers, only winners,' Schmidt said in an interview. 'All we have to do is do it.' Schmidt said he hopes governments in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere can commit to solving the problem, but he thinks private groups like the Gates Foundation may need to take the lead in funding initial steps that will draw attention and prompt action by politicians. The letter calls for 'transformational efforts' such as enhancing photosynthesis in essential crops such as wheat and rice, developing crops that are not as reliant on chemical fertilizers and lengthening the shelf life of fruits and vegetables. Cynthia Rosenzweig, a climate research scientist at NASA who won the World Food Prize in 2022, said in an interview that researchers are already making progress toward breakthroughs, but their work needs to be turbocharged with more funding and emphasis from world leaders. 'It's not that we have to dream up new solutions,' Rosenzweig said. 'The solutions are very much being tested but in order to actually take them from the lab out into the agriculture regions of the world, we really do need the moonshot approach.' The term moonshot refers to an unprecedented effort, stemming from President John F. Kennedy's call in 1962 for Americans to rocket to the Moon. Rosenzweig, noting she works for NASA, said meeting the food needs of a growing population will take the kind of commitment the U.S. made in achieving Kennedy's goal of reaching the Moon. 'Look at how the scientists had to come together. The engineers had to be part of it. The funding had to come together as well as the general public,' she said. 'That base of support has to be there as well.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/winners-of-nobel-and-world-food-prizes-seek-new-ways-to-grow-food/7935994.html	2025-01-14T00:24:02-08:00	
Malaysia eyes greater sustainability in palm oil sector as EU law looms	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — Malaysia said on Tuesday it will encourage sustainability while maintaining the competitiveness of its palm oil industry ahead of the implementation of the European Union's anti-deforestation law at the end of this year. The EU last month approved a one-year delay to the landmark deforestation law, which bans the importation of palm oil, soy and other goods linked to the destruction of forests. The bill now takes effect from Dec. 30 this year. The law requires companies and traders selling soy, beef, coffee, palm oil and other products in the EU to provide proof their supply chains do not contribute to deforestation. Malaysia and Indonesia, the world's largest exporters of palm oil, have previously complained that the law and implementation rules are discriminatory. Malaysia's Deputy Plantation and Commodities Minister Chan Foong Hin said it was crucial for the country's palm oil industry to understand the impact of the EU law so that domestic practices could be adapted and market access maintained. 'By aligning our operations with these standards, we bolster our market position and enhance competitiveness,' Chan told an industry conference on Tuesday. Chan said the success of Malaysia's palm oil industry depended on the adoption of green initiatives, including advanced agriculture technologies, sustainable farming, and new production methods, to help protect the environment while creating new growth opportunities. Speaking at the same conference, Malaysian Palm Oil Board director-general Ahmad Parveez Ghulam Kadir said authorities would work with the local industry. 'We are looking forward to a better outlook in 2025,' Ahmad Parveez said. 'The ministry and agencies will continuously collaborate closely to address environmental concerns while also promoting economic stability and social responsibility within the industry to foster a more sustainable and balanced future.' He said Malaysian palm oil stocks are expected to fall to around 1.6 million metric tons this year, compared with 1.71 million tons in 2024. Production in the world's second-largest producer in 2025 should come in at 19.5 million tons, marginally higher than the 19.34 million tons in 2024. Palm oil exports are expected to be 17.3 million tons in 2025, up from 16.9 million tons in 2024, Ahmad Parveez added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-eyes-greater-sustainability-in-palm-oil-sector-as-eu-law-looms/7935981.html	2025-01-13T23:53:46-08:00	
Sydney closes nine beaches due to mysterious ball-shaped debris	SYDNEY — Nine beaches in Sydney, including well-known Manly beach, were closed to bathers on Tuesday after small white and gray balls of debris washed up on the shores at the height of the summer holiday season. Northern Beaches Council said it was working on safely removing the matter. Most of the samples of the ball-shaped debris were the size of marbles, with some larger, it said in a statement. Sydney's ocean beaches, famed for golden sand and clean water, draw tourists from around the globe. Beachgoers were advised to avoid Manly, Dee Why, Long Reef, Queenscliff, Freshwater, North and South Curl Curl, North Steyne and North Narrabeen beaches until further notice and keep away from the material while the clean-up and investigations continued. Authorities said they were working closely with the state's environmental agency to collect samples of the debris for testing. Last October, several beaches including the iconic Bondi beach east of downtown Sydney, were shut after thousands of black balls appeared on the shores. An inquiry later found that those balls were formed from fatty acids, chemicals similar to those in cosmetics and cleaning products, as well as hair, food waste and other materials associated with wastewater.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sydney-closes-nine-beaches-due-to-mysterious-ball-shaped-debris/7935971.html	2025-01-13T23:16:47-08:00	
US special counsel report says prosecutors had enough evidence to convict Trump in 2020 election case	In a report to Congress released early Tuesday, special counsel Jack Smith said his office had sufficient evidence to 'obtain and sustain' a trial conviction of President-elect Donald Trump for efforts to overturn Trump’s loss to President Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Smith said Trump 'resorted to a series of criminal efforts to retain power' after it became clear that he had lost and that legal ways to challenge the results had failed. 'This included attempts to induce state officials to ignore true vote counts; to manufacture fraudulent slates of presidential electors in seven states that he had lost; to force Justice Department officials and his own Vice President, Michael R. Pence, to act in contravention of their oaths and to instead advance Mr. Trump's personal interests; and, on January 6 , 2021, to direct an angry mob to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification of the presidential election and then leverage rioters,' Smith said in his report. Smith said Trump acted both in his private capacity as an election candidate, as well as with the help of multiple co-conspirators, and that Trump tried to use 'the power and authority of the United States Government in furtherance of his scheme.' The report further says that Trump’s false claims, such as votes being cast by large numbers of dead people or ineligible voters, or that voting machines had changed votes for Trump into votes for Biden, were 'demonstrably and, in many cases, obviously false.' Trump has repeatedly denied wrongdoing and attacked the special counsel’s work as politically motivated. He responded to the report’s release early Tuesday with a post on his Truth Social platform calling Smith 'a lamebrain prosecutor.' 'Deranged Jack Smith was unable to successfully prosecute the Political Opponent of his ‘boss,’ Crooked Joe Biden, so he ends up writing yet another ‘Report’ based on information that the Unselect Committee of Political Hacks and Thugs ILLEGALLY DESTROYED AND DELETED, because it showed how totally innocent I was, and how completely guilty Nancy Pelosi, and others, were,' Trump said. Trump is set to be inaugurated for a new term next week after defeating Vice President Kamala Harris in the 2024 election. During the 2024 campaign, Trump denied he lost the 2020 vote, including in a September debate with Harris. Tuesday’s report release came a day after U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon cleared the Justice Department to make public the portion of Smith’s report that dealt with Trump’s efforts to cling to power. Judge Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, had earlier blocked the release of Smith’s full report, which also includes an unreleased section about accusations that Trump illegally retained classified documents after he left office. Smith sought to prosecute Trump on both matters, while Trump denied wrongdoing. Judge Cannon dismissed the classified documents case in July, ruling that Smith was illegally appointed. The Supreme Court also ruled in July that presidents have broad immunity from prosecution for official acts, which blunted Smith’s efforts in the election interference case. After Trump defeated Harris, the Justice Department dropped both cases against Trump, citing longstanding policy against prosecuting a sitting U.S. leader.

Impeachment trial of South Korea's Yoon adjourned after he does not attend	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's Constitutional Court adjourned the opening session of the impeachment trial of suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol within minutes on Tuesday after the embattled leader did not attend court. A lawyer advising Yoon had said the president, who has been holed up in his hillside villa in Seoul for weeks, would not attend, saying a bid by authorities to detain him prevented Yoon from expressing his position at the trial. The next trial session is scheduled for Thursday and if Yoon also decides not to attend the trial, proceedings will start with his legal team representing him. Outside the court, one of Yoon's lawyers, Yoon Kab-keun, said the president would decide whether to go to the court in person on Thursday after discussions on his defense strategy. The Constitutional Court must decide within 180 days whether to remove Yoon from office or restore his presidential powers. Yoon also faces a criminal investigation for alleged insurrection, with authorities seeking to execute an arrest warrant after he ignored summons to appear for questioning. His lawyer repeated on Tuesday that the arrest warrant of investigating authorities was invalid, and said Yoon will respond to a valid detention warrant that is executed legally. Yoon's declaration of martial law on Dec. 3 that was withdrawn after about six hours has plunged one of Asia's most vibrant democracies into a period of unprecedented political turbulence. Yoon's chief of staff said on Tuesday that Yoon's office was ready to consult with investigating authorities in order to avoid a clash during the execution of the arrest warrant against Yoon. Yoon could go to a third location outside of his fortified residence, or a visit to his home could be arranged so that investigating authorities could question Yoon, presidential chief of staff Chung Jin-suk said Tuesday in a statement. Investigating authorities, including the Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), and the police, have received a re-issued arrest warrant from a South Korean court after their first attempt to detain Yoon for questioning failed after a stand-off with presidential security officers earlier this month. CIO, the police and Presidential Security Service (PSS) met on Tuesday to discuss the execution of the latest arrest warrant, investigating authorities said in a statement. At the meeting, police and CIO asked the PSS for cooperation in executing the warrant peacefully and safely, and were awaiting a response. The defense ministry said on Tuesday that military forces in charge of presidential security would not be mobilized in relation to Yoon's warrant execution. Amid South Korea's political chaos, North Korea launched several short-range ballistic missiles on Tuesday, coinciding with a visit to Seoul by Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya, and less than a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office. South Korean lawmakers, after being briefed by the National Intelligence Service, said on Monday that the North's recent weapons tests were partly aimed at 'showing off its U.S. deterrent assets and drawing Trump's attention.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/impeachment-trial-of-south-korea-s-yoon-adjourned-after-he-does-not-attend/7935965.html	2025-01-13T22:26:09-08:00	
Thailand's Thaksin bullish on legalizing online gambling, crypto	Thailand's political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra believes Southeast Asia's second-largest economy should push to legalize online gambling, which he said could net the government as much as 100 billion baht, or $2.89 billion, in annual revenues. Although without a formal role in government, the former prime minister, 75, is one of the most influential figures in Thai politics and is widely seen as a key power center behind the premiership of his 38-year-old daughter, Paetongtarn Shinawatra. Speaking at an event in Bangkok late on Monday, just hours after the Thai cabinet approved a draft law to legalize casinos, Thaksin said the government was coming up with ways to control access to, and tax revenue from, online gambling. 'Online gambling has 2 to 4 million Thai users with savings of 300 billion baht and gains and losses of about 500 billion per year,' said Thaksin. 'If we can tax 20% ... we would get more than 100 billion per year,' he said. While most forms of gambling are illegal in Thailand, it is hugely popular and successive governments led or backed by Thaksin have pushed to legalize it to create jobs and boost tourism, arguing huge sums of money are being lost that can be turned into state revenue. The government was working on an identification system to control access to online gaming that would prevent underage use and allow the monitoring of gambling addicts, Thaksin said. 'We would have like a passport to control who can play,' he said, without elaborating. Thaksin also made a push for Thailand's financial institutions to be more open to cryptocurrency, citing incoming U.S. President Donald Trump's pro-crypto stance, including his appointment of crypto deregulation advocate Paul Atkins as the head of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. He said the Thai's SEC needs to have more digital approach, like 'allowing trade of stablecoin, or coin that are backed by assets.' The Thai government is already looking to allow using crypto as a form of payment, with the resort island of Phuket a possible site for a pilot, he said. 'There will be no risk, it is just another currency in the world,' Thaksin said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thailand-s-thaksin-bullish-on-legalizing-online-gambling-crypto/7935955.html	2025-01-13T21:56:42-08:00	
Release of US special counsel’s report could bring new insight into Trump’s 2020 efforts to cling to power	The public could learn as early as Tuesday new details about U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to President Joe Biden. A federal judge has cleared the U.S. Department of Justice to release special counsel Jack Smith’s report about Trump’s efforts to cling to power as he falsely claimed he won the election and a mob of his supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who was appointed by Trump, had earlier blocked the release of Smith’s full report, which also includes a section about accusations that Trump illegally retained classified documents after he left office.

California firefighters ‘better prepared’ amid wind-fueled extreme fire threat	California firefighters backed by fresh reinforcements of manpower and equipment prepared for the potential of new or worsening wildfires in southern California on Tuesday amid warnings of high winds and dry conditions. The National Weather Service said wind gusts Tuesday could exceed 100 kph, putting large areas of southern California under extreme fire danger warnings. Los Angeles County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Monday that firefighters were 'absolutely better prepared' than when a series of wildfires rapidly emerged last week, but that the wind gusts could force authorities to ground the aircraft critical to the firefighting effort. Such restrictions were in place for part of last week as four major fires burned. Together, those blazes have scorched more than 160 square kilometers. Firefighters have brought one fire fully under control, while another north of Los Angeles was 97% percent contained. Danger remained from the two largest fires, including the Palisades Fire on the western side of Los Angeles that has burned 96 square kilometers and was 14% contained as of late Monday, according to the California Department of Foresty and Fire Protection (Cal Fire). The other major fire was the Eaton Fire in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains on the east side of the city. That fire was 33% contained and has burned 57 square kilometers, Cal Fire said. The fires have killed at least 24 people, while authorities continue to search for dozens of people who have been reported missing. About 100,000 people in the region remained under evacuation orders. U.S. President Joe Biden pledged additional federal support on Monday and said during a briefing at the White House, 'We’re going to keep doing everything possible to help you get through this.' 'It was a heartbreaking weekend for a lot of people in Los Angeles,' Biden said. 'Ash was raining down like snow, homes burned to the ground. Thousands of those homes are gone. And we learned we lost more of our fellow Americans. So, let’s say again to the people of Los Angeles, we’re with you.' The president also praised the work of emergency responders. 'Los Angeles is the City of Angels, and you’re now the angels,' Biden said. 'You’re the angels literally saving people’s lives, and we owe you.' Biden said the federal government was providing aid to help with overtime pay for firefighters, debris removal and temporary shelters. He said the region will need tens of billions of dollars to recover and called on Congress to 'step up' and provide funding. Some Republican leaders in Congress have suggested federal aid only be given with conditions, as they criticized California leaders for what they allege is mismanaging water and forest resources. California Governor Gavin Newsom has said in recent days that the state has increased its firefighter force and forest management efforts since he took office in 2019. On Monday, a lawsuit filed against Southern California Edison claims the utility’s equipment sparked the deadly Eaton Fire that began Jan. 7. Edison acknowledged that fire agencies are investigating whether its equipment may have started a smaller fire in the area that also occurred Jan. 7. Authorities have not yet determined an official cause for the fire. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power also was sued on Monday. The suit claims that the utility failed to properly manage water supplies critical to fighting the deadly Palisades Fire, which has killed at least eight people and destroyed thousands of structures, according to the court filing. Some information was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-firefighters-better-prepared-amid-wind-fueled-extreme-fire-threat/7935943.html	2025-01-13T21:25:05-08:00	
Jeff Bezos' space company tries to launch rocket after last-minute postponement	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. — Blue Origin will try again to launch its massive new rocket as early as Tuesday after calling off the debut launch because of ice buildup in critical plumbing. The 98-meter New Glenn rocket was supposed to blast off before dawn Monday with a prototype satellite. But ice formed in a purge line for a unit powering some of the rocket's hydraulic systems and launch controllers ran out of time to clear it, according to the company. Founded by Amazon's Jeff Bezos, Blue Origin said Tuesday's poor weather forecast could cause more delay. Thick clouds and stiff wind were expected at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. The test flight already had been delayed by rough seas that posed a risk to the company's plan to land the first-stage booster on a floating platform in the Atlantic. New Glenn is named after the first American to orbit Earth, John Glenn. It is five times taller than Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket that carries paying customers to the edge of space from Texas. Bezos founded the company 25 years ago. He took part in Monday's countdown from Mission Control, located at the rocket factory just outside the gates of NASA's Kennedy Space Center. No matter what happens, Bezos said this weekend, 'We're going to pick ourselves up and keep going.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jeff-bezos-space-company-tries-to-launch-rocket-after-last-minute-postponement/7935939.html	2025-01-13T20:31:09-08:00	
Supreme Court rejects Utah's push to wrest control of public land from the federal government	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court on Monday turned back a push by the state of Utah to wrest control of vast areas of public land from the federal government, marking a small victory for land conservation advocates who worry that similar efforts may escalate in a Republican-controlled Washington. The high court refused to let the GOP-controlled state file a lawsuit seeking to bring the land and its resources under state control. The decision came in a brief order in which the court did not explain its reasoning, as is typical. It marks the latest roadblock for states in a running feud with the U.S. government over who should control huge swaths of the West and the enormous oil and gas, timber, and other resources they contain. Utah's top state leaders said they have not ruled out taking their lawsuit to a lower court. In the Western state known for its rugged mountains popular with skiers and red-rock vistas that draw throngs of tourists, federal agencies control almost 70% of the land. Utah argues that local control would be more responsive and allow the state access to revenue from taxes and development projects. The complaint sought control of about half of federal land, which still amounts to an area nearly as large as South Carolina. The parcels are used for things like energy production, grazing, mining and recreation. Utah's world-famous national parks and national monuments would have stayed in federal hands. Monday's decision by the high court comes as the newly Republican-controlled Congress adopted a rules package that includes language allowing lawmakers to more easily transfer or sell off public lands managed by federal agencies. The rules consider public lands to have no monetary value, meaning lawmakers will no longer need to account for lost revenue if they decide to give parcels to states or extractive industries. While conservationists applauded the court's rejection of what they called a land-grab lawsuit, many remained worried that the efforts will continue. Public lands under state control could be vulnerable to privatization, degradation and oil drilling, said Steve Bloch, legal director for the Southern Utah Wilderness Alliance. 'If successful, Utah's lawsuit would result in the sale of millions of acres of public lands in red-rock country to the highest bidder, an end to America's system of federal public lands and the dismantling of the American West as we know it,' Bloch said. Utah's Republican Sens. Mike Lee and John Curtis criticized the court's decision and promised legislative action. Curtis, who campaigned on being a climate-conscious Republican, said the people of Utah should be entrusted to manage the land they have lived on for generations. 'Building roads, moving cattle and cleaning up campgrounds all require navigating a behemothic bureaucracy that's stacked up against the average Utahn,' Curtis said. In a joint statement with Utah's Republican legislative leaders and attorney general, Gov. Spencer Cox said he was disappointed in the court's decision to turn away the lawsuit. 'Utah remains able and willing to challenge any BLM land management decisions that harm Utah,' state leaders said. 'We are also heartened to know the incoming administration shares our commitments to the principle of 'multiple use' for these federal lands and is committed to working with us to improve land management.' While lawsuits typically start in federal district courts and eventually work their way up to the U.S. Supreme Court, disputes involving states can start at the nation's highest court if the justices agree to hear them. Utah leaders noted that the high court did not comment on the merits of their arguments or prevent them from filing the lawsuit in a federal district court. Conservation groups say they'll remain ready to challenge any future lawsuits. 'This lawsuit is an assault on the country's long-standing and successful history of safeguarding valuable and vulnerable landscapes in trust for all Americans,' said Chris Hill, who leads the Conservation Lands Foundation. 'And while the Supreme Court's decision to not hear the case is a reprieve, we fully expect this small group of anti-public lands politicians to continue to waste taxpayer dollars and shop their bad ideas.' The federal Bureau of Land Management declined to comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-rejects-utah-s-push-to-wrest-control-of-public-land-from-the-federal-government/7935933.html	2025-01-13T19:51:56-08:00	
Impeachment trial of South Korean President Yoon to begin	SEOUL, South Korea — The impeachment trial of South Korea's suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol begins Tuesday, with the country's Constitutional Court set to weigh whether to strip him of his presidential duties over a failed martial law bid. Yoon's Dec. 3 power grab plunged South Korea into its worst political crisis in decades, after he directed soldiers to storm parliament in an unsuccessful attempt to stop lawmakers voting down his suspension of civilian rule. He was impeached soon after and suspended from duty, but has gone to ground in his residence since, refusing summonses from investigators probing him on insurrection charges and using his presidential security team to resist arrest. Lawmakers also impeached Yoon's stand-in last month, putting the country in further political instability, and the current acting president has appeared unwilling to wade into the standoff, instead urging all parties to negotiate for a solution. The trial's first of five hearings is slated to begin at 2 p.m. (0500 GMT). The following sessions take place on Jan. 16, 21, 23 and Feb. 4. The court will decide mainly two issues, whether Yoon's martial law declaration was unconstitutional and if it was illegal. 'This impeachment case focuses solely on the martial law situation, so the facts are not particularly complex,' lawyer Kim Nam-ju told AFP. 'Since most of the individuals involved have already been indicted and the facts have been somewhat established, it doesn't seem like it will take a long time.' The court has up to 180 days from Dec. 14, when it received the case, to make its ruling on whether Yoon indeed violated the constitution and the martial law act. Yoon's legal team said he would not appear at the first hearing over purported safety concerns, saying he would be willing to appear at a later date if security issues were ironed out. 'Concerns about safety and potential incidents have arisen. Therefore, the president will not be able to attend the trial on Jan. 14,' lawyer Yoon Kab-keun told AFP. The trial will continue in his absence if he does not appear. Former presidents Roh Moo-hyun and Park Geun-hye did not appear for their impeachment trials in 2004 and 2016-2017, respectively. Yoon's lawyers have argued the court must utilize the full 180 days — specifically to examine what 'led to the declaration of martial law.' Separate to the trial, a joint team of investigators from the Corruption Investigation Office (CIO) — which is probing Yoon over insurrection — and police are preparing a fresh attempt to arrest the president. An earlier attempt failed after Yoon's presidential guards blocked access to investigators. If the new warrant is executed successfully, Yoon would become the first sitting South Korean president to be arrested. If eventually convicted in that case, Yoon faces prison or even the death penalty. As media speculation rose that the second attempt would take place this week, the police, CIO and Yoon's presidential security service met Tuesday to discuss the arrest warrant, the Yonhap news agency reported. The CIO said it would 'prepare thoroughly' for its second effort to arrest Yoon, with police reportedly preparing 1,000 investigators for the fresh attempt. Meanwhile, Yoon's guards have reinforced his Seoul compound with barbed wire installations and bus barricades. On Tuesday Yoon's chief of staff Chung Jin-suk said his office was 'ready to consider all options for investigation or visits' to the sitting leader 'at a third location.' Yoon's legal team has also sought to put pressure on police to avoid being involved in the arrest attempt, claiming officers would be in 'in violation of multiple laws' if they cooperated with investigators. Late Sunday, the CIO sent a letter to the defense ministry and presidential security service saying anyone blocking Yoon's potential arrest 'may face criminal charges' for obstruction and abuse of authority.	https://www.voanews.com/a/impeachment-trial-of-south-korean-president-yoon-to-begin/7935919.html	2025-01-13T19:03:56-08:00

North Korea launches missiles toward eastern waters in 2nd launch of year, South says	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korea on Tuesday test-fired multiple missiles toward its eastern waters, South Korea's military said, as it continued its weapons demonstrations ahead of Donald Trump's return to the White House. South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the weapons were fired from a northern inland area and were suspected to be short-range ballistic missiles. It wasn't immediately clear how far the weapon flew. The joint chiefs said the South Korean military has strengthened surveillance while sharing the launch information with the U.S. and Japanese militaries. It was North Korea's second launch event of 2025, following a ballistic launch last week. North Korea said the Jan. 6 test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong Un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations. North Korea is coming off a torrid year in weapons testing. The systems it demonstrated in 2024 included solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles designed to strike the U.S. mainland and various shorter-range missiles designed to overwhelm missile defenses in South Korea. There concerns that its military capabilities could advance further through technology transfers from Russia, as the two countries align over the war in Ukraine. At a year-end political conference, Kim vowed to implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy and criticized the Biden administration's efforts to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a 'nuclear military bloc for aggression.' North Korean state media did not specify Kim's policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term as president, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Even if Trump returns to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely. Kim's strengthened position — built on his expanded nuclear arsenal, deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of U.S. international sanctions — presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff, experts say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-launches-missiles-toward-eastern-waters-in-2nd-launch-of-year-south-says/7935902.html	2025-01-13T18:25:59-08:00

Peru court throws out graft trial of presidential candidate Fujimori	LIMA, PERU — A court in Peru on Monday suspended the money laundering trial of three-time presidential candidate Keiko Fujimori, citing errors in the indictment. The 49-year-old daughter of ex-President Alberto Fujimori was on trial for allegedly taking money from scandal-tainted Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht to fund failed presidential bids in 2011 and 2016. She is charged with money laundering, organized crime, obstruction of justice and making false declarations. Fujimori had already spent 16 months in pre-trial detention before being freed ahead of the 2021 presidential elections, which she also lost. Prosecutors had sought a 30-year prison sentence for Fujimori, and a 15-year ban on her holding public office — which would rule her out for elections in 2026. A judge ruled Monday that the charge sheet had been 'flawed' and would have to be corrected if there is to be a new trial. This came after the Constitutional Court annulled the charges against one of Fujimori's co-defendants. Prosecutors will be able to appeal Monday's ruling.	https://www.voanews.com/a/peru-court-throws-out-graft-trial-of-presidential-candidate-fujimori-/7935865.html	2025-01-13T16:58:49-08:00	
Crypto firm Tether and its founders finalizing move to El Salvador	DUBAI — Cryptocurrency firm Tether plans to move its headquarters to El Salvador, its chief executive said, as the founders of the world's biggest stablecoin look to capitalize on the Central American country's bid to become a hub for crypto trading. Tether has emerged as a dominant force in the booming market for stablecoins, which are designed to maintain a constant value by being pegged to traditional currencies and offer users a way to move money between cryptocurrencies without exposure to price swings. CEO Paolo Ardoino told Reuters that Tether would relocate to El Salvador after the cryptocurrency recently obtained a license there as a digital asset service provider. Ardoino and his fellow managers and co-founders of Tether will also move their residences to El Salvador, he said. Previously, the company was incorporated in the British Virgin Islands. 'This move to El Salvador will be the first time we're going to have also a physical headquarters,' he said. But not all of the company's 100-plus employees will move there, he said, adding that many of the staff work remotely. The company plans to hire 100 Salvadorans over the next several years, he said. The booming market for stablecoins has worried regulators concerned that growing stablecoin reserves expose the broader financial system to bigger risks, because they act as a bridge between the crypto universe and mainstream financial markets. Tether has faced questions around its reserves and does not fully disclose where they are held or in what form. The firm says the vast majority of its stablecoin is backed by traditional currency reserves held with Wall Street brokerage Cantor Fitzgerald, whose CEO, Howard Lutnick, has been nominated to head the U.S. Commerce Department under President-elect Donald Trump. 'So, we have some liquidity on other banks, but the vast, vast majority of the T-bills are in Cantor,' Ardoino said. Boosting monitoring of tokens The company said last year it was increasing monitoring of how its tokens are used to combat illicit finance. Asked whether Tether had considered alternative locations for its headquarters, Ardoino said it lacked a license to operate in the European Union and had ruled out the United States for now. It was 'quite premature' to predict possible changes that might be implemented under Trump, he said. Trump's victory in the November U.S. election sparked a record rise in cryptocurrency prices. The Republican has vowed to introduce a friendlier regulatory environment for crypto and said he planned to create a U.S. bitcoin strategic reserve. El Salvador is seeking to become a hub for digital currency trading, and three years ago President Nayib Bukele made it the first country to establish bitcoin as legal tender, alongside the dollar. 'Welcome home,' Bukele wrote on social media platform X in response to Tether's announcement. In a separate post on Monday, Bukele asked the CEO of Rumble, Chris Pavlovski, to consider moving the headquarters of the video-sharing platform to El Salvador. Days earlier, the company announced a cloud services agreement with Bukele's government. Tether's eponymous dollar-pegged token USDT=CCCL (USDT) accounts for roughly two-thirds of the $212 billion worth of stablecoins in circulation, according to CoinGecko data. The overall market has grown around 45% over the last year, the data shows.	https://www.voanews.com/a/crypto-firm-tether-and-its-founders-finalizing-move-to-el-salvador-/7935830.html	2025-01-13T16:37:42-08:00	
Mexico's Sheinbaum lays out road map to make country economic powerhouse	MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum on Monday rolled out her administration's road map to make the nation one of the world's top economies by the time she leaves office. Mexico, currently the No. 12 economy according to World Bank data, aims to crack the Top 10 by 2030, Sheinbaum said. The nation will do so by boosting local manufacturing and swapping out imports, creating manufacturing jobs and cutting through red tape to attract investments in the country, Sheinbaum said. The business-friendly agenda represents a shift in tone from Sheinbaum's predecessor and mentor, President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who left office in October and often tussled with private firms. Sheinbaum laid out a laundry list of goals on Monday for her country, including bumping investments up to 28% of GDP, adding 1.5 million manufacturing jobs and boosting local sourcing for industries subject to Chinese imports — a key source of tensions with the United States and Canada. Mexico plans to boost its position using trade agreements, tariff policies and strengthening customs enforcement, a government presentation showed. The moves come as trade tensions with the United States — Mexico's top trade partner — are heightened on tariff threats from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has accused Mexico of being a back door for Chinese goods to circumvent existing U.S. tariffs. Mexico denies such accusations but has since cracked down on contraband goods coming into the country from Asia and rolled out tariffs targeting e-commerce giants such as Shein and Temu. 'This is a collective job,' Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard said at the presentation, thanking private-sector representatives who helped build what he called a 'navigational chart for the new era we are entering.' 'There are uncertainties in the immediate future. But if we work together and have a direction for the nation like the one we have, my friends, we are going to come out on top,' he added. Sheinbaum's administration will boost local sourcing in the key textile and automotive industries, the presentation showed, while also working with Mexican steel producers, who have long accused China of undercutting the market. Sheinbaum, a climate scientist who has made strong environmental pledges, will also work to make Mexico's energy grid run on 45% sustainable energy, her presentation showed. However, that promise could be challenged by the heavily polluting and heavily indebted state oil firm Pemex. Lopez Obrador poured billions of dollars into the company during his administration. Sheinbaum's presentation also pledged to maintain the country's hydrocarbon reserves-to-production ratio for at least the next decade. 'Our goal is to reduce poverty and inequality,' Sheinbaum said. 'In the face of any uncertainty in the near future, Mexico has a plan and is united going forward.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-s-sheinbaum-lays-out-road-map-to-make-country-economic-powerhouse-/7935828.html	2025-01-13T16:35:38-08:00	
Premier of separatist Moldova region says gas cutoff shattered foreign trade	CHISINAU, MOLDOVA — The prime minister of Moldova's separatist Transniestria region said Monday that the abrupt curtailment of Russian gas supplies that plunged the region into an energy crisis has also shattered both its exports and imports. The cutoff, prompted by Ukraine's refusal to renew an agreement allowing Russian gas to transit through Ukraine, has led to daily blackouts in the pro-Russian region of some 350,000 people and disruptions in heating and water supplies. Prime Minister Alexander Rozenberg told local media that the New Year cutoff had triggered a 43% decline in imports and a 60% plunge in exports in the region, which split from Moldova in the final days of Soviet rule. 'The steepest drop in the volume of export operations ... has been registered in the metals sector, in manufacture of machines and in the chemical industry,' he said. 'Exports of cement have been completely stopped.' Transniestria depends heavily on assistance from Moscow and its leaders acknowledge that the Russian gas it has long received was provided free of charge as 'humanitarian assistance.' The gas cutoff affects operations at a thermal plant that provides electricity both for Transniestria and much of the area controlled by the central Moldovan government. Its operations have been switched to coal, and Ukraine, Moldova's eastern neighbor, has offered to provide supplies. Moldovan President Maia Sandu, who has spearheaded the country's drive to join the EU, called a meeting of Moldova's Supreme Security Council on Tuesday to discuss energy. Both Moldova and Transniestria have proclaimed states of emergency. Much of Transniestria's industry has been forced to close or obliged to operate at night, when there is less strain on the power grid. Among the factories closed are a cement plant and a steel mill in the town of Rybnita, with the latter accounting for 35% of the region's budget revenue. The region's separatist authorities last week said energy savings had enabled them to reduce rolling blackouts from eight hours a day to three by the weekend. But a blackout of five hours had been announced for Monday. Moldova, which denounces Russia's invasion of Ukraine, says Moscow fomented the crisis and has suggested shipping gas on a route through Turkey, Bulgaria and Romania. Russian gas giant Gazprom said it will provide no supplies until Moldova settles arrears it estimates at $709 million, a figure disputed by Moldovan authorities. Transniestria's leaders say Moldova has done nothing to ease the crisis and reject any notion that Moldova's government has offered to help purchase power from Western Europe. More than 30 years after Transniestria waged a brief war against the newly independent Moldovan state, the region continues to exist alongside Moldova with little turmoil. But 1,500 Russian 'peacekeepers' remain in the territory and efforts to resolve the separatist dispute have made little headway.	https://www.voanews.com/a/premier-of-separatist-moldova-region-says-gas-cutoff-shattered-foreign-trade-/7935845.html	2025-01-13T16:34:02-08:00	
US agencies warn of potential New Orleans copycat attack	WASHINGTON — The Federal Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday warned of a potential public safety threat from violent extremists who might try to copy the New Year's Day attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people. The warning comes a week before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. 'The FBI and DHS are concerned about possible copycat or retaliatory attacks due to the persistent appeal of vehicle ramming as a tactic for aspiring violent extremist attackers,' the agencies said in a statement. Early on New Year's Day, more than a dozen people were killed and a dozen others injured when a man rammed a rented pickup truck into a crowd of revelers along Bourbon Street in New Orleans. The man who carried out the attack was a U.S. Army veteran who had pledged allegiance to Islamic State and appeared to have made recordings condemning music, drugs and alcohol. The agencies said such attacks, inspired by foreign 'terrorist' organizations, have been carried out in the U.S. and abroad using rented, stolen and personally owned vehicles. Attackers could also attempt to use improvised explosive devices to supplement a vehicle attack, they said. The agencies said past targets have included pedestrians, law enforcement or military members, and crowded public venues that are accessible from roadways. 'We ask that the public remain vigilant regarding possible copycat or retaliatory attacks and report any suspicious activity to law enforcement,' they said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agencies-warn-of-potential-new-orleans-copycat-attack/7935595.html	2025-01-13T16:04:52-08:00	
Russian forces bypass key stronghold to cut off supplies to Ukrainians	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russian forces are bypassing a key stronghold in eastern Ukraine that they have fought for months to capture and are focusing instead on cutting supply lines to it, a Ukrainian official said Monday. Russian troops are going around the vital logistics hub of Pokrovsk, where a steadfast Ukrainian defense has kept them at bay, and are taking aim at a highway that leads from there to the central Ukraine city of Dnipro, Major Viktor Trehubov, a local Ukrainian army spokesperson, told The Associated Press. That route is crucial for supplies feeding Ukrainian forces in the entire region. Cutting the highway traffic would also severely weaken Pokrovsk. 'So far, they have not achieved their goal and [Ukrainian forces] are working to ensure that they do not achieve it in the future — just as they have not been successful in other attempts to bypass the city,' Trehubov said in a WhatsApp message. Ukraine’s army is under severe strain along parts of the approximately 1,000-kilometer (600-mile) front line, especially in the eastern Donetsk region where Pokrovsk is located. After almost three years of war, Ukrainian units are depleted and are outnumbered by Russian forces. Though its battlefield progress has been slow and costly, momentum in the war is in Russia’s favor and its onslaught has gradually swallowed up towns and villages, especially in Donetsk. The Russian Defense Ministry claimed Monday its forces had seized the village of Pishchane. In his daily video address to the nation late Sunday, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said fighting around Pokrovsk was 'the most intense' in recent days. In separate comments to local media, Trehubov, the army spokesperson, speculated that Russia's heavy losses of troops and armor in the Donetsk operation had prompted it to alter its strategy. 'Now they are acting more cautiously,' he said. Russian President Vladimir Putin is pressing his advantage ahead of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s arrival in the White House next week. Trump says he wants to bring a swift end to the war, though he hasn’t publicized details of his plans. In 2022, Moscow illegally annexed the Donetsk and neighboring Luhansk regions, which make up the economically important Donbas industrial area, together with the southeastern provinces of Kherson and Zaporizhzhia. But Russian forces don’t fully control any of them.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-forces-bypass-key-stronghold-to-cut-off-supplies-to-ukrainians-/7935592.html	2025-01-13T16:00:37-08:00

Millions have had student loans canceled under Biden, despite collapse of his forgiveness plan	WASHINGTON — Despite failing to deliver his promise for broad student loan forgiveness, President Joe Biden has now overseen the cancellation of student loans for more than 5 million Americans — more than any other president in U.S. history. In a last-minute action on Monday, the Education Department canceled loans for 150,000 borrowers through programs that existed before Biden took office. His administration expanded those programs and used them to their fullest extent, pressing on with cancellation even after the Supreme Court rejected Biden's plan for a new forgiveness policy. 'My Administration has taken historic action to reduce the burden of student debt, hold bad actors accountable, and fight on behalf of students across the country,' Biden said in a written statement. In total, the administration says it has waived $183.6 billion in student loans. The wave of cancellations could dry up when President-elect Donald Trump takes office. Trump hasn't detailed his student loan policies but previously called cancellation 'vile' and illegal. Republicans have fought relentlessly against Biden's plans, saying cancellation is ultimately shouldered by taxpayers who never attended college or already repaid their loans. Biden loosened rules for debt forgiveness The latest round of relief mostly comes through a program known as borrower defense, which allows students to get their loans canceled if they're cheated or misled by their colleges. It was created in 1994 but rarely used until a wave of high-profile for-profit college scandals during the Obama administration. A smaller share of the relief came through a program for borrowers with disabilities and through Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which was created in 2007 and offers to erase all remaining debt for borrowers in a government or nonprofit job who make 10 years of monthly payments. Most of Monday's borrower defense cancellations were for students who attended several defunct colleges owned by Center for Excellence in Higher Education, including CollegeAmerica, Stevens-Henager College, and Independence University. They are based on past findings that the schools lied to prospective students about their employment prospects and the terms of private loans. Before Biden took office, those programs were criticized by advocates who said complex rules made it difficult for borrowers to get relief. The Biden administration loosened some of the rules using its regulatory power, a maneuver that expanded eligibility without going through Congress. As an example, just 7,000 borrowers had gotten their loans canceled through Public Service Loan Forgiveness before the Biden administration took office. Widespread confusion about eligibility, along with errors by loan servicers, resulted in a 99% rejection rate for applicants. Huge numbers of borrowers made years of payments only to find out they were in an ineligible repayment plan. Some were improperly put into forbearance — a pause on payments — by their loan servicers. Those periods didn't end up counting toward the 10 years of payments needed for cancellation. The Biden administration temporarily relaxed the eligibility rules during the pandemic and then made it more permanent in 2023. As a result, more than 1 million public servants have now had their balances zeroed out through the program. All those rule changes were meant to be a companion to Biden's marquee policy for student debt, which proposed up to $20,000 in relief for more than 40 million Americans. But after the Supreme Court blocked the move, the Biden administration shifted its focus to maximizing relief through existing mechanisms. Republicans have called for a different approach Announcements of new cancellation became routine, even as conservatives in Congress accused Biden of overstepping his power. Republican states fought off Biden's later attempts at mass forgiveness, but the smaller batches of relief continued without any major legal challenge. As Republicans take hold of both chambers of Congress and the White House, Biden's changes could be targeted for a rollback. But it's unclear how far the next administration will go to tighten the cancellation spigot. Trump proposed eliminating PSLF during his first term in office, but Congress rejected the idea. Project 2025, a blueprint created by the Heritage Foundation for a second Trump term, proposes ending PSLF, and narrowing borrower defense and making repayment plans less generous than existing ones.	https://www.voanews.com/a/millions-have-had-student-loans-canceled-under-biden-despite-collapse-of-his-forgiveness-plan-/7935510.html	2025-01-13T14:10:30-08:00

Palestinians dedicate new West Bank olive grove to Jimmy Carter	TULKAREM, West Bank — Palestinian activists and residents planted a grove of 250 olive trees in a northern West Bank town Monday in memory of the late U.S. President Jimmy Carter, describing him as a staunch supporter of the Palestinian cause. The former president’s legacy is 'rooted' among Palestinians and across the globe, said Abbas Melhem, executive manager of the Palestinian Farmers Union. Carter was one of the few world leaders who 'stood firmly supporting the struggle of the Palestinians for independence and for freedom,' he said. Under clear winter skies, Palestinian kids helped a handful of adults place the trees into newly dug holes. Melhem said the 10-dunam (2.5-acre) grove in the city of Tulkarem, titled 'Freedom Farm,' would be fenced in to protect it from wildlife or extremist Jewish settlers, who have attacked Palestinian olive trees in the past. The advocacy group for farmers in the West Bank launched the project in collaboration with U.S.-based nonprofit Treedom for Palestine, which plants trees to empower Palestinian farmers. Carter, who died last month at the age of 100, brokered the Camp David peace accords between Israel and Egypt in 1978. In his later years, Carter was highly critical of Israel’s military rule over the Palestinians, saying conditions in the occupied West Bank amounted to apartheid. Israel captured the West Bank in the 1967 Mideast war, and the Palestinians want it to form the main part of their future state. 'I think planting olive trees that live at least 100 years old like him is a very suitable way to honor his life and his legacy,' said George Zeidan, the Carter Center’s director in Israel and Palestine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinians-dedicate-new-west-bank-olive-grove-to-jimmy-carter/7935489.html	2025-01-13T14:00:34-08:00	
Lasers help archaeologists study ancient tattoos on Peruvian mummies	WASHINGTON — For more than 5,000 years, humans have adorned themselves with tattoos. In a new study, researchers used lasers to uncover highly intricate designs of ancient tattoos on mummies from Peru. The preserved skin of the mummies and the black tattoo ink used show a stark contrast — revealing fine details in tattoos dating to around 1250 A.D. that aren’t visible to the naked eye, said study co-author Michael Pittman, an archaeologist at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The researchers examined around 100 mummies from coastal Peru’s Chancay culture – a civilization that flourished before the Inca empire and the arrival of Europeans. All the individuals had some form of tattoos on the back of their hands, knuckles, forearms or other body parts. The study focused on four individuals with 'exceptional tattoos' — designs of geometric shapes such as triangles and diamonds, said Pittman. It wasn't clear exactly how the tattoos were created, but they are 'of a quality that stands up against the really good electric tattooing of today,' said Aaron Deter-Wolf, an expert in pre-Columbian tattoos and an archaeologist at the Tennessee Division of Archaeology, who was not involved in the research. Results were published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Using lasers that make skin faintly glow, 'we basically turn skin into a light bulb,' said co-author Tom Kaye of the nonprofit Foundation for Scientific Advancement in Sierra Vista, Arizona. The findings were 'helpful to learn about new non-destructive technologies that can help us study and document sensitive archaeological materials,' such as mummies, said Deter-Wolf. The oldest known tattoos were found on remains of a Neolithic man who lived in the Italian Alps around 3,000 B.C. Many mummies from ancient Egypt also have tattoos, as do remains from cultures around the world. Throughout history, tattoos have been used in many ways — to mark cultural or individual identity, life events or social status, or to 'ward off maladies or help enhance relationships with spirits or deities,' said Lars Krutak, an archaeologist at the Museum of International Folk Art in Santa Fe, New Mexico, who was not involved in the research. While designs on pottery, textiles and stonework are more commonly preserved and studied by researchers, 'when ancient tattoos are available to us, they give exciting insights into forms of figurative and abstract art that we aren’t otherwise able to access,' said Bournemouth University archaeologist Martin Smith, who was not part of the study.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lasers-help-archaeologists-study-ancient-tattoos-on-peruvian-mummies-/7935481.html	2025-01-13T13:58:22-08:00	
Ryanair calls for alcoholic drink limit at EU airports amid legal action against unruly passenger	NEW YORK — Ryanair is calling on European authorities to limit the sale of alcoholic beverages at airports across the continent, as the Irish airline continues legal action against a passenger who it says caused a costly flight diversion last year. The budget airline is seeking more than 15,000 euros ($15,324) in damages over the April 2024 incident. Ryanair alleges that this passenger's 'inexcusable behavior' on a flight from Dublin to Lanzarote in Spain's Canary Islands was so disruptive that it forced the aircraft to divert to Porto, Portugal, for safety — where crew members and over 160 other passengers were later delayed overnight. After announcing its civil suit against the passenger last week, Ryanair on Monday shared further information detailing the costs it incurred for excess fuel, lodging, legal fees and more as a result of this diversion. And the airline also suggested a drink limit for airports across the European Union. 'It is time that EU authorities take action to limit the sale of alcohol at airports,' Ryanair wrote in a statement. 'We fail to understand why passengers at airports are not limited to two alcoholic drinks [using their boarding pass in exactly the same way they limit duty-free sales], as this would result in safer and better passenger behavior on board aircraft, and a safer travel experience for passengers and crews all over Europe.' Ryanair noted that it and other airlines already limit alcohol sales in-flight — but said that passengers can still consume excess alcohol at airports before boarding, particularly during flight delays, without similar restrictions. Aviation agencies have long expressed concern with disruptive, in-flight incidents — particularly those that result in violence against others on board, verbal abuse, harassment or other health hazards like smoking. Although still rare, reports of unruly passengers seen on planes have recently been on the rise. When reached for comment Monday, a spokesperson for European Union Aviation Safety Agency noted that, while the agency could not provide specifics, 'both the number and severity of incidents' have increased in Europe since 2020. Worldwide, the International Air Transport Association found that there was one disruptive incident for every 480 flights in 2023 — the latest figures from the trade organization, which used data from more 24,500 reports and 50 operators worldwide. That's up from one every 568 in 2022. How many of those incidents involved alcohol was not immediately known. But, among efforts aimed at preventing in-flight disruptive behavior overall, the IATA and other aviation groups have previously underlined the importance of serving alcohol responsibly, not allowing travelers who are too intoxicated to board and participating in additional safety initiatives, like 'One Too Many' in the U.K. Meanwhile, in the U.S., the Federal Aviation Administration reported that it received 2,102 reports of unruly passenger incidents last year, resulting in $7.5 million in fines levied. That incident count is up 1% from 2023, but still far below a 2021 peak of 5,973.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ryanair-calls-for-alcoholic-drink-limit-at-eu-airports-amid-legal-action-against-unruly-passenger-/7935464.html	2025-01-13T13:54:15-08:00	
Elon Musk says third patient got Neuralink brain implant	Elon Musk said a third person has received an implant from his brain-computer interface company Neuralink, one of many groups working to connect the nervous system to machines. 'We've got ... three humans with Neuralinks and all are working well,' he said during a recent wide-ranging interview at a Las Vegas event streamed on his social media platform X. Since the first brain implant about a year ago, Musk said the company has upgraded the devices with more electrodes, higher bandwidth and longer battery life. Musk also said Neuralink hopes to implant the experimental devices in 20 to 30 more people this year. Musk didn't provide any details about the latest patient, but there are updates on the previous ones. The second recipient — who has a spinal cord injury and got the implant last summer — was playing video games with the help of the device and learning how to use computer-aided design software to create 3-D objects. The first patient, also paralyzed after a spinal cord injury, described how it helped him play video games and chess. But while such developments at Neuralink often attract notice, many other companies and research groups are working on similar projects. Two studies last year in the New England Journal of Medicine described how brain-computer interfaces, or BCIs, helped people with ALS communicate better. Who's working on brain-computer interface technology? More than 45 trials involving brain-computer interfaces are underway, according to a U.S. database of studies. The efforts are aimed at helping treat brain disorders, overcoming brain injuries and other uses. Many research labs have already shown that humans can accurately control computer cursors using BCIs, said Rajesh Rao, co-director of the Center for Neurotechnology at the University of Washington. Rao said Neuralink may be unique in two ways: The surgery to implant the device is the first time a robot has been used to implant flexible electrode threads into a human brain to record neural activity and control devices. And those threads may record from more neurons than other interfaces. Still, he said, the advantages of Neuralink’s approach have yet to be shown, and some competitors have eclipsed the company in other ways. For example, Rao said companies such as Synchron, Blackrock Neurotech and Onward Medical are already conducting BCI trials on people 'using either less invasive methods or more versatile approaches' that combine neural recording with stimulation. What are the benefits of BCIs? Marco Baptista, chief scientific officer of the Christopher & Dana Reeve Foundation, called BCI technology 'very exciting' with potential benefits to people with paralysis. Through clinical trials, 'we’ll be able to see what’s going to be the winning approach,' he said. 'It’s a little early to know.' Baptista said his foundation generally tries to support research teams financially and with expert help – though it hasn’t given any money to Neuralink. 'We need to really support high-risk, high-reward endeavors. This is clearly high-risk, high-reward. We don’t know how safe it’s going to be. We don’t know how feasible it’s going to be,' he said. How are BCIs tested and regulated? Neuralink announced in 2023 that it had gotten permission from U.S. regulators to begin testing its device in people. While most medical devices go on the market without clinical studies, high-risk ones that undergo pre-market approval need what’s called an 'investigational device exemption' from the Food and Drug Administration, said Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco, who studies high-risk devices. Neuralink says it has this exemption, but the FDA said it can’t confirm or disclose information about a particular study. Redberg said the FDA tends to be involved in all steps from recruiting patients to testing devices to analyzing data. She said this regulatory process prioritizes safety. She also pointed to another layer of protection: All research involving people needs an institutional review board, or IRB. It can also be known as an ethical review board or an independent ethics committee. Members must include at least one non-scientist as well as someone not affiliated with the institution or organization forming the board. The role of such boards 'is to assume there is reasonable risk and reasonable chance of benefit and that patients are informed of those before they enroll,' said Redberg.	https://www.voanews.com/a/elon-musk-says-third-patient-got-neuralink-brain-implant/7935447.html	2025-01-13T13:39:59-08:00	
In Nigeria, spate of airstrikes killing civilians sparks concern	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Human rights groups in Nigeria are condemning a pattern of civilian deaths from airstrikes in the northeast, and are calling for an impartial investigation of the military's operations. This follows reports from local residents that a weekend airstrike targeting armed gangs in Zamfara state killed at least 15 civilians. Nigeria’s air force has confirmed it is investigating multiple reports of civilian casualties from the Saturday raid. An air force spokesperson, Air Vice Marshal Olusola Akinboyewa, stated Sunday that there is no confirmed evidence of civilian casualties and clarified that the airstrike targeted criminal gangs, resulting in the rescue of several people. Local residents in Tungar Kara village, however, told the news media that at least 15 people were killed, including members of a local militia. The incident follows a Christmas Day airstrike in nearby Sokoto state that killed 10 civilians. Isa Sanusi of Amnesty International condemned the reports of frequent civilian casualties. 'It is actually unfortunate that the military is repeatedly doing the same thing — striking without proper verification of their target,' Sanusi said. 'It has now reached a level that we can no longer call it a mistake. The reason why the military is doing this is because the government could not hold them to account.' Amnesty International says it has received testimonies and evidence indicating that the recent airstrike in Tungar Kara killed innocent civilians. Nigerian authorities have struggled to curtail the operations of armed gangs and terror groups, often resorting to aerial strikes to fight them. Civilian deaths, however, have become more frequent. On Monday, Nigeria’s chief of defense staff, General Christopher Musa, told local media that the military does not intentionally target civilians, and that an investigation into the accident is underway. Sanusi, however, insisted on greater accountability. 'The military should be asked to hand over every detail they have. A panel should be constituted, including experts in military air operations, so that the exact reason why this is happening should be confirmed and avoided in the future,' Sanusi said, adding, 'The families of the victims have also approached us.' Security analyst Chidi Omeje said the military must exercise caution in its aerial operations. 'I’m not sure that when you have this type of intensive military operation, you always get it right. That’s why I’m actually not very comfortable with the use of aerial combat in this manner, because I’m not sure we have reached the point where we can be very precise in our attacks,' Omeje said. Since 2017, air raids by the military have resulted in the deaths of more than 400 Nigerian civilians, according to SBM Intelligence, a Lagos-based research firm.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-nigeria-spate-of-airstrikes-killing-civilians-sparks-concern/7935425.html	2025-01-13T13:30:43-08:00	
China's EV sales surge in 2024; foreign automakers struggle in shifting market	A new industry report released Monday shows China made big strides last year toward an EV-driven future, as domestic sales of all types of electric vehicles rose by 40% in 2024. Sales of gasoline powered cars tumbled, including foreign imports. In 2024, a total of 31.4 million total vehicles were sold in the world’s largest automobile market by sales, according to the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers. That marked a 4.5% rise compared with the previous year. Despite the uptick in sales, foreign automobile importers are increasingly finding it hard to compete with local brands in China who have been offering a wide variety of affordable EVs and intensified market competition. One example is German luxury car maker Porsche, who closed several of its physical stores in China in 2024. Porsche sales in China were down 29% year on year which marked the third consecutive year of decline. In addition to Porsche, luxury carmakers BMW, Mercedes, and Audi each saw a drop in their vehicle sales in China in 2024 with BMW sales falling 13.4%, Mercedes sales by 7%, and Audi sales by 11%. Tai Chih-yen, an associate researcher at the Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research in Taipei told VOA’s Mandarin service that a sense of patriotism and support for national brands has created additional pressures that have contributed to the struggles international automakers are facing. 'Higher-end consumers have started to abandon foreign brands and are turning to comparatively better priced high-end domestic cars,' Tai told VOA. 'This is not a so-called consumption downgrade, but more a reflection of the current situation, where many are choosing to be more discreet [in the kinds of cars they drive] and show their patriotism by driving domestic luxury brands.' The industry report also noted that sales of traditional gasoline and diesel-powered vehicles in China sank 17% in 2024, from 14 million to 11.6 million, a slide that coincides with Beijing’s focus on transitioning to electric vehicles. At the same time, Chinese vehicle exports were up 19.3% in 2024, according to the report. However, export growth is expected to cool with the report estimating only a 5.8% increase in 2025. China faced a backlash in 2024 as it moved to expand EV sales overseas, with the U.S., Canada and EU unveiling steep tariffs to stop a flood of cheap electric vehicles into their markets. The U.S., Canada and EU have raised concerns about subsidies that the Chinese government provides EV makers that allows them to sell their cars for lower prices. They have also voiced concerned that China has too much production of EVs and that cars are being dumped into foreign markets, allegations that Beijing has repeatedly denied. China argues that its EV subsidies are similar to those of other countries and that sales of electric vehicles help with climate change. China has filed a complaint at the World Trade Organization over the EU’s tariff decision. Michael Baturin and VOA Mandarin Service reporter Nai-chuan Lin contributed to this report.

At least 100 illegal miners died trapped in South African mine	JOHANNESBURG — At least 100 people who were mining illegally in an abandoned gold mine in South Africa have died after being trapped deep underground for months while police tried to get them out, a group representing the miners said Monday. Sabelo Mnguni, a spokesperson for the Mining Affected Communities United in Action Group told The Associated Press that a cellphone sent to the surface with some rescued miners Friday had two videos on it showing dozens of bodies underground wrapped in plastic. Mnguni said 'a minimum' of 100 men had died in the mine in North West province where police first launched an operation in November to force the miners out. They were suspected to have died of starvation or dehydration, Mnguni said. He said 18 bodies have been brought out since Friday. Police spokesperson Brig. Sebata Mokgwabone said they were still verifying information on how many bodies had been recovered and how many survivors were brought out after starting a new rescue operation Monday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-100-illegal-miners-died-trapped-in-south-african-mine/7935416.html	2025-01-13T13:14:13-08:00	
Biden defends foreign policy record despite ongoing crises	Washington — Outgoing President Joe Biden sought to burnish his foreign policy record Monday and said U.S. adversaries are weaker than when he took office four years ago despite global crises that remain unresolved. A week before handing over to President-elect Donald Trump, Biden in a rare State Department speech touted his administration's backing for Ukraine against Russia's 2022 invasion and for Israel's wars in the Middle East. Biden said the United States was 'winning the worldwide competition' and would not be surpassed economically by China as had been predicted, while Russia and Iran have been weakened by wars without direct U.S. involvement. 'Compared to four years ago, America is stronger, our alliances are stronger, our adversaries and competitors are weaker,' Biden said. 'We have not gone to war to make these things happen.' While wars continue to rage in Ukraine and the Middle East, officials hope a deal between Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas can be reached before Biden departs the White House on Jan. 20. Biden said negotiators were close to reaching a deal that would free hostages held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip and halt the fighting in the Palestinian enclave to allow a surge of humanitarian aid. 'So many innocent people have been killed, so many communities have been destroyed. Palestinian people deserve peace,' he said. Biden has faced criticism for providing Israel with weapons and diplomatic support during its assault on Gaza after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 46,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials, with much of the enclave laid to waste and most of its population displaced. Protesters shouting 'war criminal' greeted Biden outside the State Department on Monday, some with signs and some throwing red liquid intended to look like blood. Biden said he had helped Israel defeat adversaries like Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both backed by Iran. The U.S. president also hailed Washington's support for Israel during two Iranian attacks in 2024. 'All told, Iran is weaker than it's been in decades,' he added, noting the collapse of the Syrian Assad government. 'There's no question that our actions contributed significantly.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-defends-foreign-policy-record-despite-ongoing-crises/7935441.html	2025-01-13T13:06:33-08:00	
Biggest European allies to swiftly implement new NATO targets, Berlin says	BERLIN — Germany, Poland, Britain, France and Italy will implement as swiftly as possible new NATO targets for weapons and troop numbers which the alliance is about to agree upon, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius pledged on Monday. The chief of NATO's Military Committee, Dutch Admiral Rob Bauer, told Reuters earlier that the alliance aims to bring forward the decision on new targets for weapons and troop numbers to this summer. The Western military and political alliance has been under pressure not only in the wake of Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine but also internally, with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump calling on its members to spend much more on defense. A NATO summit in The Hague at the end of June will also discuss hiking NATO's existing military spending target of 2% of national GDP, with 3% being floated by some experts as one potential new target. Trump, who returns to the White House on Jan. 20, recently urged a 5% goal. Speaking after a meeting with his four counterparts in the Polish village of Nowa Wies, Pistorius welcomed NATO's decision to fix the alliance's new capability targets in June instead of October as originally planned, a move he said was triggered by a German request. 'This buys us a lot of time and we can much earlier kick off the implementation,' Pistorius told reporters. At the same time, he rejected Trump's push to have members raise defense spending to 5% of GDP, arguing this would equal more than 40% of Germany's total budget. 'The crucial question for me is: How fast do we … every single ally, manage to meet NATO's new capability targets? … How quickly are we fully capable of defending ourselves when we need to be?' Pistorius said. France's defense minister, Sebastien Lecornu, said military budgets would continue to increase but did not specify a figure for a new NATO target. 'The situation is worse than it was during the Cold War. ... We can be defeated without being invaded,' he said, referring to cyberattacks. Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz said the next meeting of the Group of Five in Paris would discuss how to finance the organization and the development of the arms industry in Europe.

Baltimore prosecutors back Adnan Syed's request to have his sentence reduced to time served	Baltiomore, Md. — Baltimore prosecutors filed a motion supporting Adnan Syed's recent request to have his sentence reduced to time served, which could ensure he remains free indefinitely as he awaits further court decisions in a decadeslong legal saga that amassed a large following from the hit podcast 'Serial.' Syed was released from prison in 2022 after prosecutors asked a judge to overturn his murder conviction in the 1999 slaying of his high school ex-girlfriend, Hae Min Lee. But challenges from Lee's family later led to his conviction being reinstated. In August, the Maryland Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision ordering a new hearing about vacating the conviction. Last month, Syed's attorneys filed a motion asking for his sentence to be reduced under Maryland's relatively new Juvenile Restoration Act, which allows people serving long sentences for crimes they committed as minors to seek release after 20 years behind bars. The legislation was passed amid growing consensus that such defendants are especially open to rehabilitation, in part because brain science shows cognitive development continues well beyond the teenage years. Syed was 17 when Lee was found strangled to death and buried in a makeshift grave. Prosecutors filed the motion in support of a sentence reduction on Sunday, according to the Baltimore City State's Attorney's Office. In it, State's Attorney Ivan Bates said Syed's request is 'in the interest of justice.' 'I truly believe Mr. Syed's case is precisely what legislators envisioned when they crafted the Juvenile Restoration Act,' Bates said in a statement Monday. 'We have an individual who has served over 20 years in prison from the time he was a teenager and who has displayed tremendous personal growth and reform.' But attorneys for the Lee family argue it's premature to consider a sentence reduction while the integrity of the conviction is still up in the air. 'That question regarding ultimate guilt or innocence needs to be resolved before any thought of reducing Mr. Syed's sentence can be considered,' attorney David Sanford said in a statement. 'Currently Mr. Syed remains a convicted murderer and nothing the State or Mr. Syed has ever presented calls that fact into question.' The case, which has been rife with legal twists and turns, has more recently pitted criminal justice reform efforts against the rights of crime victims and their families, whose voices are often at odds with a growing movement to acknowledge and correct longstanding issues such as systemic racism, police misconduct and prosecutorial missteps. Since his release in 2022, Syed has been working at Georgetown University's Prisons and Justice Initiative and helping care for his aging parents, according to court filings. His father died in October after a long illness. 'He cares so much about our family,' his mother wrote in a recent letter to the court. 'He is married and tries to be the best husband he can. He is always trying to help us out anyway that he can. He has tried hard to become a positive member of his community.' Syed has maintained his innocence from the beginning, but many questions about the case remain unanswered even after the 'Serial' podcast combed through the evidence, reexamined legal arguments and interviewed witnesses. The series debuted in 2014 and drew millions of listeners who became armchair detectives. Prosecutors wrote that since his release from prison in 2022, Syed, 43, has shown he doesn't pose a threat to public safety. 'In taking this position, the State does not want to minimize the seriousness of the crime in this case,' the motion says. 'The State, however, does not believe in warehousing individuals who committed a crime when they were a juvenile and have demonstrated maturity, have been rehabilitated [and] are now fit to reenter society.' But the motion doesn't present a position on Syed's conviction itself. The Maryland Supreme Court's 4-3 ruling in August called for a new hearing on whether the conviction should be vacated because the victim's relatives didn't receive adequate notice to allow them to attend the original proceeding, which won Syed his freedom. Bates, who took office as state's attorney a few months after the 2022 hearing, is now weighing how to proceed given the Supreme Court's decision. But if Syed's motion for a reduced sentence is granted, he would likely avoid going back to prison regardless.	https://www.voanews.com/a/baltimore-prosecutors-back-adnan-syed-s-request-to-have-his-sentence-reduced-to-time-served/7935393.html	2025-01-13T12:55:14-08:00	
Sahel vacuum provides opportunities for China, analysts say	JOHANNESBURG — Stretching from the Atlantic Ocean to the Red Sea, Africa’s Sahel region is experiencing security problems and surging anti-Western sentiment that could prove an opportunity for China, analysts say. China’s top diplomat was in the volatile Sahel last week as a part of his weeklong trip to the continent, where he pledged military aid on a visit that happened to coincide with an attack on the presidential compound in Chad. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi’s visit also came amid a spat between France and its former African colonies. In Nigeria, on the last leg of what has become a regular January trip to Africa, Wang said China would help train 6,000 troops and 1,000 police officers across the continent. Additionally, he pledged $136 million in military aid to the region. His pledge was a reiteration of Beijing’s promises at the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) in September. But the choices of countries on his itinerary, including Chad and Nigeria, were telling, experts said. 'Wang's focus on military aid and training, and the choice of countries to be visited, is in line with China's new focus on defense diplomacy as opposed to the purely economic and diplomatic engagements that used to characterize Chinese engagement with the continent a decade ago,' Darren Olivier, director of the conflict research consultancy African Defense Review, told VOA. Both Chad and Nigeria are battling insurgencies, and just a few hours after Wang met with Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby – who seized power in a 2021 coup – Deby’s compound was attacked by armed men. The attack failed, but the incident 'emphasizes the insecurity' in the region on which China could be looking to capitalize, said Alex Vines, Africa program director at Chatham House. 'There is a mercantilist, commercial element to Wang’s trip, which is to look at where to expand on market share, and Nigeria and Chad are very much in the market for defense sales and diversifying their security partnerships,' Vines told VOA. In fact, China has already surpassed Russia as the top arms supplier to sub-Saharan Africa. Oluwole Ojewale, a Nigerian researcher with the Institute for Security Studies, said Nigeria has had trouble in the past buying weapons from the U.S. due to alleged rights violations, which has prompted it to look elsewhere. 'For the case of Chad and most countries who are decoupling from the France security partnership … it is almost expected that they also need to look for other international partners that can provide some form of help in terms of armaments, in terms of training,' Ojewale said of the Chinese announcement. Macron raises ire Chad in December became the latest Sahel country to kick out French troops that had been operating military bases in the country for years, following the lead of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger. Senegal and Ivory Coast have also now asked French forces to withdraw. The trend comes amid rising anti-French sentiment in a region that has been dubbed Africa’s 'coup belt' for the number of military takeovers in recent years. French President Emmanuel Macron heightened such sentiment last week when he said France’s former colonies 'forgot to say thank you' for Paris’ security efforts in West Africa, adding that 'none of them would be in a sovereign country today if the French army had not been deployed in this region.' The U.S. has also been made to pull out of the Sahel, with Niger demanding Washington withdraw about 1,000 troops last year and close its largest drone base in Africa. The U.S. has been struggling to maintain influence in the region, where it had been supporting counter-terror efforts for years. The Pentagon is currently looking at maintaining a smaller force presence in the region. Some West African countries, such as Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, have turned for help to Russia, which publicly emphasizes its lack of colonial history. China takes a similar tack, positioning itself as a fellow 'Global South' developing country that doesn’t preach to Africa on human rights or other issues. Of Macron’s 'clumsiness,' Vines said, 'China will kind of capitalize on it … and the Chinese will privately point out, look, you know, this is what’s different from us.' Paul Nantulya, a China analyst at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, noted that China has recently become bolder in taking advantage of the French vacuum by delivering batches of high-end security equipment to Sahel countries over the last 15 months. 'And at the FOCAC summit, the representatives of these military regimes were received very, very well in Beijing,' he said, adding that they also visited weapons manufacturers during their time in China. Filling a vacuum At FOCAC, China also emphasized its Global Security Initiative (GSI), which was proposed by President Xi Jinping in 2022 as an alternative to the existing world order in terms of solving conflicts and ensuring peace. China’s vision of a foreign security policy includes seeking 'the biggest common denominator and the widest converging interests, rather than create closed small circles or reshape the existing international security order.' While the initiative may signal China’s desire to play a bigger role in international politics, Cobus van Staden, a China researcher with the South African Institute for International Affairs, said Beijing is anti-interventionist and while it might provide training, it’s not going to commit to being a security provider itself. 'Overall, what struck me about the comments was that while they were talking about this kind of military cooperation, Wang was always framing that under the Global Security Initiative which focuses on self-sufficiency rather than external security provisions,' he told VOA. Deborah Brautigam, director of the Chinese Africa research Initiative at Johns Hopkins University, echoed this. 'Military aid and training are low-key, low-cost forms of support that also help open markets to Chinese arms exports. They’re opportunistic and unlikely to be a pathway into the stationing of troops or deeper military engagement,' she told VOA. Christian Geraud Neema, Africa editor at the China-Global South Project, said he thinks China will stay away from getting directly involved in African crises to 'avoid any blowback in case of failures.' 'When speaking with decision-makers on the continent, many have a hard time telling you what China's GSI is about and how concretely it can fit to their context,' he added. 'So many of them consider China an easier option for military equipment than anything else.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/sahel-vacuum-provides-opportunities-for-china-analysts-say/7935372.html	2025-01-13T12:45:26-08:00	
Rights activist links brief kidnapping in Kenya to Tanzanian government	Nairobi, Kenya — A Tanzanian human rights activist who was briefly abducted on Sunday says she was targeted because of her comments accusing the government of abusing and oppressing its people. Maria Sarungi Tsehai was kidnapped in Nairobi by unidentified gunmen, alarming fellow activists. Tanzanian human rights activist Maria Sarungi Tsehai said she is fortunate to be free after armed men abducted her in Kenya’s capital Sunday afternoon. Tsehai said she was out walking when three men grabbed her, bundled her into a vehicle and physically assaulted her as they tried to establish her identity and gain access to her mobile phone. 'I am sure part of the abduction was to get access to my devices and to get access to the activities I do online, which sometimes include whistleblowing and also doing a lot about abductions in Tanzania. That's the first thing I felt they really wanted,' she said. The Tanzanian national, who has been living in Kenya for the past four years, has criticized her country’s government and the ruling party for alleged human rights violations and for closing civic space for critics, journalists, opposition groups, and politicians. The armed men eventually abandoned her on a street in the dark and told her not to look back. Tsehai said she was able to secure some of her belongings and money and take a cab ride home, where she contacted family members and supporters who had posted on social media about her disappearance, and had trooped to police stations trying to find her. There was no immediate comment from Tanzanian officials on the alleged abduction. Kenya has seen an increase in the abduction of foreigners in recent months. Several Turkish asylum seekers were abducted in October, and four of them were sent back to their country, a move that has angered the United Nations and rights groups. A month later, Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye found himself in front of a Ugandan military court; his wife said he was kidnapped in Nairobi. Roland Ebole is an East African regional researcher at Amnesty International. He said the kidnapping trend is not good for Kenya if it wants to attract foreign business and diplomatic activity. 'This is a very dangerous precedent for Kenya, considering that we host many expatriates in this country. Kenya is set to be the third largest U.N. hub in the world, and when foreign nationals do not feel protected, they don't feel secure in this country, then this is really dangerous,' he said. Rights groups such as Amnesty are also following up on the abduction of Kenyan government critics, a trend that started after anti-government protests in June and July that included the storming of parliament by critics of a bill to increase taxes. Despite the recent human rights violations in Kenya, Tsehai said she feels safer in Kenya than in Tanzania due to its vibrant citizens' movement for good governance, rights, and the rule of law. 'What I experienced yesterday, I don't know how many people know when you are being abducted and you see people fighting for you, and they don't know who you are. That gives me a sense. Later, I was told that social media Kenyans were trending and commenting about it as if I was one of their own. The second that gives me safety and security, unlike in Tanzania, there is a rule of law,' she said. Tanzania is expected to hold a general election later this year, and rights groups and opposition groups are already predicting the government will attempt to stifle dissent and political activity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rights-activist-links-brief-kidnapping-in-kenya-to-tanzanian-government/7935276.html	2025-01-13T11:43:23-08:00	
Pakistan claims killing 27 Baloch insurgents	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan reported Monday that its security forces raided a 'terrorists’ location' in southwestern Balochistan province and killed 27 insurgents during what was described as an intelligence-driven operation. A military statement said that 'multiple hideouts, including caches of arms, ammunition, and explosives, were also destroyed during the operation' in the central Kachhi district of the large but sparsely populated province. The announcement noted that law enforcement agencies wanted the slain insurgents for allegedly orchestrating 'terrorist activities' against security personnel and civilians in the district, where the outlawed separatist Baloch Liberation Army (BLA) and its allies are active. VOA could not immediately verify the official claims from independent sources, nor have Baloch insurgents commented on them. Regional experts describe BLA as the largest and most lethal of all the separatist groups active in natural resources-rich Balochistan, which sits on Pakistan’s border with Iran and Afghanistan. The group, designated as a global terrorist organization by the United States, has claimed almost all local attacks in recent months, killing and injuring hundreds of people, mainly security forces. Last week, dozens of heavily armed BLA fighters invaded the town of Zehri in the Khuzdar district of the province. They briefly took control of government facilities, including a security installation, and robbed a bank before setting several buildings on fire and escaping the area, according to the insurgent group and Pakistani officials. The daring daylight insurgent attack sparked criticism regarding an alleged delay in the response of Pakistani security forces to the BLA strikes. 'Those responsible must explain how terrorists were able to commandeer the area for eight hours,' the English-language DAWN newspaper wrote in a subsequent editorial. The provincial government initiated an investigation into the attack, resulting in the dismissal of over a dozen members of the paramilitary Balochistan Levies force for their alleged failure to resist the insurgents and surrender their weapons. Insurgents allege that the central and provincial Pakistani governments exploit Balochistan’s natural resources, such as gold and copper, while disregarding the poverty-stricken local population. Islamabad rejects the charges as baseless, saying that massive infrastructure development projects are underway in the province, including those funded by China. BLA has also targeted Chinese nationals associated with some of the projects in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-claims-killing-27-baloch-insurgents/7935268.html	2025-01-13T11:35:15-08:00	
Judge clears way for release of special counsel Smith's report on Trump's Jan. 6 case	WASHINGTON — The Justice Department can publicly release its investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump's 2020 election interference case, a federal judge said Monday — the latest ruling in a court dispute over the highly anticipated document days before Trump is set to take office again. But a temporary injunction barring the immediate release of the report remains in effect until Tuesday, and it's unlikely U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon's order will be the last word on the matter. Defense lawyers may seek to challenge it all the way up to the Supreme Court. Cannon had earlier temporarily blocked the department from releasing the entire report on former Special Counsel Jack Smith's investigations into Trump that led to two separate criminal cases. Cannon's latest order on Monday cleared the way for the release of the volume on Trump's 2020 election interference case. She set a hearing for Friday on whether the department can release to lawmakers the volume on Trump's classified documents case. The department has said it will not publicly disclose that volume as long as criminal proceedings against two of Trump's co-defendants remain pending. Smith resigned his position on Friday after transmitting his report to Attorney General Merrick Garland, the Justice Department revealed in a footnote in a court filing over the weekend. The ruling, if it stands, could open the door for the public to learn additional details in the coming days about Trump's frantic but ultimately failed effort to cling to power in the run-up to the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection at the Capitol. But even as Cannon permitted the release of the volume on election interference, she halted the Justice Department from immediately sharing with congressional officials a separate volume related to Trump's hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach, Florida. Lawyers for the Republican president-elect's two co-defendants, Trump valet Walt Nauta and Mar-a-Lago property manager Carlos De Oliveira, had argued that the release of the report would prejudice them given that criminal proceedings remain ongoing against them in the form of a Justice Department appeal of Cannon's dismissal of charges. As a compromise, the Justice Department said that it would not make that document public but would instead share it with select congressional officials for their private review. But Cannon halted those plans and instead scheduled a hearing for Friday afternoon. 'All parties agree that Volume II expressly and directly concerns this criminal proceeding,' she wrote. 'All parties also appear to agree that public release of Volume II would be inconsistent with the fair trial rights of Defendants Nauta and De Oliveira and with Department of Justice Policy governing the release of information during the pendency of criminal proceedings.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-clears-way-for-release-of-special-counsel-smith-s-report-on-trump-s-jan-6-case-/7935226.html	2025-01-13T10:42:47-08:00	
Haitian police arrest ex-lawmaker accused of arming gangs to influence elections	PORT-AU-PRINCE — Police in Haiti have arrested a former legislator long accused of arming gangs in the country’s central region and previously sanctioned by the U.S. and Canada. Prophane Victor, an ex-member of Parliament who represented the Petite Riviere community of the Artibonite region, was arrested Sunday in the capital, Port-au-Prince, according to Haiti’s National Police. It wasn’t immediately clear if Victor had an attorney. His arrest marks a rare win for Haitian police in a country where high-ranking politicians accused in killings and gang activity often act with impunity and move about the country freely. Police said in a statement that a former gang leader had accused Victor several times of colluding with gang members operating in Artibonite, especially in the community of Savien. Meanwhile, a U.N. report released last year noted that Victor began arming young men in Petite Riviere to secure his 2016 election win. Those men eventually formed Gran Grif, the largest gang in Artibonite. The report noted that Victor had a falling out with Gran Grif in 2020 'as a result of unfulfilled promises made during the election period.' Since then, officials accused Victor of supporting rival gangs. Canada sanctioned Victor in June 2023 as did the U.S. in September 2024, accusing him of supporting gangs 'that have committed serious human rights abuse.' In October, the Gran Grif gang was accused of killings dozens of people in one of the biggest massacres in Haiti’s recent history. The massacre occurred in the community of Pont-Sonde, located in the Artibonite region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/haitian-police-arrest-ex-lawmaker-accused-of-arming-gangs-to-influence-elections-/7935101.html	2025-01-13T09:37:14-08:00	
US designates extreme right-wing 'Terrorgram' network as terrorist group	WASHINGTON — The U.S. on Monday imposed sanctions on an extreme right-wing online network, designating the 'Terrorgram' collective a terrorist group and accusing it of promoting violent white supremacy. The U.S. State Department said in a statement that it had designated the group, which primarily operates on the Telegram social media site, and three of its leaders as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. The State Department said the group has motivated and facilitated attacks and attempted attacks by users, including a 2022 shooting outside an LGBTQ bar in Slovakia, a planned attack in 2024 on energy facilities in New Jersey and an August knife attack at a mosque in Turkey. 'The group promotes violent white supremacism, solicits attacks on perceived adversaries, and provides guidance and instructional materials on tactics, methods, and targets for attacks, including on critical infrastructure and government officials,' the State Department said. The action freezes any of the group's U.S. assets and bars Americans from dealing with it. The leaders targeted on Monday with sanctions were based in Brazil, Croatia and South Africa, according to the statement. In September, U.S. prosecutors unveiled criminal charges against two alleged leaders of the group, saying they used Telegram to solicit attacks on Black, Jewish, LGBTQ people and immigrants with the aim of inciting a race war. Britain in April said it would proscribe the Terrorgram collective as a terrorist organization, meaning it would become a criminal offense in the country to belong to or promote the group. U.S. President Joe Biden has railed against white supremacy while in office. In 2021, Biden launched the first-ever U.S. National Strategy for Countering Domestic Terrorism, which included resources to identify and prosecute threats and new deterrents to prevent Americans from joining dangerous groups.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-designates-extreme-right-wing-terrorgram-network-as-terrorist-group/7935044.html	2025-01-13T09:16:35-08:00	
Lebanon's Salam wins enough support to become PM, angering Hezbollah	BEIRUT — Nawaf Salam, the head of the International Court of Justice, won enough support to become Lebanon's next prime minister after a majority of lawmakers backed him for the post on Monday, a big blow to Hezbollah which accused opponents of working to exclude it. The support for Salam underlined the major shift in the power balance among Lebanon's sectarian factions since the Shi'ite group Hezbollah was pummeled in a war with Israel last year, and its Syrian ally Bashar al-Assad was toppled. Senior Hezbollah lawmaker Mohammed Raad, whose Iran-backed group had wanted incumbent Najib Mikati to stay in the post, said Hezbollah's opponents were working for fragmentation and exclusion. He said the group had 'extended its hand' by electing Joseph Aoun as president last week only to find the 'hand cut.' Last week's election of army commander General Aoun, who enjoys the support of the United States and Saudi Arabia, was another sign of shifts in the political landscape, in which Hezbollah had long held decisive sway. Aoun, a Maronite Christian, was holding consultations over the choice of prime minister with parliament's 128 lawmakers on Monday. He is obliged to pick the candidate with the greatest number of votes. Salam had secured the backing of 85 of the lawmakers by Monday afternoon, with the consultations yet to conclude. The prime minister must be a Sunni Muslim according to Lebanon's sectarian power-sharing system which parcels out state positions on the basis of religious affiliation. The presidency goes to a Maronite Christian and the speaker of parliament must be a Shiite Muslim. Hezbollah lawmakers attended their meeting with Aoun later than scheduled, delaying their arrival as they saw the momentum building behind Salam, a Hezbollah source said. Hezbollah believed a political understanding had been reached on Mikati's election before the group agreed to elect Aoun last week, the source said. Sunni and Christian allies of Hezbollah were among those who named Salam. Faisal Karami, a Sunni lawmaker aligned with the group, said he had nominated Salam, citing demands for 'change and renewal' and Arab and international support for Lebanon. Aoun's election and the designation of a new premier are steps towards reviving Lebanese government institutions which have been paralyzed for more than two years, with the country having neither a head of state nor a fully empowered cabinet. The new administration faces huge tasks including rebuilding areas leveled by Israeli airstrikes during the war with Hezbollah, and launching long-stalled reforms to revive the economy and address the root causes of the collapse of Lebanon's financial system in 2019. In his former role as commander of the U.S.-backed army, Aoun played a critical role in the implementation of a U.S.-brokered ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah. The terms require the Lebanese army to deploy into south Lebanon as Israeli troops and Hezbollah withdraw forces. Raad said Hezbollah would follow the next steps, and 'proceed with calm and wisdom, out of concern for the national interest, and we will see their actions ... to expel the occupier from our land.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-s-salam-wins-enough-support-to-become-pm-angering-hezbollah/7935008.html	2025-01-13T08:25:51-08:00	
Russia says Iran's president will visit this week, sign partnership pact with Putin	Moscow — Russian President Vladimir Putin will host his Iranian counterpart this week for the signing of a broad partnership pact between Moscow and Tehran, the Kremlin said Monday. The agreement on 'comprehensive strategic partnership' between the countries will be signed during Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's visit to Moscow on Friday, the Kremlin said. It added that the leaders will discuss plans for expanding trade and cooperation in transport, logistics and humanitarian spheres along with 'acute issues on the regional and international agenda.' Ukraine and the West have accused Tehran of providing Moscow with hundreds of exploding drones for use on the battlefield in Ukraine and helping launch their production in Russia. The Iranian drone deliveries, which Moscow and Tehran have denied, have allowed for a barrage of long-range drone strikes on Ukraine's infrastructure. Iran, in turn, wants sophisticated Russian weapons like long-range air defense systems and fighter jets to help fend off possible attacks by Israel. Pezeshkian will visit Moscow three days before the inauguration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has pledged to broker a peace deal on Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-iran-s-president-will-visit-this-week-sign-partnership-pact-with-putin/7934862.html	2025-01-13T07:05:03-08:00	
At least 40 farmers killed by Islamic militants in northeast Nigeria, official says	Dakar, Senegal — At least 40 farmers were killed in an attack by Islamic militants in northeast Nigeria's Borno state, a government official said Monday. The attack Sunday was suspected to have been carried out by extremists from the Boko Haram group and its breakaway faction that is loyal to the Islamic State group in Borno's Dumba community, said Borno state Gov. Babagana Umara Zulum. He warned civilians to stay within designated 'safe zones' that have been cleared by the army of both extremists and munitions. Zulum also called for an investigation into the attack by the armed forces. 'Let me assure the citizens of Borno that this matter will be thoroughly investigated for further necessary action. Let me use this opportunity to call on the armed forces to track and deal decisively with the perpetrators of this heinous act of violence against our innocent citizens,' he said. Boko Haram, Nigeria's homegrown jihadis, took up arms in 2009 to fight Western education and impose their radical version of Islamic law. The conflict, now Africa's longest struggle with militancy, has spilled into Nigeria's northern neighbors. Some 35,000 civilians have been killed and more than 2 million have been displaced in the northeastern region, according to the U.N. The 2014 kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls by Boko Haram in the village of Chibok in Borno state — the epicenter of the conflict — captured the attention of the world.	https://www.voanews.com/a/farmers-killed-by-islamic-militants-in-northeast-nigeria-official-says/7934904.html	2025-01-13T07:04:41-08:00

Magnitude 6.9 earthquake rattles southwestern Japan, followed by tsunami warning	Tokyo — A strong earthquake with a preliminary magnitude of 6.9 has hit southwestern Japan, the country's Meteorological Agency said Monday. Tsunami warnings were issued for Miyazaki Prefecture, where the temblor was centered, in the southwestern island of Kyushu, as well as nearby Kochi Prefecture, shortly after the quake struck at 9:19 p.m. local time, according to the agency. The extent of damage was not immediately clear. Japan is frequently hit by earthquakes because of its location along the 'Ring of Fire,' an arc of volcanoes and fault lines in the Pacific Basin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/earthquake-rattles-southwestern-japan-followed-by-tsunami-warning/7934799.html	2025-01-13T05:46:55-08:00	
Taiwan's spy agency says China is working with gangs, shell companies to gain intelligence on Taiwan	TAIPEI, Taiwan — Taiwan's intelligence bureau says China's main spy agency is working with criminal gangs, shell companies and other dubious partners to gain intelligence on Taiwan's defenses, resulting in a major rise in those arrested for alleged espionage on the island. Current and retired Taiwanese military personnel are a special concern, accounting for around half of the 64 alleged spies put on trial last year, it said. That number is up from 16 in 2021 and 10 in 2022. The arrests are in line with China's stepped-up campaign of military intimidation, economic coercion and 'gray area' tactics such as utilizing the internet to promote unification and providing all-expense-paid trips to China to low-level government officials. According to a report released over the weekend by Taiwan's National Security Bureau, Chinese agents have sought to use the Taiwanese underworld to channel funds to those with information to sell. Gangs, many with origins dating to before the 1949 split between the two sides, are sought out, along with loan sharks, shell companies that can be used to launder funds, religious sects that sometimes engage in illegal activity, and non-profit groups, the report said. Some payments are made in cryptocurrency, while old-fashioned methods are also used such as sexual seduction to trap unsuspecting targets and pressure them to reveal secrets. That was the case of a one-star general, Lo Hsien-che, who was caught in such a scheme while stationed in Thailand, the bureau said. Among those arrested last year were 23 people working together in a spy ring, one of whom was sentenced to 20 years in prison, it said. China's main spy agency, the State Security Ministry, runs programs relying on traditional spy craft and cyberattacks, along with military intelligence, while the party's United Front division runs propaganda campaigns. China's ruling Communist Party, which refuses most contact with Taiwan's governing pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, has frequent contacts with the main opposition Nationalist Party. Chinese tactics may have had some effect on local elections, but the DPP appears to be firmly in control and the vast majority of Taiwanese still favor maintaining their de facto independence, backed by strong support from the U.S. China's recruitment of retired military personnel has been facilitated by many having been born in mainland China and backing unification between Taiwan and the mainland. Taiwan's government has enacted time limits on when retired senior officers can visit the mainland and under what circumstances in an attempt to prevent their recruitment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-spy-agency-says-china-is-working-with-gangs-shell-companies-to-gain-intelligence-on-taiwan-/7934787.html	2025-01-13T05:34:31-08:00	
India's Modi inaugurates strategic tunnel in disputed Kashmir	JAMMU, India — India's prime minister marked Monday the opening of a tunnel in the northeast of disputed Kashmir that will grant all-year accessibility to a town that is isolated by heavy snow each winter. The $932 million project includes a second tunnel and a series of bridges and high mountain roads that will link Kashmir with Ladakh, a cold desert region nestled between India, Pakistan and China that has faced territorial disputes for decades. Amid high security, Narendra Modi visited the resort town of Sonamarg where he inaugurated the 6.5-kilometer tunnel. The town denotes the end of the conifer-clad mountains of the Kashmir Valley before Ladakh begins across the rocky Zojila mountain pass. The tunnel, named Z-Morh, will now grant it accessibility for the first time all year round. The second tunnel, about 14 kilometers long, will bypass the challenging Zojila pass and connect Sonamarg with Ladakh and is expected to be completed in 2026. Sonamarg and Ladakh have been plagued with severe snowfalls that close the mountain passes due to massive snowfalls, forcing them to remain cut off from neighboring towns for nearly six months every year. Authorities on Monday deployed police and soldiers in the area and established multiple checkpoints at key intersections as an enhanced security measure for the prime minister's visit. Troops also stationed sharpshooters at several points and carried out drone surveillance to ensure constant vigilance. Modi later at a public meeting, attended by hundreds of people in freezing weather, said the ambitious project would improve road connectivity and boost tourism in the region. The meeting also was attended by some of Modi's Cabinet ministers and Kashmir's chief minister Omar Abdullah. Experts say the tunnel project is important to the military, which will gain significantly improved capabilities to operate in Ladakh while also providing civilians with freedom of movement year-round between the Kashmir Valley and Ladakh. In October, gunmen fatally shot at least seven people working on the tunnel project and injured at least five others. Police blamed insurgents fighting for decades against Indian rule in the region. In 2019, New Delhi stripped Kashmir's special status as a semi-autonomous region with a separate constitution and inherited protections on land and jobs. The federal government also downgraded and divided the former state into two centrally governed union territories, Ladakh and Jammu-Kashmir, the first time in the history of India that a region's statehood was downgraded to a federally administered territory. India and Pakistan each administer a part of Kashmir, but both claim the territory in its entirety. Militants in the Indian-controlled portion of Kashmir have been fighting New Delhi's rule since 1989. Many Muslim Kashmiris support the rebels' goal of uniting the territory, either under Pakistani rule or as an independent country. India insists the Kashmir militancy is Pakistan-sponsored terrorism. Pakistan denies the charge, and many Kashmiris consider it a legitimate freedom struggle. Tens of thousands of civilians, rebels and government forces have been killed in the conflict. Indian and Chinese soldiers have been engaged in a military standoff in Ladakh since 2020 even as Beijing and New Delhi agreed in October on patrols in disputed areas. Both countries have stationed tens of thousands of soldiers along their frontier, backed by artillery, tanks and fighter jets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-modi-inaugurates-a-strategic-tunnel-in-disputed-kashmir/7934753.html	2025-01-13T04:52:43-08:00	
Biden administration unveils new rules for AI chip, model exports	— The Biden administration announced Monday new restrictions on the export of the most advanced artificial intelligence chips and proprietary parameters used to govern the interactions of users with AI systems. The rule, which will undergo a 120-day period for public comments, comes in response to what administration officials described as a need to protect national security while also clarifying the rules under which companies in trusted partner countries could access the emerging technology in order to promote innovation. 'Over the coming years, AI will become really ubiquitous in every business application in every industry around the world, with enormous potential for enhanced productivity and societal, healthcare and economic benefits,' Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told reporters. 'That being said, as AI becomes more powerful, the risks to our national security become even more intense.' A senior administration official said the new rule will not include any restrictions on chip sales to Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, United Kingdom or the United States. Countries that are under U.S. arms embargoes are already subject to export restrictions on advanced AI chips, but a senior administration official said they will now be under restrictions for the transfer of the most powerful closed weight AI models. The weights in an AI model determine how it processes the inputs from a user and determines what to provide the user as a response, according to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration. In a closed weight system, those parameters are secret, unlike with an open weight system in which users could see the settings the model is using to make its decisions. The majority of countries — those not included in the close partner or arms embargo lists — will not face licensing requirements for obtaining the equivalent of 1,700 of the most advanced AI chips currently available, nor for any less advanced chips. Companies in the United States and allied countries will not face restrictions in using the most powerful closed weight AI systems, provided they are stored under adequate security, a senior administration official said. 'I think the key point I would underscore is that we identified really some of the closest security allies of the United States that have effectively implemented and have a well-documented record of upholding a robust AI technology protection regime, and generally have technology ecosystems that promote the use of AI and other advanced technologies consistent with our national security and foreign policy interests,' a senior administration official said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-unveils-new-rules-for-ai-chip-model-exports-/7934695.html	2025-01-13T04:00:01-08:00	
Los Angeles firefighter loses home in Eaton Fire	The deadly fires in the Los Angeles area have persisted for a week amid firefighters’ efforts to contain the infernos, which had killed at least 24 people by Sunday. Officials say more than 7,000 structures have gone up in flames in what has been called the Eaton Fire, including the home of a firefighter. VOA’s Genia Dulot met with him and his family.	https://www.voanews.com/a/los-angeles-firefighter-loses-home-in-eaton-fire/7934653.html	2025-01-13T02:44:28-08:00	
Mozambique to swear in new parliament after disputed vote	Maputo, Mozambique — Mozambique is set to swear in its new parliament on Monday, following months of deadly protests over an election in October that the opposition said was rigged. Opposition leader Venancio Mondlane has called on his supporters to hold peaceful protests from Monday to Wednesday, when Daniel Chapo is due to be installed as president. Mondlane said he won the presidential vote and that the results were rigged in favor of Chapo's Frelimo party, which has been in power for 50 years. Two opposition parties, Renamo and MDM, announced they would boycott Monday's session, which will swear in new parliamentarians. Renamo won 28 seats in the 250-seat house and the Democratic Movement of Mozambique (MDM) took eight. The opening ceremony 'constitutes a social outrage and a lack of respect for the will of Mozambicans' who were deprived of 'free, fair and transparent' elections, Renamo spokesman Marcial Macome told reporters Sunday. The MDM was boycotting to show it aligned itself with demands for 'electoral truth,' its representative said. Frelimo won 171 seats and the Podemos party took 43. Mondlane, who was backed by the Podemos at the vote, claims he won 53 percent of the votes in the presidential election. The official result says he won 24 percent to Chapo's 65 percent. Mondlane returned from more than two months of exile on Thursday last week to push his presidency claims. Thousands of his supporters rallied in the capital to welcome him, sparking clashes with security forces that left at least three dead, according to an election monitor. 'We must declare a national strike... paralyze activities during these three days,' the 50-year-old said in a Facebook post late Saturday. Urging supporters to 'demonstrate our refusal' of the official election result, he called for a 'peaceful mobilization,' adding that 'if the assembly takes the oath, it is a betrayal of the will of the people.' 'Let us demonstrate against the inauguration of those who betrayed the will of the people on Monday and against those who stole the will of the people on Wednesday,' Mondlane said. The post-election unrest has claimed around 300 lives, according to a tally by a local rights group, with security forces accused of using excessive force, including live bullets, against demonstrators. Some police officers have also died, according to the authorities. The unrest has caused major losses to Mozambique's economy, stopping cross-border trade and affecting shipping, mining and industry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-to-swear-in-new-parliament-after-disputed-vote/7934647.html	2025-01-13T02:18:25-08:00	
Exhausted' Frenchman held in Iran since 2022 reveals identity	PARIS — A Frenchman held in Iran since October 2022 on Monday revealed his identity in an audio message broadcast on a French radio station, saying he was becoming increasingly exhausted over his ordeal. Olivier Grondeau, 34, had previously only been identified by his first name and French authorities had not released details of his case. In an audio message aired on France Inter on Monday, Grondeau fully identified himself and warned that he and the other two French detainees held in Iran were 'exhausted.' The other two French nationals currently held in Iran are teacher Cecile Kohler and her partner, Jacques Paris, who were detained in May 2022. They are accused of seeking to stir up labor protests, accusations their families have vehemently denied. 'You, who have the power to influence this matter, hear this truth,' he said in the audio message, apparently addressing the French authorities. 'Cecile's strength, Jacques' strength, Olivier's strength — it is all running out,' he said. 'Your responsibility is called upon to ensure the survival of three human beings,' he said. Grondeau was arrested in Shiraz, in southern Iran, in October 2022, and sentenced to five years in prison for 'conspiracy against the Islamic republic,' his mother Therese Grondeau told France Inter. His family rejects the charges, describing Grondeau as a passionate fan of Persian poetry who was traveling to Iran on a tourist visa as part of a world tour. On Friday, France summoned the Iranian ambassador to protest Tehran's holding of the trio, describing them as 'state hostages.' Their 'situation is intolerable, with undignified detention conditions that, for some, constitute torture under international law,' the French foreign ministry said. The tensions have come after an Italian journalist, Cecilia Sala, arrested and jailed in Iran since December, was freed and returned to Rome earlier this month. Her swift release — in contrast to the prolonged detention of the French nationals — was the result of 'intense work through diplomatic and intelligence channels' by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government, her office said. Foreign ministries whose nationals have been held by Iran are known to sometimes advise families to keep a low profile and not announce the arrest of their loved ones publicly, in the hope the situation can be resolved behind the scenes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exhausted-frenchman-held-in-iran-since-2022-reveals-identity/7934638.html	2025-01-13T02:05:36-08:00	
Thai cabinet approves controversial casino bill	BANGKOK — Thailand's cabinet approved a controversial bill on Monday to legalize gambling in designated 'entertainment complexes' to boost tourism and create jobs. The proposed law would allow casinos to be set up within tourism complexes that would also include theme parks, water parks, hotels and shopping malls. Gambling in Thailand is currently only legal on certain state-run horse races and an official lottery, but illicit betting is widespread. 'The objectives are to increase revenue, support investment in Thailand and solve illegal gambling,' Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra told reporters. The bill will go to the Office of the Council of State for drafting before being debated and voted on by lawmakers in parliament -- a process that will likely take months. Since the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, which hammered Thailand's crucial tourism industry, the kingdom has launched numerous strategies to lure more visitors, such as cutting visa requirements for Chinese and Indian travelers. Deputy Finance Minister Julapun Amornvivat said the government hopes the entertainment complexes will ultimately boost tourist numbers by 5%-10% and create up to 15,000 new jobs. The location for the proposed complexes, and the timetable for their construction, have not been announced. Conservative forces in Buddhist-majority Thailand have long resisted moves to legalize gambling, even as casino complexes have sprung up in neighboring Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. The U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime warned in a report last year that Southeast Asia's casinos were 'foundational pieces of the banking architecture used by organized crime' to launder massive volumes of money.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thai-cabinet-approves-controversial-casino-bill/7934629.html	2025-01-13T01:49:39-08:00	
Forecasters warn of ‘explosive fire growth’ conditions amid deadly California wildfires	Firefighters in southern California are battling to bring multiple major Los Angeles area wildfires under control Monday as forecasters warn of renewed strong winds that could cause 'explosive fire growth.' The new wind threat, with the biggest concern happening Tuesday, is expected to bring sustained winds of 80 kph and gusts up to about 110 kph, the National Weather Service warned. Strong winds and dry conditions in an area that has not received significant rainfall for more than eight months helped fuel the fires that have already killed at least 24 people and caused billions of dollars in damage since they began a week ago. A brief reprieve in the winds in recent days allowed firefighters aided by air drops of water and fire retardant to make some progress in bringing the blazes under control. Of the three major fires still burning in the Los Angeles area, Cal Fire said late Sunday the Palisades Fire was 13% contained and has burned 96 square kilometers. Eight of the deaths were attributed to the Palisades Fire in the Pacific Palisades area, officials said. Sixteen deaths were from the Eaton Fire, located farther inland in North Pasadena and Altadena, which was 27% contained and has burned nearly 60 square kilometers. Another blaze, the Hurst Fire in the Sylmar area, was 89% contained, Cal Fire said, after burning more than three square kilometers. The fires together have destroyed more than 12,000 structures. About 100,000 people remained under evacuation orders late Sunday, with officials saying people would not be allowed back in fire risk areas while the new wind warnings were still in place. Some schools that had canceled classes last week were resuming operations Monday. The National Basketball Association’s Los Angeles Lakers and Los Angeles Clippers were also set to resume home games Monday after canceling games due to the fires. Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned art works, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top public U.S. universities. California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' on Sunday that the wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, 'in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope.' A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground is among the costliest in the country. Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on, with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the blazes as they quickly spread out of control. The governor said he is asking the same questions 'that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?’ Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply overwhelmed, 'Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was really no firefight that could've been more meaningful?' Firefighting crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday he told officials to prepare for the possibility of sending 150 Ukrainian firefighters to help the effort in California. 'The situation there is extremely difficult, and Ukrainians can help Americans save lives,' Zelenskyy said. Some information for this story was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/forecasters-warn-of-explosive-fire-growth-conditions-amid-deadly-california-wildfires/7934627.html	2025-01-13T01:41:01-08:00	
South Korea says 300 North Korean soldiers killed in Ukraine	Around 300 North Korean soldiers have been killed and 2,700 others injured in Russia’s war in Ukraine, South Korea’s spy agency told lawmakers in a closed briefing Monday. The National Intelligence Service said it had participated in the interrogation of several North Korean troops who were captured by Ukrainian forces. The briefing came days after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced the capture of two North Korean soldiers during fighting in Russia’s Kursk region, where Ukrainian forces launched a surprise offensive in August. Zelenskyy said late Sunday he would send captured North Koreans back to their country if North Korean leader Kim Jong Un organizes a swap for Ukrainian soldiers being held in Russia. The Ukrainian leader said it is 'only a matter of time' before Ukraine captures more North Korean soldiers, and that Russia’s military 'is dependent on military assistance from North Korea.' Drone attacks Ukraine’s military said Monday it destroyed 78 of the 110 drones that Russian forces launched in overnight attacks targeting regions across the country. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Mykolaiv Governor Vitaliy Kim said on Telegram that falling drone fragments damaged several houses, but did not hurt anyone. Russian shelling in his region injured one person, Kim said Monday. In Sumy, officials said Russian attacks caused a fire at a residential building and injured one person. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it destroyed six Ukrainian drones over the Voronezh region, as well as one drone over Belgorod and another drone over Bryansk. The ministry also said Monday that a Ukrainian drone attack Saturday targeted the TurkStream gas pipeline that is used to send Russian gas to Turkey and Europe. Russian air defenses shot down all of the drones involved in the attack, and there were no casualties, the ministry said.

Australian counter-terrorism police probe rise in antisemitic hate crimes	SYDNEY — Australian authorities are warning of escalating acts of antisemitism, which are now being investigated by counter-terrorism officers. A synagogue in Sydney, the country’s most populous city, was defaced Saturday with hate symbols and an attempt was made to start a fire. Red swastikas were daubed along the front fence of the synagogue in the latest act of hate thought to be linked to conflicts in the Middle East. Security images released by the police show two people wearing black hooded jackets and dark clothing outside the building. Authorities say the vandalism was an act of 'violence, hatred and racism.' New South Wales Police Commissioner Karen Webb on Sunday told reporters that every effort was being made to catch those responsible. 'I appeal to anyone out there who knows who has perpetrated these disgusting offenses to come forward and tell police who they are,' Webb said. 'We will continue pursuing them until we find them.' Counter-terrorism police have taken over all the investigations into recent hate attacks on synagogues and other properties in the Australian state of New South Wales. Last Friday, the Allawah synagogue in Sydney was defaced in a separate incident by antisemitic graffiti. Penny Sharpe, the acting premier of New South Wales, told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Monday that a specialist counter-terrorism police unit would be in charge of the hate crimes investigations. 'They basically bring all of the intelligence we have about activity that is out there,' Sharpe said. 'They are able to coordinate at the local level and at the broader level and, really, call on and ask the community to also help as we get to the bottom of this and that we make sure that New South Wales is a safe place for everyone.' In a statement released to local media Sunday, the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, a prominent community organization, said the Jewish community remained 'unbowed' by attempts of intimidation. In December, a synagogue in Melbourne, Victoria was firebombed by assailants. Muslim groups also have recorded a surge in Islamophobic abuse since Israel’s war in Gaza began in October 2023. Last year, the government in Canberra set up specialist antisemitic and Islamophobia community envoys in an attempt to diffuse tensions in the Australian community.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australian-counter-terrorism-police-probe-rise-in-antisemitic-hate-crimes/7934602.html	2025-01-13T00:27:42-08:00	
South Korea plans to overhaul airport structures after fatal Jeju Air crash	Seoul, South Korea — South Korea said it planned to improve the structures housing the antennas that guide landings at its airports this year after December's fatal crash of a Jeju Air plane, which skidded off the runway and burst into flames after hitting such a structure. The country's transport ministry, which has been inspecting safety conditions at airlines and airports since the Boeing jet crashed at the southwestern Muan airport, announced on Monday the move to change the so-called 'localizer' structures. Seven domestic airports, including Muan, were found to have embankments or foundations made of concrete or steel that needed to be changed, the ministry said in a statement. It added that it would prepare measures to improve the structures by this month and it aimed to complete the improvements by the end of 2025. It did not provide details of the planned improvements. Aviation safety experts have criticized the placement of the embankment at Muan airport and said it likely raised the death toll of the crash, which killed 179 of the 181 people on board. The government has also finished its inspection of six domestic airlines flying Boeing 737-800s, and found violations at some operators including exceeding the period of inspection pre- and post-flight, and non-compliance with procedures to resolve plane defects or passenger boarding. The transport ministry declined to comment on whether Jeju Air was among the airlines where violations were found. A Jeju Air spokesperson could not be immediately reached for comment. A special safety inspection of the country's major airport facilities will also take place between Jan. 13-21, the ministry statement said. The government also extended the shutdown of Muan airport to Jan. 19, the ministry said in a separate statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-plans-to-overhaul-airport-structures-after-fatal-jeju-air-crash/7934598.html	2025-01-13T00:12:51-08:00	
Philippines files protest over Beijing's 'escalatory actions' in South China Sea	Manila, Philippines — The Philippines on Monday called on Beijing to desist from 'escalatory actions' at a South China Sea shoal and said a protest has been lodged over the presence of Chinese coast guard, militia and navy in its exclusive economic zone. The protest stems from the presence of two coast guard vessels on Jan. 5 and Jan. 10 in and around the disputed Scarborough shoal, one of which was a 165-meter-long boat referred to by the Philippines as 'the monster.' It said a Chinese navy helicopter was also deployed in the area. 'The escalatory actions of these Chinese vessels and aircraft disregard Philippine and international laws,' said the Philippines' national maritime council, an inter-agency group tasked with upholding the country's interests at sea. 'China should direct its vessels to desist from conducting illegal actions that violate Philippines' sovereign rights in its EEZ,' it said in a statement. China's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment. China says the Scarborough Shoal is its territory and has accused the Philippines of trespassing. Tensions between China and the U.S. ally the Philippines have escalated the past two years, with frequent run-ins between their coast guards in the South China Sea, which China claims sovereignty over almost in its entirety. The statement came just hours after Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. had a virtual call with U.S. President Joe Biden and Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba where the three leaders discussed China's conduct in the South China Sea. China's expansive claims overlap with the EEZs of Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam. The disputed waterway is a strategic shipping route through which about $3 trillion worth of commerce moves annually. A 2016 ruling of an international arbitral tribunal said Beijing's claims, based on its historic maps, have no basis under international law, a decision China does not recognize.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-files-protest-over-beijing-s-escalatory-actions-in-south-china-sea/7934590.html	2025-01-12T23:44:04-08:00	
China's rare earth exports in 2024 climb as home demand limited	BEIJING — China's exports of rare earth minerals rose 6% in 2024, customs data showed on Monday, as sputtering economic growth limited domestic demand. The world's largest producer of rare earths last year shipped 55,431 metric tons of 17 minerals used in the making of products ranging from electric vehicles to consumer electronics, General Administration of Customs data showed. That was the highest volume since Reuters' records back to 2014, but the total value of the exports slumped 36% to $488.8 million, the data showed, reflecting falling prices last year amid ample supply. The average spot price of praseodymium oxide in China, for example, fell 26% in 2024, following a drop of 37% in 2023, according to data from information provider Shanghai Metals Market (SMM). China exported 3,326 tons of rare earth minerals in December, down from 4,416 tons in November and 3,439 tons in December 2023. Imports China's rare earth imports last month dropped 41.1% from a year earlier to 9,645 tons, producing a 2024 total of 132,931 tons, down 24.4% from 2023. Analysts say the 2024 fall was mainly due to reduced supplies from the United States and Myanmar, the other two major producers of rare earths. An armed group fighting Myanmar's military regime said last October that it had taken control of a mining hub that is a major supplier of rare earth oxides to China, disrupting shipments. Imports from the U.S. and Myanmar slipped by 14.6% and 31.6% year-on-year, respectively, in the first 11 months of the year, China’s customs data showed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-rare-earth-exports-in-2024-climb-as-home-demand-limited/7934585.html	2025-01-12T23:35:24-08:00	
India kicks off Hindu festival touted as the world's largest religious gathering	PRAYAGRAJ, India — Millions of Hindu devotees, mystics and holy men and women from all across India flocked to the northern city of Prayagraj on Monday to kickstart the Maha Kumbh festival, which is being touted as the world's largest religious gathering. Over about the next six weeks, Hindu pilgrims with gather at the confluence of three sacred rivers — the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati — where they will take part in elaborate rituals, hoping to begin a journey to achieve Hindu philosophy's ultimate goal: the release from the cycle of rebirth. Here's what to know about the festival: A religious gathering at the confluence of three sacred rivers Hindus venerate rivers, and none more so than the Ganges and the Yamuna. The faithful believe that a dip in their waters will cleanse them of their past sins and end their process of reincarnation, particularly on auspicious days. The most propitious of these days occur in cycles of 12 years during a festival called the Maha Kumbh Mela, or pitcher festival. The festival is a series of ritual baths by Hindu sadhus, or holy men, and other pilgrims at the confluence of three sacred rivers that dates to at least medieval times. Hindus believe that the mythical Saraswati river once flowed from the Himalayas through Prayagraj, meeting there with the Ganges and the Yamuna. Bathing takes place every day, but on the most auspicious dates, naked, ash-smeared monks charge toward the holy rivers at dawn. Many pilgrims stay for the entire festival, observing austerity, giving alms and bathing at sunrise every day. 'We feel peaceful here and attain salvation from the cycles of life and death,' said Bhagwat Prasad Tiwari, a pilgrim. The festival has its roots in a Hindu tradition that says the god Vishnu wrested a golden pitcher containing the nectar of immortality from demons. Hindus believe that a few drops fell in the cities of Prayagraj, Nasik, Ujjain and Haridwar — the four places where the Kumbh festival has been held for centuries. The Kumbh rotates among these four pilgrimage sites about every three years on a date prescribed by astrology. This year's festival is the biggest and grandest of them all. A smaller version of the festival, called Ardh Kumbh, or Half Kumbh, was organized in 2019, when 240 million visitors were recorded, with about 50 million taking a ritual bath on the busiest day. Maha Kumb is the world's largest such gathering At least 400 million people — more than the population of the United States — are expected in Prayagraj over the next 45 days, according to officials. That is around 200 times the 2 million pilgrims that arrived in the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia for the annual Hajj pilgrimage last year. The festival is a big test for Indian authorities to showcase the Hindu religion, tourism and crowd management. A vast ground along the banks of the rivers has been converted into a sprawling tent city equipped with more 3,000 kitchens and 150,000 restrooms. Divided into 25 sections and spreading over 40 square kilometers (15 square miles), the tent city also has housing, roads, electricity and water, communication towers and 11 hospitals. Murals depicting stories from Hindu scriptures are painted on the city walls. Indian Railways has also introduced more than 90 special trains that will make nearly 3,300 trips during the festival to transport devotees, beside regular trains. About 50,000 security personnel — a 50% increase from 2019 — are also stationed in the city to maintain law and order and crowd management. More than 2,500 cameras, some powered by AI, will send crowd movement and density information to four central control rooms, where officials can quickly deploy personnel to avoid stampedes. The festival will boost Modi's support base India's past leaders have capitalized on the festival to strengthen their relationship with the country's Hindus, who make up nearly 80% of India's more than 1.4 billion people. But under Prime Minister Narendra Modi, the festival has become an integral part of its advocacy of Hindu nationalism. For Modi and his party, Indian civilization is inseparable from Hinduism, although critics say the party's philosophy is rooted in Hindu supremacy. The Uttar Pradesh state, headed by Adityanath — a powerful Hindu monk and a popular hard-line Hindu politician in Modi's party — has allocated more than $765 million for this year's event. It has also used the festival to boost his and the prime minister's image, with giant billboards and posters all over the city showing them both, alongside slogans touting their government welfare policies. The festival is expected to boost the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party's past record of promoting Hindu cultural symbols for its support base. But recent Kumbh gatherings have also been caught in controversies. Modi's government changed the city's Mughal-era name from Allahabad to Prayagraj as part of its Muslim-to-Hindu name-changing effort nationwide ahead of the 2019 festival and the national election that his party won. In 2021, his government refused to call off the festival in Haridwar despite a surge in coronavirus cases, fearing a backlash from religious leaders in the Hindu-majority country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-kicks-off-hindu-festival-touted-as-the-world-s-largest-religious-gathering/7934559.html	2025-01-12T21:08:12-08:00	
Millions of Hindu devotees gather for Maha Kumbh festival	Millions of Hindu devotees, mystics and holy men and women from all across India flocked to the northern city of Prayagraj on Monday to kickstart the Maha Kumbh festival, which is being touted as the world's largest religious gathering. Over about the next six weeks, Hindu pilgrims with gather at the confluence of three sacred rivers — the Ganges, the Yamuna and the mythical Saraswati — where they will take part in elaborate rituals, hoping to begin a journey to achieve Hindu philosophy's ultimate goal: the release from the cycle of rebirth.	https://www.voanews.com/a/millions-of-hindu-devotees-gather-for-maha-kumbh-festival/7934558.html	2025-01-12T21:05:03-08:00	
Malaysia imposes anti-dumping duties on iron, steel imports from 4 countries	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — Malaysia's trade ministry said it has imposed provisional anti-dumping duties on some flat-rolled products of iron or non-alloy steel exports from China, India, Japan and South Korea. The duties, on products with a width of more than 600 mm, range from 2.52% to 36.80% and were effective from Jan. 11, the ministry said in a statement on Monday. The ministry said the provisional anti-dumping duties will be in effect for up to 120 days, with a final determination to be made by May 10, and that feedback on the preliminary determination could be submitted by Jan. 20. The ministry's decision followed an investigation into the products from China, India, Japan and South Korea that started in August, following a petition by a domestic producer. The ministry said the petitioner had alleged the imports were being sold well below the domestic price in the four countries and had caused material injury to the domestic industry in Malaysia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-imposes-anti-dumping-duties-on-iron-steel-imports-from-4-countries/7934555.html	2025-01-12T20:55:02-08:00	
Japan foreign minister to visit S.Korea to shore up security cooperation	TOKYO — Japanese Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya will travel to South Korea on Monday to shore up security cooperation between the East Asian neighbors and their mutual U.S. ally that is meant to counter China's growing regional power. It marks the first time in seven years that a Japanese foreign minister will visit South Korea for a bilateral meeting with their South Korean counterpart, Japan's government said. Iwaya will also meet with South Korea's Acting President Choi Sang-mok, Tokyo said. Iwaya aims to 'reconfirm' the importance of relations and that the two countries will continue to coordinate policies including those on North Korea in the 'light of the current strategic environment,' it said in a press release. Deepening trilateral security cooperation could be more difficult amid the political turmoil in South Korea prompted by the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol. The transition to a second Trump administration on Jan. 20 also means that none of the original leaders who established the three-way security cooperation pact in 2023 - U.S. President Joe Biden, Yoon, and former Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida—remain in power. 'The trilateral will move forward. The real question is will the trilateral thrive,' U.S. Ambassador to Japan Rahm Emanuel said at a press conference in Tokyo on Friday, shortly before he returns to the United States. ‘’It's going to take work to nurture it and develop it,' Emanuel said. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol has been holed up in his hillside villa in Seoul since parliament voted to impeach and suspend him last month over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3. Presidential security service and military guards there have blocked investigators from arresting him. Iwaya's planned visit comes after the South Korean foreign minister met last week with outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who expressed 'serious concerns' over some of the actions Yoon took over the course of his martial law declaration. Iwaya met Blinken in Tokyo the following day. Iwaya will travel to the Philippines after South Korea to discuss security and economic cooperation and will visit Palau to attend the second inauguration of President Surangel Whipp before returning to Japan.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-foreign-minister-to-visit-s-korea-to-shore-up-security-cooperation/7934548.html	2025-01-12T20:28:23-08:00	
Somalia, Ethiopia to restore diplomatic ties amid AU mission agreement	WASHINGTON — Somalia announced that obstacles to Ethiopia's participation in the new African Union mission in Somalia (AUSSOM) have been overcome, and the final stage of the composition and size of Ethiopian forces is expected to be sorted out shortly. Somalia previously threatened to expel Ethiopian troops from the African Union peacekeeping mission unless Ethiopia renounced its controversial memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Somaliland, the breakaway region of Somalia. Under the terms of the MOU, Somaliland would lease about 20 kilometers (12 miles) of its Gulf of Aden coastline to landlocked Ethiopia’s naval forces and in exchange — according to Somaliland officials — Ethiopia would begin a process considering the official recognition of Somaliland’s independence. However, Ali Omar Balcad, Somalia’s state foreign minister told VOA that the obstacles posed by the MOU, which had hindered Ethiopia's participation in AUSSOM, have now been overcome. The minister said the current challenge lies in reallocating the number of troops assigned to AUSSOM, which were previously distributed to other countries. 'A Somali delegation will visit Ethiopia on Jan. 15, to proceed and finalize the technical details for their involvement and the number,' Balcad told VOA. Restoration of diplomatic ties The development comes after a two-day visit by Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud to Addis Ababa, during which he held discussions with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed. The leaders agreed to mend diplomatic ties strained by Ethiopia's MOU with Somaliland. 'After in-depth discussions, Somali President Hassan Mohamud and Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed have agreed to reestablish diplomatic relations,' Balcad said in an interview with VOA. 'Somalia’s ambassador to the African Union in Addis Ababa will also serve as Somalia’s new ambassador to Ethiopia. In return, Ethiopia will send a new ambassador to Somalia and assign consular representatives to Hargeisa and Garowe,' Balcad added. The diplomatic relationship between the two nations was damaged last year when Somalia declared the MOU between Ethiopia and Somaliland to be 'null and void' and a violation of its sovereignty. The fallout led to the expulsion of Ethiopia's ambassador to Somalia and the order to close Ethiopian consulates in Hargeisa and Garowe, although both consulates continue to operate. In a joint communique issued Saturday, the two leaders pledged to 'restore and enhance' bilateral relations through full diplomatic representation. Both leaders emphasized that regional stability hinges on strong cooperation built on mutual trust and respect. Turkey played a pivotal role in mediating between the two sides. Last month, President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan facilitated a meeting in Ankara between President Mohamud and Prime Minister Ahmed, where both parties reaffirmed their commitment to mutual sovereignty and territorial integrity in what is being called the Ankara Declaration. The Somali minister said the trade, port access and sea routes are set to be key topics at a meeting scheduled for next month in Ankara, building on the discussions from last month's agreement. Egypt and Red Sea tensions Meanwhile, Egypt declared Saturday that it will not accept any military or naval presence in the Red Sea from non-bordering countries. The remarks, made by Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty during a news conference with his Somali and Eritrean counterparts, underscore Egypt's growing concerns over Ethiopia's regional influence. 'We will not allow landlocked countries to set up [a] military presence along the Red Sea. Such moves would affect the security arrangement in the deep waters,' Abdelatty said. Somalia’s foreign minister Balcad told VOA he is aware of Egypt's remarks, emphasizing that Somalia is not directly involved in the Red Sea issue, as it does not share a border with the waterway. The Bab-el-Mandeb strait connects the Red Sea to the Gulf of Aden which runs along Somalia’s coastline. 'We maintain independent relations with Cairo and Addis Ababa, and we don't believe one harms the other,' Balcad said.

Austrian woman kidnapped in Niger's Agadez city, authorities say	Niamey, Niger — An Austrian woman has been kidnapped by gunmen in Niger's Agadez city, residents and the Austrian Foreign Ministry said Sunday. It is the first time a European citizen is known to have been kidnapped in the conflict-hit West African nation since a military junta took power in 2023. The ministry said the Austrian Embassy in Algeria, which is also responsible for Niger, had been informed of the kidnapping of an Austrian woman in Agadez and was in contact with regional authorities on the ground. Residents and local media identified the victim as Eva Gretzmacher and reported she is an aid worker who has lived in Agadez — hundreds of kilometers away from the capital city of Niamey — for more than 20 years. '(She) is well known for her social commitment (and) created a skills center in 2010 that initiated various projects, notably in the fields of education, women’s empowerment, ecology, culture and art,' the online newspaper Air Info Agadez reported. Gretzmacher also supported education programs through her development work and provided assistance to local nongovernment organizations in various sectors, local media said. No group claimed responsibility for her abduction and authorities in Niger did not immediately comment on the incident. Niger has for many years battled a jihadi insurgency linked to al-Qaida and the Islamic State group, a security crisis that analysts say has worsened since the military toppled the country's government in July 2023. Despite their promise to restore peace in hot spots, the junta’s capacity to improve Niger’s security has increasingly been questioned amid increasing attacks. Niger was seen as one of the last democratic countries in Africa’s Sahel region that Western nations could partner with to beat back the jihadi insurgency in the vast expanse below the Sahara Desert. The country has severed decadeslong military ties with the West and turned to Russia as a new security partner.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austrian-woman-kidnapped-in-niger-s-agadez-city-authorities-say/7934475.html	2025-01-12T16:30:11-08:00	
At least 10 dead in southeast Brazil landslides	Rio de Janeiro — Landslides caused by torrential rains in southeast Brazil have left at least 10 people dead, rescue services in Minas Gerais state said Sunday. Nine people died in the city of Ipatinga, where 8 centimeters (3.1 inches) of rain fell in the space of one hour on Saturday night, the mayor's office said. Firefighters pulled the body of an 8-year-old boy from the rubble of a house destroyed by a landslide. Another landslide swept away everything in its path along a street on the side of a hill in the city's Bethania neighborhood. AFP images from the scene showed rubble from the houses poking up from the mud. As of Sunday evening, one person from the area remained missing, though four members of the person's family were rescued. A body was also found in the nearby town of Santana do Paraiso. Minas Gerais state governor Romeu Zema sends a message of 'solidarity with the victims' in a statement on social media. Latin America's biggest country has been rocked by several extreme weather events over the past year. Massive floods caused by days of record-breaking rain killed more than 180 people in the south of the country in April and May. Brazil also suffered a historic drought linked to climate change, laying the ground for the worst wildfires in 17 years, which consumed vast chunks of the Amazon rainforest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southeast-brazil-landslides/7934473.html	2025-01-12T16:21:03-08:00	
Here's what happened when previous US presidents tried to downsize government	President-elect Donald Trump pledges to reduce government spending when he takes office. He has tasked billionaire businessman Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy, who's worth an estimated $950 million, to lead the Department of Government Efficiency, a proposed presidential advisory commission.

Philadelphia 76ers won't build disputed $1.3B downtown stadium	Philadelphia, Pennsylvania — The Philadelphia 76ers have decided not to build a $1.3 billion downtown arena, a surprising move that comes just weeks after the team received approval for the controversial project from the city council. The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Sunday that multiple council members had confirmed the change in plans. The team has struck a deal with Comcast Spectacor to remain in the city's sports stadium district, the newspaper said, but further details about the new proposal have not been released. The 76ers, the mayor's office and Comcast Spectacor — which owns the Wells Fargo Center, where the team currently plays — did not respond Sunday to requests for comment. The team rents the arena from Comcast Spectacor, which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers of the NHL, who also play there. The council had voted on Dec. 19 to approve the downtown arena after more than two years of heated debate over the proposal, and the owners of the NBA team had hoped to move into what would be called 76 Place by 2031. The council vote came despite vocal opposition from nearby Chinatown residents and other activists. 'I’m so livid right now I don’t even know what to do,' Jimmy Harrity, an at-large member of the council, told the newspaper. Harrity, who supported the team’s move, said, 'I feel as though I was used as a pawn.' Mayor Cherelle Parker, a Democrat who had championed the plan, has said the entire city will benefit from what she called a 'historic game-changing economic development project.' Supporters had hoped the 18,500-seat arena would help revive a distressed retail corridor called Market East, which runs from City Hall to the Liberty Bell. The area has struggled for years despite several redevelopment efforts. The team owners, Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment, had pushed for city approval by year’s end so they could meet their target opening date. They had vowed not to ask the city for any construction funding, although they were free to seek state and federal funds. Instead of property taxes, they would have paid about $6 million in annual payments in lieu of taxes. Opponents feared the arena would bring gridlock on game days as well as gentrification and rising rents to the area. The Chinatown community has fought a series of proposed developments since the 1960s, including casinos, a prison, a baseball stadium and a highway, the last of which dissected the neighborhood when it opened in 1991.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philadelphia-76ers-won-t-build-disputed-1-3b-downtown-stadium/7934223.html	2025-01-12T15:07:06-08:00	
Supporters of Bolivia's ex-President Morales march for 3rd day, protesting crisis	La Paz, Bolivia — Hundreds of Bolivian farmers and workers who support former President Evo Morales continued their march on La Paz for the third consecutive day on Sunday to protest the economic crisis the country is suffering. 'This is a just struggle, a peaceful march, we are talking about people who are dying of hunger,' said Indigenous leader Juanita Ancieta. 'The people have risen up and no one is going to stop us because the country is in bad shape,' she added. Without Morales, its historic leader, who remained in his stronghold of Cochabamba (center), the 'March for Life,' which brings together hundreds of inhabitants from various regions, left the district of Calamarca on Sunday morning. It started Friday from Patacamaya, in the Andes, with the goal of reaching the seat of government and Parliament in La Paz, which the marchers hope to reach by Monday. Some chew coca leaves to combat hunger and fatigue. Others hold up placards against the economic policies of President Luis Arce, former economy minister under Evo Morales. 'This is a march against the rising cost of living, against the lack of fuel supplies because of this government. This march demands that it solve these problems,' Flora Aguilar, wearing a multi-colored blanket, told reporters. For months, Luis Arce and Evo Morales have been at odds over control of the ruling party and the choice of candidate between the two for the presidential election next August. According to official data, inflation in Bolivia was 9.9% in 2024, the highest in 16 years, while fuel and dollar shortages affect the entire country. The government is subsidizing fuel imports, which has dried up the country's foreign exchange reserves. This march is the second after the one in September, in which Evo Morales himself participated. Since then, the former president (2006-2019) remains in the Cochabamba region, in the center of the country, because there is an arrest order against him from the prosecutor's office, with which the local police refuse to cooperate. Evo Morales, 65, is accused of having a relationship with a minor in 2015, with whom he allegedly had a daughter, which he denies. He denounces 'judicial persecution' by the Arce government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supporters-of-bolivia-ex-president-morales-march-for-3rd-day-protesting-crisis/7934208.html	2025-01-12T14:28:04-08:00	
London subway riders bare their legs in 'No Trousers Tube Ride'	London — Hundreds of Londoners headed down to the Underground on Sunday afternoon, stripped down to their underwear and travelled around a bit, trying to look as though nothing unusual was going on. As if. This was the Official No Trousers Tube Ride, an annual event with no point other than injecting a little levity into the bleak midwinter. No deep meaning, no bigger motive. The only goal was to be silly, if but for one afternoon. 'There's so much bad, so much not fun going on,' said ringleader Dave Selkirk, a 40-year-old personal trainer. 'It's nice to do something just for the sake of it.' After gathering at the entrance to Chinatown, dozens of clothing anarchists trooped through the icy streets to the Piccadilly Circus Underground station in central London where they boarded their first train. The only hiccup was that the cars were so crowded some people couldn't shed their trousers. Selfies were taken. Grins were exchanged. The tourists looked puzzled. The first stunt in this vein was held in New York in 2002, the brainchild of local comedian Charlie Todd. His idea was this: Wouldn't it be funny if someone walked onto a subway train in the middle of winter wearing a hat, gloves, scarf — everything but pants? Or trousers as they're known in London, pants being synonymous with underpants in Britain. 'It would be unusual in New York, although you can see anything on our subway system, but what would really be funny is if at the next stop, a couple of minutes later, when the doors open and additional persons got on, not wearing trousers as well,' Todd told the BBC. 'And they act like they don't know each other, and they act like … it's no big deal and they just forgot their trousers.'' The idea took off, and no pants days have been held all over: in Berlin, Prague, Jerusalem, Warsaw and Washington, D.C., among other cities. London hosted its first big reveal in 2009. 'You know, it's meant to be a bit of harmless fun,' Todd said. 'Certainly, we are living in a climate where, you know, people like to have culture war fights. My rule in New York was always the goal of this event is to amuse other people, to give people a laugh. It's not to be provocative, it's not to irritate someone. So hopefully the spirit of that continues.' Basil Long, a lawyer, showed up at the meeting point in a down coat and hat on a freezing winter afternoon. But after his journey underground in the warm tunnels of the Tube, he had been transformed, wearing only a white shirt with bold rainbow stripes, pink underwear and Underground-themed socks. 'I just saw it online and I just thought, why not? It's always a question, isn't it?' he said. 'When someone is asked why they climbed Everest, they were just like, why not?' But Miriam Correa had a purpose. The 43-year-old chef wanted to come because she had seen pictures of previous no trouser rides that featured lots of thin, scantily clad women. 'I am a real woman,'' she said, adding that there was no reason to be ashamed of her shape. 'All bodies are perfect.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/london-subway-riders-bare-their-legs-in-no-trousers-tube-ride-/7934202.html	2025-01-12T14:05:15-08:00	
Los Angeles wildfires rage on despite added firefighting resources	Wildfires in the Los Angeles, California, area are raging and weather conditions aren’t helping matters, with winds picking back up.

Zelenskyy says he's ready to swap North Korean soldiers for Ukrainian POWs in Russia	Kyiv, Ukraine — Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday Kyiv is ready to hand over North Korean soldiers to their leader Kim Jong Un if he can facilitate their exchange for Ukrainians held captive in Russia. 'In addition to the first captured soldiers from North Korea, there will undoubtedly be more. It's only a matter of time before our troops manage to capture others,' Zelenskyy said on the social media platform X. Zelenskyy said Saturday that Ukraine had captured two North Koreans in Russia's Kursk region, the first time Ukraine has announced the capture of North Korean soldiers alive since their entry into the nearly three-year-old war last fall. Ukrainian and Western assessments say that some 11,000 troops from Russia's ally North Korea have been deployed in the Kursk region to support Moscow's forces. Russia has neither confirmed nor denied their presence. Zelenskyy has said Russian and North Korean forces had suffered heavy losses. 'Ukraine is ready to hand over Kim Jong Un's soldiers to him if he can organize their exchange for our warriors who are being held captive in Russia,' Zelenskyy said. He posted a short video showing the interrogation of two men who are presented as North Korean soldiers. One of them is lying on a bed with bandaged hands, the other is sitting with a bandage on his jaw. One of the men said through an interpreter that he did not know he was fighting against Ukraine and had been told he was on a training exercise. He said he hid in a shelter during the offensive and was found a couple of days later. He said that if he was ordered to return to North Korea, he would, but that he was ready to stay in Ukraine if given the chance. Reuters could not verify the video. 'One of them (soldiers) expressed a desire to stay in Ukraine, the other to return to Korea,' Zelenskyy said in a televised statement. Zelenskyy said that for North Korean soldiers who did not wish to return home, there may be other options available and 'those who express a desire to bring peace closer by spreading the truth about this war in the Korean (language) will be given that opportunity.' Zelenskyy provided no specific details.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-says-he-s-ready-to-swap-north-korean-soldiers-for-ukrainian-pows-in-russia/7934198.html	2025-01-12T13:46:51-08:00	
Fires burn Los Angeles schools, destroy outdoor education sanctuaries	For Irina Contreras, a program manager for Los Angeles County's Department of Arts and Culture, outdoor education was a refuge for both her and her daughter during the pandemic. Now, much of that refuge has been burned in the raging wildfires around Los Angeles. Her 7-year-old daughter, Ceiba, hikes with a kid's adventure group called Hawks and attended Matilija, a bilingual forest school for preschool and kindergarten. Rain or shine, she and her friends would spend their days climbing, jumping, hiking, and swimming in places like Eaton Canyon Nature Area, a 77-hectare (190-acre) preserve near Altadena, now destroyed by fire. Ceiba learned to ask plants for permission before taking samples to glue into her nature journal. Once, her group discovered a hidden path that led behind a waterfall. Ceiba couldn't stop talking about it for days. For parents like Contreras, the wildfires have been devastating not just because of the loss of life and thousands of homes. They are mourning natural and educational areas that served as sanctuaries and learning spaces for local families, especially in the years since the pandemic. The fires have torn through natural areas that served every type of educational setting: public and private schools, nature-based preschools, homeschool groups, summer camps and more. 'It's about so much more than what she's been learning,' Contreras said. 'I can speak with absolute confidence that it totally affected me, personally.' The fires have burned school buildings, too, including Odyssey Charter School in Altadena, which Miguel Ordenana's children attend. 'The community has been devastated by the fire,' said Ordenana, senior manager of community science at the Natural History Museum. 'It's been a challenge to carefully share that news with my children and help them work through their emotions. A lot of their friends lost their homes. And we don't know the impact to school staff, like their teachers, but a lot of them live in that area as well and have lost their homes.' Some areas untouched by fire were inaccessible because of poor air quality. Griffith Park, home of the Hollywood sign, had not been affected by the end of the week but it's not clear when the air quality there will be good enough to resume outdoor programs, said Ordenana, who was the first to capture on camera a late puma in the nearby area that gained fame under the name P-22. Ordenana said his family was able to connect with some other families from Odyssey Charter School for pizza and an indoor playdate, but he is uncertain what the days will look like for them with school closures already extending through next week. All schools in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the nation's second largest, were closed Friday because of heavy smoke and ash over the city. Classes will not resume until conditions improve, officials said. Pasadena Unified School District also closed schools and several of its campuses sustained damage, including Eliot Arts Magnet Middle School. The California Department of Education released a statement Wednesday saying 335 schools from Los Angeles, San Bernardino, Riverside, Ventura, and San Diego counties were closed. It was unclear how many would be closed Monday. During the pandemic, Contreras felt like she was stuck on a screen. She devoted much of her energy to working, writing and organizing, but her daughter's outdoor education helped her better understand the value of stepping away from the grind. Contreras feels confident the outdoor programs will return, although it's unclear when it will be safe for people to hike around areas like Eaton Canyon. 'The nature center is gone,' Richard Smart, superintendent of the Eaton Canyon Natural Area in Pasadena, said Thursday. 'The wildflowers, the shrubs are gone.' The park hosted dozens of school field trips a year and Smart estimates more than a thousand students visited yearly. 'Teachers liked it because it was also free, it was local, it was nearby. And it was a place to see nature — wild nature but also in a friendly, safe environment,' he said. Only a few exterior walls of the Eaton Canyon Nature Center were left standing, he said. 'For many of the local school districts, we truly were in their backyard, and now they won't be able to use it for the foreseeable future,' he said. 'The park is such a touchstone for people in the community, and so to lose that is just, devastating is not even the right word. It feels indescribable.' Many parents and teachers are likely wondering what to do and where to take their children as fires continue to burn across Los Angeles, said Lila Higgins, a senior manager for community science at the Natural History Museum and author of 'Wild L.A,' a field trip and nature guidebook. A certified forest therapy guide, Higgins says time in nature lowers heart rates, lowers blood pressure and helps children with attention deficit disorder feel more calm and relaxed. 'For children's cognitive development, time in nature and time spent connecting with nature is so important,' Higgins said. Outdoor spaces also can help children learn how to develop relationships through connections with animals, understand orientation through space by following trails and map-reading and understand human impact on wildlife. 'A lot of the places that we're talking about are really popular with homeschoolers, but they also are a destination for some field trips, certainly places like Eaton Canyon,' said Greg Pauly, co-author of 'Wild L.A.' and director of the Urban Nature Research Center at the museum. 'I do think it's safe to say that people are going to continue to be interacting with those landscapes and it will hopefully still be a field trip destination in the future. But it's certainly going to be a while before that happens.' 'This is the reality of modern Southern California,' he said. 'Fire changes the landscape and people's lives shockingly often.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fires-burn-los-angeles-schools-destroy-outdoor-education-sanctuaries/7934188.html	2025-01-12T13:34:45-08:00	
California wildfires could be leaving deeper inequality in their wake	ALTADENA, Calif. — The sight of celebrity mansions and movie landmarks reduced to ashes can make it seem like the wildfires roaring through the Los Angeles area affected a constellation of movie stars. But a drive through the charred neighborhoods around Altadena shows that the fires also burned through a remarkable haven for generations of Black families avoiding discriminatory housing practices elsewhere. They have been communities of racial and economic diversity, where many people own their own homes. Some now fear the most destructive fires in California's history have altered that for good. Recovery and rebuilding may be out of reach for many, and pressures of gentrification could be renewed. Samantha Santoro, 22, a first-generation college student at Cal Poly Pomona, remembered being annoyed when the initial news coverage of the wildfires focused more on celebrities. She and her sister, who attends UC Berkeley, worry how their Mexican immigrant parents and working-class neighbors who lost their homes in Altadena will move forward. 'We don't have like, 'Oh, I'll just go to my second home and stay there,'' Santoro said. The landlord of their family's two-bedroom house with a pool had never increased the $1,650 rent, making it possible for the Santoros to affordably raise their daughters. Now, they're temporarily staying with a relative in Pasadena. The family has renters insurance but not much else. 'I think it's hard to believe that you have nothing,' Santoro said, through tears, thinking of her parents. 'Everything that they ever worked for was in that house.' Altadena had been a mix of tiny bungalows and magnificent mansions. The community of 42,000 includes blue-collar families, artists, entertainment industry workers and white-collar ones. About 58% of residents are non-white, with one-fourth of them Hispanic and nearly a fifth Black, according to Census data. During the Civil Rights era, Altadena became a rare land of opportunity for Black Americans to reach middle class without the discriminatory practices of denying them access to credit. They kept homes within the family and helped others to flourish. Today, the Black home ownership rate there is at 81.5%, almost double the national rate. That's impressive considering 92% of the 15,000 residences in Altadena are single-family homes, according to the 2023 Census American Community Survey. The median income is over $129,000. Just over 7% of residents live in poverty. Victoria Knapp, chair of the Altadena Town Council, worries that the fires have irreparably changed the landscape for these families. 'Someone is going to buy it and develop who knows what on it. And that is going to change the character of Altadena,' Knapp said, adding that those with fewer resources will be disproportionately hurt. The family of Kenneth Snowden, 57, was one of the Black families able to purchase a home in 1962. That house, as well as the one Snowden bought almost 20 years ago, are both gone. He is challenging state and federal officials to help all fire-affected communities fairly because 'your $40 million home is no different than my $2 million home.' Snowden wants the ability to acquire home loans with 0% interest. 'Give us the ability to rebuild, restart our lives,' he said. 'If you can spend billions of dollars fighting a war, you can spend a billion dollars to help us get back where we were at.' Shawn Brown lost not only her home but also the public charter school she founded in Altadena. She had a message for fellow Black homeowners who might be tempted with offers for their property: 'I would tell them to stand strong, rebuild, continue the generational progress of African Americans.' She and other staff at Pasadena Rosebud Academy are trying to raise money to rebuild while looking at temporary sites in churches. But even some churches have burned. At Altadena Baptist Church, the bell tower is pretty much the only thing still standing. The Rev. George Van Alstine and others are trying to help more than 10 church members who lost homes with needs like navigating insurance and federal aid. The pastor is worried the fires will lead to gentrification, with Black parishioners, who make up half the congregation, paying the price. 'We're seeing a number of families who are probably going to have to move out of the area because rebuilding in Altadena will be too expensive for them,' he said. The 32-year-old photographer Daniela Dawson, who had been working two jobs to meet the $2,200 rent for her studio apartment, fled the wildfires with her Hyundai SUV and her cat, Lola. She lost almost everything else, including thousands of dollars of photography gear. She did not have renter's insurance. 'Obviously now I'm thinking about it. Wish I had it,' she said. Dawson plans to return to Arizona, where she lived previously, and regroup. But she likely won't be returning to Altadena.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-wildfires-could-be-leaving-deeper-inequality-in-their-wake/7934183.html	2025-01-12T13:34:08-08:00

Tens of thousands protest in Belgrade	Belgrade, Serbia — Tens of thousands of anti-government protesters in Belgrade on Sunday switched on the lights on their mobile phones and stood in silence for 15 minutes to commemorate victims of a railway station roof collapse for which they blame authorities. The protest was organized and led by students from Belgrade state university who are demanding that those responsible for the roof collapse are brought to justice. They blame the ruling Serbian Progressive Party (SNS) of President Aleksandar Vucic for corruption and nepotism, which he and the party deny. Students at state universities in Belgrade, Kragujevac and Nis have been blockading classes for weeks to demand the release of all documents relevant to the renovation of the station, as well as criminal prosecution of officials responsible for the disaster. Every day they block traffic in front of their faculties for 15 minutes to commemorate the 15 victims. The concrete awning of the recently renovated roof of Novi Sad station caved in on Nov. 1, killing 14 and injuring three. One of the injured died later. Opposition leaders and the public have taken to the streets repeatedly, blaming the accident on shoddy construction resulting from government corruption and nepotism. The ruling coalition denies those charges, and Vucic has said those responsible must be held to account. 'We have been unhappy for years. We came here to express our revolt (with authorities), and to support students,' said Tamara Kovacevic, one of the protesters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-protest-in-belgrade/7934158.html	2025-01-12T12:19:14-08:00	
Top Vatican diplomat inaugurates, consecrates Catholic church at Jesus’ baptism site	Bethany Beyond the Jordan, Jordan — The Vatican secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, Friday consecrated a new Catholic church at Bethany Beyond the Jordan on the banks of the Jordan River officially recognized by the church as the site where John the Baptist baptized Jesus. Parolin’s three-day visit to Jordan coincides with a new exhibition of 90 Jordanian artifacts of the nation's history at the start of Christianity, to be debuted at the Vatican in February. Representing Pope Francis, the top Vatican diplomat, Cardinal Pietro Parolin inaugurated and consecrated the Church of the Baptism of the Lord at Al-Maghtas, known in the Bible as Bethany Beyond the Jordan, on the banks of the Jordan River Friday before thousands of Jordanians, Palestinians, other Arabs and diplomats. 'Pope Francis sent me as his legate [personal representative] for the consecration of the Latin church on the site of Jesus’ baptism. I would like also in the name of His Holiness to thank the royal household, especially His Majesty King Abdullah II, the Royal Highness Prince Ghazi, and the government of Jordan for the care they have shown to this holy place,' said Parolin. 'My presence here today, according to the wishes of the pope, is meant to be a tangible sign of the closeness of the whole Church to the Christian communities of the Middle East,' Parolin said in his homily, read on his behalf in Arabic by the Rev. Jihad Shweihat. 'At a time in history when this region is experiencing serious upheaval, it is important that Christians also make their contribution to the building of a just and peaceful society,' he said. Parolin celebrated Mass, accompanied by the Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa, during the ceremony also celebrating the 25th anniversary of the Catholic Church’s annual pilgrimage to Jesus’ Baptismal site. Parolin also anointed the church’s altar, dedicating it as where the relics of Pope St. John Paul II and the recently canonized Holy Martyrs of Damascus and others will be placed. The papal envoy also spoke of the planned Vatican-Jordanian exhibition 'Jordan: Dawn of Christianity,' to debut at the Vatican next month, celebrating Jordan’s biblical roots through the centuries. It also commemorates 30 years of diplomatic ties between Jordan and the Holy See and coincides with the Vatican’s 2025 Jubilee Year of Hope. 'Other sites testify to the presence of Christ in the early church. These will be the subject of an exhibition to be displayed in the Vatican in February as an expression of the profound bond that unites Jordan and the Holy See,' said Cardinal Parolin. Jordan’s tourism and antiquities minister, Lina Annab, described the exhibition’s importance to journalists on Wednesday in Amman, saying many people outside the country do not realize that there are Jordanian Christians. 'This exhibition celebrates and sheds light on the origins and heritage as well as the enduring legacy and presence of Christianity in Jordan. The origins of Christianity are here. Jordan is an integral part of the Holy Land. We are more interested in really showcasing the importance of Jordan as far as the faiths that have lived on this land, whether the Islamic faith or the Christian faith,' said Annab. Three popes have visited the site of Jesus’ baptism on the Jordanian banks of the Jordan River: John Paul II in 2000, Benedict XVI in 2009, and Francis in 2014. Pope Paul VI first visited Jordan in 1964, making Jordan the only country to have received four Catholic papal visits.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-vatican-diplomat-inaugurates-consecrates-catholic-church-at-jesus-baptism-site/7934156.html	2025-01-12T12:11:55-08:00	
Den of Thieves 2' is No. 1 at box office as 'Better Man' flops	New York — On a quiet weekend in movie theaters, while much of Hollywood’s attention was on the wildfires that continue to rage in Los Angeles, Lionsgate’s 'Den of Thieves 2: Pantera' debuted atop the box office with $15.5 million, according to studio estimates Sunday. Mid-January is often a slow moviegoing period, and that was slightly exacerbated by the closures of about 10 theaters in Los Angeles, the country’s top box-office market. A sequel to the Gerard Butler 2018 heist thriller, 'Den of Thieves 2' performed similarly to the original. The first installment, released by STX, opened with $15.2 million seven years ago. O’Shea Jackson Jr. co-stars in the sequel, which debuted in 3,008 North American theaters. Butler's films are becoming something of a regular feature in January. He also starred in 'Plane,' which managed $32.1 million after launching on Jan. 13 in 2023. 'Den of Thieves 2,' made for about $40 million, was a bit more costly to make. Audiences liked it well enough, giving it a 'B+' CinemaScore. Reviews (58% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes) weren’t particularly good. But it counted as Lionsgate’s first No.1 opening since 'The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes' in November 2023. Also entering wide release over the weekend was the Robbie Williams movie 'Better Man,' one of the more audacious spins on the music biopic in recent years. Rather than going the more tradition routes of Elton John ('Rocketman') or Elvis Presley ('Elvis'), the British popstar is portrayed by a CGI chimpanzee in Michael Gracey’s film. The Paramount Pictures release, produced for $110 million and acquired by Paramount for $25 million, didn’t catch on much better than Williams’ previous forays into the United States. It tanked, with $1.1 million in ticket sales from 1,291 locations. Gracey’s previous feature, 2017’s 'The Greatest Showman' ($459 million worldwide), fared far better in theaters. Reviews, however, have been very good for 'Better Man.' It was bested by 'The Last Showgirl,' the Las Vegas drama starring Pamela Anderson. The Roadside Attractions release expanded to 870 theaters and collected $1.5 million. Also outdoing 'Better Man' was Brady Corbet’s 'The Brutalist.' Coming off winning best drama at the Golden Globes, the A24 postwar epic grossed a hefty $1.4 million from just 68 locations. It will expand wider in the coming weeks. The weekend's lion share of business went to holiday holdovers, including 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' 'Nosferatu' and 'Moana 2.' In its fourth week of release, Barry Jenkins 'Mufasa' continued to do well, adding $13.2 million to bring its total to $539.7 million worldwide. Also on its fourth weekend, 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' padded its $384.8 million global total with $11 million. Robert Eggers’ 'Nosferatu,' the surprise hit of the Christmas period, collected $6.8 million in ticket sales, bringing the vampire tale to $81.1 million domestically. The Walt Disney Co.’s 'Moana 2,' in its seventh week of release, added $6.5 million to bring its global tally to $989.8 million. In the coming days, it will become the third Disney film released in 2024 to notch $1 billion, joining 'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool and Wolverine.' Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Den of Thieves 2: Pantera,' $15.5 million. 2. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $13.2 million. 3. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $11 million. 4. 'Nosferatu,' $6.8 million. 5. 'Moana 2,' $6.5 million. 6. 'A Complete Unknown,' $5 million. 7. 'Wicked,' $5 million. 8. 'Babygirl,' $3.1 million. 9. 'Game Changer,' $1.9 million. 10. 'The Last Showgirl,' $1.5 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/den-of-thieves-2-is-no-1-at-box-office-as-better-man-flops/7934145.html	2025-01-12T11:33:24-08:00	
Signs point to Israeli-Hamas ceasefire but no certainty	There were signs Sunday that a long elusive ceasefire to end fighting between Israel and the militant group Hamas in Gaza could be reached in the coming days, along with the release of the remaining hostages held by the militants. A top-level Israeli security delegation arrived in Qatar for new talks with Qatari, Egyptian and U.S. officials, according to a spokesperson for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. They are making new efforts to reach an agreement before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office January 20 and President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated. Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told CNN's 'State of the Union' show that the parties were 'very, very close' to reaching a deal to halt more than 15 months of fighting in Gaza and free the remaining 98 hostages held there, with two-thirds of them believed to be alive. 'We are still determined to use every day we have in office to get this done,' he said. 'We are not, by any stretch of imagination, setting this aside.' Biden spoke Sunday with Netanyahu about the ongoing negotiations, the White House said, but did not disclose any details of the talks. Sullivan said Biden is receiving daily updates on the Doha talks and that some progress has been made in the indirect talks between Israel and Hamas. He said there was still a chance to reach an agreement before Biden leaves office, but not a certainty, saying that 'Hamas, in particular, remains intransigent.' Israel launched its assault on Hamas in Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed across its borders on October 7, 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 46,000 people have been killed in Gaza, with most of them women and children, according to Palestinian health officials, although Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants it has killed. Much of Gaza, a narrow strip of land along the Mediterranean Sea, has been laid to waste during the fighting and gripped by a humanitarian crisis, with most of its 2.3 million population displaced, often multiple times. Netanyahu's office said Saturday that the Israeli delegation to the Doha talks includes the director of the Mossad intelligence agency, David Barnea; the head of the Shin Bet domestic security service, Ronen Bar; and the military's head of hostage concerns, Nitzan Alon. Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, met Saturday with Netanyahu, after having met with Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani on Friday. Israeli and Palestinian officials have said since Thursday that some progress has been made in the indirect talks between Israel and Hamas, but did not elaborate. The sides have been keeping a tight lid on the details being worked out. It is not clear how they will bridge one of the biggest gaps that has persisted throughout previous rounds of talks: Hamas demands an end to the war while Israel says it will not end the war as long as Hamas rules Gaza and poses a threat to Israelis. Some material in this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/signs-point-to-israeli-hamas-ceasefire-but-no-certainty-/7934149.html	2025-01-12T11:32:39-08:00	
Chad’s ruling party wins majority in parliamentary election boycotted by opposition	N’DJAMENA — Chad’s ruling party took the majority of votes in last month’s parliamentary election, which was boycotted by the main opposition and which analysts had said would consolidate the president's political power, provisional results show. In what was the first parliamentary election in Chad in more than a decade, the ruling Patriotic Salvation Movement party won 124 out of 188 seats, while the voter turnout was 51.5%, according to the provisional results announced late Saturday by Ahmed Bartchiret, head of the electoral commission. The parliamentary election, which also included regional and municipal elections, was the last stage of the country's transition to democracy after Mahamat Idriss Deby took power as a military ruler in 2021. The takeover followed the death of Deby's father and longtime president Idriss Deby Itno, who spent three decades in power. Deby eventually won last year's disputed presidential vote. Deby had said the election would 'pave the way for the era of decentralization so long awaited and desired by the Chadian people,' referring to the distribution of power beyond the national government to the different provincial and municipal levels. The election was boycotted by more than 10 opposition parties, including the main Transformers party, whose candidate, Succes Masra, came second in the presidential election. The main opposition had called the election a 'charade' and expressed worries that it would be a repeat of the presidential vote, which election observers said was not credible. The main opposition did not immediately comment on the election results. Last month's vote came at a critical period for Chad, which is battling several security challenges from Boko Haram militant attacks in the Lake Chad region to the break in decadeslong military ties with France, its key ally.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-s-ruling-party-wins-majority-in-parliamentary-election-boycotted-by-opposition-/7934131.html	2025-01-12T10:58:11-08:00

Vance: Jan. 6 participants who committed violence 'obviously' shouldn't be pardoned	Washington — Vice President-elect JD Vance says people responsible for the violence during the Capitol riot 'obviously' should not be pardoned, as President-elect Donald Trump is promising to use his clemency power on behalf of many of those who tried on Jan. 6, 2021, to overturn the results of the election that Trump lost. Vance insisted in an interview on 'Fox News Sunday' that the pardon question is 'very simple,' saying those who 'protested peacefully' should be pardoned and 'if you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned.' He later said there was a 'bit of a gray area' in some cases. More than 1,500 people have been charged with federal crimes stemming from the siege that left more than 100 police officers injured and sent lawmakers running into hiding as they met to certify Democrat Joe Biden's 2020 victory. Hundreds of people who did not engage in destruction or violence were charged only with misdemeanor offenses for illegally entering the Capitol. Others were charged with felony offenses, including assault for beating police officers. Leaders of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys extremist groups were convicted of seditious conspiracy for what prosecutors described as plots to use violence to stop the peaceful transfer of power from Trump, the Republican incumbent, to Biden. In a post on X, Vance responded to criticism from supporters of the Capitol rioters that his position did not go far enough to free all convicted. 'I've been defending these guys for years,' he said. 'The president saying he'll look at each case (and me saying the same) is not some walkback,' Vance said. 'I assure you, we care about people unjustly locked up. Yes, that includes people provoked and it includes people who got a garbage trial.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-jan-6-participants-who-committed-violence-obviously-shouldn-t-be-pardoned-/7934082.html	2025-01-12T09:15:38-08:00	
Higher winds threaten to spread Los Angeles wildfires	Roaring flames continued to ravage Los Angeles on Sunday as the top U.S. emergency official warned that increasing winds could pose new threats in the coming days. 'The winds are potentially getting stronger and dangerous,' Deanne Criswell, the administrator of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, or FEMA, told CNN’s 'State of the Union' show. 'You never know which way they’re going.' Local officials expressed fears that as the fires spread, they could endanger more highly populated areas and threaten some of the city’s key landmarks, including the J. Paul Getty Museum, which houses renowned art works, and the University of California, Los Angeles, one of the top public U.S. universities. As the wildfires raged for a sixth day, the death toll reached 16, with officials worried that more bodies will be found by searchers and cadaver dogs in the neighborhoods that have been leveled by the blazes. California Senator Adam Schiff told CNN that driving through the devastated communities 'frankly reminded me of visiting war zones. There are whole neighborhoods that are gone. We haven’t seen this before.' 'The heartbreak is just overwhelming,' he said. California Governor Gavin Newsom told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that the wildfires could be the worst natural disaster in U.S. history, 'in terms of just the costs associated with it, in terms of the scale and scope.' A preliminary estimate by AccuWeather put the damage and economic losses so far between $135 billion and $150 billion. The damages are so high in part because much of the housing that has burned to the ground is among the costliest in the country. Newsom called for an independent review of how the fires raged on, with firefighters at times facing a shortage of water to fight the blazes as they quickly spread out of control. The governor said he is asking the same questions 'that people out on the streets are asking, yelling about, ‘What the hell happened? What happened to the water system?’ Newsom said he wants to know whether the water supply was simply overwhelmed, 'Or were 99 mile-an-hour winds determinative and there was really no firefight that could've been more meaningful?' 'All of us want to know those answers, and I just don't want to wait because people are asking me. I want to know those facts,' he said. 'I want them objectively determined, and let the chips fall where they may. This is not about finger pointing.' Newsom on Friday ordered state officials to determine why a 440-million-liter reservoir was out of service and some hydrants had run dry. Firefighters raced Saturday to get in front of the largest and most destructive blaze burning in Los Angeles as it shifted directions and grew by about 400 hectares. The Santa Ana winds that fueled the blazes are forecast to return. 'We need to be aggressive out there,' California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) Operations Chief Christian Litz told reporters at a Saturday briefing. The National Weather Service predicted winds picking up Saturday night into Sunday morning in the area and again late Monday through Tuesday morning, with sustained winds up to 48 kph and gusts up to 112 kph. Four active fires in the Los Angeles region have burned more than 16,000 hectares, with flames destroying more than 12,000 structures. About 150,000 people have been ordered to evacuate their homes, with 700 people taking refuge in nine shelters. The causes of all four blazes remain under investigation. Officials said two of the fires were 90- and 76% contained but the other two only 11- and 15%. The Palisades fire, the largest and only 11% contained, is threatening to jump over a major highway, Interstate 405, into a more heavily populated area. Jim Hudson, a Cal Fire incident commander, told reporters that firefighters have three priorities: 'Life, your property and permanent control' of the flames. Firefighting crews from California and nine other states are part of the ongoing response that includes 1,354 fire engines, 84 aircraft and more than 14,000 personnel, including newly arrived firefighters from Mexico. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/higher-winds-threaten-to-spread-los-angeles-wildfires/7934058.html	2025-01-12T09:07:44-08:00

Tens of thousands protest in Romania's capital against annulled presidential race	BUCHAREST — Tens of thousands protested in Romania's capital on Sunday against a top court's decision last month to annul the presidential election after an outsider candidate unexpectedly emerged as the frontrunner. Many of the demonstrators in Bucharest honked horns and waved Romania's blue, yellow, and red flags, while others brandished placards bearing slogans such as 'Democracy is not optional' and 'We want free elections.' Many also demanded the resumption of the presidential race from the second round. The protest comes a month after the Constitutional Court made the unprecedented move to annul the election just two days before a Dec. 8 runoff. The far-right populist Calin Georgescu shocked many when he won the first round on Nov. 24, after which allegations of electoral violations and Russian interference emerged. George Simion, the leader of the far-right Alliance for the Unity of Romanians, said at the protest on Sunday, 'We are protesting against the coup d'état that took place on Dec. 6. 'We are sorry to discover so late that we were living in a lie and that we were led by people who claimed to be democrats, but are not at all,' Simion, whose party organized the protest on Sunday, told reporters. 'We demand a return to democracy through the resumption of elections, starting with the second round.' The canceled presidential race last month plunged the European Union and NATO member country into turmoil and followed other controversies including a recount of first-round votes. New dates have been set to rerun the vote with the first round scheduled for May 4. If no candidate obtains more than 50% of the ballot, a runoff would be held two weeks later on May 18. It is not yet clear whether Georgescu will be able to participate in the new election. Georgescu has since challenged the court's decision at a local appeals court and lodged a complaint at the European Court of Human Rights. The Constitutional Court's published decision to annul the elections cited the illegal use of digital technologies including artificial intelligence, as well as the use of 'undeclared sources' of funding. Georgescu had declared zero campaign spending. Many observers attributed Georgescu's success to his TikTok account, which now has 7.2 million likes and 646,000 followers. Some experts suspected Georgescu's online following was artificially inflated while Romania's top security body alleged he was given preferential treatment by TikTok over other candidates. On Friday, another protest in Bucharest was attended by thousands who also expressed anger over the canceled presidential race.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tens-of-thousands-protest-in-romania-s-capital-against-annulled-presidential-race-/7934028.html	2025-01-12T08:09:33-08:00	
Italy's justice minister seeks to revoke arrest of Iranian based on US warrant	Rome — Italy's justice minister has asked an appeals court to revoke the arrest of an Iranian citizen wanted by the U.S. over a drone attack in Jordan that killed three Americans a year ago. Mohammad Abedini is scheduled to appear at a Milan court on Wednesday in connection with his bid for house arrest pending the extradition process to the U.S. He was arrested on a U.S. warrant on Dec. 16, three days before Italian journalist Cecilia Sala was detained while on a reporting trip to Iran. Sala, who was believed held as a bargaining chip for Abedini's release, returned home last week, giving rise to speculation about Abedini's fate. An official note released by the Justice Ministry on Sunday said that under Italy-U.S. extradition treaties, 'only crimes that are punishable according to the laws of both sides can lead to extradition, a condition which, based on the state of documents, can't be considered as existing.' The ministry said that the potential charge against Abedini — criminal association for violating the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, a U.S. federal law — 'did not correspond to any conduct recognized by Italian law as a crime.' The U.S. Justice Department has accused Abedini of supplying the drone technology to Iran that was used in a January 2024 attack on a U.S. outpost in Jordan that killed three American troops. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni described a 'diplomatic triangulation' with Iran and the United States as being key to securing Sala's release, confirming for the first time that Washington's interests in the case entered into the negotiations. Sala's release came after Meloni made a surprise trip to Florida to meet U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago estate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-justice-minister-seeks-to-revoke-arrest-of-iranian-based-on-us-warrant/7934008.html	2025-01-12T07:49:02-08:00	
Malala Yousafzai asks Muslim leaders to reject Taliban’s treatment of Afghan women openly	ISLAMABAD — Nobel Peace Prize laurate Malala Yousafzai urged Muslim leaders Sunday not to 'legitimize' Afghanistan’s ruling Taliban, accusing them of being the 'perpetrators of gender apartheid' and calling for accountability. Yousafzai spoke at the closing session of a Pakistan-hosted international summit on girls’ education in Muslim communities around the world, sharply criticizing the hardline Taliban government for imposing sweeping curbs on Afghan women’s access to education and employment. 'For the past three-and-a-half years, the Taliban have ripped away the right to learn from every Afghan girl. They have weaponized our faith to justify it,' the education activist stated. 'The Taliban are explicit about their mission. They want to eliminate women and girls from every aspect of public life and erase them from society,' she said. 'Simply put, the Taliban do not see women as human beings. They cloak their crimes in cultural and religious justification.' The Taliban swept back to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, imposing their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia, that the United Nations has labeled as 'gender apartheid.' Afghan girls are entirely banned from attending school beyond the sixth grade. Women are prohibited from public and private workplaces except for a few departments, such as health, immigration, and police. The Muslim World League, or MWL, co-hosted the two-day conference in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, bringing together ministers, education officials, and scholars from nearly 50 Muslim-majority countries and representatives from the United Nations and non-governmental organizations. 'I have a message for everyone in this room,' Yousafzai said. 'As Muslim leaders, now is the time to raise your voice and use your power. You can show true leadership; you can show true Islam,' she told the gathering. 'Afghan women and girls must be free to shape their own future. The very loudest champions of their cause must be fellow Muslims, leaders such as yourselves,' she added. Yousafzai sought a united voice from Muslim scholars to openly challenge and denounce the Taliban’s 'oppressive laws.' Taliban officials did not immediately comment on the criticism. They vehemently defend their governance, saying it is aligned with Sharia and culture in Afghanistan. A conference declaration issued Sunday condemned 'extremist ideologies' and religious edicts, known as fatwas, that are rooted in cultural norms obstructing girls' education as a 'grave misuse of religious principles to legitimize policies of deprivation and exclusion.' The declaration noted that anyone who rejects or opposes Islamic principles mandating equal education for men and women 'is considered outside the framework of the Islamic Ummah’s (Islamic world’s) concepts and cannot be regarded as part of it. 'It is essential to disavow their ideology, whether they are an individual, an institution, or an entity—public or private,' the statement said. The multi-page declaration did not mention Afghanistan, the only country where girls are banned from seeking secondary school education and beyond. Pakistani officials said that the Taliban government in Kabul had been formally invited to attend the global summit, but Islamabad did not receive a response. Speaking at the opening session on Saturday, Mohammad bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa, the MWL secretary-general, stressed that men and women must acquire education as mandated by Islam. 'The Islamic world is united in its belief that those who oppose women’s education are misguided and do not represent true Islam,' Al-Issa responded when asked if the outcome of the summit could encourage the Taliban to relax restrictions on Afghan women and girls. Nonetheless, the Saudi scholar clarified that the gathering in Islamabad was not directed at any specific community or country. 'We have simply tried to address the concerns of those who oppose women’s education and conveyed our message that there are no restrictions in Islam regarding education for girls,' Al-Issa stated, without naming the Taliban. Roza Otunbayeva, the head of the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, attended the summit, telling a panel that leaders of Islamic countries need to support Afghan girls. 'I really call on all these ministers ... who came from all over the world, to offer scholarships, to have online education, to have all sorts of education for them. This is the task of the day,' she said. No country has recognized the Taliban government primarily over its curbs on Afghan women and girls. While the United States and the West at large have refused to engage with the de facto Afghan leaders diplomatically and relocated their embassies from the country, neighboring and regional countries, including China, Iran, Pakistan, and Russia, have retained their diplomatic missions in Kabul and maintain close contacts with the Taliban.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malala-yousafzai-asks-muslim-leaders-to-reject-taliban-s-treatment-of-afghan-women-openly-/7933980.html	2025-01-12T07:27:09-08:00	
Sweden to contribute up to 3 warships to reinforced NATO presence in Baltic	STOCKHOLM — Sweden will contribute up to three warships to a NATO effort to increase the alliance's presence in the Baltic Sea as it tries to guard against sabotage of underwater infrastructure, the government said Sunday. The Swedish military also will contribute an ASC 890 surveillance aircraft, the government said in a statement. And the country's coast guard will contribute four ships to help monitor the Baltic, with a further seven vessels on standby. Sweden became the Western military alliance's 32nd member in March. It followed neighboring Finland into NATO after Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The government said this will be the first time that Sweden as a NATO ally contributes armed forces to the alliance's defense and deterrence. The decision comes as a string of incidents in the Baltic has heightened concerns about possible Russian activities in the region. The undersea cables and pipelines that crisscross the sea link Nordic, Baltic and central European countries, promote trade, energy security and, in some cases, reduce dependence on Russian energy resources. Ten Baltic Sea cables have been damaged since 2023, affecting Estonia, Finland, Sweden, Germany and Lithuania. At least two incidents involved ships later accused of dragging their anchors. Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said at an annual security conference Sunday that Sweden is not at war, but there is also no peace, Swedish news agency TT reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-to-contribute-up-to-3-warships-to-reinforced-nato-presence-in-baltic/7933974.html	2025-01-12T07:13:46-08:00	
15 killed in explosion and fire at gas station in central Yemen	Cairo — An explosion at a gas station triggered a massive fire in central Yemen, killing at least 15 people, health officials said Sunday. The explosion occurred Saturday at the Zaher district in the province of Bayda, the Houthi rebel-run Health Ministry said in a statement. At least 67 others were injured, including 40 in critical condition. The ministry said rescue teams were searching for those reported missing. It wasn't immediately clear what caused the explosion. Footage circulated online showing a massive fire that sent columns of smoke into the sky and left vehicles charred and burning. Bayda is controlled by Iranian-backed Houthi rebels, who have been at war with Yemen's internationally recognized government for more than a decade. Elsewhere in Bayda, the Houthis attacked and looted Hanaka al-Masoud village in the al-Qurayshiya district last week, according to the internationally recognized government. It said there were fatalities but gave no figures. Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani said the attack came after a weeklong siege of the village. 'This horrific attack targeted citizens' homes and mosques, and resulted in many casualties, including women and children, and the destruction of property,' he said. Rights activist Riyadh al-Dubai said the Houthis detained dozens of men and looted homes, seizing valuables such as gold, money, daggers and other possessions. He said shelling by the Houthis had continued relentlessly day and night for more than five days. The U.S. Embassy in Yemen condemned the attack, saying in a statement that the 'deaths, injuries, and wrongful detentions of innocent Yemenis perpetrated by Houthi terrorists are depriving the Yemeni people of peace and a brighter future.' Yemen's civil war began in 2014, when the rebels took control of the capital, Sanaa, and much of the country's north, forcing the government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia. A Saudi-led coalition entered the war in March 2015, backed at the time by the U.S., in an effort to restore the internationally recognized government. The war has killed more than 150,000 people including civilians and combatants, and in recent years deteriorated largely into a stalemate and caused one of the world's worst humanitarian crises.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-in-an-explosion-and-fire-at-a-gas-station-in-central-yemen-/7933898.html	2025-01-12T05:29:14-08:00	
Zelenskyy calls on allies to honor promises on arms supplies to Ukraine	KYIV — Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy called on allies on Sunday to honor all promises to supply Ukraine with weapons, including those to counter Russian air attacks. Zelenskyy said that over the past week Russian forces had launched hundreds of strikes on Ukraine and nearly 700 aerial bombs and over 600 attack drones were used. Ukrainian air defenses downed 60 out of 94 drones launched by Russia overnight, the air force said on Sunday. It said that 34 drones were 'lost,' in reference to Ukraine's use of electronic warfare to redirect Russian drones. 'Every week, the Russian war continues only because the Russian army retains its ability to terrorize Ukraine and exploit its superiority in the sky,' Zelenskyy said on the Telegram messaging app. He called on Ukraine's allies to fulfill agreements already made. 'The decisions made at the NATO summit in Washington, as well as those adopted during the Ramstein meetings regarding air defenses for Ukraine, have still not been fully implemented,' Zelenskyy said. Ukraine's leader this week said he had discussed with partners and the United States the possibility of granting Ukraine licenses to produce air defense systems and missiles.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskiyy-calls-on-allies-to-honor-promises-on-arms-supplies-to-ukraine-/7933864.html	2025-01-12T04:21:41-08:00	
Voters in Comoros head to polls to elect 33-seat parliament	MORONI — Voters in Comoros were heading to the polls on Sunday to elect the Indian Ocean archipelago's 33-seat parliament, a year after the reelection of President Azali Assoumani in a poll which the opposition alleged was marred by widespread irregularities. Officials from the ruling party have denied those allegations. Polling stations opened early on Sunday and voters, numbering some 338,000 according to the polling body, started casting their ballots at 8 a.m. Comoros last had parliamentary elections in January 2020. Nearly 100 candidates were selected by the country's Supreme Court to contest the election. Assoumani's opponents accuse him of authoritarian excesses and suspect him of wanting to prepare his eldest son, Nour El-Fath, to replace him when his term ends in 2029. Assoumani has been ruling Comoros since 1999 when he came to power through a coup. He has since won three elections. Last year Assoumani granted his son sweeping new powers, putting him in charge of coordinating all government affairs. Some opposition parties, such as Juwa, led by former President Ahmed Abdallah Sambi who was sentenced to life imprisonment in 2022, have called for the boycott of the polls, although others have rejected that plea. 'The Azali regime is weakened ... by participating in these elections we are contributing to further exposing the flaws in its system and accelerating its inevitable fall,' Hamidou Karihila, who is contesting the election for the opposition Hope of the Comoros party, told Reuters. Polls are due to close at 4 p.m. and results are expected by Jan. 17.	https://www.voanews.com/a/voters-in-comoros-head-to-polls-to-elect-33-seat-parliament-/7933850.html	2025-01-12T03:09:23-08:00	
2034 World Cup visitors will live in 'a bubble,' not see real life, Saudi rights activist says	LONDON — Football fans visiting Saudi Arabia for the 2034 World Cup will live in a 'bubble' that does not reflect real life there, a Saudi rights activist warned on Thursday. After FIFA confirmed the kingdom as the 2034 tournament host on Wednesday, the football body president Gianni Infantino acknowledged 'the world will be watching' to see positive social change. Human rights groups believe migrant workers' lives will be at risk building stadiums and other projects for the World Cup, and Saudi Arabia's laws limiting freedoms for women and LGBTQ+ people have been criticized at the United Nations Human Rights council. 'Western people will be very safe. They will see a bubble of what Saudi Arabia is,' Lina al-Hathloul, a Saudi activist with the London-based rights group ALQST, said. Her sister, Loujain al-Hathloul, was jailed for three years after campaigning to end the Saudi ban on women driving that was lifted in 2018, and lives there under a travel ban. Saudi Arabia is today 'a pure police state,' Lina al-Hathloul claimed, under the rule of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whose close working ties to Infantino were key to getting the World Cup without a rival bid. The crown prince 'has really managed to create this bubble where people only see entertainment and they don't see the reality on the ground,' al-Hathloul said. 'No one will see tortures in prisons and no one will see executions. You also have the jails full of people just for tweets.' Saudi officials stressed during a 15-month bid campaign, made mostly opaque by FIFA, that the kingdom is modernizing fast and hosting football's biggest event will drive more change. 'We're very proud of the society that we are today,' Hammad Albalawi, from the 2034 World Cup bid team, said on Wednesday in Riyadh, stating the kingdom's goals are 'to make the citizens global citizens and to welcome guests from all around the world.' Only Norway of FIFA's 211 member federations opposed how the 2034 decision was made by acclaim on Wednesday. Two years ago, on the eve of the World Cup in Qatar, Infantino accused Europeans of hypocrisy giving moral lessons to other regions and cultures. On Wednesday, the English Football Association said it got promises from Saudi officials before giving support. 'They assured us that they are fully committed to providing a safe and welcome environment for all fans,' the English FA said in a statement, 'including LGBTQ+ fans.' Two days before the vote, British Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with Prince Mohammed in Riyadh and said Saudi Arabia was a key partner in his 'number one mission' of economic growth. Starmer, who is an Arsenal fan, said he hoped to watch a game with the crown prince on a future visit to London. 'You have some changes,' Al-Hathloul said, noting more freedoms for Saudi women to choose what to wear, 'but they're not institutional, they're not fundamental, and they're not for everyone.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-cup-visitors-will-live-in-a-bubble-not-see-real-life-saudi-rights-activist-says-/7931799.html	2025-01-12T00:06:29-08:00	
Court ruling will help New Mexico stay a go-to state for women seeking abortions	SANTA FE, NEW MEXICO — The New Mexico Supreme Court on Thursday struck down abortion restrictions by conservative cities and counties, helping to ensure the state remains a go-to destination for people from other states with bans. The unanimous opinion, in response to a request from state Attorney General Raúl Torrez, reinforces the state's position as having some of the most liberal abortion laws in the country. Attorneys representing the cities of Hobbs and Clovis and Lea and Roosevelt counties had argued that provisions of a federal 'anti-vice' law known as the Comstock Act block courts from striking down local abortion ordinances. But Justice C. Shannon Bacon, writing for the majority opinion, said state law precludes cities and counties from restricting abortion or regulating abortion clinics. 'The ordinances violate this core precept and invade the Legislature's authority to regulate access to and provision of reproductive healthcare,' she wrote. 'We hold the ordinances are preempted in their entirety.' New Mexico Attorney General Raúl Torrez praised the court's ruling Thursday, saying that the core of the argument was that state laws preempted any action by local governments to engage in activities that would infringe on the constitutional rights of citizens. 'The bottom line is simply this: Abortion access is safe and secure in New Mexico,' he said. 'It's enshrined in law by the recent ruling by the New Mexico Supreme Court and thanks to the work of the New Mexico Legislature.' New Mexico House Speaker Javier Martínez called access to health care a basic fundamental right in New Mexico. 'It doesn't take a genius to understand the statutory framework that we have. Local governments don't regulate health care in New Mexico. It is up to the state,' the Albuquerque Democrat said. Opposition to abortion runs deep in New Mexico communities along the border with Texas, which has one of the most restrictive bans in the U.S. But Democrats, who control every statewide elected office in New Mexico and hold majorities in the state House and Senate, have moved to shore up access to abortion — before and after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, eliminating the nationwide right to abortion. In 2021, the New Mexico Legislature repealed a dormant 1969 statute that outlawed most abortion procedures as felonies, ensuring access to abortion even after the Roe v. Wade reversal. And in 2023, Democratic New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham signed a bill that overrides local ordinances aimed at limiting abortion access and enacted a shield law that protects abortion providers from investigations by other states. In September, construction began on a state-funded reproductive health and abortion clinic in southern New Mexico that will cater to local residents and people who travel from neighboring states. The new clinic is scheduled for completion by early 2026 to provide services ranging from medical and procedural abortions to contraception, cervical cancer screenings and education about adoptions. In Thursday's opinion, justices said they 'strongly admonish' Roosevelt County, in particular, for an ordinance that would have allowed individuals to file lawsuits demanding damages of more than $100,000 for violations of the county's abortion ordinance. The provision would have created 'a private right of action and damages award that is clearly intended to punish protected conduct,' the court said in its opinion. Erin Hawley, a vice president at Alliance Defending Freedom, an Arizona-based Christian legal advocacy group, is an attorney who argued on behalf of Roosevelt County in the case. On Thursday, she criticized the court's decision and emphasized its limitations. 'Roosevelt County and other New Mexico localities should be able to enforce ordinances that comply with federal law and protect the lives of their citizens,' said Hawley, the wife of U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri. 'We're grateful that the New Mexico Supreme Court did not abandon common sense and find a so-called right to abortion in the state constitution.' It was not immediately clear whether the ruling can be appealed in federal court or influence broader efforts to apply Comstock Act restrictions on abortion. The New Mexico Supreme Court opinion explicitly declined to address conflicts with federal law, basing its decision solely on state provisions. Austin, Texas-based attorney Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas solicitor general and architect of that state's strict abortion ban, said he looked forward 'to litigating these issues in other states and bringing the meaning of the federal Comstock Act to the Supreme Court of the United States.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/court-ruling-will-help-new-mexico-stay-a-go-to-state-for-women-seeking-abortions/7931810.html	2025-01-12T00:05:42-08:00	
Huge, rare Mekong catfish spotted in Cambodia, raising conservation hopes	HANOI, Vietnam — Six critically endangered Mekong giant catfish — one of the largest and rarest freshwater fish in the world — were caught and released recently in Cambodia, reviving hopes for the survival of the species. The underwater giants can grow up to 10 feet (3 meters) long and weigh up to 300 kilograms (661 pounds), or as heavy as a grand piano. They now are found only in Southeast Asia's Mekong River but in the past inhabited the length of the 4,900-kilometer (3,044-mile) river, all the way from its outlet in Vietnam to its northern reaches in China's Yunnan province. The species' population has plummeted by 80% in recent decades because of rising pressures from overfishing, dams that block the migratory path the fish follow to spawn and other disruptions. Few of the millions of people who depend on the Mekong for their livelihoods have ever seen a giant catfish. To find six of the giants, which were caught and released within five days, is unprecedented. The first two were on the Tonle Sap river, a tributary of the Mekong not far from the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh. They were given identification tags and released. On Tuesday, fishermen caught four more giant catfish including two longer than 2 meters (6.5 feet) that weighed 120 kilograms and 131 kilograms (264 pounds and 288 pounds), respectively. The captured fish were apparently migrating from their floodplain habitats near Cambodia's Tonle Sap Lake northward along the Mekong River, likely to spawning grounds in northern Cambodia, Laos or Thailand. 'It's a hopeful sign that the species is not in imminent - like, in the next few years - risk of extinction, which gives conservation activities time to be implemented and to continue to bend the curve away from decline and toward recovery,' said Dr. Zeb Hogan, a University of Nevada-Reno research biologist who leads the U.S. Agency for International Development-funded Wonders of the Mekong project. Much is still unknown about the giant fish, but over the past two decades a joint conservation program by the Wonders of the Mekong and the Cambodian Fisheries Administration has caught, tagged and released around 100 of them, gaining insights into how the catfish migrate, where they live and the health of the species. 'This information is used to establish migration corridors and protect habitats to try to help these fish survive in the future,' said Hogan. The Mekong giant catfish is woven into the region's cultural fabric, depicted in 3,000-year-old cave paintings, revered in folklore and considered a symbol of the river, whose fisheries feed millions and are valued at $10 billion annually. Local communities play a crucial role in conservation. Fishermen now know about the importance of reporting accidental catches of rare and endangered species to officials, enabling researchers to reach places where fish have been captured and measure and tag them before releasing them. 'Their cooperation is essential for our research and conservation efforts,' Heng Kong, director of Cambodia's Inland Fisheries Research and Development Institute, said in a statement. Apart from the Mekong giant catfish, the river is also home to other large fish, including the salmon carp, which was thought to be extinct until it was spotted earlier this year, and the giant sting ray. That four of these fish were caught and tagged in a single day is likely the 'big fish story of the century for the Mekong,' said Brian Eyler, director of the Washington-based Stimson Center's Southeast Asia Program. He said that seeing them confirms that the annual fish migration was still robust despite all the pressures facing the environment along the Mekong. 'Hopefully, what happened this week will show the Mekong countries and the world that the Mekong's mighty fish population is uniquely special and needs to be conserved,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/huge-rare-mekong-catfish-spotted-in-cambodia-raising-conservation-hopes-/7931801.html	2025-01-12T00:05:05-08:00	
Scarves over headscarves, Muslim women's outdoors group tackles snow tubing in Minnesota	MAPLE GROVE, Minnesota — Ice crystals clung to the eyelashes, parka hood, beanie hat and headscarf of Ruqayah Nasser as she took a break after her first-ever snow tubing runs in a Minnesota park on a -18 Celsius January morning. She had joined two dozen other members of a group founded by a Somali-American mother in Minneapolis to promote all-seasons activities among Muslim women, who might otherwise feel singled out in the great outdoors, especially when wearing hijabs. 'They understand my lifestyle. I don't have to explain myself,' said Nasser, who recently moved to the Twin Cities from Chicago and whose family hails from Yemen. 'My religion is everything. It's my survival kit.' As one of the most visible signs of the Muslim faith, hijabs often attract controversy. Within Islam, some women want to wear the headscarves for piety and modesty, while others oppose them as a symbol of oppression. In the sports world, including in the last Olympics, devout athletes have often faced extra hurdles on and off the field in finding accommodations for religious practices. Concerned about safety as a woman — particularly one wearing a head covering — but determined to get outdoors to beat seasonal depression, Nasrieen Habib put out a social media post about creating a hiking group three years ago. From the nine women who responded, her Amanah Rec Project has grown to more than 700 members. There's a core group for Muslim women only — for 'more sisterhood and modesty,' Habib says — as well as a group for families. In addition to weekly outings, they organize longer trips and education on everything from appropriate winter clothing — a challenge for many migrant communities — to health and environmental sustainability from the perspective of Islam. 'It's a way to live your whole life according to a set of beliefs and rules. And part of those beliefs and rules is taking care of creation,' Habib said as her 4-year-old son took a break from tubing in a toasty chalet at Elm Creek Park Reserve near Minneapolis. 'How can we be more sustainable in a time where we see the impact of climate change, especially impacting people who look like us in the Global South?' Two sisters, Ruun Mahamud and Nawal Hirsi, moved to the United States from Somalia as children about two decades ago. They found a safe haven in Minnesota where, since the late 1990s, growing numbers of East African refugees have created an increasingly vocal Muslim community. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar was the first lawmaker to wear a hijab while on the U.S. House floor, and Minneapolis was the first large city in the United States to allow the Islamic call to prayer to be broadcast publicly by its two dozen mosques. Even though she feels 'safe and accepted' in her hijab, Hirsi joined the group for extra support. 'I love being outdoors and joining this group has made me more comfortable to participate,' she said on the tubing hill, where she had convinced Mahamud to come along for the first time. 'Oh my gosh, it's the most amazing thing I've ever done,' Mahamud gushed after speeding downhill on a tube attached to her sister's as their daughters recorded the adventure on their phones. The sisters said it's important to include love for the outdoors and physical activity in their children's religious upbringing. 'Taking care of one's health is part of our faith,' Hirsi said. Muslim women who wear hijabs can face multiple barriers to sports participation, said Umer Hussain, a Wilkes University professor who studies religion and sports. They range from activities where genders mix or head coverings pose logistical hurdles to conservative families who might frown on it. Groups like Habib's tackle empowering women in their communities as well as raising awareness about religious accommodations like single-sex spaces or locations for prayer. 'The biggest barrier, for women specifically, is having access to spaces that allow us to practice our religion while keeping our modesty and abiding by the Islamic laws that tell us we are not supposed to be in mixed spaces without covering up,' Habib said. She appears to have tapped into a great demand. 'When she told me she was going to start a hiking group to get sisters out in nature … it was like actually something I've been looking for for a very long time,' Makiya Amin said as she climbed up the tubing hill in a long white skirt, bright-red headscarf, and heavy winter coat. 'I didn't really have those type of people who were outdoorsy already around me.' Isho Mohamed joined the group for the wide-ranging conversations as much as for the outdoors, which as a self-described 'homebody' she had largely avoided since college days. 'It's a safe space that takes me out of my comfort zone,' she said of the group outings. During them, the women share about work experiences but also life as immigrants and, most importantly, their faith. 'We also talk about spiritual connection and connecting with God as well, and just say a little prayer here and there when we're walking,' Mohamed added. Her cheeks glowing above her ski mask after two hours on the hill, Jorida Latifi was with her 7-year-old son among the last to hang up their snow tubes. Originally from Albania, Latifi has gone out with the group almost weekly since joining more than a year ago. 'With Muslim sisters … they do understand you, what you go through, even with the clothing and hijabs,' Latifi said. 'It feels way, way more like, you know, where you are with family.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/scarves-over-headscarves-muslim-women-s-outdoors-group-tackles-snow-tubing-in-minnesota/7930545.html	2025-01-12T00:03:59-08:00	
Croatia's President Milanovic overwhelming favorite to win reelection in runoff vote	ZAGREB, CROATIA — Croatia's incumbent President Zoran Milanovic will be the overwhelming favorite to win reelection when he faces a ruling conservative party candidate in a runoff presidential vote on Sunday. The left-leaning Milanovic comfortably won the first round of voting on Dec. 29, leaving his main challenger Dragan Primorac, a forensic scientist who had unsuccessfully run for presidency previously, and six other candidates far behind. The runoff between the top two contenders was necessary because Milanovic won 49% of the vote, falling short of securing outright victory by merely 5,000 votes, while Primorac trailed far behind with 19%. The election comes as the European Union and NATO member country of 3.8 million people struggles with biting inflation, corruption scandals and a labor shortage. Milanovic, 58, is an outspoken critic of Western military support for Ukraine in its war against Russia. He is the most popular politician in Croatia and is sometimes compared to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump for his combative style of communication with political opponents. Milanovic has served as prime minister in the past with a mixed record. He has been a fierce critic of current Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic and the pair have long sparred with each other. Milanovic regularly accuses Plenkovic and his conservative Croatian Democratic Union party of systemic corruption, calling the premier a 'serious threat to Croatia's democracy.' Plenkovic has sought to portray Sunday's vote as one about Croatia's future in the EU and NATO. He has labelled Milanovic 'pro-Russian' and a threat to Croatia's international standing. Political analyst Viseslav Raos said the increasingly outspoken Milanovic has no motive to 'try to please someone or try to control himself.' 'If there was no cooperation with the prime minister for the first five years [of his presidency], why would it be now,' he added. Though the presidency is largely ceremonial in Croatia, an elected president holds political authority and acts as the supreme military commander. Despite limited powers, many believe the presidential position is key for the political balance of power in a country mainly governed by the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) since gaining independence from Yugoslavia in 1991. During a TV debate ahead of the Sunday vote, Milanovic and Primorac exchanged barbs while exposing deep political differences. Primorac, 59, entered politics in the early 2000s, when he was science and education minister in the HDZ-led government. He unsuccessfully ran for the presidency in 2009, and after that mainly focused on his academic career including lecturing at universities in the United States, China and in Croatia. Milanovic denied he is pro-Russian but last year blocked the dispatch of five Croatian officers to NATO's mission in Germany called Security Assistance and Training for Ukraine. He also pledged he would never approve sending Croatian soldiers as part of any NATO mission to Ukraine. Plenkovic and his government say there is no such proposal. Milanovic accused Primorac of associating with 'mass murderers,' referring to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's associates and the war in Gaza. He also claimed that Plenkovic was Primorac's sponsor and dubbed Primorac 'the last communist' — a reference to his membership of the former ruling Communist Party of Yugoslavia in the late 1980s. Primorac meanwhile claimed that Milanovic's only political allies were Bosnian Serb separatist leader Milorad Dodik, Russia's President Vladimir Putin and Hungary's populist leader Viktor Orban.	https://www.voanews.com/a/croatia-s-president-milanovic-overwhelming-favorite-to-win-reelection-in-runoff-vote/7933801.html	2025-01-11T23:16:45-08:00	
North Korean troops in Ukraine gain battlefield experience, cementing alliance with Russia	KYIV, UKRAINE — For weeks, Ukrainian troops braced for an unfamiliar enemy: North Korean soldiers sent to bolster Moscow's forces after Ukraine launched a lightning-fast incursion and seized territory in Russia's Kursk region over the summer. Their arrival marked a new and alarming phase in the war. And while initially inexperienced on the battlefield, North Korean troops have adapted quickly — a development that could have far-reaching consequences as they gain combat knowledge in the war against Ukraine. Unlike the Russian troops Ukraine has been battling for nearly three years, Kyiv's forces were uncertain about what to expect from this new adversary, drawn into the war after Moscow and Pyongyang signed an agreement pledging military assistance using 'all means' if either were attacked. One Ukrainian soldier who has witnessed North Koreans in battle described them as disciplined and highly methodical, saying they were more professional than their Russian counterparts. The soldier spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to discuss the sensitive military issue. However, other soldiers, including Ukrainian special forces, have shared battlefield drone footage on the Telegram messaging app mocking their tactics as outdated. Nevertheless, there is consensus among Ukrainian soldiers, military intelligence and others monitoring developments on the ground: While Pyongyang's troops lacked battlefield experience when they arrived, that has been changing quickly. With 1.2 million troops, North Korea's military ranks among the largest standing armies globally. But its post-Korean War foreign engagements have been limited, leaving them inexperienced with modern warfare technologies like drones. 'For the first time in decades, the North Korean army is gaining real military experience,' said Andrii Yusov, spokesperson for Ukraine's military intelligence agency. 'This is a global challenge — not just for Ukraine and Europe, but for the entire world.' Identifying the presence of North Korean troops Despite Ukrainian, U.S. and South Korean assertions that Pyongyang has sent 10,000-12,000 troops to fight alongside Russia in the Kursk border region, Moscow has never publicly acknowledged the North Korean forces. While reports of their presence first emerged in October, Ukrainian troops only confirmed engagement on the ground in December. Analysts say that without the influx of North Korean troops, Russia would have struggled to pursue its strategy of overwhelming Ukraine by throwing large numbers of soldiers into the battle for Kursk. While Moscow's counterattack in Kursk has inflicted thousands of Ukrainian casualties, Kyiv's overstretched forces have managed to hold on to about half of the 984 square kilometers seized in August, though the situation remains dynamic. Besides the symbolic impact of Ukraine's success capturing Russian territory, control of Kursk could also be a bargaining chip in any ceasefire negotiations. According to Ukraine's intelligence agency, the North Korean soldiers are operating alongside Russian units, with the latter providing reconnaissance and electronic warfare support. The North Koreans wear Russian military uniforms with fake military IDs in their pockets, according to a report by a Ukrainian military unit that has observed them on the battlefield, and they could easily be mistaken for Russian soldiers. The subterfuge means Moscow and 'its representatives at the U.N. can deny the facts,' said Yusov, the Ukrainian military intelligence spokesperson. Among the things proving their presence is that they have been heard speaking Korean with North Korean accents in intercepted communications, Yusov said. He said the North Korean troops are using their own weapons and equipment and have learned to cope with the improvised explosives-laden drones that have become emblematic of the war, first-hand experience even some NATO-member countries don't have. 'This is a new level of threat,' Yusov said. 'Regional countries must prepare for what this means in the future.' North Koreans gain invaluable experience on the battlefield The North Koreans' early missteps were largely caused by inexperience, such as moving in large groups in open terrain, making them easy targets for drones and artillery strikes. According to the Ukrainian military unit's report, the North Korean soldiers were spotted easily as they moved in single-file columns through forest in groups of three, with 3 to 5 meters between soldiers. On open terrain, they moved in dispersed formations of five to 15 soldiers, making them vulnerable and leading to heavy losses. However, during night operations, their movements were swift and units oriented themselves using red flashlights along routes, the report said. 'They're fast, physically well-prepared, and act strictly according to their algorithms,' said the Ukrainian soldier who spoke to the AP. 'If you drill the same routines for years, to the point where they can be executed blindfolded, it will yield results.' Despite their discipline, their lack of combat experience hindered their effectiveness. The Ukrainian military reported that North Korean troops often sustained heavy losses, with many killed by drones. On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy put the number of killed or wounded North Koreans at 4,000, though U.S. estimates are lower, at around 1,200. 'Much of their military doctrine and training is based on strategies and experiences from over half a century ago,' said Glib Voloskyi, a military analyst with the Ukrainian think tank CBA Initiatives Center. The large-group formations date to when artillery accuracy was significantly lower, and observing troop movements much more difficult. Today, reconnaissance and so-called first-person view drones, or FPVs, that transmit video allowing soldiers to strike targets in real time have made the battlefield highly transparent, and anyone stepping onto it without cover, let alone moving in groups, is immediately spotted. 'But it is only a matter of time before they acquire the necessary skills to improve their combat effectiveness, which, combined with their discipline and training, could make them a significant military force,' Voloskyi said. No surrender policy means few North Korean POWs After weeks of fighting, Ukrainian soldiers have taken only two prisoners of war. In announcing the capture Saturday, Zelenskyy said taking them alive 'was not easy' because of efforts to conceal the North Koreans' presence and avoid their interrogation by Ukraine. North Korean soldiers avoid surrendering at all costs, Zelenskyy said. This may stem from North Korean internal propaganda that portrays capture as the ultimate disgrace, analysts said. 'To be captured alive is considered a betrayal of the country, the leader and everything they stand for,' said Seongmin Lee of the New York-based Human Rights Foundation, who defected from North Korea in 2009. This belief is instilled from a young age and reinforced throughout military training, he said. 'Because of the disgrace associated with the capitulation, heroic soldiers are supposed to save the last of their bullets to kill themselves,' Lee said. Lee said he shared photos of dead North Korean soldiers with contacts back home. 'Most North Koreans don't even know what is going on,' he said. Dorothy Camille Shea, the deputy U.S. ambassador to the U.N., warned of the dangers posed by the rapidly improving battlefield skills the North Korean troops are gaining fighting in Kursk. North Korea 'is significantly benefiting from receiving Russian military equipment, technology and experience, rendering it more capable of waging war against its neighbors,' Shea told the 15-member U.N. Security Council on Wednesday. As an added potential benefit, she said, North Korea 'will likely be eager to leverage these improvements to promote weapons sales and military training contracts globally.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-troops-in-ukraine-gain-battlefield-experience-cementing-alliance-with-russia/7933800.html	2025-01-11T22:59:37-08:00	
Arab, EU diplomats in Saudi Arabia for talks on support for Syria	RIYADH, SAUDI ARABIA — Top diplomats from the Middle East and Europe head for the Saudi capital for talks on Syria as world powers push for stability after the fall of Bashar al-Assad. The talks on Sunday will unfold in two sessions: the first will bring together Arab officials while the second will feature wider participation including from Turkey, France, the European Union, Britain and the United Nations, a Saudi official told AFP on Saturday. The gathering takes place as Syria's new leader, Ahmed al-Sharaa, whose forces seized Damascus and toppled longtime ruler Assad last month, is pushing for sanctions relief. Western powers, including the United States and the European Union, imposed sanctions on Assad's government over his brutal crackdown on anti-government protests in 2011 that triggered civil war. More than 13 years of conflict in Syria have killed more than half a million people, ravaged the economy, and pushed millions to flee their homes, including to Europe. The European Union's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said on Friday that the 27-nation bloc could begin lifting sanctions if Syria's new rulers took steps to form an inclusive government that protects minorities. Saudi Arabia cut ties with Assad's government in 2012 and had long openly championed his ouster. But in 2023 it hosted an Arab League meeting at which Assad was welcomed back into the regional fold. This month the Gulf kingdom, the biggest economy in the Middle East, has sent food, shelter and medical supplies to Syria. Riyadh is now negotiating how to support the war-struck country's transition beyond that. 'This summit sends the message that Saudi Arabia wants to take the lead on coordinating the regional effort to support Syria's recovery,' said Anna Jacobs, a non-resident fellow at the Arab Gulf States Institute in Washington. 'But the big question is how much time and how many resources will Saudi Arabia devote to this effort? And what is possible with many of the sanctions remaining in place?' The meetings on Sunday represent a continuation of talks on post-Assad Syria held last month in Jordan, the Saudi official said. U.S. Undersecretary of State John Bass is also to attend, coming from talks in Turkey that partly covered 'the importance of regional stability, preventing Syria from being used as a base for terrorism, and ensuring the enduring defeat' of the Islamic State group, the State Department said. Saudi Arabia is among the countries taking a more cautious approach to Syria's new administration than Turkey and Qatar, which were the first to re-open embassies in Damascus after the fall of Assad, said Umer Karim, an expert on Saudi politics at the University of Birmingham. Yet Riyadh is 'positively approaching' the new leaders in Syria, looking to see if they can bring stability and 'control the more extreme elements in (their) ranks,' Karim said. Sunday's gathering 'gives Riyadh an opportunity to increase its sway with the new Syrian government and cultivate greater influence in a country where Turkey and Qatar now have more sway,' Jacobs said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arab-eu-diplomats-in-saudi-arabia-for-talks-on-support-for-syria-/7933772.html	2025-01-11T18:43:50-08:00	
Australia state premier calls synagogue attack an escalation in antisemitic crime	SYDNEY — The premier of Australia's New South Wales state, Chris Minns, said on Sunday that an attack on a Sydney synagogue on Saturday marked an escalation in antisemitic crime in the state, after police said the attack was attempted arson. Australia has seen a series of antisemitic incidents in the last year, including graffiti on buildings and cars in Sydney, as well as an arson attack on a synagogue in Melbourne that police ruled terrorism. In the latest incident, police were notified of antisemitic graffiti on a synagogue in the inner suburb of Newtown early on Saturday. An arson attempt was also made on the synagogue, police later said. 'This is an escalation in antisemitic crime in New South Wales. Police and the government remain very concerned that an accelerant may have been used,' Minns, the leader of Australia's most populous state, said on Sunday in a televised media conference alongside state police commissioner Karen Webb. 'In the last 24 hours, these matters have now been taken over by counterterrorism command,' Webb said. A house in Sydney's east, a hub of the city's Jewish community, was also defaced with antisemitic graffiti, police said on Saturday, adding they were also looking into offensive comments on a street poster in the suburb of Marrickville. On Friday, a special police task force was set up to investigate an attack on the Southern Sydney Synagogue in the suburb of Allawah early Friday morning. David Ossip, president of the New South Wales Jewish Board of Deputies, said on Sunday he welcomed extra resources promised by the government in the recent incidents. 'The New South Wales government has also provided us with additional funding to enhance Jewish communal security,' Ossip added in a statement. On Friday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, referring to the Southern Sydney Synagogue incident, said that there was 'no place in Australia, our tolerant multicultural community, for this sort of criminal activity.' The number of anti-Semitic and Islamophobic incidents have increased in Australia since Hamas attacked Israel in October 2023 and Israel launched its war on Gaza. Some Jewish organizations have said the government has not taken sufficient action in response.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-state-premier-calls-synagogue-attack-an-escalation-in-antisemitic-crime/7933773.html	2025-01-11T18:21:05-08:00	
Syria, Lebanon pledge firm ties after years of tensions	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Syria's new ruler and Lebanon's prime minister pledged Saturday to build lasting ties during the first visit by a Lebanese head of government to Damascus since the civil war started in 2011. Prime Minister Najib Mikati's trip came after Islamist-led rebels seized Damascus last month, bringing an end to the rule of President Bashar al-Assad. Previous Lebanese governments refrained from visits to Syria amid tensions at home over militant group Hezbollah's support for Assad during the conflict. Syria's new leader Ahmed al-Sharaa said he hoped to turn over a new leaf in relations, days after crisis-hit Lebanon finally elected a president this week following two years of deadlock. 'There will be long-term strategic relations between us and Lebanon. We and Lebanon have great shared interests,' said Sharaa. It was time to 'give the Syrian and Lebanese people a chance to build a positive relationship,' he said, adding he hoped Joseph Aoun's presidency would usher in an era of stability in Lebanon. Sharaa said the new Syria would 'stay at equal distance from all' in Lebanon, and 'try to solve problems through negotiations and dialogue.' Mikati said ties should be based on 'mutual respect, equality and national sovereignty.' The new authorities in Syria also said Sharaa had phoned Aoun to congratulate him Saturday. Syria was the dominant power in Lebanon for three decades under the Assad family, with President Hafez al-Assad intervening in its 1975-1990 civil war and his son Bashar al-Assad only withdrawing Syria's troops in 2005 following mass protests triggered by the assassination of Lebanese ex-Prime Minister Rafic Hariri. After mending ties with Damascus, his son Saad Hariri was the last Lebanese premier to visit the Syrian capital in 2010 before the civil war. Taking office Thursday, Aoun swore he would seize the 'historic opportunity to start serious... dialogue with the Syrian state.' With Hezbollah weakened after two months of full-scale war with Israel late last year and Assad now gone, Syrian and Lebanese leaders seem eager to work to solve long-pending issues. Among them is the presence of some 2 million Syrian refugees Lebanon says have sought shelter there since Syria's war started. Their return to Syria had become 'an urgent matter in the interest of both countries,' Mikati said. Lebanese authorities have long complained that hosting so many Syrians has become a burden for the tiny Mediterranean country which since 2019 has been wracked by its worst-ever economic crisis. Mikati also said it was a priority 'to draw up the land and sea borders between Lebanon and Syria,' calling for creation of a joint committee to discuss the matter. Under Assad, Syria repeatedly refused to delimit its borders with its neighbor. Lebanon has hoped to draw the maritime border so it can begin offshore gas extraction after reaching a similar agreement with Israel in 2022. The Lebanese premier said both sides had stressed the need for 'complete control of (land) borders, especially over illicit border points, to stem smuggling.' Syria shares a 330-kilometer (205-mile) border with Syria with no official demarcation at several points, making it porous and prone to smuggling. Syria imposed new restrictions on the entry of Lebanese citizens last week, following what Lebanon's army said was a border skirmish with unnamed armed Syrians. Lebanese nationals had previously been allowed into Syria without a visa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-lebanon-pledge-firm-ties-after-years-of-tensions-/7933763.html	2025-01-11T17:18:45-08:00	
Biden honors Pope Francis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden on Saturday honored Pope Francis with the Presidential Medal of Freedom with distinction, the highest civilian award given by the president, saying the pontiff was 'a light of faith, hope, and love that shines brightly across the world.' Biden had been scheduled to present the medal to the pope in person on Saturday in Rome on what was to be the final overseas trip of his presidency, but Biden canceled his travel plans so he could monitor the wildfires in California. The White House said Biden bestowed the award to the pope during a phone call in which they also discussed efforts to promote peace and alleviate suffering around the world. It's the only time Biden has presented the honor with distinction during his presidency. Biden himself is a recipient of the award with distinction, recognized when he was vice president by then-President Barack Obama in a surprise ceremony eight years ago. That was the only time in Obama's two terms that he awarded that version of the medal. The citation for the pope says 'his mission of serving the poor has never ceased. A loving pastor, he joyfully answers children's questions about God. A challenging teacher, he commands us to fight for peace and protect the planet. A welcoming leader, he reaches out to different faiths.' Biden is preparing to leave office Jan. 20 and has doled out honors to prominent individuals, including supporters and allies, in recent weeks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-honors-pope-francis-with-the-presidential-medal-of-freedom/7933765.html	2025-01-11T17:17:04-08:00	
Blue Origin set for 1st launch of New Glenn rocket	CAPE CANAVERAL — A quarter of a century after its founding, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is finally ready for its maiden orbital voyage with a brand-new rocket the company hopes will shake up the commercial space race. The launch initially scheduled for Sunday was pushed back a day due to 'unfavorable' sea conditions, Blue Origin posted on X. Named New Glenn after legendary astronaut John Glenn — the first American to orbit Earth in 1962 — the rocket stands 320 feet (98 meters) tall, roughly equivalent to a 32-story building — and is set to blast off from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in a launch window that opens at 1 a.m. (0600 GMT) Monday. 'Pointy end up!' the company's CEO, Dave Limp posted on X alongside photos of the gleaming white behemoth. With the mission, dubbed NG-1, Bezos, the world's second-richest man, is taking direct aim at the world's wealthiest: Elon Musk, whose company SpaceX dominates the orbital launch market through its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy rockets. These serve the commercial sector, the Pentagon, and NASA — including, crucially, ferrying astronauts to and from the International Space Station. 'SpaceX has for the past several years been pretty much the only game in town and so having a competitor... this is great,' G. Scott Hubbard, a retired senior NASA official, told AFP. SpaceX, meanwhile, is planning the next orbital test of Starship — its gargantuan new-generation rocket — the same day, upping the sense of high-stakes rivalry. If all goes to plan, shortly after launch, Blue Origin will attempt to land the first-stage booster on a drone ship named Jacklyn, in honor of Bezos' mother, stationed about 620 miles (1,000 kilometers) downrange in the Atlantic Ocean. Though SpaceX makes such landings a near-routine spectacle, this will be Blue Origin's first shot at a touchdown on the high seas. Meanwhile, the rocket's upper stage will fire its engines toward Earth orbit, carrying a Defense Department-funded prototype spaceship called Blue Ring, which will remain aboard for the roughly six-hour test flight. Limp emphasized that simply reaching orbit is the prime goal, while successfully recovering the booster would be a welcome 'bonus.' Blue Origin does have experience landing its New Shepard rockets — used for suborbital tourism — but they are much smaller and land on terra firma rather than a ship at sea. Blue Origin has secured a NASA contract to launch two Mars probes aboard New Glenn. The rocket will also support the deployment of Project Kuiper, a satellite internet constellation designed to compete with Starlink. Like Musk, Bezos has a lifelong passion for space. But whereas Musk dreams of colonizing Mars, Bezos envisions shifting heavy industry off-planet onto floating space platforms to preserve Earth, 'humanity's blue origin.' He founded Blue Origin in 2000 — two years before Musk created SpaceX — but has adopted a more cautious pace, in contrast to his rival's 'fail fast, learn fast' philosophy. 'There's been impatience within the space community over Blue Origin's very deliberate approach,' Scott Pace, a space policy analyst at George Washington University and former member of the National Space Council, told AFP. If New Glenn succeeds, Pace added, it will give the U.S. government 'dissimilar redundancy' — valuable backup if one system fails.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blue-origin-set-for-1st-launch-of-new-glenn-rocket-/7933754.html	2025-01-11T16:47:41-08:00	
Cyclone-ravaged Mayotte on red alert as it braces for new storm	MAMOUDZOU, FRANCE — Residents of the French territory of Mayotte braced Saturday for a storm expected to bring strong winds and heavy rain less than a month after the Indian Ocean archipelago was devastated by a deadly cyclone. Mayotte was placed on a red weather alert from 1900 GMT on Saturday in anticipation of the passage of Cyclone Dikeledi to the south of the territory. Authorities called for 'extreme vigilance' following the devastation wrought by Cyclone Chido in mid-December. Meteo-France predicted 'significant rain and windy conditions,' saying that very heavy rain could cause flooding. Residents were advised to seek shelter and stock up on food and water. The storm hit the northeastern coast of Madagascar on Saturday evening around 1630 GMT and was heading straight for the tourist island of Nosy Be. It is expected to pass to the south of Mayotte on Sunday morning, according to forecasts. 'Nothing is being left to chance,' Manuel Valls, France's new overseas territories minister, told AFP, referring to forecasts of 'heavy and continuous rain' and winds of up to 110 kilometers per hour (kph). As it hit Madagascar, average winds were estimated at 130 kilometers per hour, with gusts up to 180 kph. The most devastating cyclone to hit France's poorest department in 90 years caused colossal damage, killing at least 39 people and injuring more than 5,600 in December. 'We need to be seriously prepared for the possibility of a close passage of the cyclone,' the Mayotte prefecture said on social media platform X. Prefect Francois-Xavier Bieuville, the top Paris-appointed official on the territory, said Mayotte would be placed on a red weather alert from 1900 GMT on Saturday. 'I have decided to bring forward this red alert to 10 p.m. to allow everyone to take shelter, to confine themselves, to take care of the people close to you, your children, your families,' Bieuville said on television. Messages in French and two regional languages were broadcast on radio and television to alert the population. Bieuville told reporters Saturday that the cyclone was forecast to pass within 110 kilometers (70 miles) of the archipelago's southern coast. 'We even have systems telling us 75 kilometers. So, we have something that is going to hit Mayotte very closely', he said. The storm intensified from a tropical storm to a tropical cyclone Saturday morning, but forecasters are not expecting it to further intensify. More than 4,000 personnel have been mobilized in Mayotte, including members of police and the army, said the interior ministry. The prefect has requested that mayors reopen accommodation centers such as schools and gymnasiums that sheltered around 15,000 people in December. He also ordered firefighters and other forces to be deployed to 'extremely fragile' shantytowns in Mamoudzou and elsewhere. Potential mudslides were 'a major risk', the prefect said. 'Chido was a dry cyclone, with very little rain,' he added. 'This tropical storm is a wet event; we are going to have a lot of rain.' Mayotte's population stands officially at 320,000, but there are an estimated 100,000 to 200,000 more undocumented inhabitants living in shanty towns that were destroyed by the cyclone in December.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyclone-ravaged-mayotte-on-red-alert-as-it-braces-for-new-storm-/7933748.html	2025-01-11T16:28:10-08:00	
Trump prosecutor Jack Smith resigns from US Justice Department	U.S. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the federal cases against Donald Trump on charges of trying to overturn his 2020 election defeat and mishandling of classified documents, has resigned, as the Republican president-elect prepares to return to the White House. Smith resigned Friday from the Department of Justice, according to a court filing on Saturday to U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, asking her to lift a court order she issued blocking the release of his final report. Notice of Smith's resignation came in a footnote in the filing, which said the Special Counsel had completed his work, submitted his final confidential report on January 7, and 'separated' from the Justice Department on January 10. A former war crimes prosecutor, Smith brought two of the four criminal cases Trump faced after leaving office, but saw them grind to a halt after a Trump-appointed judge in Florida dismissed one and the U.S. Supreme Court — with three justices appointed by Trump — found that former presidents have sweeping immunity from prosecution for official acts. Neither case went to trial. After Trump defeated Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris in the November 5 election, Smith dropped both cases, citing a longstanding Justice Department rule against prosecuting sitting presidents. In asking courts to dismiss the charges, Smith's team defended the merits of the cases they had brought, signaling that only Trump's impending return to the White House made them untenable. Smith's departure is another marker of the collapse of the criminal cases against Trump, which could end without any legal consequences for the incoming president and sparked a backlash that helped fuel his political comeback. Smith's resignation from the Justice Department was expected. Trump, who has frequently called Smith 'deranged' had said he would fire him immediately upon taking office on January 20, and has suggested that he may pursue retribution against Smith and others who investigated him once he returns to office. Trump in 2023 became the first sitting or former U.S. president to face criminal prosecution, first in New York, where he was charged with trying to cover up a hush money payment to a porn star during his 2016 presidential campaign. Smith's charges followed, accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified material after leaving office and of trying to overturn his 2020 loss, a campaign that sparked the January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol. Prosecutors in Georgia also charged Trump over his efforts to overturn his election defeat in that state. Trump denied wrongdoing and assailed the prosecutions as politically motivated attempts to damage his campaign. He raised millions in campaign contributions from courthouse appearances and used the cases to drive a powerful narrative that the political establishment was arrayed against him and his supporters. The Justice Department defended the cases, saying they were run by career prosecutors who operated free of political influence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-prosecutor-jack-smith-resigns-from-us-justice-department-/7933741.html	2025-01-11T16:15:16-08:00	
Winter storm dumps snow in US South, maintains its icy grip	ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Flight cancellations piled up and state officials warned of continuing dangerous roads Saturday in the wake of a winter storm that closed schools and disrupted travel across parts of the southern United States. A storm that brought biting cold and wet snow to the South was moving out to sea off the East Coast on Saturday, leaving behind a forecast for snow showers in the Appalachian Mountains and New England. But temperatures are expected to plunge after sundown Saturday in the South, raising the risk that melting snow will freeze and turn roadways slick with ice. 'I definitely don't think everything's going to completely melt,' said Scott Carroll, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Atlanta, Georgia. 'Especially the secondary roads will probably still have some slush on them.' Airport tie-ups remain Major roads were mostly clear, but few ventured out early Saturday. The Atlanta Hawks postponed the pro basketball game they were supposed to host Saturday afternoon against the Houston Rockets, citing icy conditions. Major airports including those in Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, continued to report disruptions Saturday. While flights were operating, airlines canceled and delayed more flights after Friday's weather slowed airline travel to a crawl. By Saturday afternoon, about 1,000 flights in and out of Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport were canceled or delayed, according to tracking software FlightAware. Sarah Waithera Wanyoike, who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Lilburn, was starting her second day at Atlanta's airport Saturday. Wanyoike arrived at the world's busiest airport before sunrise Friday to catch an Ethiopian Airlines flight, on the way to her job in Zimbabwe. The plane boarded after a delay Friday, but never left, discharging passengers back to the gate after taxiing around and never taking off for six hours. Wanyoike said her luggage remained stuck on the plane and she dared not try to go home because she was told to be back at the gate before dawn Saturday. 'People slept with their babies on the floors last night,' Wanyoike said. Delta Air Lines, the largest carrier at the Atlanta airport, said late Friday that it was 'working to recover' on Saturday, saying cancellations would be worst among morning flights because of crews and airplanes that weren't where they were supposed to be after the airline canceled 1,100 flights Friday. Richmond drops boil-water advisory Meanwhile, the city of Richmond in the state of Virginia, lifted its boil-water advisory late Saturday morning, nearly a week after Monday's snowstorm cut power and caused a malfunction to the city's water system. Mayor Danny Avula said lab tests confirmed that Richmond's water was safe to drink, adding that boil-water advisories had been lifted for some surrounding counties as well. The temporary halting of the water system affected more than 200,000 people, some of whom lacked water in their homes because of diminished pressure. Freezing rain pushed up electricity outages above 110,000 in Georgia on Friday night, but most power was restored Saturday. The National Weather Service reported small amounts of ice accumulation around Atlanta from the freezing rain. Parts of mountainous western North Carolina saw as much as 4.5 inches (about 11 centimeters) of snow in a 24-hour period that ended at 7 a.m. Saturday, according to the National Weather Service. Parts of middle Tennessee saw nearly 6 inches (about 15 centimeters) of snow by Saturday morning. Earlier this week, the storm brought heavy snow and slick roads to much of the states of Texas and Oklahoma before moving east. The states of Arkansas and North Carolina mobilized National Guard troops for tasks such as helping stranded motorists, and governors declared states of emergency. City starts digging out Businesses and churches started digging out from under several inches of snow that fell on Nashville, Tennessee, in order to reopen for the weekend. At Judah Temple of Praise, church members Saturday shoveled, salted and blew snow off sidewalks and the parking lot in advance of Sunday services. 'We're not going to use the excuse of a parking lot covered in snow to not show up and praise our God tomorrow,' said elder Myyah Lockhart. Andy Atkins, co-owner of the Bad Luck Burger Club food truck in east Nashville, brushed off picnic tables with a broom and shoveled snow off the sidewalk in front of his business. He closed the truck Friday but hoped that customers would show up Saturday. 'Having a day off is good for the soul, but is bad for the pocket, you know,' said Atkins. Alabama schools could stay closed School was canceled Friday for millions of children from Texas to Georgia and as far east as the state of South Carolina, giving them a rare snow day. Officials in northern Alabama on Saturday said schools could remain closed Monday if ice doesn't melt off secondary roads. The storm piled up more than a year's worth of snowfall on some cities. As much as a foot (about 31 centimeters) fell in parts of Arkansas, and there were reports of nearly 10 inches (about 25 centimeters) in Little Rock, which averages 3.8 inches (9.7 centimeters) a year. More than 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) fell at Memphis International Airport in Tennessee. The city usually sees 2.7 inches (6.9 centimeters) a year. The storm dumped as much as 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) in some spots in central Oklahoma and northern Texas. The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole, but it sometimes ventures south into the United States, Europe and Asia. Some experts say such events are happening more frequently, paradoxically, because of a warming world.	https://www.voanews.com/a/winter-storm-dumps-snow-in-us-south-maintains-its-icy-grip-/7933575.html	2025-01-11T15:40:31-08:00	
Israeli military says 4 soldiers killed in north Gaza	JERUSALEM/GAZA CITY — Four soldiers died in combat in the north of the Gaza Strip, the Israeli military said Saturday, more than 15 months into its war with Hamas militants. The deaths brought to 403 the number of soldiers killed in the Palestinian territory since Israel launched its ground offensive in retaliation for Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror organization. An officer and a reservist soldier were 'seriously wounded' during the same incident and were taken to a hospital, the military said in a statement. The military said Saturday it had killed three militants in a ground operation near Jabalia in northern Gaza, where Israeli troops have been waging an intense offensive since early October, saying it aims to prevent Hamas from regrouping. Gaza's civil defense agency said it counted eight people killed near Jabalia, including two children in an Israeli airstrike on a school-turned-shelter. Defense agency spokesperson Mahmud Bassal confirmed eight people, including two children and two women, were killed by Israeli shelling on the Halwa school in the northern Gaza city of Jabalia. Bassal said the strike wounded 30 people, including 19 children, and that the Halwa school housed 'thousands of displaced people.' The Israeli military, in a statement, acknowledged it conducted a strike on the facility. It said the air force 'conducted a precise strike on terrorists in a command-and-control center' that had previously served as the Halwa school in Jabaliya. It said it targeted the premises because 'the school had been used by Hamas terrorists to plan and execute attacks.' The attack was the latest in a series of Israeli strikes on school buildings housing displaced people in Gaza, where fighting has raged for more than 14 months. At least 46,537 Palestinians, most of them civilians, have been killed in Israel's military campaign in Gaza since the war began, according to data provided by the Hamas-run health ministry. The United Nations has acknowledged these figures as reliable. The October 7 attack that triggered it resulted in the deaths of about 1,200 people on the Israeli side, most of them civilians. About 250 people were taken hostage, with about 100 still being held in Gaza, though at least one-third of them are believed to be dead. On Saturday, Hamas responded to Sharon Cunio, who had directly addressed the group in Arabic in a video Friday. She asked for a sign that her husband, David, was still alive, more than 450 days after he was taken to the Palestinian territory. In its response, Hamas said the fate of her husband depends on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. 'Netanyahu has not decided yet. Time is running out,' the Ezzedine al-Qassam Brigades said. Stop-start negotiations have been underway seeking an end to the devastating war and the release of the remaining hostages, with the latest round starting last weekend in Qatar.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-military-says-4-soldiers-killed-in-north-gaza-/7933570.html	2025-01-11T15:05:42-08:00	
German far-right outlines radical program as protesters rally	RIESA, GERMANY — The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party set out a radical program Saturday at a party congress ahead of next month's snap general election as thousands of protesters took to the streets to voice their opposition to the party. Demonstrators shouting 'No to Nazis' outside the venue in the eastern town of Riesa succeeded in delaying the start of the congress by around two hours. Once it got underway just after 12 p.m. local time (1100 GMT) the party's 600-odd delegates approved co-leader Alice Weidel as candidate for chancellor by acclamation ahead of the general election on February 23. In a fiery speech to the hall afterward, Weidel condemned the protestors outside as 'a left-wing mob' and 'red-painted Nazis' before going on to present her 'plan for the future' for Germany. She said the first 100 days of a government containing the AfD would see the 'total closing of Germany's borders and the turning back anyone traveling without documents' as well as 'large-scale repatriations.' 'I say to you quite honestly, if this must be called remigration, then let it be called remigration,' she said. Turning to energy policy, Weidel advocated a return to nuclear energy and more coal power stations, as well as relaunching the Nord Stream pipelines for Russian gas. In keeping with the AfD's denial of climate science, Weidel also attacked efforts to promote renewable energy. She branded wind turbines 'windmills of shame' and promised to tear them all down. The AfD is currently in second place in opinion polls, averaging 20%, although one survey Saturday eagerly seized on by the party gave them 22%. The conservative CDU/CSU is leading at 31% while Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats are fighting it out for third place with their Green coalition partners on 15% and 14% respectively. Weidel in her speech bashed the CDU/CSU, branding them a 'party of cheats' and saying her goal was to overtake them. The congress caps an eventful week for Weidel, who on Thursday was hosted by Elon Musk, the world's richest man and a key Donald Trump ally, for a wide-ranging livestream on his X social media platform. Musk also boosted the livestream of Saturday's congress by sharing it on his own X account, helping it gain a worldwide audience of more than 4 million as of the early evening. The AfD has also been buoyed by events in Austria in recent days, where the far-right Freedom Party (FPOe) has been invited to try to form a government with the conservative People's Party (OeVP). So far all of Germany's other parties, including the CSU/CDU, have ruled out working with the AfD. Outside the congress venue, protestors braved the cold to shout slogans such as 'No to Nazis.' Police said they numbered at least 8,000 while organizers put the number at more than 12,000. Among them was Julia, who declined to give her last name but said she wanted to turn out to oppose a party that represented 'exclusion, discrimination and hatred.' 'We want to show very clearly that we are the majority, that we are in favor of open borders and solidarity in society,' she told AFP. Dorothea, part of the Omas Gegen Rechts ('Grannies Against The Far-Right') protest movement, called the AfD a 'merciless downfall for Germany.' While doubting she and her fellow protestors could reach 'those in the AfD bubble,' she hoped they could get through to 'nonvoters and the undecided.' Earlier Saturday, demonstrators tried to breach police cordons with protest organizers accusing the police of using violence and pepper spray. Police said that six officers had suffered minor injuries. The far-left Die Linke party complained that one of its regional members of Parliament who was observing the protests was knocked unconscious by a blow to the face from police. The head of the region's police force apologized for the incident and said it was being investigated. Observers are expecting heated debates over some points of AfD's program as the party congress continues Sunday. Those include party leadership plans to replace its Junge Alternative ('Young Alternative') youth wing, which has been classified as an extremist group by intelligence services.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-far-right-outlines-radical-program-as-protesters-rally-/7933565.html	2025-01-11T14:45:24-08:00	
Afghan Taliban skip Pakistan-hosted summit on girls' education	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan hosted a two-day global conference Saturday, where delegates advocated for the promotion of girls' education worldwide in Muslim communities and denounced restrictions on female schooling as contrary to the principles of Islam. However, speakers, including the host, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, and scholars from participating nations, refrained from mentioning Afghanistan, the sole Islamic country where its hard-line Taliban leaders have banned girls from seeking education beyond the sixth grade. Pakistani officials announced on the eve of the conference that the Taliban government in Kabul had been formally invited to attend the Global Summit on Girls' Education in Muslim Communities, but Islamabad did not receive a response. More than 150 international dignitaries are attending the summit in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad, including ministers, ambassadors, scholars, and academics from 44 Muslim and Muslim-friendly countries, as well as representatives from international organizations such as UNESCO, UNICEF, the World Bank, and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, according to officials. Mohammad bin Abdulkarim Al-Issa, the secretary-general of the Muslim World League, a non-governmental international organization based in Saudi Arabia, stressed in his speech that men and women must acquire education. He later addressed a televised news conference with the help of his interpreter to emphasize that Islam allows women to receive an education. 'The Islamic world is united in its belief that those who oppose women's education are misguided and do not represent true Islam,' Al-Issa responded when asked if the outcome of the summit could encourage the Taliban to relax restrictions on women's access to education and employment in Afghanistan. The Saudi scholar clarified that the gathering in Islamabad was not directed at any specific community or country. 'We have simply tried to address the concerns of those who oppose women's education and conveyed our message that there are no restrictions in Islam regarding education for girls,' he stated, without naming Afghanistan. The Taliban have refrained from commenting on their absence from the event. The de facto Afghan leaders vehemently resist criticism of their governance, asserting that their policies align with local culture and Islamic law, known as Sharia. Nobel Peace Prize laureate Malala Yousafzai is also among the participants and is scheduled to address the gathering Sunday. She told reporters that she was happy to be returning to her native Pakistan. 'I am excited to join Muslim leaders from around the world for a critical conference on girls' education,' Yousafzai said via social media platform X on the eve of the conference. 'On Sunday, I will speak about protecting rights for all girls to go to school, and why leaders must hold the Taliban accountable for their crimes against Afghan women & girls,' she wrote. In 2012, the education activist was shot and injured by the outlawed extremist Pakistani Taliban in her picturesque home district of Swat in northwestern Pakistan while she was a schoolgirl. She was subsequently airlifted to the United Kingdom for medical treatment and has since returned to her home country only a few times. She has become a global advocate for girls' education and, at 17, became the youngest recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize. The Pakistani Foreign Ministry announced that the conference will culminate in a formal signing of the Islamabad Declaration, committing Muslim nations to empowering girls through education to foster inclusive and sustainable educational reforms. 'We have decided to place [the] Islamabad Declaration to be signed by this conference before the United Nations, including the U.N. Security Council, as a collective aspiration of the Ummah (Muslim world),' Sharif said in his inaugural speech Saturday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-taliban-skip-pakistan-hosted-summit-on-girls-education/7933555.html	2025-01-11T14:25:26-08:00	
Braced with defenses against fire, Getty art center faces LA flames	LOS ANGELES — After ripping through thousands of buildings, wildfires in Los Angeles were looming Saturday toward the celebrated Getty Center and its priceless collection. Nestled in the mountains above Los Angeles, the famed art museum is within a new evacuation warning zone as the Palisades Fire roars east. Dubbed a 'beautiful fortress' and constructed of fire-resistant travertine stone, as well as cement and steel, the center has drawn museum experts from around the world to observe its safety system. Its roofs are covered with crushed stone to prevent embers from igniting; in the gardens, resilient plants were chosen. Inside, the galleries can be closed off with a vaultlike double door that, museum officials say, is practically impenetrable. 'Getty staff, the art collections and buildings remain safe from the Palisades fire,' the museum said Friday, hours before the evacuation warning. 'The threat is still happening,' Getty added in an X post. The museum's unique collection comprises 125,000 artworks — including paintings by Rembrandt, Turner, Van Gogh and Monet — and 1.4 million documents. It also houses a research hub and a foundation. Museum officials have previously said the collection is protected within the center's fireproof structure, made up of 300,000 travertine blocks and 12,500 tons of steel bars. 'The Getty was constructed to house valuable art and keep it very safe from fires, from earthquakes, from any type of damage,' said Lisa Lapin, communications vice president now and when Getty was threatened by fire in 2019. 'We are really built like a beautiful fortress, and everything inside is quite safe,' she told AFP at the time. Built more than two decades ago by architect Richard Meier at a cost of $1 billion, the center's protective measures also include a 3.8-million liter water tank feeding its irrigation system. The building's ventilation system has an internal recycling system, similar to those found in cars, preventing smoke from entering rooms from the outside. Despite such extensive measures, Getty announced its closure earlier this week 'out of caution and to help alleviate traffic.' When the 2019 fire threatened the center, it served as a base for firefighters battling the blaze. Caused by a tree branch falling on power lines, that fire burned 300 hectares and destroyed 10 homes. A fire two years before that also triggered safety measures at Getty, although it affected only the far side of an adjacent freeway. 'In both cases, we've been very confident that the center is fine,' said Lapin in 2019. The Palisades fire has ravaged nearly 9,000 hectares since erupting on Tuesday and is just 11% contained as a series of fires burn through Los Angeles neighborhoods. The fire threatened the separate Getty Villa, which also has special flame-resistant protections, earlier in the week. Trees and vegetation around the coastal villa were burned, but the structure and collections, including Greek and Roman antiquities, were spared.	https://www.voanews.com/a/braced-with-defenses-against-fire-getty-art-center-faces-la-flames-/7933548.html	2025-01-11T13:52:26-08:00	
Iran holding war games as it faces Israel tensions, Trump's return	Iran was holding air defense exercises Saturday, state media reported, as the country braces for more friction with arch-enemy Israel and the United States under incoming U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. The war games take place as Iranian leaders face the risk that Trump could empower Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to attack Iran's nuclear sites, while further tightening U.S. sanctions on its oil industry through his 'maximum pressure' policy. 'In these exercises...defense systems will practice the fight against air, missile and electronic warfare threats in real battlefield conditions... to protect the country's skies and sensitive and vital areas,' Iranian state television said. Saturday's drills are part of two-months-long exercises launched on January 4 which have already included war games in which the elite Revolutionary Guards defended key nuclear installations in Natanz against mock attacks by missiles and drones, state media said. Iran's military has said it was using new drones and missiles in the exercises and released footage of a new underground 'missile city' being visited by Guards Commander-in-Chief Major General Hossein Salami. Iran has recently suffered setbacks in Lebanon after Israeli attacks against Iranian-backed Hezbollah and the toppling of Tehran's ally President Bashar Al-Assad in Syria last month. But Salami warned, in a speech carried by state TV about a 'false sense of delight' among Iran's enemies, saying Iran and particularly its missile forces were stronger than ever. While Iranian officials have downplayed Iran's setbacks, an Iranian general, Behrouz Esbati, who was reportedly based in Syria, said in a speech circulated on social media that Iran had 'badly lost' in Syria. Reuters could not verify the recording. Trump in 2018 withdrew from a deal struck by his predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 in which Iran agreed to curb uranium enrichment, which can yield material for nuclear weapons, in return for the relaxation of U.S. and U.N. economic sanctions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-holding-war-games-as-it-faces-israel-tensions-trump-s-return-/7933514.html	2025-01-11T12:46:04-08:00	
Turkey's Kurdish leaders meet jailed politician; 2 sides inch toward peace	ISTANBUL — A delegation from one of Turkey's biggest pro-Kurdish political parties met a leading figure of the Kurdish movement in prison Saturday, the latest step in a tentative process to end the country's 40-year conflict, the party said. Three senior figures from the Peoples' Equality and Democracy Party (DEM) met the party's former co-chairperson, Selahattin Demirtas, at Edirne prison near the Greek border. The meeting with Demirtas — jailed in 2016 on terrorism charges that most observers, including the European Court of Human Rights, have labelled politically motivated — took place two weeks after DEM members met Abdullah Ocalan, the imprisoned head of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). While the PKK has led an armed insurgency against the Turkish state since the 1980s, the DEM is the latest party representing left-leaning Kurdish nationalism. Both DEM and its predecessors have faced state measures largely condemned as repression, including the jailing of elected officials and the banning of parties. In a statement released on social media after the meeting, Demirtas called on all sides to 'focus on a common future where everyone, all of us, will win.' Demirtas credited Ocalan with raising the chance that the PKK could lay down its arms. Ocalan has been jailed on Imrali island in the Sea of Marmara since 1999 for treason over his leadership of the PKK, considered a terrorist organization by Turkey and most Western states. Demirtas led the DEM between 2014 and 2018, when it was known as the Peoples' Democratic Party (HDP) and he is still widely admired. He said that despite 'good intentions,' it was necessary for 'concrete steps that inspire confidence … to be taken quickly.' One of the DEM delegation, Ahmet Turk, said: 'I believe that Turks need Kurds and Kurds need Turks. Our wish is for Turkey to come to a point where it can build democracy in the Middle East.' The armed conflict between the PKK and the Turkish state, which started in August 1984 and has claimed tens of thousands of lives, has seen several failed attempts at peace. Despite being imprisoned for a quarter of a century, Ocalan remains central to any chance of success due to his ongoing popularity among many of Turkey's Kurds. In a statement released on December 29, he signaled his willingness to 'contribute positively' to renewed efforts. Meanwhile, in an address Saturday to ruling party supporters in Diyarbakir, the largest city in the Kurdish-majority southeast, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan called for the disbandment of the PKK and the surrender of its weapons. This would allow DEM 'the opportunity to develop itself, strengthening our internal front against the increasing conflicts in our region, in short, closing the half-century-old separatist terror bracket and consigning it to history ... forever,' he said in televised comments. The latest drive for peace came when Devlet Bahceli, leader of the far-right Nationalist Movement Party and a close ally of Erdogan, surprised everyone in October when he suggested that Ocalan could be granted parole if he renounced violence and disbanded the PKK. Erdogan offered tacit support for Bahceli's suggestion a week later, and Ocalan said he was ready to work for peace, in a message conveyed by his nephew.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-s-kurdish-leaders-meet-jailed-politician-2-sides-inch-toward-peace-/7933499.html	2025-01-11T11:48:54-08:00	
Los Angeles wildfire switches direction, poses new threat	LOS ANGELES — The largest of the raging wildfires that have devastated parts of Los Angeles this week was reported to have shifted direction Saturday, triggering more evacuation orders and posing a new challenge to exhausted firefighters. Six simultaneous blazes that have ripped across Los Angeles County neighborhoods since Tuesday have killed at least 11 people and damaged or destroyed 10,000 structures. The toll is expected to mount when firefighters are able to conduct house-to-house searches. The fierce Santa Ana winds that fanned the infernos eased Friday night. But the Palisades Fire on the city's western edge was heading in a new direction, prompting another evacuation order as it edged toward the Brentwood neighborhood and the San Fernando Valley foothills, the Los Angeles Times reported. 'The Palisades fire has got a new significant flare-up on the eastern portion and continues to northeast,' LA Fire Department Captain Erik Scott told local TV station KTLA, according to a report on the Times website. The fire, the most destructive in the history of Los Angeles, has razed whole neighborhoods to the ground, leaving just the smoldering ruins of what had been people's homes and possessions. Before the latest flare-up, firefighters had reported progress in subduing the Palisades Fire and the Eaton Fire in the foothills east of the metropolis after it burned out of control for days. On Friday night, the Palisades Fire was 8% contained and the Eaton Fire 3%, said the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, known as CAL FIRE. The two big fires combined had consumed 35,000 acres (14,100 hectares), or 54 square miles — 2½ times the land area of Manhattan. Some 153,000 people remained under evacuation orders and another 166,800 faced evacuation warnings with a curfew in place for all evacuation zones, Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said. Seven neighboring states, the federal government and Canada have rushed aid to California, bolstering aerial teams dropping water and fire retardant on the flaming hills and crews on the ground attacking fire lines with hand tools and hoses. The National Weather Service said that conditions in the Los Angeles area would improve through the weekend, with sustained winds slowing to about 20 mph (32 kph), gusting between 35 mph and 50 mph. 'It's not as gusty, so that should help firefighters,' NWS meteorologist Allison Santorelli said, adding that conditions were still critical with low humidity and dry vegetation. CAL FIRE said there was a chance of strong winds again on Tuesday. 'There will continue to be a high likelihood of critical fire weather conditions through next week,' it said. Officials have declared a public health emergency due to the thick, toxic smoke. Homes reduced to ash Pacific Palisades residents who ventured back to their devastated neighborhoods Friday were shocked to find brick chimneys looming over charred waste and burnt-out vehicles as acrid smoke lingered in the air. 'This was a house that was loved,' Kelly Foster, 44, said while combing through the rubble where her house once stood. Foster's 16-year-old daughter, Ada, said she tried to get inside, but 'I just became sick. I just couldn't even ... yeah, it's hard.' In Rick McGeagh's Palisades neighborhood, only six of 60 homes survived, and all that remained standing at his ranch house was a statue of the Virgin Mary. 'Everything else is ash and rubble,' said McGeagh, 61, a commercial real estate broker who, along with his wife, raised three children at their home. On Friday morning, hundreds of people streamed into a parking lot near the Rose Bowl stadium in Pasadena for donated clothing, diapers and bottled water. Denise Doss, 63, said she was anxious to return to her destroyed home in Altadena to see if anything was salvageable, but officials stopped her due to safety concerns. 'At least to say goodbye until we can rebuild. I will let God lead me,' Doss said. Billions in losses Many Altadena residents said they were worried government resources would go to wealthier areas and that insurers might short-change those who cannot afford to contest denials of fire claims. Beyond those who lost their homes, tens of thousands remained without power, and millions of people were exposed to poorer air quality, as the fires lofted traces of metals, plastics and other synthetic materials. Private forecaster AccuWeather estimated the damage and economic loss at $135 billion to $150 billion, portending an arduous recovery and soaring homeowners' insurance costs. California Insurance Commissioner Ricardo Lara called Friday for insurers to suspend pending nonrenewals and cancellations that homeowners received before the fires began and to extend the grace period for payments. President Joe Biden declared the fires a major disaster and said the U.S. government would reimburse 100% of the recovery for the next six months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/los-angeles-wildfire-switches-direction-poses-new-threat/7933478.html	2025-01-11T10:43:38-08:00	
Uyghurs detained in Thailand face deportation, persecution in China	BANGKOK — A group of Uyghur men who were detained in Thailand over a decade ago say that the Thai government is preparing to deport them to China, alarming activists and family members who say the men are at risk of abuse and torture if they are sent back. In a letter obtained by The Associated Press, 43 Uyghur men held in Bangkok made a public appeal to halt what they called an imminent threat of deportation. 'We could be imprisoned, and we might even lose our lives,' the letter said. 'We urgently appeal to all international organizations and countries concerned with human rights to intervene immediately to save us from this tragic fate before it is too late.' The Uyghurs are a Turkic, majority-Muslim ethnicity native to China’s far west Xinjiang region. After decades of conflict with Beijing over discrimination and suppression of their cultural identity, the Chinese government launched a brutal crackdown on the Uyghurs that some Western governments deem a genocide. Hundreds of thousands of Uyghurs, possibly a million or more, were swept into camps and prisons, with former detainees reporting abuse, disease and, in some cases, death. Over 300 Uyghurs fleeing China were detained in 2014 by Thai authorities near the Malaysian border. In 2015, Thailand deported 109 detainees to China against their will, prompting international outcry. Another group of 173 Uyghurs, mostly women and children, were sent to Turkey, leaving 53 Uyghurs stuck in Thai immigration detention and seeking asylum. Since then, five have died in detention, including two children. Of the 48 still detained by Thai authorities, five are serving prison terms after a failed escape attempt. It is unclear whether they face the same fate as those in immigration detention. Advocates and relatives describe harsh conditions in immigration detention. They say the men are fed poorly, kept in overcrowded concrete cells with few toilets, denied sanitary goods such as toothbrushes or razors, and are forbidden contact with relatives, lawyers and international organizations. The Thai government's treatment of the detainees may constitute a violation of international law, according to a February 2024 letter sent to the Thai government by United Nations human rights experts. The immigration police said they have been trying to take care of the detainees as best as they could. Recordings and chat records obtained exclusively by the AP show that on Jan. 8, the Uyghur detainees were asked to sign voluntary deportation papers by Thai immigration officials. The move panicked detainees, as similar documents were presented to the Uyghurs deported to China in 2015. The detainees refused to sign. Three people, including a Thai lawmaker and two others in touch with Thai authorities, told the AP there have been recent discussions within the government about deporting the Uyghurs to China, although the people had not yet seen or heard of any formal directive to do so. Two of the people said that Thai officials pushing for the deportations are choosing to do so now because this year is the 50th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Thailand and China, and because of the perception that backlash from Washington will be muted as the United States prepares for a presidential transition in less than two weeks. The people spoke on the condition of anonymity in order to describe sensitive internal discussions. The Thai and Chinese foreign ministries did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Beijing says the Uyghurs are jihadis but has not presented evidence. Uyghur activists and rights groups say the men are innocent and expressed alarm over their possible deportation, saying they face persecution, imprisonment and possible death in China. 'There’s no evidence that the 43 Uyghurs have committed any crime,' said Peter Irwin, Associate Director for Research and Advocacy at the Uyghur Human Rights Project. 'The group has a clear right not to be deported, and they’re acting within international law by fleeing China.' On Saturday morning, the detention center where the Uyghurs are being held was quiet. A guard told a visiting AP journalist the center was closed until Monday. Two people with direct knowledge of the matter told the AP that all the Uyghurs detained in Thailand submitted asylum applications to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which the AP verified by reviewing copies of the letters. The U.N. agency acknowledged receipt of the applications but has been barred from visiting the Uyghurs by the Thai government to this day, the people said. The UNHCR did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Relatives of three of the Uyghurs detained told the AP that they were worried about the safety of their loved ones. 'We are all in the same situation — constant worry and fear,' said Bilal Ablet, whose elder brother is detained in Thailand. 'World governments all know about this, but I think they’re pretending not to see or hear anything because they’re afraid of Chinese pressure.' Ablet added that Thai officials told his brother no other government was willing to accept the Uyghurs, although an April 2023 letter authored by the chair of the National Human Rights Commission of Thailand first leaked to The New York Times Magazine and independently seen by the AP said there are 'countries that are ready to take these detainees to settle down.' Abdullah Muhammad, a Uyghur living in Turkey, said his father, Muhammad Ahun, is one of the men detained in Thailand. Muhammad says although his father crossed into Thailand illegally, he was innocent of any other crime and had already paid fines and spent over a decade in detention. 'I don’t understand what this is for. Why?' Muhammad said. 'We have nothing to do with terrorism, and we have not committed any terrorism.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uyghurs-detained-in-thailand-face-deportation-persecution-in-china/7933447.html	2025-01-11T10:00:33-08:00	
Trump envoy to meet Netanyahu amid ceasefire push	JERUSALEM/CAIRO — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, will meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday following his visit to Doha, Qatar, an Israeli official said, amid efforts to secure a hostage deal and ceasefire in Gaza. A second Israeli official said some progress had been made in the indirect talks between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas, mediated by Egypt, Qatar and the United States, to reach a deal in Gaza. The mediators are making new efforts to reach a deal to halt the fighting in the enclave and free the remaining Israeli hostages held there before Trump takes office on Jan. 20. Witkoff arrived in Doha on Friday and met Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani, according to a statement released by Qatar’s Foreign Ministry. Egyptian and Qatari mediators received reassurances from Witkoff that the U.S. would continue to work toward a fair deal to end the war soon, Egyptian security sources said, although he did not give any details. Attacks in Gaza On Saturday, the Palestinian civil emergency service said eight people were killed, including two women and two children, in an Israeli airstrike on a former school sheltering displaced families in Jabalia, in the northern Gaza Strip. The Israeli military said that the strike targeted Hamas militants who were operating at the school and that it had taken measures to reduce the risk of harm to civilians. Later on Saturday, the Gaza Civil Emergency Service said five people were killed and several others were wounded in two Israeli strikes. One of the two strikes killed three people in a house near the Daraj neighborhood in Gaza City. The Israeli military said it struck a Hamas militant 'in that area' at that approximate time. Israel launched its assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed across its borders in October 2023, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 46,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials, with much of the enclave laid to waste and gripped by a humanitarian crisis.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-envoy-to-meet-netanyahu-amid-ceasefire-push/7933435.html	2025-01-11T09:31:37-08:00	
Sudan’s military retakes strategic city from RSF rebels	CAIRO — Sudan’s military and its allies have taken back a strategic city from the rebel Rapid Support Forces, officials said Saturday, dealing a major blow to the notorious paramilitary group the United States accused of committing genocide in the country’s ongoing civil war. The recapture of the city of Wad Medani, the capital of Gezira state, came more than a year after it fell to the RSF. Wad Medani had previously been a haven for displaced families in the early months of the war. The conflict in Sudan started in April 2023 when simmering tensions between the leaders of the military and the RSF exploded into open fighting in the capital, Khartoum, and other cities across the sprawling northeastern African country. The conflict has killed more than 28,000 people, forced millions to flee their homes and left some families eating grass in a desperate attempt to survive as famine swept parts of the country. It has been marked by gross atrocities, including ethnically motivated killing and rape, according to the United Nations and rights groups. The International Criminal Court said it was investigating alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity. Earlier this month, the Biden administration said that the RSF and its proxies are committing genocide, and slapped sanctions on the RSF leader, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, as well as seven RSF-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates, including one handling gold likely smuggled out of Sudan. The military said in a statement that its forces had entered Wad Medani early Saturday and that they were working to 'clear the rebels’ remnants inside the city.' 'Congratulations to the Armed Forces, their supporting forces everywhere and to our people as they reclaim their dignity, security and stability,' the statement said. There was no immediate comment from the RSF. Culture and Information Minister Khalid Aleiser, who is the government spokesperson, said the military and its allies 'liberated' Wad Medani, which is about 100 kilometers southeast of Khartoum. Soldiers posted videos on social media purportedly showing forces celebrating with residents in the city center. One video showed residents taking to the streets to celebrate the 'liberation' of the city and shouting, 'Allah is great.' Since the RSF captured Wad Medani in December 2023, tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes in and around the city. In recent months, the RSF has suffered multiple battlefield blows, giving the military the upper hand in the war. It has lost control of many areas in Khartoum, the capital's sister city of Omdurman, and the eastern and central provinces. The war has created the world’s largest displacement crisis, driving over 14 million people — about 30% of the population — from their homes, according to the United Nations. An estimated 3.2 million people have crossed into neighboring countries Chad, Egypt and South Sudan. Famine has been also detected in at least five areas, including three camps for displaced people in the western Sudanese region of Darfur, according to an international monitoring project, the Integrated Food Security Classification, or IPC. The IPC said five other areas are projected to experience famine in the next six months. More areas are also at risk of famine, it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sudan-s-military-retakes-strategic-city-from-rsf-rebels/7933424.html	2025-01-11T09:20:36-08:00	
Somali president makes surprise visit to Ethiopia amid strained relations	Somali President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud arrived in Ethiopia’s capital on Saturday, exactly a month to the day since the two countries’ leaders reached an agreement aimed at ending a bitter, yearlong dispute. Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed said he received Mohamud at the Addis Ababa airport. The Somali president’s office earlier published a statement confirming Mohamud’s visit to Addis Ababa at the invitation of Ethiopia’s leader. 'The discussions with the Ethiopian leadership aim to strengthen bilateral relations and advance shared priorities,' the statement said. Ethiopia and Somalia reached a diplomatic agreement on Dec. 11 called the 'Ankara Declaration' following a heated diplomatic dispute ignited over a controversial maritime access deal between Ethiopia and the breakaway Somalian region of Somaliland. Ethiopia signed a memorandum of understanding on Jan. 1, 2024, with Somaliland allowing it to lease 20 kilometers of seafront for 50 years in return for diplomatic recognition, Somaliland officials said. The Somali government rejected the deal, calling it 'null and void,' and accused Ethiopia of 'blatant violation' of its sovereignty and territorial integrity. Under the Ankara Declaration, mediated by Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leaders of Somalia and Ethiopia reaffirmed their respect and commitment to one another’s sovereignty, unity, independence and territorial integrity. In addition, the two sides also agreed to work together to finalize 'mutually advantageous commercial arrangements through bilateral agreements, including contract, lease and similar modalities, which will allow the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia to enjoy reliable, secure and sustainable access to and from the sea, under the sovereign authority of the Federal Republic of Somalia.' In the streets of Addis Ababa, photos of the Somali leader were posted on electronic boards on major streets, according to a VOA reporter in Addis Ababa. 'Welcome President Sheikh Mahmoud,' was written under one of the photos. The flags of Somalia and Ethiopia were flown. The roads leading from Bole Airport to the palace were guarded by Ethiopia’s Federal Police. Somalia said Mohamud’s visit, which is his first since alleging he was 'prevented' from entering the African Union headquarters in February 2024 by Ethiopian security forces, 'builds on' the Ankara agreement. Prior to the trip to Addis Ababa, Mohamud visited Kampala, Uganda, for a continental summit on agricultural development, where he met with President Yoweri Museveni and Kenyan President William Ruto, two leaders who at one point attempted to mediate between Somalia and Ethiopia before the Ankara Declaration emerged. 'The president’s diplomatic engagement are part of a broader regional tour, which includes recent productive visits to Eritrea and Djibouti,' the statement from Villa Somalia said. Commenting on the meeting with Mohamud, Ruto said relations between the two countries have 'progressively deepened' since Somalia joined the regional economic bloc East African Community last year. 'Our two countries are doing more business than before, with Somalia buying goods worth KSh5 billion [$38 million] in the first nine months of 2024,' he posted. 'On peace and security, Kenya, and indeed the region, will continue to be engaged in collaborative efforts to ensure stability in Somalia,' Ruto said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/somali-president-makes-surprise-visit-to-ethiopia-amid-strained-relations/7933414.html	2025-01-11T09:01:27-08:00	
Final minutes of ‘black box’ data missing in South Korea plane crash	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The black boxes of a Boeing jetliner that crashed in South Korea last month stopped recording about four minutes before the accident, South Korean officials said Saturday, possibly complicating investigations into the cause of the disaster that killed 179 people. After analyzing the devices, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board concluded that the flight data and cockpit voice recorders stopped working about four minutes before the crash, the South Korean Transportation Ministry said. The Boeing 737-800 operated by Jeju Air skidded off a runway in the South Korean town of Muan on Dec. 29 after its landing gear failed to deploy, slamming into a concrete structure and bursting into flames, killing all but two of the 181 people on board. After initially analyzing the black boxes, South Korean officials sent the devices to the NTSB for closer examination after discovering that some of the data was missing. The Transportation Ministry said it wasn’t immediately clear why the devices failed to record data in the last four minutes. 'Data from the CVR [cockpit voice recorder] and FDR [flight data recorder] are crucial in investigating accidents, but such investigations are conducted through the examination and analysis of various sources of information, and we plan to do our utmost to determine the cause of the accident,' the ministry said in a statement. South Korean investigators have said that air traffic controllers warned the pilot about possible bird strikes two minutes before the aircraft issued a distress signal confirming that a bird strike had occurred, after which the pilot attempted an emergency landing. South Korean officials have also pledged to improve airport safety after experts linked the high death toll to Muan airport's localizer system, the structure hit by the aircraft as it crashed. The localizer, a set of antennas designed to guide aircraft during landings, was housed in a concrete structure covered with dirt on an elevated embankment. This has raised questions about whether the structure should have been built with lighter materials that would break more easily upon impact.	https://www.voanews.com/a/final-minutes-of-black-box-data-missing-in-south-korea-plane-crash/7933402.html	2025-01-11T08:39:39-08:00	
France starts 2025 with fresh controversy, questions over Africa	PARIS — France starts 2025 with a further drawdown of its military presence in its former African colonies, and fresh tensions ignited this week with controversial remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron. Chad, Senegal and now Ivory Coast have followed Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso in asking France to withdraw its troops from their soil. The reasons vary — from growing anti-French sentiment to calls for greater sovereignty and strengthening ties with other foreign powers. But the impact is the same. 'There is a clear collapse of French policy in Africa,' said Thierry Vircoulon, a researcher at the French Institute for International Relations’ Africa Center. 'The withdrawal of the French troops and basically the end of the French military presence in Africa is a symbol of that collapse.' French-African relations haven’t improved in recent days. On Monday, Macron suggested some Sahel countries had forgotten to thank French troops for spearheading a decadelong fight against Islamist insurgencies. That drew sharp criticism from leaders in Chad and Senegal. French authorities say Macron’s remarks were taken out of context. Jean-Pierre Maulny, director of the French Institute for International and Strategic Affairs think tank, said he believes France needs to be less focused on the immediate fallout and instead concentrate on longer-term ties with francophone African countries. France should think more about development and sharing the future of Africa’s security, he said, and less about adopting a big brother attitude. Macron’s government announced plans last year to reduce its military presence on the continent — where it also has troops in Gabon and Djibouti — and make it more responsive to countries’ demands. France has also expanded ties beyond francophone Africa. Its two biggest trading partners, for example, are Nigeria and South Africa. But analyst Vircoulon predicts France’s long-term influence in Africa will remain limited, at best. 'There’s very little that the French government can do, and it’s playing in favor of Russia and other countries that are not Western,' he said. He said he believes France’s strategic priorities will shift to potential conflicts in Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-starts-2025-with-fresh-controversy-questions-over-africa/7933369.html	2025-01-11T07:52:37-08:00	
Trump deportation plans face pushback in Colorado	During his presidential campaign, Donald Trump singled out Aurora, Colorado, as an example of immigrant crime that he would solve with mass deportations.

Top Vatican diplomat consecrates Catholic church at Jesus’ baptism site	BETHANY BEYOND THE JORDAN, JORDAN — The Vatican’s secretary of state, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, on Friday consecrated a new church at a place on the banks of the Jordan River that the Catholic Church officially recognizes as the site where John the Baptist baptized Jesus. Parolin inaugurated and consecrated the Church of the Baptism of the Lord at Al-Maghtas, known as Bethany Beyond the Jordan, before thousands of Jordanians, Palestinians, other Arabs and diplomats. 'My presence here today, according to the wishes of the pope, is meant to be a tangible sign of the closeness of the whole Church to the Christian communities of the Middle East,' Parolin said in his homily, read on his behalf in Arabic by the Rev. Jihad Shweihat. 'At a time in history when this region is experiencing serious upheaval, it is important that Christians also make their contribution to the building of a just and peaceful society,' he said. Parolin celebrated Mass, accompanied by Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem Cardinal Pierbattista Pizzaballa. The ceremony also celebrated the 25th anniversary of the Catholic Church’s annual pilgrimage to Jesus’ purported baptismal site. Parolin also anointed the church’s altar, dedicating it as where the relics of Pope St. John Paul II and the recently canonized Holy Martyrs of Damascus and others will be placed. Parolin’s three-day visit to Jordan coincides with a new exhibition of 90 Jordanian artifacts of the nation's history at the start of Christianity. The exhibition, 'Jordan: Dawn of Christianity,' is to debut at the Vatican next month. It celebrates Jordan’s biblical roots through the centuries and commemorates 30 years of diplomatic ties between Jordan and the Holy See. Jordan’s tourism and antiquities minister, Lina Annab, described the exhibition’s importance to journalists on Wednesday in Amman, saying many people outside the country do not realize that there are Jordanian Christians. 'This exhibition celebrates and sheds light on the origins and heritage as well as the enduring legacy and presence of Christianity in Jordan,' Annab said. 'The origins of Christianity are here. Jordan is an integral part of the Holy Land. We are more interested in really showcasing the importance of Jordan as far as the faiths that have lived on this land, whether the Islamic faith or the Christian faith.' Three popes have visited the believed site of Jesus’ baptism on the Jordanian banks of the Jordan River: John Paul II in 2000, Benedict XVI in 2009 and Francis in 2014. Pope Paul VI first visited Jordan in 1964.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-vatican-diplomat-consecrates-catholic-church-at-jesus-baptism-site/7933331.html	2025-01-11T07:21:41-08:00	
Syria thwarts planned Islamic State attack on Shiite shrine	DAMASCUS, SYRIA — Intelligence officials in Syria's new de facto government thwarted a plan by the Islamic State group to set off a bomb at a Shiite shrine in the Damascus suburb of Sayyida Zeinab, state media reported Saturday. State news agency SANA reported, citing an unnamed official in the General Intelligence Service, that members of the IS cell planning the attack were arrested. It quoted the official as saying that the intelligence service is 'putting all its capabilities to stand in the face of all attempts to target the Syrian people in all their spectrums.' Sayyida Zeinab has been the site of past attacks on Shiite pilgrims by IS — which takes an extreme interpretation of Sunni Islam and considers Shiites to be infidels. In 2023, a motorcycle planted with explosives detonated in Sayyida Zeinab, killing at least six people and wounding dozens a day before the Shiite holy day of Ashoura. The announcement that the attack had been thwarted appeared to be another attempt by the country's new leaders to reassure religious minorities, including those seen as having been supporters of the former government of Bashar Assad. Assad, a member of the Alawite minority, was allied with Iran and with the Shiite Lebanese militant group Hezbollah as well as Iranian-backed Iraqi militias. Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, the former insurgent group that led the lightning offensive that toppled Assad last month and is now the de facto ruling party in the country, is a Sunni Islamist group that formerly had ties with al-Qaida. The group later split from al-Qaida, and HTS leader Ahmad al-Sharaa has preached religious coexistence since assuming power in Damascus. Relations with neighboring Lebanon Also Saturday, Lebanon's caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati arrived in Damascus to meet with al-Sharaa. Relations between the two countries had been strained under Assad, with Lebanon's political factions deeply divided between those supporting and opposing Assad's rule. Mikati told journalists following his meeting with al-Sharaa that the two countries will form a committee to work on demarcation of the border, which has never been officially defined. Mikati also said they will work together to combat smuggling on the porous frontier. 'Some of the matters on the border need to be fully controlled, especially at illegal border points, to stop any smuggling operation between Lebanon and Syria,' he said. Chebaa Farms and the Golan Heights One particularly knotty issue is the area known as Chebaa Farms, which is controlled by Israel as part of the Golan Heights it captured from Syria in 1967 and subsequently annexed. Most of the international community regards the area as occupied. Beirut and Damascus say Chebaa Farms belong to Lebanon. The United Nations says the area is part of Syria and that Damascus and Israel should negotiate its fate. The fact that the Lebanon-Syria border was never clearly demarcated has complicated the issue. In response to a question about demarcation of that area, al-Sharaa did not give a clear answer. 'I think it is too early to talk about all the details of border demarcation,' he said. 'There are so many problems in the Syrian reality. We can’t solve it all at once.' Al-Sharaa said he hopes, meanwhile, that issues at the official border crossing will soon be resolved. Lebanese citizens, who had previously crossed easily into Syria without needing a visa, are currently barred from entry. 'We seek to have social ties between us that increase and not decrease, so any border obstacles between us should be eliminated in the future, but this is a detailed matter for customs officials,' al-Sharaa said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-thwarts-planned-islamic-state-attack-on-shiite-shrine/7933294.html	2025-01-11T06:48:40-08:00	
Ethiopia relaunches securities exchange to lure investors	Ethiopia relaunched its stock exchange, the Ethiopian Securities Exchange, on Friday after a 50-year absence. The operations of the Ethiopia Securities Exchange were stopped in 1974 following the takeover by a communist military government. Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed described the relaunch as an 'historic milestone' for Ethiopia’s economic and financial landscape. 'We have officially rung the bell to launch the Ethiopian Securities Exchange — the first stock exchange for our country. Invest in Ethiopia — a fast-growing economy with immense potential and a dynamic trajectory toward prosperity,' he posted on X. The launch of the stock exchange means the government initiated a domestic stock market, starting with the state-owned Ethio Telecom, which is yet to commence an initial public offering of shares despite announcing the move in October. Ethiopian officials announced Friday that Wegagen Bank, a private bank, was the first company to list on the exchange. Ethiopian Insurance Corporation, Ethiopian Shipping and Logistics Services Enterprise, and Berhanena Selam Printing joined Ethiopia Telecom as founding members of the exchange, although they are not yet listed. The list of investors also included foreign strategic investors, along with 16 domestic private commercial banks, 12 private insurance companies, and 17 other private domestic investors, according to a newsletter distributed during the event. Based on the shareholding structure of the Ethiopian Securities Exchange, 75% of it is allocated to private investors and 25% is capped for public shareholding. This means the share company is a private-government partnership. Abiy assured investors that all the necessary preparations had been made. Speaking in Amharic, Abiy said the government did extensive research, passed legislation and built more institutions and human capital over the past 2½ to 'avoid failure.' He also praised the country’s economy. 'Ethiopian economy means an economy that operates the biggest airline in Africa. Ethiopian economy means an economy that operates the largest telecom operator in Africa. Ethiopian economy means an economy that built the largest hydroelectric power plant in Africa,' he said touting Africa’s largest airline and the Grand Renaissance Dam, which is considered the biggest project of its type on the continent. In July 2021, the Parliament established the Ethiopian Capital Market Authority and tasked it with ensuring the existence of an environment in which securities could be issued and traded in an 'orderly, fair, efficient and transparent manner.' Ethiopia’s economy heavily relies on agriculture, with coffee, oilseed, flowers and gold being the main export items. Last year, the government introduced financial reforms that included floating the Ethiopian currency, a move backed by international financial institutions. But the market-based currency policy increased inflation and led to skyrocketing prices for imported food and fuel. This week, the government announced an increase in the price of benzene from 73 cents to 82 cents per liter. Similarly, the price of white diesel jumped from 72 cents to 78 cents per liter, with corresponding increases applied to other fuel types, a move residents said will worsen the cost of living and transportation challenges. Ethiopian economist and the executive director of Initiative Africa Kibur Gena said the Ethiopian stock exchange should align with the broader development goals of the country. Ethiopia’s government 'should approach the establishment of a stock exchange gradually and strategically,' he told VOA. He argued that the government should also build strong institutions and a regulatory framework 'so that it can attract foreign direct investment.' The relaunch also comes at a time when the country is facing security challenges in the Amhara and Oromia regions. Kibur said to attract foreign investors, there needs to be peace throughout the country. 'I suppose this government will sort of realize that if it wants to achieve its objectives, it will certainly address the peace issues,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-relaunches-securities-exchange-to-lure-investors/7933220.html	2025-01-11T04:49:59-08:00	
Russia says Ukrainian drones injure 3 in Tambov region	MOSCOW — Ukraine launched drone attacks across several regions of Russia, striking two residential houses in the Tambov region and injuring at least three people, Russia said on Saturday. The regional head, Evgeny Pervyshov, said on the Telegram messaging app people were treated for injuries resulting from shattered windows as drones hit two houses in the town of Kotovsk, about 480 kilometers southeast of Moscow. He said the buildings were only slightly damaged, the inhabitants were offered temporary housing, and an evacuation was not required. 'Three (people) had cuts from fragments of broken windows, another four complained of high blood pressure,' he said. Separately, Russia's defense ministry said it intercepted and destroyed 85 Ukrainian drones overnight in several regions of the country, including 31 drones over the Black Sea, 16 each in the Voronezh and Krasnodar regions and 14 over the Azov Sea. Russia's aviation watchdog Rosaviatsia said airports in the cities of Kazan, Nizhnekamsk and Ulyanovsk in the Volga River regions temporarily suspended flights. A flight suspension in the city of Saratov was also later declared to ensure safety. Kyiv's air force said in a statement early on Saturday that Russia launched 74 drones at Ukraine overnight, adding it had downed 47 of them, while 27 others disappeared from radars without reaching their targets. Both sides in the Ukraine conflict have turned cheap commercial drones into deadly weapons and also increased their production. Russian and Ukrainian soldiers alike have reported a visceral fear of drones, and both sides have used video footage of fatal drone strikes in their propaganda. On Friday, Russia accused Ukraine of carrying out a missile strike on a supermarket in the Russian-controlled city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-says-ukrainian-drones-injure-3-in-tambov-region/7933193.html	2025-01-11T02:21:17-08:00

US 'notorious markets' report warns of risks from online pharmacies	BANGKOK — Nearly all of the world's 35,000 online pharmacies are being run illegally and consumers who use them risk getting ineffective or dangerous drugs, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's annual report on 'notorious markets.' The report also singled out 19 countries over concerns about counterfeit or pirated products. The report also named about three dozen online retailers, many of them in China or elsewhere in Asia that it said are allegedly engaged in selling counterfeit products or other illegal activities. The report says 96% of online pharmacies were found to be violating the law, many operating without a license and selling medicines without prescriptions and safety warnings. Their websites often look like legitimate e-commerce platforms, often with false claims that they are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, said the report, released Wednesday. The FDA and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration have both issued warnings about risks of buying prescription medicines from such sources. It cited a survey by the Alliance for Safe Online Pharmacies' Global Foundation that found nearly one in four Americans who have used online pharmacies reported having encountered substandard, fake or harmful medicines. Last year, federal prosecutors reported that a network of illegal drug sellers based in the U.S., the Dominican Republic and India had packaged potentially deadly synthetic opioids into pills disguised as common prescription drugs and sold millions of them through fake online drugstores, federal prosecutors said Monday. At least nine people died of narcotics poisoning between August 2023 and June 2024 after consuming the counterfeit pills, the indictment said. Apart from the risks of using drugs that may contain inert ingredients or those that could cause allergies, the medicines are sometimes made in unsanitary conditions, said the report, which did not give annual statistics for those who may have died or otherwise been harmed. Progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods The USTR's annual report cited examples from inside the United States, but and also mentioned risks of imported ingredients including fentanyl from China. Many of the illicit online pharmacies are based outside the U.S. The 'Notorious Markets List' did laud progress in fighting counterfeit and pirated goods. In one case, U.S. authorities, industry groups and the police collaborated in shutting down a Hanoi, Vietnam-based piracy ring, Fmovies, and other related piracy sites, in July and August. The report said the world's then-largest pirated movies site had drawn more than 6.7 billion visits from January 2023 to June 2024. In another Vietnam-linked case, two people operating pirate television platform BestBuyIPTV were convicted and ordered to pay fines and forfeit property. The report also cited crackdowns on online piracy in Brazil and the United Kingdom and busts of sellers of counterfeit purses, clothing and shoes in Kuwait. But problems remain with cyberlockers that thwart efforts to restrict piracy of movies and other content and of so-called 'bulletproof' internet service providers, or ISPs, that promise people using them leeway for using pirate sites, it said. One such ISP is Avito, a Russian-based ad platform that allegedly lets sellers advertise counterfeit products. Baidu Wangpan, a cloud storage service of China's largest search engine provider, Baidu, was named for allegedly failing to enforce or being slow to act on copyright protection. The report also pointed to social-commerce site Pinduoduo and to Douyin Mall, a Chinese online platform owned by Tiktok owner ByteDance. It said the shopping platforms have sought to build up protections but that they still host many counterfeit goods. It also named Shopee, a Singapore-based online and mobile e-commerce site, saying some country-focused platforms serving Southeast Asia and South American had better track records in fighting piracy than others. IndiaMART, an big business-to-business marketplace in India, still offers a slew of counterfeit products, it said. While a large share of theft of intellectual property has moved online, the report also highlighted real world locations notorious for selling counterfeit products, including markets in Turkey, bazaars in the United Arab Emirates and Saigon Square Shopping Mall in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City. The report said Bangkok's MBK Center, a huge mall of about 2,000 stores, had actively cracked down on counterfeiting, though such products still can be found there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-notorious-markets-report-warns-of-risks-from-online-pharmacies/7931802.html	2025-01-10T23:40:33-08:00	
Hong Kong struggles to improve conditions in tiny, crowded homes	HONG KONG — Housing is famously cramped in the Asian financial hub of Hong Kong, thanks to sky-high property prices, but a single toilet and kitchen shared by four families would make for a challenging home situation anywhere. 'It's so small here; it's really inconvenient to live in,' said retired 60-year-old Xiao Bo, as she sat on her bed, eating homemade dumplings off a folding table in a tiny space adorned with pink wallpaper and a rack of colorful tote bags. Single and opting to give only her first name, she said she had nothing but 'painful' memories of the partitioned, cluttered walk-up where she has lived for three years, but could not afford a better flat. More than 200,000 people in Hong Kong live in sub-divided flats like hers, often cloaked in a musty odor and plagued by bedbugs during sweltering summers. The former British colony, ranked as the world's most unaffordable city for a 14th consecutive year by survey company Demographia, has one of the world's highest rates of inequality. In October, Hong Kong vowed to adopt new laws setting minimum space and safety norms for sub-divided flats, where each resident lives in an area of about 6 square meters on average, or half the size of the parking space for a sedan. 'We just want to regulate ... so the market will be providing flats of what we think will be a reasonable and liveable standard,' its leader, John Lee, said at the time. Hong Kong aims to eliminate subdivided flats by 2049, a target set in 2021 by China's top official overseeing the city. Beijing sees the housing woes as a serious social problem that helped fuel mass anti-government protests in 2019. Authorities plan to boost the supply of public housing to shorten waiting times from as much as 5-1/2 years now, saying they have identified more than enough land to build 308,000 public housing units in the next decade. Hong Kong's housing problem is the top agenda item for the government, the Housing Bureau said in a written response to Reuters, and it is 'determined to eradicate sub-standard sub-divided units.' Since July 2022, about 49,000 applicants have been housed in public rental housing, and around 18,400 units of transitional housing have been made available for immediate and short-term accommodation, the Bureau said. Tiny homes Still, Hong Kong's roughly 110,000 sub-divided flats have become notorious for high rents, with a median floor rate of HK$50 ($6.43) per .3 meter, a survey by non-government body the Society for Community Organization (SoCO) showed in 2022. For so-called 'coffin' homes, each roughly the size of a single bed, the rate is even higher, at HK$140, exceeding a rate of about HK$35 for private homes. 'All I hope for is to quickly get into public housing,' said Wong Chi-kong, 76, who pays HK$2,900 ($370) for a space smaller than 5 square meters. His toilet sits right beside his bed and under the shower head. 'That's all I ask for. Amen,' added Wong, who stores all his belongings on the other side of the bed to keep them from getting splashed whenever he takes a shower. Wong, who uses a walking stick to get around while contending with deteriorating eyesight, spends most of his summer afternoons in a public library to escape the scorching heat trapped in his home. Yet some may consider Xiao Bo and Wong to be among the more fortunate, as tens of thousands of so-called 'coffin' homes fall outside the scope of the new laws. These windowless spaces are still more cramped, but just big enough, at 1.4 square meters to 1.7 square meters, for people to sleep in and store a few personal items. But lack of ventilation forces them to leave open the small sliding doors to their homes, denying them any vestiges of privacy. They also share washrooms with up to 20 others. 'Because the beds are wooden, there are a lot of bedbugs here,' said 80-year-old Leung Kwong Kuen, adding, 'Insecticide is useless,' in eradicating them. Leung used to manage a factory in mainland China before the Asian financial crisis of the 1990s, but now, estranged from his wife and two grown-up children, lives in a 'coffin' home in Hong Kong, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997. 'I believe in Buddhism; letting go, the past is the past,' he said. 'The most important thing is I can still manage to have two meals and a place to sleep for now.' The sub-divided flats and 'coffin' homes are usually located in outdated residential buildings in old business areas, allowing affordable access to workplaces and schools. 'Shame of Hong Kong' About 1.4 million of Hong Kong's population of about 7.5 million live in poverty, with the number of poor households rising to 619,000 in the first quarter of 2024, to account for about 22.7% of the total, says non-profit organization Oxfam. SoCO called for the new regulations to extend to 'coffin' homes. 'This kind of bed homes is the shame of Hong Kong,' said its deputy director, Sze Lai-shan. The Housing Bureau said the Home Affairs Department takes strict enforcement actions against unlicensed bedspace apartments. Sum, a 72-year-old bachelor, has lived in a 'coffin' home for three years, paying HK$2,500 in monthly rent. A Chinese New Year poster on the door to his home reads 'Peace and safety wherever you go.' Personal items, such as a television on the platform where he sleeps, take up half of Sum's living space. He was formerly homeless and slept under a street flyover for a year. 'The most important thing is having a roof over my head, not worrying about getting sunburnt or rained on,' said Sum, who gave only his last name. Chan, 45, who pays rent of HK$2,100 a month for his 2-square-meter home, said he hoped public housing would finally enable him to escape the bedbugs. 'I applied in 2005,' he said, providing only one name. 'I have been waiting for 19 years.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hong-kong-struggles-to-improve-conditions-in-tiny-crowded-homes-/7930564.html	2025-01-10T23:39:54-08:00	
College tuition has fallen significantly at many US schools, research finds	boston — The cost of college keeps spiraling ever higher, right? Not necessarily. New research indicates students are paying significantly less to attend public universities than they were a decade ago. And tuition increases at private colleges have finally slowed after years of hefty rises. Figures compiled by the nonprofit College Board indicate the average student attending an in-state public university this year faces a tuition bill of $11,610, which is down 4% from a decade earlier when taking inflation into account. But the real savings come in what the average student actually pays after getting grants and financial aid. That's down 40% over the decade, from $4,140 to $2,480 annually, according to the data. That reduced cost means less borrowing. Just under half of students attending in-state public universities are graduating with some debt, down from 59% a decade earlier, according to the College Board figures. And among those who do borrow, the average loan balance has fallen by 17%, to $27,100. Meanwhile, at private colleges, tuition continues to rise, but at a much slower rate. It has increased 4% over the past decade, when taking inflation into account, to an average $43,350, according to the College Board. That's a big change from the two decades prior, when tuition increased 68%. Costs are coming down as Americans question whether college is worth the price. Surveys find that Americans are increasingly skeptical about the value of a degree, and the percentage of high school graduates heading to college has fallen to levels not seen in decades, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Yet research still finds that, over time, a degree pays off. Americans with a bachelor's degree earn a median of $2.8 million during their careers, 75% more than if they had only a high school diploma, according to research from Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce. COVID effect The COVID-19 pandemic has been a big factor in the cost reductions, said Jennifer Ma, an executive research scientist at the College Board and lead author of the study. 'We know that during COVID, a lot of institutions — public and private — froze tuition,' Ma said. As states and the federal government responded to the pandemic, Ma said, they increased higher education funding, allowing colleges to reduce the cost of attendance. Some of that money has since expired, however, including an infusion of federal pandemic aid that was mostly used up by the end of 2022. Cost was a major consideration in Kai Mattinson's decision to attend Northern Arizona University. It would have cost her about $39,000 annually to attend the public university but discounts and scholarships bring that down to between $15,000 and $20,000 for the 22-year-old senior from Nevada. 'I originally wanted to go to the University of Arizona, but when it came down to tuition and other cost, Northern Arizona University was the best option,' said Mattinson, a physical education major who also works as a long-term substitute at a local elementary school. Many institutions have tried to limit cost increases. Purdue University in Indiana, for example, has frozen its annual in-state tuition at $9,992 for the past 13 years. Mark Becker, the president of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, said he was pleased to see the new data. 'Institutional efforts to control costs, combined with many states' efforts to increase investments in public universities and federal investment in the Pell Grant, have increased college affordability and enabled significant progress on tackling student debt,' Becker said in a statement. Costs for those attending public two-year community colleges have fallen even more, by 9% over the past decade, according to the College Board data, which is broadly in line with federal figures collected by the National Center for Education Statistics. Still, for parents paying for their children to attend out-of-state public universities or private colleges, the costs remain daunting — as much as $95,000 annually, in some cases. However, many institutions offer significant discounts to the sticker price for middle- and lower-income students. Some private colleges have been expanding their financial aid, including the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which in November announced undergraduates with a family income below $200,000 would no longer need to pay any tuition at all starting in the fall. Other private colleges are discounting tuition as a marketing move in an increasingly difficult environment. They face a dwindling pool of young adults, and students who are more wary of signing up for giant loans. Recruiting students is crucial for staying afloat as operational costs rise. After temporary relief thanks to federal money during the pandemic, many colleges have cut programs to try to keep costs under control.	https://www.voanews.com/a/college-tuition-has-fallen-significantly-at-many-us-schools-research-finds/7930536.html	2025-01-10T23:38:52-08:00	
Germany races to secure stricken 'Russian shadow fleet' oil tanker	BERLIN — Germany was racing Saturday to secure a heavily loaded tanker stranded off its northern coast, towing the stricken ship it said was part of Russia's sanctions-busting 'shadow fleet' away from shore to avert an oil spill. The 274-meter-long Eventin was sailing from Russia to Egypt with almost 100,000 tons of oil on board when its engine failed and it lost the ability to maneuver, according to Germany's Central Command for Maritime Emergencies. As the vessel drifted in coastal waters Friday, Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock slammed Russia's use of 'dilapidated oil tankers' to avoid sanctions on its oil exports, calling it a threat to European security. Three tugs have linked up with the Eventin and are attempting to steer it northeast, away from the coast and toward a 'safer' area where there is 'more sea space,' the command said. It said it had taken 'safety measures' due to rough seas, with 2.5-meter-high waves and strengthening wind gusts. The ship was intercepted off the island of Ruegen, having come within 14 kilometers of the coast. No oil leaks were detected by several surveillance overflights, authorities said Friday, and responders have passed radios and flashlights to the stranded crew. It will take around eight hours to pull the Eventin roughly 25 kilometers to safer waters northeast of Cape Arkona, the command said early Saturday, adding they expected it to arrive by mid-morning. 'Rusty tankers' Although the tanker was navigating under the Panamanian flag, the German foreign ministry linked it to Russia's sanctions-busting 'shadow fleet.' Baerbock said that 'by ruthlessly deploying a fleet of rusty tankers, (Russian President Vladimir) Putin is not only circumventing the sanctions, but is also willingly accepting that tourism on the Baltic Sea will come to a standstill' in the event of an accident. Following Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, Western countries have hit Russia's oil industry with an embargo and banned the provision of services to ships carrying oil by sea. In response, Russia has relied on tankers with opaque ownership or without proper insurance to continue lucrative oil exports. The number of ships in the 'shadow fleet' has exploded since the start of the war in Ukraine, according to U.S. think tank the Atlantic Council. In addition to direct action against Russia's oil industry, Western countries have moved to sanction individual ships thought to be in the shadow fleet. The European Union has so far sanctioned over 70 ships thought to be ferrying Russian oil. The United States and Britain on Friday moved to impose restrictions on around 180 more ships in the shadow fleet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/germany-races-to-secure-stricken-russian-shadow-fleet-oil-tanker/7933154.html	2025-01-10T23:04:39-08:00	
Russia blames Ukraine for deadly supermarket strike	Russia accused Ukraine of conducting a deadly missile strike Friday on a supermarket in the Moscow-controlled city of Donetsk, while Kyiv reported a massive wave of Russian drone attacks on several regions and fierce fighting near the strategic logistics hub of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine. The fighting on Friday came a day after the Ukraine Defense Contact Group meeting in Ramstein, Germany, where Kyiv's allies vowed no letup in aid to bolster Ukraine's air defenses amid Moscow's relentless assaults, including attacks on civilian and infrastructure sites. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who traveled to Rome following the Ramstein gathering, also praised new actions by the United States and Britain to sanction Russia's oil producers, a major liquefied natural gas project, and more than 100 tankers in its 'shadow fleet' as the West looks to deprive Moscow of funds needed to carry on its war. Russian state RIA news agency said investigators were looking into the supermarket attack early Friday, claiming a U.S.-supplied HIMARS missile hit the supermarket, killing two people, in the occupied city. Video on social media, which has been verified by RFE/RL, appears to show a massive explosion in an area where a small market is located. Ukrainian officials have not commented on the Russian accusation. The Ukrainian Air Force, meanwhile, said Russia attacked Ukraine with 72 Shahed-type strike drones in the Poltava, Sumy, Kharkiv, Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Zaporizhzhia, Khmelnytskiy, Vinnytsia and Kherson regions. In Kyiv, bright flashes and explosions were seen as defense systems intercepted several drones in the sky. No deaths were reported, though some damage from debris was seen at a high-rise residential building, military officials said. The Ukrainian General Staff said several small towns east of Pokrovsk and an important highway a few kilometers south of the area had been the site of intense battles on Friday. Pokrovsk has been the target of Russia's brutal drive in recent months, mainly destroying the city with a prewar population of about 64,000 people. As intense attacks and fighting on the front lines continue, diplomatic efforts to stop the conflict appear to be picking up momentum. Ukraine's Foreign Ministry said on Friday that it expects Kyiv to have high-level talks with the White House once President-elect Donald Trump takes office. 'We are waiting for a meeting between our presidents because for us the main thing is to work together with America. ... We are preparing for contacts at the highest and high levels immediately after the inauguration,' ministry spokesperson Heorhiy Tykhiy said. The Kremlin said it remains willing to meet with Trump and that there has been progress in setting up a meeting after the new president is inaugurated on Jan. 20. 'No conditions are required for this, just a mutual desire and political will to conduct a dialogue and resolve existing problems through dialogue is required,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow a day after Trump said a meeting was being set up between him and President Vladimir Putin, though he laid out no timeline. At Ramstein, hundreds of millions of dollars in military aid was pledged -- including $500 million from Washington as part of the outgoing President Joe Biden's goal of sending as much support as possible before Trump returns to office. Zelenskyy, meanwhile, thanked Washington and London for their 'synchronized action' in sanctioning Russian energy firms and ships operating the Kremlin's so-called 'shadow fleet' of sanctions-busting vessels in the Baltic Sea -- which are also suspected of sabotaging communications and electrical cables in the body of water.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-blames-ukraine-for-deadly-supermarket-strike/7933135.html	2025-01-10T20:37:58-08:00	
Biden team urges Trump administration to keep continuity in Indo-Pacific	white house — Jake Sullivan, the outgoing U.S. national security adviser, is urging the incoming Trump administration to continue President Joe Biden's strategy of bolstering ties with allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific to counter adversaries including China and North Korea. 'The case we will make to them is that the American position in the region is incredibly strong right now,' Sullivan said in response to VOA's question during a roundtable with journalists on Friday. 'There should be more continuity than significant change with respect to our Indo-Pacific strategy,' he said. 'But I don't know what the incoming team will actually end up doing.' Sullivan, considered one of the main architects of the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific strategy, said the president's approach is 'working in a big way,' and he warned that straying from that will 'bring risk.' Sullivan acknowledged, however, that the administration failed to make substantial progress on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. As the threat from Pyongyang remains as acute as it has ever been, Sullivan highlighted key distinctions: closer cooperation between North Korea and Russia, and a 'broader alignment of competitors and adversaries — Russia, China, North Korea, Iran.' He repeated the administration's warning against reducing U.S. support for Kyiv, something that President-elect Donald Trump has signaled he would do. What happens in Ukraine really matters for the Indo-Pacific, Sullivan said, because 'China's watching.' Biden's aides have often voiced concern that the West's reluctance to bolster Kyiv's defenses could embolden China to follow Russia's lead and invade its smaller democratic neighbor, Taiwan, or act even more aggressively on its disputed territorial claims in the South China Sea. Bonnie Glaser, managing director of German Marshall Fund's Indo-Pacific Program, said that cooperation between Moscow and Pyongyang has developed quickly, with North Korea sending its troops to support Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and is likely to expand. 'We have yet to see what weapons systems or military technologies [Russian President Vladimir] Putin has promised to deliver to [North Korean leader] Kim [Jong Un],' she told VOA. 'Beijing has refused to apply leverage to stop this trend.' Sullivan expressed confidence that the administration has 'set up a great opportunity for the next team' to enhance the U.S. position and has 'shifted the balance of power' in the Indo-Pacific. He outlined Biden's approach of creating a network of alliances and partnerships, including enhancing cooperation with the Quad, an informal grouping with India, Australia and Japan, as well as rolling out the AUKUS security deal with the United Kingdom and Australia to provide Canberra with nuclear-powered submarines to better patrol the waters of the region. Sullivan also highlighted trilateral cooperation among the U.S., Japan and South Korea, with the two former adversaries now working together to deter North Korea's nuclear threat, and among the U.S., Japan and the Philippines to push back against Beijing's aggression in the South China Sea. Continuity or change Because relations between Washington and Beijing will likely remain adversarial, the region could see more continuity on U.S. policy toward China under the incoming administration. Trump has selected two well-known China hawks for key roles in his 'America First' Cabinet: Senator Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, and Representative Mike Waltz, the man Trump is eyeing to become Sullivan's successor. However, Waltz earlier this week announced a sweeping directive to terminate all national security staffers loaned from other departments and agencies who serve in apolitical, nonpartisan senior staff roles. Waltz said the firings were meant to enforce absolute alignment with Trump's policy agenda. Aside from staffing the National Security Council with Trump loyalists, it’s unclear whether the president-elect will employ the same approach of leveraging alliances to deter China. The first Trump administration saw that 'multilateral alliances are more a burden than a reality,' said Aaron David Miller, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. During his first term, Trump terminated U.S. membership in organizations and agreements including the Paris Climate Accord, the U.N. Human Rights Council and the World Health Organization. 'If you do form alliances, they're going to have to be based on clear, specific quid pro quo transactions,' he told VOA. During his first term, Trump also focused more on bilateral ties, and he may fall back on that approach. 'He might emphasize ties with strong conservative leaders like [Prime Minister Narendra] Modi in India but de-emphasize groups like the U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilat[eral], particularly if a new government in Seoul drifts a little away from Washington,' said Zack Cooper, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. 'What remains unclear is whether Trump will be confrontational with China outside the economic arena,' Cooper told VOA. Key uncertainties include whether the U.S. will pursue a less robust response to Beijing's moves in the Taiwan Strait and the South China Sea. 'Trump personally seems more open to engagement with [Chinese President] Xi Jinping and focused on trade issues, but many in his administration will be pushing for a hard line on security and technology issues,' Cooper said. Change of trade strategy Trade is one area where analysts expect a significant change in strategy as Trump appears set to enact protectionist measures, threatening to wield tariffs as a weapon of punishment not only on adversaries but also on regional partners, particularly those with large trade surpluses, including Japan. Trump is expected to undo the Biden's administration's effort to revitalize trade with the region. During his presidential campaign, Trump vowed to kill the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, Biden's 2022 deal with countries in the region, saying that it will hurt American manufacturing and workers. IPEF was Biden's attempt to bolster economic ties with Indo-Pacific countries, five years after Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Obama administration's most important trade initiative, the Trans-Pacific Partnership, immediately upon entering his first term. The framework pursues nontrade priorities such as supply chain resilience, secure digital infrastructure and sustainable clean energy transition. It has been criticized by many in the region for not offering market access measures as Beijing aggressively expanded its economic clout, including through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, the world's largest regional free-trade pact that covers almost one-third of the world's population and GDP.

Prosecutors demand former US senator get at least 15 years in prison for corruption	Prosecutors are demanding that former U.S. Senator Bob Menendez be given at least a 15-year prison sentence following his conviction for corruption that included acting as an agent of a foreign government. In the sentencing recommendation filed late Thursday in a Manhattan federal court, prosecutors said the 71-year-old Democrat who once represented New Jersey is the first senator convicted of abusing a Senate committee leadership position and the first person convicted of serving as a foreign agent while being a public official. This 'historical rarity,' they said, was a 'grave abuse of his power.' Menendez's lawyers say their client has suffered enough and have called for leniency, citing federal guidelines that would have him serving less than 27 months. Meanwhile, probation officers said their guidelines would have the senator serving from 24½ to 30½ years. Prosecutors said arguments that Menendez has been punished enough reflect a 'deeply misplaced sense of entitlement.' He is scheduled to be sentenced on January 29. Menendez was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee when he was charged in 2023 but was forced out of that position and relinquished his Senate seat in August. He had been a senator for 18½ years. Prosecutors said in their court submissions that Menendez had, in multiple instances, promoted the Egyptian government's viewpoints and assisted the Egyptian government in ways 'directly adverse to his own fellow U.S. Senators' as he sought to adjust his own public criticism of Egypt. Menendez was convicted in July of 16 counts of corruption. An FBI raid on his home in 2022 uncovered at least $150,000 in gold bars, $480,000 in cash and a Mercedes-Benz. A large portion of the cash, prosecutors said, was the result of bribes from three New Jersey businessmen. The men had sought the senator's protection and influence in schemes that included giving one of them, Wael Hana, the sole right to certify that U.S. meat exported to Egypt adhered to Islamic dietary requirements, forcing out other companies that had been certifying the exportations. Two of the businessmen — Hana and Fred Daibes — were convicted with Menendez. Prosecutors have called for them to spend 10 and nine years in prison, respectively. The third man pleaded guilty and testified at the trial. Menendez's wife, Nadine Menendez, who is facing many of the same charges as her husband, has pleaded not guilty. Her trial is scheduled to begin next month. It was delayed last year after a breast cancer diagnosis required surgery. Some information for this story came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prosecutors-demand-former-us-senator-get-at-least-15-years-in-prison-for-corruption-/7933053.html	2025-01-10T17:29:25-08:00	
Judge holds Giuliani in contempt for continued lies about election workers	WASHINGTON — Rudy Giuliani was found in contempt of court Friday for the second time in a week, as a federal judge warned Giuliani he could be sent to jail if he doesn't stop spreading lies about two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against him. U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell in Washington found that the former New York City mayor and former attorney for President-elect Donald Trump violated court orders barring him from defaming Wandrea 'Shaye' Moss and her mother, Ruby Freeman. The judge ordered him to review trial testimony and other materials from the case and warned him that future violations could land him behind bars. Moss and Freeman sued Rudy Giuliani for defamation for falsely accusing them of committing election fraud in connection with the 2020 election. His lies upended their lives as they received racist threats and harassment. Giuliani smiled and chuckled as the judge explained why she was holding him in contempt of court. Howell, who was nominated to the bench by President Barack Obama, said it is 'outrageous and shameful' for Giuliani to suggest that he is the one who has been treated unfairly in this case. 'This takes real chutzpah, Mr. Giuliani,' she said. Giuliani calls judge 'bloodthirsty' Shortly before the hearing began, Giuliani slammed the judge in a social media post, calling her 'bloodthirsty' and biased against him and the proceeding a 'hypocritical waste of time.' After leaving the courtroom, Giuliani called the hearing a farce and the judge 'completely biased and prejudiced.' Giuliani briefly testified during Friday's hearing, but only to authenticate records about his personal finances. The judge didn't fine Giuliani for his most recent defamatory comments about the case, but she said she would impose daily fines of $200 if he doesn't certify within 10 days that he has complied with her order to review trial testimony and other case-related material. A jury sided with the mother and daughter in December 2023 and awarded them $75 million in punitive damages plus roughly $73 million in other damages On Monday in New York, Judge Lewis Liman found Giuliani in contempt of court for related claims that he failed to turn over evidence to help the judge decide whether he can keep a Palm Beach, Florida, condominium. Giuliani says he gets death threats Giuliani, 80, had tried to get out of appearing in person Friday, telling the judge he gets death threats and has been told to be careful about traveling. But he withdrew his request to appear virtually after the judge ordered him to explain whether he has traveled from his Florida home within the past month. On the witness stand at the defamation trial, Moss and Freeman described fearing for their lives after becoming the target of a false conspiracy theory that Giuliani and other Republicans spread as they tried to keep Trump in power after he lost the 2020 election to Democrat Joe Biden. Moss told jurors she tried to change her appearance, seldom leaves her home and suffers from panic attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/judge-holds-giuliani-in-contempt-for-continued-lies-about-election-workers/7932871.html	2025-01-10T17:19:56-08:00	
Taiwan chipmaker starts making 4-nanometer chips in US, official says	WASHINGTON — Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. has begun producing advanced 4-nanometer chips in Arizona for U.S. customers, a milestone in the Biden administration's semiconductor efforts, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo told Reuters. In November, the Commerce Department finalized a $6.6 billion grant to TSMC's U.S. unit for semiconductor production in Phoenix, Arizona. 'For the first time ever in our country's history, we are making leading-edge 4-nanometer chips on American soil, American workers — on par in yield and quality with Taiwan,' Raimondo told Reuters in an interview, saying it had begun in recent weeks. 'That's a big deal — never been done before, never in our history. And lots of people said it couldn't happen,' Raimondo said of the previously undisclosed production start. A spokesperson for TSMC, the world's largest contract chipmaker and a major supplier to Apple and Nvidia, which reports earnings next week, declined to comment Friday. In April, TSMC agreed to expand its planned investment by $25 billion to $65 billion and to add a third Arizona production facility by 2030. Congress created a $52.7 billion semiconductor manufacturing and research subsidy program in 2022. Commerce persuaded all five leading-edge semiconductor firms to locate production facilities in the United States as part of the program. Raimondo told Reuters earlier that Commerce had to persuade TSMC to boost its U.S. plans. 'It didn't happen on its own. ... We had to convince TSMC that they would want to expand,' Raimondo said. TSMC will produce the world's most advanced 2-nanometer technology at its second Arizona factory, expected to begin production in 2028. TSMC also agreed to use its most advanced chip manufacturing technology, called 'A16,' in Arizona. The TSMC award from Commerce also includes up to $5 billion in low-cost government loans. Raimondo wants the United States to make 20% of world's leading-edge logic chips by 2030 — up from the 0% before TSMC began production in Arizona. In April, Commerce said TSMC expects to begin high-volume production in its first U.S. fab by the first half of 2025. Last month, Commerce finalized an award of $407 million to help fund Amkor Technology's planned $2 billion advanced semiconductor packaging facility in Arizona, which is set to be the largest of its kind in the U.S. When fully operational, Amkor's Arizona plant will package and test millions of chips for autonomous vehicles, 5G/6G and data centers. Apple will be its first and largest customer, with the chips produced at a nearby TSMC facility.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-chipmaker-starts-making-4-nanometer-chips-in-us-official-says/7933080.html	2025-01-10T17:10:15-08:00	
Myanmar anti-military factions need to be strategic with China, experts say	WASHINGTON — Analysts say that rising anti-China sentiment in Myanmar reflects widespread frustration with Beijing's perceived support for the country's military junta in the conflict-torn Southeast Asian nation. Since the Myanmar military seized power in February 2021, critics have accused Beijing of backing the junta to safeguard its Belt and Road Initiative projects and maintain regional stability. Public distrust of China also stems from its long-standing ties with Myanmar's military, according to analysts and activists. 'There's a widespread perception that China is stalling progress in the anti-coup revolution,' said Lin Htet, a Myanmar activist who fled the country after the coup because of his outspoken opposition to the regime. According to a survey by the Institute for Strategy and Policy-Myanmar, or ISP-Myanmar, released in mid-2024, 54% of key stakeholders in Myanmar held a negative view of China as a neighbor. That figure rose to 72% among civil society organizations, with respondents describing China as either 'not good at all' or 'not a good neighbor.' Similarly, 60% of ethnic armed organizations and 54% of the People's Defense Forces, the armed wing of the National Unity Government, or local defense forces — formed after the 2021 coup to oppose the military regime — reported the same sentiment. 'Many believed China supported the military takeover at the time,' said Nan Lwin, head of the Myanmar China studies program at ISP-Myanmar, an independent think tank. 'While those sentiments initially subsided by mid-2021, they resurfaced later as Beijing began high-level engagements with the regime.' Htet Min Lwin, a Myanmar expert at York University in Toronto, Ontario, highlighted the growing anti-China sentiment in Myanmar since Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's visit to Naypyitaw in August, where he met with junta leader Min Aung Hlaing. 'Historically, Myanmar's political stakeholders have rarely been united,' Htet Min Lwin said. 'Yet, during Wang Yi's visit, all revolutionary forces opposed to the military regime expressed unanimous anti-China sentiment. From political leaders to analysts, many view China's actions as interference.' Protests, public sentiment In recent months, anti-military activists have staged protests and boycotts of products to draw attention to Beijing's perceived interference in Myanmar. In November, there was a call to boycott products 'Made in China.' Lin Htet recently organized a demonstration outside the Chinese Embassy in Washington. He said the protest was to call on China to stop meddling in Myanmar's affairs and to change its policies while emphasizing a desire to remain good neighbors. 'This is not about racial hatred,' Lin Htet told VOA. During the protest, he recalled two Burmese-born ethnic Chinese individuals, Kyal Sin and Khant Nyar Hein, who were killed during the early days of the anti-coup demonstrations in 2021. 'Our Chinese brothers and sisters gave their lives on the streets for democracy. We have not forgotten them to this day,' he said, citing Kyal Sin's burial in a Chinese cemetery and quoting Khant Nyar Hein's mother's plea to 'please don't hate Chinese in Myanmar.' Chinese Embassy responds In a written reply to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar said, 'The current situation in Myanmar is of great concern,' and it urged all relevant parties 'to adhere to dialogue and consultation, and to cease fire as soon as possible.' 'China is Myanmar's largest neighbor. No other country wants Myanmar to restore stability and realize development more than China,' the embassy said. 'On the Myanmar issue, China is committed to respecting Myanmar's sovereignty, independence, national unity and territorial integrity, non-interference in its internal affairs, and the Myanmar-owned and Myanmar-led peace process.' 'It is hoped that all relevant parties in Myanmar will effectively safeguard the safety of Chinese enterprises, projects and personnel in Myanmar, create a secure environment for mutually beneficial cooperation between the two countries, and better benefit the people of both countries,' the statement said. Call for diplomacy According to ACLED data research, which specializes in conflict analysis, resentment among Myanmar's local population is expected to grow in 2025 amid China's increasing public support for the military. However, experts warn that alienating China could backfire. 'We can't do anti-China sentiment. We can't just demonize China. It is no longer the 15th century,' said Sai Kyi Zin Soe, a Myanmar analyst. 'We're neighbors, so we must maintain some diplomacy. We have to understand China's concerns and their political stance.' Htet Min Lwin also emphasized the need to engage with Beijing constructively. 'China's influence can slow the Myanmar resistance's revolutionary war [against the junta],' he said. 'Rather than simply criticizing China, the opposition should engage its policymakers and clarify Myanmar's situation. Lobbying is vital. If the advocacy approach is effective, the revolutionary forces can maintain their momentum.' Michael Martin, a senior adviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the National Unity Government (NUG), Myanmar's opposition, lacks a coherent strategy to engage China. 'They don't have an idea how to work with China,' Martin said. 'They talk about, you know, 'Why won't you recognize us as a state actor?' That's not going to go very far with China. China recognizes the SAC [the military's State Administration Council] as the state actor. They can't have two.' A path forward As Myanmar's conflict grinds on, analysts stress the importance of balancing public dissatisfaction with pragmatic engagement. 'China's strategy is to hedge its relations with multiple stakeholders in the country, whether it's the SAC or the NUG,' Enze Han, an associate professor at the University of Hong Kong, said in an email to VOA. For those seeking democracy, the challenge lies in finding a strategic approach that acknowledges China's regional interests while advancing Myanmar's aspirations for democracy and equality. 'We have absolutely no need to hate China or Chinese people,' Lin Htet said. 'But if the Chinese government continues interfering in Myanmar's affairs as it does now, it could face even more resistance, further alienating itself from the Burmese people.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-anti-military-factions-need-to-be-strategic-with-china-experts-say/7933047.html	2025-01-10T17:04:49-08:00	
Snowstorm ices roads, closes schools, delays flights in southern US	ATLANTA, GEORGIA — A powerful winter storm that dumped heavy snow and glazed roads with ice across much of Texas and Oklahoma lumbered eastward into Southern United States Friday, making for dicey travel and a rare snow day for many students. Arkansas and North Carolina mobilized their National Guards for tasks such as helping stranded motorists, as governors in multiple states declared states of emergency. School was canceled for millions of children from Texas to Georgia and as far east as South Carolina. The storm piled up more than a year's worth of snowfall on some Southern cities. As much as a foot (about 31 centimeters) fell in parts of Arkansas. There were reports of nearly 10 inches (about 25 centimeters) in Little Rock, a city that averages 3.8 inches (9.7 centimeters) a year. More than 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) fell at Memphis International Airport in Tennessee since late Thursday. The city usually sees 2.7 inches (6.9 centimeters) a year. In some areas where snow tapered off, such as Memphis, Tennessee, the worry was that wet roads would freeze overnight. Farther south and east into Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and Georgia, a wintry mix of sleet, snow and ice made travel treacherous. The heavy wet stuff also packed into a pretty good snowball. In Atlanta, Georgia, Mikayla Johnson, 12, was out making snow angels and snowmen on her day off from school. 'My first thought was, 'Wow!'' said Mikayla, who was outdoors with her father, Nate. 'We haven't had snow since I was, like, 4 – good snow, at least. So I was really happy.' The storm dumped as much as 7 inches (about 18 centimeters) in some spots in central Oklahoma and northern Texas. And in the Kansas City area, students were back at school in several districts Thursday after three straight snow days, only to see classes called off again Friday because of more snow. Snow began falling in metro Atlanta before dawn, leading to hundreds of flights being cancelled and hundreds more delayed at the world's busiest airport, according to flight tracking software FlightAware. Controllers declared a ground stop before 8 a.m., meaning no planes could land or take off. Four passengers were injured after a Delta plane bound for Minneapolis aborted takeoff Friday morning, according to the Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport. One passenger was hospitalized, while three people were treated at the scene for minor injuries. The incident contributed to further delays, although Delta said it was unclear whether the weather had anything to do with the flight aborting its takeoff. The airline said there was an indication of an engine issue. Other airports with significant delays and cancellations included those in Charlotte, North Carolina, Dallas-Fort Worth and Nashville. Fifty-five passengers on three American Airlines flights that were diverted from Dallas-Fort Worth spent the night at the Bill and Hillary Clinton National Airport in Little Rock. Texas Governor Greg Abbott urged residents to avoid driving if possible. Some 75,000 fans were expected Friday at AT&T Stadium in Arlington for the college football championship semifinal between Texas and Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole, but it sometimes ventures south into the U.S., Europe and Asia. Some experts say such events are happening more frequently, paradoxically, because of a warming world. The cold snap coincided with rare January wildfires tearing through the Los Angeles area. Southern discomfort As much as 8 inches (about 20 centimeters) of snow was forecast in parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia through Saturday, the National Weather Service said. Snow and ice were likely to accumulate Friday across metro Atlanta, making roadways treacherous and possibly causing power outages. More than 1 million public school students in metro Atlanta and north Georgia got a snow day or were at home learning online. After a disastrous winter storm in 2014 left thousands of Atlanta-area workers and schoolchildren stranded overnight away from home, officials in Georgia were quick to cancel in-person classes and close offices Friday. Schools close Many schools canceled classes Friday in Alabama's northern half, where roads were largely covered in snow or ice and some were already impassible, the Alabama Law Enforcement Agency said. Tennessee's largest school district, Memphis-Shelby County Schools, closed all schools Friday. Tours at Graceland, Elvis Presley's former home-turned-museum, were canceled, a spokeswoman said. Parts of South Carolina were seeing their first wintry weather in three years. The state Department of Transportation treated interstates and other major highways from Columbia northward, but vehicles were slipping off icy Interstate 95 south of the city. Some schools closed. With snow, sleet and freezing rain expected across North Carolina, a public outdoor inauguration ceremony Saturday in Raleigh, North Carolina, for Governor Josh Stein and other elected officials was canceled. The storm's trajectory overlapped with much of the western North Carolina area impacted by Hurricane Helene last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/snowstorm-ices-roads-closes-schools-delays-flights-in-southern-us/7933052.html	2025-01-10T16:55:10-08:00	
Study: Gaza death toll 41% higher than official figures	The death toll from Israel’s war against Hamas militants in Gaza is far higher than official figures, according to a new analysis. Henry Ridgwell reports from London.	https://www.voanews.com/a/study-gaza-death-toll-41-higher-than-official-figures-/7932859.html	2025-01-10T15:44:21-08:00	
Gaza death toll 41% higher than official figures, study contends	London — The death toll from Israel’s war against Hamas militants in Gaza is far higher than official figures, according to an analysis by researchers at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine published in The Lancet. The analysis, published Thursday in the medical journal, estimates that between October 2023 and June 2024, there were more than 64,000 Palestinian deaths caused by violence in Gaza, suggesting that the Hamas-run Ministry of Health in the territory underreported the death toll by 41%. The official figure for that period was 37,877 deaths. Some 59% of the dead were women, children or the elderly, according to the peer-reviewed Lancet report, which is roughly in line with other estimates. The analysis did not identify the number of Hamas fighters among the dead. A separate United Nations analysis of more than 8,000 verified deaths between November 2023 to April 2024 concluded that 44% of victims were children and 26% were women. Sources The researchers in the Lancet report used a scientific technique called capture-recapture analysis, whereby three different sources were cross-referenced. The less overlap between the sources, the more likely it is that many deaths have gone unrecorded. 'This method … uses multiple data sources (lists) with sufficient identifying information to accurately link records, identify overlapping cases, and infer the true number of cases (deaths), including those not featured within any list, based on statistical models,' the report said. The first source was the Palestinian Ministry of Health’s list of bodies identified in hospitals and morgues; the second source was an online survey distributed by the Ministry of Health asking relatives to record deceased family members; and the third list was compiled from obituaries posted on social media sites such as Instagram and Facebook. Indirect deaths The data did not include Palestinians who had died from causes indirectly related to the war. 'So in reality, the number of mortalities might be higher if we also include the issue of not accessing health care, heart attacks … infectious diseases, maternal care, pregnant women not being able to get access to proper delivery, and so on,' said report co-author Zeina Jamaluddine of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The analysis also excluded missing people. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs estimates that 10,000 Palestinians are missing under rubble and presumed dead. The capture-recapture technique has been used to estimate deaths in other conflicts, Jamaluddine said. 'It has been used in Sudan and Yemen. It has also been used in Kosovo — and some of this evidence has been used in the ICJ [International Court of Justice].' Israel offensive Israel launched its war on Hamas in Gaza following the militant group’s cross-border attack on October 7, 2023, which killed more than 1,200 people, mostly civilians. More than 240 hostages were taken back to Gaza. There are still almost 100 hostages being held by Hamas, with about one-third of them believed dead. Israel accuses Hamas of using civilians as human shields in Gaza. In a statement, Israel’s embassy in London told VOA, 'As has already been proven countless times before, any information that derives from Gaza cannot be trusted, nor can you ignore the Lancet’s history of anti-Israel bias. For this reason, we would strongly encourage readers to question their source and validity. We urge that the continual spread of misinformation about Israel is stopped. Such activity only serves Hamas, is irresponsible, and dangerously contributes to rising anti-Jewish hatred.' Reuters quoted an unnamed senior Israeli official saying, 'No other army in the world has ever taken such wide-ranging measures. These include providing advance warning to civilians to evacuate, safe zones, and taking any and all measures to prevent harm to civilians. The figures provided in this report do not reflect the situation on the ground.' VOA was unable to independently verify the figures. Israel does not allow foreign journalists to enter Gaza.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaza-death-toll-41-higher-than-official-figures-study-contends/7932849.html	2025-01-10T15:44:11-08:00

VOA Mandarin: China's winter surge of flu-like HMPV cases raises concerns of transparency	Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) has recently spread widely across China, overwhelming hospitals and evoking memories of the COVID-19 outbreak. HMPV is not a new virus; it has been known for years and typically has a low mortality rate. Nevertheless, epidemiologists are calling for greater transparency about the spread of the virus to help contain infections. While the health care system is under strain, experts stress that there is no need for panic. They recommend the public follow basic protective measures, particularly during the Spring Festival travel period, to help curb further spread of the virus.

US intelligence mostly rejects links between ‘Havana Syndrome,’ adversaries	WASHINGTON — U.S. intelligence agencies charged with investigating the spate of brain injuries and other serious health ailments that have struck hundreds of officials remain unconvinced that the illnesses are tied to the work of a foreign adversary. An updated intelligence assessment of what the U.S. government calls anomalous health incidents, or AHIs, released Friday calls the possibility that the health symptoms were caused by a foreign actor or weapon 'very unlikely.' The conclusion, endorsed by five of the seven U.S. intelligence agencies tasked with investigating the ailments, commonly known as Havana Syndrome, match the results of a 2023 assessment that found symptoms 'were probably the result of factors that did not involve a foreign adversary, such as preexisting conditions, conventional illnesses and environmental factors.' New information, described by officials as being 'sensitive' in nature, only served to further support the 2023 findings, they said. 'The intelligence does not link a foreign actor to these events. Indeed, it points away from their involvement,' according to a U.S. intelligence official who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity to discuss the latest findings. 'All IC [intelligence community] components agree that years of history collection, targeting and analytic efforts have not surfaced compelling intelligence reporting that ties a foreign actor to any specific event reported as a possible AHI,' the official said. The new assessment contrasts, however, with a December House Intelligence subcommittee report, which accused U.S. intelligence agencies of sloppy work and attempting to 'create a politically palatable conclusion.' There is reliable evidence to suggest that some anomalous health incidents are the work of foreign adversaries,' CIA Subcommittee Chairman Rick Crawford, a Republican, said at the time. On Friday, the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Republican Mike Turner, accused the new U.S. intelligence report of again falling short. 'This new intelligence, I believe, should completely change the assessment of our adversaries’ capabilities and the risks to our personnel,' he said. Despite the disagreement, some of the evidence pointing to foreign involvement in Havana Syndrome injuries appears to be finding more credibility with some elements of U.S. intelligence. Two of the seven agencies contributing to the latest assessment, which looked at intelligence gathered as recently as last month, now assess with 'low confidence' that a foreign hand could be involved in a limited number of cases. One of the agencies now judges 'there is ‘roughly even chance’ a foreign actor has used a novel weapon or prototype device to harm a small, undetermined subset of the USG [U.S. government] personnel or dependents,' according to the declassified assessment. The other agency concluded there is a 'roughly even chance' that a U.S. adversary has developed such a weapon, although the report states even if that is the case, 'it is unlikely a foreign actor has deployed such a weapon in any events reported as possible AHIs.' The U.S. intelligence official who spoke with reporters described the change as 'subtle,' arguing, 'they shift from unlikely with low confidence to roughly even chance with low confidence.' But White House officials Friday seemed to see the change as something more significant. 'Today’s updated Intelligence Community Assessment, which is the product of ongoing analytic efforts and includes a shift in key judgments by some intelligence components,' said National Security Council spokesperson Sean Savett. '[It] only reinforces why it is vital that the U.S. government continue critical research, investigate credible incidents and strengthen efforts to provide timely care and long-term clinical follow-up,' he said. That includes ongoing research into the potential to weaponize pulsed electromatic energy. A February 2022 report by a panel of experts warned that the core symptoms in a small number of Havana Syndrome cases were 'distinctly unusual' and suggested some sort of device must be responsible. 'Pulsed electromagnetic energy, particularly in the radiofrequency range, plausibly explains the core characteristics,' the 2022 report said. U.S. officials have, until now, mostly dismissed such claims, arguing that nothing in the available intelligence agencies or in medical studies supports that radiofrequency waves could be weaponized. Medical research has 'historically shown no harmful bioeffects,' according to the latest U.S. assessment. But the new assessment noted, 'more recent, limited studies have produced mixed preliminary results.' 'We have made it a priority to continue research in this area, to understand the effects of directed energy, which is an area that requires much more ongoing work,' a senior administration official told reporters, briefing on the condition of anonymity to discuss the U.S. response. 'There's a lot that we do not understand,' the official said. 'We are gaining greater insight over time.' The admission is not enough for some suffering from Havana Syndrome. The new assessment 'disgracefully continues to hide the truth behind a cloak of secrecy,' said Mark Zaid, a national security lawyer who represents dozens of victims. Zaid said he has filed a request to declassify the full report and called on President-elect Donald Trump to 'require full disclosure of what the government knows.' 'Evidence of the use of directed energy, particularly by Russia, of some form spans decades,' Zaid said in a statement shared with VOA. 'The CIA has sought to cover up its knowledge through both Democrat and Republican administrations, and classified information exists that we have knowledge of that fundamentally contradicts today’s report.' Others have challenged the U.S. intelligence findings on Havana Syndrome. An investigation in April by CBS's '60 Minutes' show, Germany's Der Spiegel and The Insider said a review of travel documents and mobile phone records, along with eyewitness testimony and interviews with multiple U.S. officials and victims, shows that Russia is likely to blame. Specifically, the investigation tied numerous reports of Havana Syndrome with the presence of members of Unit 29155 of Russia's military intelligence service, known for its role in sabotage and assassinations. It found that members of GRU Unit 29155 had received awards and promotions for their work on sound or radio frequency-based directed energy weapons. The U.S. intelligence official Friday, however, pushed back against the findings. 'The claims do not hold up to scrutiny,' the official said. Cases of Havana Syndrome were first publicly reported among diplomats and other employees at the U.S. Embassy in Havana, Cuba, in 2016. Symptoms range from nausea and dizziness to debilitating headaches and memory problems, with cases having been reported in Russia, China, Poland, Austria and the United States. 'These are our colleagues and friends,' said the U.S. intelligence official, stressing that the assessment’s failure to link to a foreign adversary is not meant to question the suffering of those afflicted. 'These personnel and their dependents experienced genuine, sometimes painful and traumatic, physical symptoms and sensory phenomena, and they honestly and sincerely reported those events as possible,' the official said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-intelligence-mostly-rejects-links-between-havana-syndrome-adversaries/7932763.html	2025-01-10T13:56:42-08:00	
Biden administration extends temporary status for 4 nationalities	MIAMI, FLORIDA — About 600,000 Venezuelans and more than 230,000 Salvadorans already living in the United States can legally remain another 18 months, the Department of Homeland Security said Friday, barely a week before President-elect Donald Trump takes office with promises of hard-line immigration policies. Biden's administration has strongly supported Temporary Protected Status, which he has expanded to cover about 1 million people. TPS faces an uncertain future under Trump, who tried to sharply curtail its use during his first term as president. Federal regulations would allow the extensions to be terminated early, although that's never been done before. Homeland Security also extended TPS for more than 103,000 Ukrainians and 1,900 Sudanese who are already living in the U.S. The TPS designation gives people legal authority to be in the country, but it doesn't provide a long-term path to citizenship. They are reliant on the government renewing their status when it expires. Conservative critics have said that over time, the renewal of the protection status becomes automatic, regardless of what is happening in the person's home country. Friday's announcement, which came as Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro took office for a third six-year term in Caracas amid widespread international condemnation, is 'based on the severe humanitarian emergency the country continues to face due to political and economic crises under the Maduro regime,' the department said. Homeland Security cited 'environmental conditions in El Salvador that prevent individuals from returning,' specifically heavy rains and storms in the last two years. Congress created TPS in 1990 to prevent deportations to countries suffering from natural disasters or civil strife, giving people authorization to work in increments of up to 18 months at a time. About 1 million immigrants from 17 countries are protected by TPS, including people from Venezuela, Haiti, Honduras, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Sudan, Ukraine and Lebanon. Venezuelans are one of the largest beneficiaries, and their extension runs from April 2025 to October 2, 2026. Salvadorans won TPS in 2001 after earthquakes rocked the Central American country. TPS for Salvadorans was to expire in March and was extended until Sept. 9, 2026. Trump and his running mate, JD Vance, suggested they would scale back the use of TPS and policies granting temporary status as they pursue mass deportations. During his first administration, Trump ended TPS for El Salvador but was held up in court. In recent months, advocates have increased pressure on the Biden administration to ask for TPS extensions for those who already have it and to protect people from other countries such as Guatemala and Ecuador. 'This extension is just a small victory,' said Felipe Arnoldo Diaz, an activist with the National TPS Alliance. 'Our biggest concern is that after El Salvador, there are countries whose TPS are expiring soon and are being left out,' such as Nepal, Nicaragua and Honduras. The money that Salvadorans send home is a major economic support for the Central American country, potentially complicating efforts to end TPS for the U.S. ally. Trump has had warm relations with Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, who worked closely with him on preventing illegal immigration to the U.S. Remittances amount to about $7.5 billion a year. Bukele is immensely popular, largely because his heavy-handed security efforts have eviscerated the country's street gangs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-extends-temporary-status-for-4-nationalities/7932659.html	2025-01-10T12:12:39-08:00	
Nigerian president orders probe into Borno military base attack	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian President Bola Tinubu has ordered a probe into last week's terrorist attacks on a military base in Damboa, Northeast Borno State, that killed six troops. In a statement Thursday, Tinubu said the investigation will help identify security lapses to avoid future occurrences. The president's statement — released Thursday by his information adviser Bayo Onanuga — called for a comprehensive investigation into the attack on the military base at Sabon Gida, Damboa. According to the Nigerian military, Islamic State of West Africa Province militants masterminded the ambush, killing six soldiers on Jan. 4. Authorities say the investigation will focus on identifying possible intelligence gaps and operational inefficiencies that may have contributed to the incident. But Beacon Security analyst Kabir Adamu said the president must be clear about the probe's objective. 'It depends on who's going to conduct the probe,' said Adamu. 'If it's the military themselves, my honest opinion is that it's because of their lapses that led to the attack, so I don't expect them to do an effective probe. I would expect an external body or even the national assembly to set up a parliamentary committee. Ordering a probe without really the details of what, who, when, and how the probe will be conducted is a bit vague.' The president also praised the swift intervention of security forces, particularly their air units, during the attack. He sent condolences to the families of the fallen soldiers and ordered the military to intensify its operations against bandits and terrorists. The attack occurred amid ongoing progress in Nigeria's counterterrorism efforts. According to Adamu, that may have been a factor in the terrorists' mission. 'This particular forward operating base is the only one in that location, sandwiched between Alagano and Sambisa Forest. They wanted to cripple the activity of the military which would give them access to about five local governments in southern Borno,' said Adamu. 'I don't see it as a resurgence because it is just one incident. That forward operating base has always been vulnerable.' Nigeria faces significant security challenges from terrorist groups and criminal gangs, particularly in the northwest and central regions. In November, national defense authorities reported military successes, including the deaths of about 115 terrorists and the arrest of hundreds more. However, security analyst Ebenezer Oyetakin said continued vigilance is needed. 'Since President Bola Tinubu took over, there have been drastic moves to contain them, and we are seeing it in the successes that are being recorded by our military, [but] we are at war, and we should be alert at all times,' said Oyetakin. 'There have been many other probes in the past, and we are still where we are.' As Nigerian authorities work to secure the nation, many will be watching to see whether this latest investigation leads to tangible improvements.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-president-orders-probe-into-borno-military-base-attack-/7932579.html	2025-01-10T11:38:59-08:00	
Trump's return sparks renewed hope among Nigerian separatists	ABUJA, NIGERIA — As U.S. President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second inauguration on Jan. 20, thousands of miles away in Nigeria his return to power has reignited hope among Biafra secessionists. Some view him as a possible ally in their decades-long battle for autonomy – though at least one analyst thinks they should lower their expectations. On the morning of Nov. 6, Odinaka Nwankwo, a retired footballer, sat on his porch in southeast Nigeria’s Anambra state listening to the results of the U.S. presidential election on his transistor radio. After a few hours, the news broke that Republican candidate Donald Trump had defeated opponent Kamala Harris. Nwankwo, a supporter of the Biafra secessionist movement, said jubilation immediately erupted. 'We know that Trump can go straight to them and tell them - resolve this issue of Biafra, if they want to be free, let them be free,' Nwankwo said. 'I think that's the why the southeast is excited about his coming, not that he will give the southeast Biafra, but at least he [is] blunt about issues because he doesn't know how to play politics.' Trump won both the electoral college and popular vote to become the 47th U.S. president-elect. Biafra's separatist communities are now expressing hope that Trump's presidency, which begins on Jan. 20, could be a turning point for their movement. Ifeanyi Okoroafor is a resident of Imo State in southeast Nigeria. 'Marginalization is subjection and it will never end until secession comes,' Okoroafor said. 'The world is talking about Trump coming in and because America is a force in world power they can dictate certain things that will happen elsewhere. It may not be that easy though. Trump because he's Republican and their manner of doing things is what the people are seeing.' The Biafra movement has sought independence from Nigeria for decades. A 1967 secession attempt led to a brutal civil war that lasted three years and killed over 1 million people, mostly from starvation. Critics say that when it comes to Trump, Biafran activists may be too optimistic. Ahmed Buhari, a Nigerian political analyst, said that it’s unclear why Trump would be interested in the issue. 'Trump has clearly defined himself as that president who puts America first, so for him to support any mission, it will have to be clear how it's going to benefit the American people,' Buhari said. 'Until that is properly defined, he might not be interested in having that conversation with the Biafran people.' But Biafra supporter and human rights lawyer Prince Mandela hopes Trump will put pressure on Nigeria’s authorities to address Biafra's concerns, including the release of activist leader Nnamdi Kanu, who's been held by authorities against court orders granting him bail. 'Donald Trump is someone that kicks against the breach of fundamental human rights,' Mandela said. 'So, a man like Donald Trump coming to power might one way or the other … help reduce some of the persecutions.' During his first term, Trump queried then-Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari about violence against Christians in Nigeria — an issue Biafrans often frame as vital to their struggle. Beyond that, Trump seemed to pay little attention to Nigeria or Africa as a whole. Biafran secessionists are hoping that this time around, their issue can make it onto Trump’s agenda.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-return-sparks-renewed-hope-among-nigerian-separatists-/7932619.html	2025-01-10T11:37:43-08:00	
Pakistan struggles to bring trade to China-built port	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan is struggling to attract commercial activity to a Chinese-funded deep-sea port in the southwest that experts say is hampered by local insecurity, a lack of basic services and the absence of plans to make the port prosper. A press release issued Wednesday after a meeting chaired by Pakistani Minister for Planning and Development Ahsan Iqbal indicated that authorities do not have a plan to attract trade to the port, nearly a decade after the first container ships traveled through it in 2016. 'The minister noted the lack of commercial analysis and a comprehensive operational plan for Gwadar Port, calling for immediate efforts to unlock its potential,' the statement said. Iqbal has ordered a plan to be drawn up within six months to generate trade traffic, according to the statement. Constructed in 2007 at a cost of nearly $250 million and operated by the China Overseas Ports Holding Company since 2013, Gwadar port is situated in the warm waters of the Arabian Sea in Pakistan’s Balochistan province. Although built before the 2015 launch of the roughly $60 billion China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, the port is billed as the 'crown jewel' of the energy, infrastructure and investment project launched as part of Beijing’s Belt and Road Initiative. Despite nearly a billion dollars of additional infrastructure development in and around Gwadar city, a report by Pakistan’s Ministry of Maritime Affairs has noted that during the fiscal year 2022-23, Gwadar, the smallest of the country’s three ports, handled less than 1% of Pakistan’s seaborne trade at its three berths. 'All this is symptomatic of absence of long-term planning in Pakistan's governance system,' said Muhammad Faisal, an expert in Pakistan’s foreign policy at the Sydney-based University of Technology. 'From the beginning, Gwadar was more of a ‘geopolitical’ venture than a pure commercial case,' Faisal said in a written statement. In a bid to ramp up shipping activity in Gwadar, Prime Minister Shahbaz Sharif told a cabinet meeting Tuesday that 60% of public sector imports and exports should pass through the port. This came after Sharif ordered at least 50% of public cargo to go through the port in a Cabinet meeting last August. Former Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi told VOA that the port lacks the infrastructure and manpower to handle massive cargo. 'Unless you spend another 3 billion to 4 billion dollars there and make a world-class port, you really can’t call it a port,' Abbasi said, criticizing what he called the Sharif government’s unrealistic approach. According to reports, the Chinese firm operating the Gwadar port plans to build a total of 100 berths by 2045. Pakistan’s largest airport by area, which was built near Gwardar port, also remains largely unused. Aviation website Skyscanner shows three weekly domestic flights to Karachi and one international flight to Oman from the massive new facility. Constructed with a $230 million Chinese grant, the opening of New Gwadar International Airport suffered several delays prior to its soft launch last month. Wednesday’s statement from the planning ministry said Iqbal directed the preparation of marketing templates and packages showcasing Gwadar’s cost-effective trade routes and potential incentives for international businesses. Insecurity, lack of services a hurdle Abbasi, who is also an aviation expert, told VOA that while the new Gwadar airport is a necessary accompaniment to the deep-sea port in the long term, the lack of basic facilities such as water, electricity and security in the city make it an unattractive destination for airlines. 'Airlines have a basic requirement that there must be passengers. No passenger wants to come to Gwadar or leave from Gwadar,' Abbasi said. Balochistan province, home to Gwadar, has been in the throes of a separatist insurgency for two decades, and violence has escalated in recent months. At least six people, mostly security personnel, and eight militants were killed recently as Pakistani forces thwarted an attack on the Gwadar Port Authority complex near the port. The port gives China a shorter route for trade with the Middle East and Central Asia. Despite Pakistan’s failure to market Gwadar port and airport to international businesses, Sydney-based expert Faisal said the project may not become a liability like Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port, which Beijing took control of in 2017 after Colombo failed to pay off debt linked with it. 'Since Pakistan fundamentally viewed Gwadar port in ‘geostrategic’ terms and contrasts it with India's cooperation with Iran in neighboring Chahbahar port, Gwadar will remain useful for Pakistan,' Faisal told VOA. Mustafa Hyder Sayed, executive director of the Islamabad-based Pakistan-China Institute, said the slow pace of business in Gwadar is not a problem for bilateral ties. 'State-to-state relations are deep-rooted in long-term strategic interests and not any [one] event; not any project or single instance can harm any state-to-state relations,' Sayed told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-struggles-to-bring-trade-to-china-built-port/7932597.html	2025-01-10T11:36:23-08:00	
As Maduro takes office, advocates condemn latest journalist arrest in Venezuela	MADRID — As President Nicolas Maduro was inaugurated for a third term Friday, exiled Venezuelan journalists and opposition parties condemned the arrests of a prominent press freedom activist and a well-known opposition figure. Venezuela’s neighbor, Colombia, cited the arrests when it announced that the country’s leader would be skipping Friday’s ceremonies. The Venezuelan government said this week that it had detained seven 'mercenaries,' including two Americans. However, the political party, Popular Will, said authorities have detained up to 19 people. Among those is Carlos Correa, a lawyer, journalist and director of Espacio Publico, a civil association that defends freedom of expression. Witnesses saw hooded figures take the 60-year-old journalist away, his nonprofit said on social media platform X. The government said it has also arrested Enrique Marquez, 61, a politician who ran in the 2024 presidential elections and later backed Edmundo Gonzalez as the victor. Marquez is accused of trying to stage a coup against Maduro, the government said Wednesday. It made no comment about the arrest of Correa. Gonzalez said that masked men had also taken his son-in-law on Tuesday while he was taking his children to school. Journalist arrest condemned The arrest of Correa rocked Venezuela’s media community, many of whom are in exile because of a repressive media environment. 'The journalistic community is shocked that the regime would cross the line of detaining such a prominent human rights advocate,' said documentary maker Juan Ravell. 'Most journalists that have been harassed and persecuted in Venezuela know of Carlos’ work because he is usually the first you go to when something happens,' Ravell told VOA. Ravell, who left Venezuela for the U.S., directed the film A Dangerous Assignment, about a large-scale corruption case in Venezuela which aired on Frontline on PBS. 'Attacks on press freedom in Venezuela have escalated post July 28 [the date of presidential elections] and Carlos’ detention goes a step further in this worrying path. We hope that international pressure persuades the government to release Carlos,' said Ravell. Clavel Rangel, who went into exile in 2020 amid legal threats, said that Correa and Espacio Publico are 'an ally of journalists and press workers who have been subjected to judicial proceedings or who, like him, have been subjected to forced disappearances.' Rangel had been accused of libel after she and a colleague reported on Venezuela’s metal sector. 'As a Venezuelan journalist, I demand his immediate release. Carlos’ team has [helped] journalists with a text message, with the assistance of lawyers, legal advice and hundreds of reports that leave a record of what happens to press workers,' she said. Rangel added, 'Personally, I have much to thank Carlos for: my training as a journalist and as a journalist who has needed legal assistance several times.' The Venezuelan Communications Ministry did not reply to an email from VOA asking for a comment about the arrests. Political turmoil The country’s interior minister confirmed the arrest of Marquez, whom it said had attempted to stage a coup against Maduro, the AFP agency reported. 'Enrique Marquez is part of the coup they wanted to carry out in Venezuela,' Diosdado Cabello said on television, adding that Marquez was 'linked to the FBI gringo' — an unnamed American whom authorities say they have also arrested. The Venezuelan government has repeatedly accused the opposition of plotting with foreign governments to commit acts of sabotage and terrorism. Caracas is investigating major opposition leaders for alleged conspiracy, among other charges, and has repeatedly accused the opposition of inciting violence with its claims of victory in the July election. The opposition published ballot box-level tallies which, it says, show a resounding victory for its candidate Gonzalez. Gonzalez is recognized by several countries, including the U.S., as president-elect. He is currently on a tour to promote the opposition’s cause. The Venezuelan government is offering a $100,000 reward for his capture. Venezuela’s electoral authority and the country’s top court say Maduro won but have not published detailed tallies to verify this claim. In a speech after being sworn in Friday, Maduro claimed to have 'complied with the constitution' and accused external powers of attacking Venezuela. But the contested election and arrests of media freedom campaigners and opposition politicians prompted some foreign leaders to boycott Maduro’s inauguration. President Gustavo Petro of Colombia said on social media that the detentions of Marquez and Correa meant he could not attend Maduro's inauguration. Petro added that he would not break relations with Venezuela, with whom he has sought to increase trade. Panama's Foreign Minister Javier Martinez-Acha described Maduro as a 'tyrant.' The Spanish government said neither Spain nor the EU would send a representative to Caracas for Friday’s ceremony. Jose Manuel Albares, the Spanish foreign minister, told reporters that the EU was coordinating a common position against the Maduro government to guarantee the 'physical integrity, freedom of expression and freedom of demonstration.'

The U.S. on Friday also announced new sanctions on Venezuelans, including the president of the state-owned oil company and military and police officials who the Treasury Department said played 'roles in carrying [out] Maduro’s repression and human rights abuses.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-maduro-takes-office-advocates-condemn-latest-journalist-arrest-in-venezuela-/7932596.html	2025-01-10T11:20:32-08:00	
Pakistan court temporarily blocks deportation of Afghan musicians, singers	ISLAMABAD — A high court in Pakistan prohibited authorities Friday from forcibly deporting Afghan musicians and singers until their asylum cases are resolved within the next two months. The ruling comes amid a crackdown on hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighboring Afghanistan who either lack legal permits to reside in the country or have overstayed their visas. They sought refuge in Pakistan after Taliban insurgents swept back to power in Kabul in 2021, placing sweeping curbs on civil liberties and banning music in line with their strict interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia. However, a group of 150 Afghan performers initiated a legal challenge against their deportation in the northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, arguing they are at risk of persecution if they return home. 'The federal government … shall decide cases of all these petitioners for grant or refusal of asylum within a period of two months,' the Pakistan court stated Friday. 'Until the final decision, these petitioners shall not be ousted from [the] territory of Pakistan nor otherwise compelled to leave Pakistan and return to their native country Afghanistan,' the ruling read. The court mandated that the Pakistan Interior Ministry permit petitioners to remain in the country if the government cannot resolve their cases within 60 days and requires additional time for a definitive decision. Attorney Mumtaz Ahmed told The Associated Press that Friday’s ruling was the first of its kind and a significant relief for his clients, who have lived in fear and uncertainty for months. Pakistan unleashed a nationwide crackdown on foreign migrants living in the country illegally in 2023. The move primarily affected Afghan refugees, forcing more than 800,000 of them to return to their impoverished country, which is struggling to recover from years of devastating war and natural disasters since the Taliban takeover. Refugee families have been reluctant to leave Pakistan, citing the Taliban’s ban on Afghan girls’ education beyond the sixth grade and restrictions on women’s access to workplaces except for a few departments, including health, immigration and police. People at risk of deportation include Afghan nationals who are awaiting responses from the United States and European nations regarding their asylum applications. Many refugees served as translators and guides for U.S.-led international forces during their two-decade presence in Afghanistan, which ended in August 2021. The United Nations and aid organizations have criticized Pakistan’s crackdown on Afghan nationals from the outset, citing dire economic conditions and a prolonged humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan. Pakistan hosts over 1 million legal Afghan refugees who fled their country due to the Soviet occupation in the 1980s, the subsequent civil war and the rule of the Islamist Taliban from 1996 to 2001. The Pakistani government has permitted those refugees to remain until June 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-court-temporarily-blocks-deportation-of-afghan-musicians-singers/7932539.html	2025-01-10T10:58:33-08:00	
Donald Trump sentenced without penalties in New York court	A New York judge Friday sentenced President-elect Donald Trump to an 'unconditional discharge' over 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.

Preventive action can’t avert wildfires but can save lives, meteorologists say	GENEVA — The World Meteorlogical Organization says that preventive action cannot avert natural disasters such as the wildfires raging across Los Angeles, but that it can help save lives and mitigate loss of property. 'Land management and prevention, regular clearing of underbrush play a key role in fire management, and evacuation plans are important in saving lives,' the WMO said Friday. 'These are all part of effective early warning systems.' In a briefing to journalists in Geneva, Claire Nullis, a WMO spokesperson, stressed the importance of preparing adequate evacuation plans and early warning systems to prevent some of the worst impacts from a natural disaster. While acknowledging the staggering losses from the devastating wildfires sweeping across parts of Los Angeles in the United States this week, she said 'The early warnings have, in this instance, been very, very good. 'You know, people have been evacuated. It has been impossible to save houses, and the loss of life is still too high, but it has been kept to a relative minimum,' she said. Media reports say at least 10 people have been killed in this week's Southern California wildfires, although more bodies are expected to be found once the fires have been contained and searchers can go through the debris. More than 10,000 structures reportedly have burned, and 180,000 people are under evacuation orders. While California is no stranger to wildfires, the WMO calls this catastrophic event 'extraordinary' in that it is affecting one of the largest cities in the United States. The WMO said that last year’s rainy season for the Los Angeles area as a whole was slightly above normal, but so far, this year it has been dry. 'The big compounding factor in this context is the winds. … They cause temperatures to rise, and they cause very low humidity, drying out the ground and vegetation,' Nullis said. The WMO said destructive wildfires have been made worse by climate change. 'Climate change, including increased heat, extended drought and a thirsty atmosphere, has been a key driver in increasing the risk and extent of wildfires in the western United States during the last decades,' it said, citing data from the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The WMO said wildfires require the alignment of a number of factors, including temperature, humidity and the lack of moisture in fuels such as trees, shrubs, grasses and forest debris. 'All these factors have strong direct or indirect ties to climate variability and climate change,' it said. 'Obviously, not every single weather-related disaster is due to climate change,' WMO spokesperson Nullis said. 'Nobody would say that. But we get quite clear signals that climate change is exacerbating some of these disasters.' In addition to the loss of life and destruction of homes and other infrastructure that could total billions of dollars in insured losses, the World Health Organization warns that wildfires can have a significant impact on human morbidity and mortality. 'Wildfire smoke, which is a mixture of air pollutants, of which particulate matter is of major concern as it can be full of PM 2.5. This is a very small particulate matter that gets right down into the lungs, and there certainly is a lot of it.' said Dr. Margaret Harris, a WHO spokesperson. 'A lot of it is associated with premature death in the general population,' she said. 'It can cause and exacerbate diseases of lung, heart, brain, the nervous system' and other illnesses. 'It has been shown to lead to cognitive impairment and actually damage your intellectual capacity and lead to memory loss,' she said, adding that firefighters and emergency response workers 'are most at risk from exposure to smoke.' The WHO estimates 4.2 million deaths globally are linked to ambient or outdoor air pollution, with 99% of the global population exposed to air pollution levels that exceed the WHO guideline level for fine particulate matter (PM 2.5). Harris said more research is needed to understand the long-term health effects of wildfire exposure on vulnerable populations, particularly children, older people, pregnant women and the chronically ill. 'We expect that we will see this over and over again if we do not get what we are doing to the planet under control,' she said. Meanwhile, the World Meteorological Organization has officially confirmed that 2024 was the hottest year on record, 'with a global mean temperature of more than 1.5 degrees above the 1850-1900 average.' 'We have just endured the hottest decade on record, with 2024 topping the list,' U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said, noting that 'blazing temperatures in 2024 require trailblazing climate action in 2025.' 'There is still time to avoid the worst of climate catastrophe. But leaders must act now,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/preventive-action-can-t-avert-wildfires-but-can-save-lives-meteorologists-say/7932476.html	2025-01-10T10:29:47-08:00	
US slaps new sanctions on Venezuelan officials as Maduro inaugurated	WASHINGTON/HOUSTON, TEXAS — The United States imposed sanctions Friday on eight Venezuelan officials and increased to $25 million the reward it is offering for the arrest of President Nicolas Maduro. The actions came on the day of Maduro’s inauguration to a third term following a disputed election last year. It was the latest in a series of punitive steps by the outgoing Biden administration against Maduro's government in the aftermath of the July vote, which both his ruling Socialist party and the OPEC nation's opposition claim to have won. The new officials sanctioned include the recently appointed head of Venezuela's state oil company PDVSA, Hector Obregon, and Venezuela's transportation minister, Ramon Velasquez. The U.S. move coincided with sanctions announced by Britain and the European Union. Maduro and his aides have always rejected sanctions by the U.S. and others, saying they are illegitimate measures that amount to an 'economic war' designed to cripple Venezuela. He and his allies have cheered what they say is the country’s resilience despite the measures, although they have historically blamed some economic hardships and shortages on sanctions. The country's electoral authority and top court claim Maduro, whose time in office has been marked by a deep economic and social crisis, won last year's presidential vote, although they have not published detailed tallies. The government, which has accused the opposition of fomenting fascist plots against it, said it will arrest opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez should he return to the country from exile and has detained prominent opposition members and activists in the lead-up to the inauguration. The opposition says Gonzalez, 75, won in a landslide. It has published its own vote tallies as evidence, winning support from governments around the world, including the United States, who consider Gonzalez the president-elect. International election observers have said the vote was unfair. Maduro, 62, has been in power since 2013, and the new sanctions come little more than a week before U.S. President Joe Biden will end his term and be succeeded by Donald Trump on Jan. 20. In addition to the sanctions, the U.S. government increased to $25 million the reward it is offering for information leading to the arrest and conviction of Maduro, who has long faced U.S. drug trafficking charges. The reward was $15 million. Maduro has held onto power despite heavy pressure from successive U.S. administrations, retaining the support of Venezuela's military as well as China, Russia and Iran. The new measures had been in the works before the brief detention Thursday of opposition leader Maria Corina Machado following an anti-government march in Caracas, her first public appearance after months out of the public eye.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-slaps-new-sanctions-on-venezuelan-officials-as-maduro-inaugurated/7932377.html	2025-01-10T09:13:57-08:00	
Biden levies new sanctions against Russian energy sector, but it's up to Trump whether to keep them	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden's administration announced Friday it's expanding sanctions against Russia's critically important energy sector, unveiling a new effort to inflict pain on Moscow for its nearly 3-year-old war in Ukraine as President-elect Donald Trump gets set to return to office vowing to quickly end the conflict. The outgoing Democratic administration billed the new sanctions as the most significant to date against Moscow's oil and liquefied natural gas sectors, the driver of Russia's economy. Officials said the sanctions, which punish entities that do business with the Russians, have the potential to cost the Russian economy upward of billions of dollars per month. More than 180 oil-carrying vessels that are suspected to be part of a shadow fleet utilized by the Kremlin to evade oil sanctions as well as traders, oil field service firms and Russian energy officials are also targeted by the new sanctions. Several of the vessels targeted are also suspected of shipping sanctioned Iranian oil, according to the Treasury Department. British officials are also announcing complementary sanctions against Russia's energy sector Friday. Both countries are targeting two of Russia's major oil producers, Gazprom Neft and Surgutneftegas, and dozens of the companies' subsidiaries. 'The United States is taking sweeping action against Russia's key source of revenue for funding its brutal and illegal war against Ukraine,' Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a statement. 'With today's actions, we are ratcheting up the sanctions risk associated with Russia's oil trade, including shipping and financial facilitation in support of Russia's oil exports.' Biden administration officials said that it will ultimately be up to Trump's administration whether to keep or scrap the new sanctions. Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the sanctions. But Trump told reporters on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin 'wants to meet, and we are setting it up.' Trump's warm relationship with Putin over the years has come under heavy scrutiny. The Republican president-elect has also balked at the cost of aid to Kyiv, pledging to move quickly to end the conflict upon his return to office on Jan. 20. Trump added a new layer of doubt about future American support earlier this week when he appeared to sympathize with Putin's position that Ukraine should not be part of NATO. The president-elect has criticized the Biden administration for expressing support for Kyiv's eventual membership in the transatlantic military alliance. The Kremlin on Friday dismissed the new sanctions ahead of the anticipated announcement. 'We are aware that the administration will try to leave as difficult a legacy in bilateral relations as possible for Trump and his team,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. The designation comes under a sanctions authority approved during Russia's 2014 invasion and annexation of Ukraine's Crimea peninsula, according to administration officials who briefed reporters on the condition of anonymity under ground rules set by the White House. Should the Trump administration move to roll back the sanctions, it would have to first notify Congress, which would have the ability to take a vote of disapproval of such a move, the officials added. The Biden administration unveiled a new $500 million military aid package on Thursday as Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy met with U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Zelenskyy had been scheduled to meet with Biden in Italy on Friday, but Biden scrapped his plans to travel overseas so he could remain in Washington to help oversee the federal response to the wildfires ravaging Los Angeles. Trump earlier this week expressed concern at the loss of life during the conflict, while arguing that 'this war would never have happened' if he were president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-levies-new-sanctions-against-russian-energy-sector-but-it-s-up-to-trump-whether-to-keep-them-/7932364.html	2025-01-10T08:52:28-08:00	
Jimmy Carter’s post-presidential legacy	James Earl Carter Jr. served a single term as the 39th president of the United States, but despite his short tenure, he had the most extensive post-presidential career in U.S. history, lasting from 1981 until his death in 2024. Carter was a peanut farmer before his presidency and placed the family farm in a blind trust when he took office. But it was heavily in debt when he returned, so Carter generated income through writing. He published more than 30 books from memoirs and nonfiction to children’s books and historical novels. The first major achievement of Carter’s post-presidential career was the 1982 founding of The Carter Center, a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting human rights. The center would go on to operate a broad range of initiatives worldwide, often working with the United Nations. One of its most prominent roles has been election monitoring, having observed and produced reports on elections in 40 countries as a neutral organization unaffiliated with the U.S. government. The Carter Center would also become known for its public health and agricultural assistance programs. Among these are ongoing efforts to combat river blindness and trachoma in developing nations by distributing medication and building toilet facilities. A major accomplishment has been the near-eradication of Guinea worm disease in Africa — the first such eradication achieved without any pharmaceuticals. Carter himself continued to travel extensively to promote diplomatic efforts, both as a private citizen and as an unofficial negotiator for the United States. During the Ronald Reagan administration, he traveled to the Middle East to support the continuation of the Camp David Accords that his administration had brokered between Egypt and Israel, and he met with Israeli and Palestinian leaders to advance the peace process. Carter helped to secure a temporary ceasefire during the Yugoslav Wars, and in 1994, went to North Korea at the request of President Bill Clinton to negotiate a treaty governing nuclear non-proliferation. He would later return to North Korea in 2010 to secure the release of Aijalon Gomes, an American citizen who had illegally crossed into the country. Along with his wife, Rosalynn, Carter was also known for his work with Habitat for Humanity, an international charity dedicated to building affordable housing for low-income families around the world. After first volunteering for the organization in 1984, the Carters launched an annual work project where they would personally participate alongside volunteers on a particular building site. Carter served on the organization’s board from 1984 to 1987. Carter’s work in human rights and social justice has been widely praised and earned him the 1998 United Nations Prize in the Field of Human Rights, as well the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize, making him the third U.S. president to receive the honor. However, Carter has also been criticized for alleged anti-Israel bias in his statements and writings on the Middle East, and for labeling Israel’s treatment of Palestinians as apartheid in his bestselling yet controversial 2006 book on the subject. Carter was the longest-lived U.S. president, remaining active well into his 90s until his eventual death at 100. While his four-year presidency has often been considered a mediocre one by historians, his post-presidency set a standard that will be difficult to surpass.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-s-post-presidential-legacy-/7932304.html	2025-01-10T08:41:42-08:00	
How Yoon's martial law bid complicates US-South Korea ties	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — In late 2021, the wife of then-presidential candidate Yoon Suk Yeol appeared exasperated by several journalists she insisted were treating her husband unfairly. In a leaked phone call with a left-leaning reporter, Kim Keon-hee vowed to have 'all of them' jailed if her husband won the presidency. The comment drew little attention, overshadowed by the scandals and mudslinging typical of South Korea’s elections. In hindsight, analysts say it hinted at how Yoon, now impeached and under investigation over his short-lived declaration of martial law, would later approach his critics as president. After taking office in May 2022, Yoon pursued criminal defamation charges against journalists at an unprecedented pace, according to a VOA investigation. As his political fortunes declined, Yoon adopted increasingly adversarial rhetoric, often framing his opponents as existential threats in a zero-sum battle against 'communists' and 'anti-state forces.' In declaring martial law early last month, Yoon used similar language, citing the need to 'eradicate pro-North Korean forces.' He later defended the move as a temporary measure to warn his opposition rivals, whom he accused of obstructing governance. Critics, however, viewed the declaration as an authoritarian overreach. The martial law decree, South Korea’s first since it emerged from military rule in the 1980s, put the Biden administration in an awkward position, having touted Yoon’s South Korea as a democratic model. In 2024, Yoon hosted the U.S.-led Summit for Democracy, an event aimed at countering global authoritarianism. Weeks later, he made headlines by singing 'American Pie' at a White House state dinner alongside President Joe Biden — a moment highlighting the administration’s embrace of Yoon as a key ally. Part of that support stemmed from Yoon’s efforts to reconcile with Japan, which reinvigorated trilateral cooperation with the United States. The partnership became so central to Biden’s Asia policy that Washington seemed unwilling to confront mounting concerns about Yoon’s leadership, according to some analysts. 'The senior Biden team was so over-invested in Yoon as the key to its signature trilateral initiative with Tokyo and Seoul that it seemingly ignored all the many warning signs over the last year-plus of Yoon’s authoritarian bent,' said Rob Rapson, a recently retired U.S. diplomat who held several senior positions in South Korea, including acting ambassador. During a visit to Seoul this week, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken sidestepped questions about Yoon, instead praising South Korea’s democratic resilience. Blinken acknowledged 'serious concerns' about Yoon’s actions, saying they were conveyed directly to Seoul. Alliance frictions After Yoon’s martial law decree, the United States temporarily paused key diplomatic and security talks with South Korea. Even though those engagements resumed by late December, some analysts say it may be premature to declare business as usual. One sensitive issue is the U.S. claim that it was not notified in advance about the martial law declaration — a move that could have impacted the approximately 28,000 U.S. troops in Korea and heightened risks for both countries. If no requirement exists for such notification, that may need to change, said Sheena Chestnut Greitens, an East Asia expert at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 'The U.S. has reasonable grounds to say that having that information in advance is necessary for effective deterrence and defense on the Korean Peninsula,' she said. Chestnut Greitens also warned that Yoon’s unilateral actions could weaken South Korea’s position with the incoming Trump administration, whose first-term policies raised fears of abandonment in Seoul. Donald Trump frequently questioned the value of the U.S.-South Korea alliance, once asking why the U.S. needs 'all those troops' in South Korea. His direct talks with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un further alarmed some South Korean officials, who feared being sidelined in any Trump-Kim deal. 'The incoming Trump team… could now cite this lack of consultation as precedent if it chooses to justify either a unilateral deal with Pyongyang or a reduction in U.S. commitment,' said Chestnut Greitens. Trump silent Trump, whose America First policy often prioritized perceived interests over the promotion of human rights, has not commented on Yoon’s martial law declaration. His approach toward South Korea is unlikely to change, suggested Alex Gray, a senior fellow at the American Foreign Policy Council and former chief of staff at the National Security Council under Trump. 'I think [President Trump] will prioritize his conception of core American security and economic interests as he did in term one,' said Gray. It is unclear how Trump will respond to Yoon’s conservative supporters, some of whom have appealed to him by waving 'Stop the Steal' protest signs reminiscent of Trump’s post-2020 election fraud claims. If Trump were to back Yoon or endorse baseless South Korean election fraud allegations, it could 'seriously damage the image of the U.S. among a majority of the Korean population,' said Ben Engel, who teaches at Dankook University outside Seoul. 'The idea that the ROK [Republic of Korea]-U.S. alliance was undergirded by the shared values of democracy and human rights would be significantly undermined and possibly lead to the alliance becoming a partisan issue in South Korea, where the alliance has had broad support since the early 2000s,' said Engel. Still, Trump may see little reason to support Yoon, who faces possible removal from office and insurrection charges. 'Why hitch yourself to a sinking ship?' Engel asked. South Korea’s reaction There has been little backlash to the U.S. response, even from liberal South Koreans who have at times been more critical of Washington. Moon Chung-in, a foreign policy adviser to several left-leaning Korean administrations, noted that Biden officials have quietly opposed Yoon’s martial law declaration. 'If Washington maintains its current approach, it can demonstrate that for the U.S., democracy matters,' Moon told VOA, though he acknowledged the United States had a 'bad track record' of backing authoritarian regimes before South Korea’s democratization. While Trump is unlikely to prioritize human rights in South Korea, Moon said he believes the incoming president would not overrule figures in his administration, such as Secretary of State nominee Marco Rubio, who take a more values-driven approach to international relations. Regardless, some experts argue that such U.S. messaging no longer resonates in South Korea. Lee Sang-sin, a research fellow at the Korea Institute for National Unification, suggested this may reflect declining perceptions of U.S. democracy. 'It may be that people have moved past the old anxiety that South Korea’s democracy cannot survive without U.S. support,' he said. 'The lingering shock of domestic turmoil,' Lee added, 'has also left people too preoccupied to focus on U.S. messaging.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-yoon-s-martial-law-bid-complicates-us-south-korea-ties/7932206.html	2025-01-10T07:56:53-08:00	
US added 256,000 jobs in December; unemployment rate dips to 4.1%	WASHINGTON — U.S. hiring picked up unexpectedly in December as employers added a strong 256,000 jobs, another sign of the economy's resilience in the face of high interest rates. Job growth rose 212,000 last month from November, the Labor Department reported Friday. For all of 2024, the economy added 2.2 million jobs, a solid number but down from 3 million in 2023, 4.5 million in 2022 and a record 6.4 million in 2021 as the economy bounded back from massive pandemic layoffs. The monthly numbers beat forecasters' expectations of around 155,000 new jobs and 4.2% unemployment. Health care companies added 46,000 jobs, retailers 43,000 and government agencies at the federal, state and local 33,000. But manufacturers cut 13,000 jobs. Labor Department revisions shaved 8,000 jobs from October and November payrolls. Average hourly wages rose 0.3% from November and 3.9% from a year earlier. The year-over-year wage gain was slightly less than economists had forecast. Stocks fell Friday morning on the expectations that the strong jobs report will make the Federal Reserve less likely to cut interest rates. The economy doesn't seem to need help. 'It seems pretty certain that the pace of Fed rate cuts is now going to slow down,' said Brian Coulton, chief economist at Fitch Ratings. Getting a clear view of the U.S. job market hasn't been easy over the past few months. Hurricanes and a big strike at Boeing threw off the October jobs numbers, pushing them down and setting up a payback rebound in November that likely exaggerated the strength of hiring. Thomas Simons, chief U.S. economist at Jefferies, said that seasonal adjustments around the holidays may have affected the December numbers, but he added that nonetheless 'it is hard to say anything negative about the details of this report.'' Over the past few years, the economy and the job market have shown surprising resilience. Responding to inflation that hit a four-decade high two and a half years ago, the Fed raised its benchmark interest rate — the fed funds rate — 11 times in 2022 and 2023, taking it to the highest level in more than two decades. The higher borrowing costs were widely expected to cause a recession but didn't. Companies kept hiring, consumers kept spending, and the economy kept rolling along. In fact, U.S. gross domestic product — the nation's output of goods and services — has expanded at a robust annual pace of 3% or more in four of the last five quarters. Layoffs are running below the pre-pandemic trend. On Thursday, the Labor Department reported that 211,000 people applied for unemployment benefits last week, the fewest in nearly a year. Inflation has come down, too, from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.7% in November. The drop in year-over-year price increases gave the Fed enough confidence to cut rates three times in the last four months of 2024. But Fed officials signaled at their December meeting that they planned to be more cautious about rate cuts this year. They now project just two rate reductions in 2025, down from the four they envisioned back in September. Progress against inflation has stalled in recent months, and it remains stuck above the Fed's 2% target.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-added-256-000-jobs-in-december-unemployment-rate-dips-to-4-1-/7932263.html	2025-01-10T07:54:29-08:00	
Report says Ethiopia forces military recruitment, including minors	A 29-year-old day laborer in Shashemene, a city in Ethiopia’s Oromia region, was walking home from dinner with two friends one night in November when he heard a commotion. On the side of the road, perhaps 400 meters away, four men dressed in the uniforms of a local militia were shoving two young people into a police car. The militiamen called out to the man and his friends. They didn’t wait to hear what came next. They turned and ran in the opposite direction. Two militiamen chased them on foot for a short distance before giving up. The laborer, who asked to remain anonymous for reasons of personal safety, said news of Oromia government security forces and allied militias grabbing young people off the street for enlistment was all over town. He didn’t want to cross the so-called recruiters — or get pressed into military service himself. 'We were aware that some people were taken,' the man recently told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service. 'So, when the militias called us, we didn’t stop. We ran, and I stayed overnight [with] my friends.' As young as 11 years old The incident reflects a worrisome reality in Oromia, where boys in their early teenage years are being forcibly recruited into military service to fight alongside Ethiopian federal government forces against rebel groups in the Amhara and Oromia regions, according to a recent report by the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, or EHRC. In one alarming case, the commission said it saw an 11-year-old boy who was detained for possible recruitment and being held at a Shashemen city detention center. The state-affiliated body released a statement on Dec. 4, 2024, denouncing the arbitrary detention of children by Oromia security forces allied with the federal government. The EHRC, which is mandated to monitor human rights conditions in the country, found that teenagers are being illegally detained and pressured to join the National Defense Force. The commission said that during its monitoring and investigation in Shashemene, it saw numerous children under 18 sent to detention halls under the pretense of 'military training.' Of 32 youths being held at a detention center in the Halelu district to whom the commission talked, nearly half were either 15 or 16 years old. That’s where investigators also found the 11-year-old, the commission said. Rebellions in two regions Following a two-year rebellion in the Tigray region that ended in 2021, Ethiopia’s federal government army is now battling rebellions in the Amhara and Oromia regions. The fighting in Amhara has been going on since 2023 when ethnic Amhara militias known as Fano refused a proposed government plan to disarm. The conflict in the Oromia region started in 2019 after rebels who returned from Eritrea took up arms, alleging marginalization of the ethnic Oromo. Acting EHRC chief Rakeb Messele told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service that security forces are listening to the commission’s objections about the forced recruitment program — although the so-called 'recruitment' has yet to stop. 'The Oromia region’s security forces told us they are visiting the detention centers and releasing those who are unwilling to join and those children under the age of 18,' she said. 'Similarly, the Ethiopian National Defense Force is getting them released from the centers.' Messele said the EHRC chose to label the situation as 'arbitrary detention' rather than 'forced military recruitment.' She told VOA it chose to refer to the practice that way because the government is taking necessary correction measures. Nearly $200 to join the army The EHRC report reveals the plight of families caught in the crossfire. 'The Oromia region's administration and members of the security forces forcibly arrested many people, including children, to ‘join the defense army’ outside of the recruitment criteria specified by the Ministry of Defense,' the report states in Amharic. One farmer from Kelem Wolega city, who requested anonymity for his safety, told VOA that two of his younger brothers are among those forcibly recruited. 'We are residents of Kelem Wolega Zone, Gidame District. Two of my brothers have been arrested,' he said. 'More than 130 people have been taken from our kebele [administrative unit].' A 15-year-old boy told the commission: 'When we came back from school, an individual took us into a Bajaj [auto rickshaw], saying that he will give 25,000 Birr [equivalent to $198] to those who join the defense force. [They] then took us to an auditorium. ... But after we entered, we could not leave.' Some parents say they were forced to pay for the return of their sons. 'In some areas of the region, they forced their families to pay large sums of money to release those arrested,' said the EHRC report. 'In some areas where EHRC conducted surveillance and investigation, in cooperation with the regional leaders, it has succeeded in freeing many people, including children and the mentally ill, who were arrested,' the report said. 'Recruiting children ... is prohibited' Kumlachew Dagne, board director of InterAfrica Group, an independent nonprofit organization working on promoting peace and security in the Horn of Africa, told VOA that although Ethiopia is not a signatory of the international war crime law, the recruitment activities are unlawful. Kumlachew said United Nations protocols 'clearly state that during civil war, recruiting children for military purpose is prohibited.' This violation, Kumlachew said, represents a blatant disregard for the rights of children and undermines efforts to protect vulnerable populations in conflict zones. He called on the Ethiopian government to take immediate action to address the issue and uphold international conventions on arbitrary detention and child rights violations. Ethiopia’s Ministry of Communications and Ministry of Defense have not responded to VOA requests for comment.

Trump will be sentenced in hush money case, days before his inauguration	New York — In a singular moment in U.S. history, President-elect Donald Trump faces sentencing Friday for his New York hush money conviction after the nation's highest court refused to intervene. Like so much else in the criminal case and the current American political landscape, the scenario set to unfold in an austere Manhattan courtroom was unimaginable only a few years ago. A state judge is to say what consequences, if any, the country's former and soon-to-be leader will face for felonies that a jury found he committed. With Trump 10 days from inauguration, Judge Juan M. Merchan has indicated he plans a no-penalty sentence called an unconditional discharge, and prosecutors aren't opposing it. That would mean no jail time, no probation and no fines would be imposed, but nothing is final until Friday's proceeding is done. Regardless of the outcome, Trump, a Republican, will become the first person convicted of a felony to assume the presidency. Trump, who is expected to appear by video from his Mar-a-Lago club in Palm Beach, Florida, will have the opportunity to speak. He has pilloried the case, the only one of his four criminal indictments that has gone to trial and possibly the only one that ever will. The judge has indicated that he plans the unconditional discharge — a rarity in felony convictions — partly to avoid complicated constitutional issues that would arise if he imposed a penalty that overlapped with Trump's presidency. The hush money case accused Trump of fudging his business' records to veil a $130,000 payoff to porn actor Stormy Daniels. She was paid, late in Trump's 2016 campaign, not to tell the public about a sexual encounter she maintains the two had a decade earlier. He says nothing sexual happened between them, and he contends that his political adversaries spun up a bogus prosecution to try to damage him. 'I never falsified business records. It is a fake, made up charge,' the Republican president-elect wrote on his Truth Social platform last week. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, whose office brought the charges, is a Democrat. Bragg's office said in a court filing Monday that Trump committed 'serious offenses that caused extensive harm to the sanctity of the electoral process and to the integrity of New York's financial marketplace.' While the specific charges were about checks and ledgers, the underlying accusations were seamy and deeply entangled with Trump's political rise. Prosecutors said Daniels was paid off — through Trump's personal attorney at the time, Michael Cohen — as part of a wider effort to keep voters from hearing about Trump's alleged extramarital escapades. Trump denies the alleged encounters occurred. His lawyers said he wanted to squelch the stories to protect his family, not his campaign. And while prosecutors said Cohen's reimbursements for paying Daniels were deceptively logged as legal expenses, Trump says that's simply what they were. 'There was nothing else it could have been called,' he wrote on Truth Social last week, adding, 'I was hiding nothing.' Trump's lawyers tried unsuccessfully to forestall a trial. Since his May conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records, they have pulled virtually every legal lever within reach to try to get the conviction overturned, the case dismissed or at least the sentencing postponed. They have made various arguments to Merchan, New York appeals judges, and federal courts including the Supreme Court. The Trump attorneys have leaned heavily into assertions of presidential immunity from prosecution, and they got a boost in July from a Supreme Court decision that affords former commanders-in-chief considerable immunity. Trump was a private citizen and presidential candidate when Daniels was paid in 2016. He was president when the reimbursements to Cohen were made and recorded the following year. On one hand, Trump's defense argued that immunity should have kept jurors from hearing some evidence, such as testimony about some of his conversations with then-White House communications director Hope Hicks. And after Trump won this past November's election, his lawyers argued that the case had to be scrapped to avoid impinging on his upcoming presidency and his transition to the Oval Office. Merchan, a Democrat, repeatedly postponed the sentencing, initially set for July. But last week, he set Friday's date, citing a need for 'finality.' He wrote that he strove to balance Trump's need to govern, the Supreme Court's immunity ruling, the respect due a jury verdict and the public's expectation that 'no one is above the law.' Trump's lawyers then launched a flurry of last-minute efforts to block the sentencing. Their last hope vanished Thursday night with a 5-4 Supreme Court ruling that declined to delay the sentencing. Meanwhile, the other criminal cases that once loomed over Trump have ended or stalled ahead of trial. After Trump's election, special counsel Jack Smith closed out the federal prosecutions over Trump's handling of classified documents and his efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Democrat Joe Biden. A state-level Georgia election interference case is locked in uncertainty after prosecutor Fani Willis was removed from it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-will-be-sentenced-in-hush-money-case-days-before-his-inauguration-/7932099.html	2025-01-10T05:37:30-08:00	
UK Treasury chief heading to China to revive suspended economic, financial talks	London — Britain's Treasury chief is travelling to China this weekend to discuss economic and financial cooperation between the countries, as the U.K.'s Labour government seeks to reset strained ties with Beijing. The Treasury said Friday that Rachel Reeves will travel to Beijing and Shanghai and will meet with her Chinese government counterpart, Vice Premier He Lifeng. Reeves' trip is expected to revive the China-U.K. Economic and Financial Dialogue — annual bilateral talks that have been suspended since 2019 due to the COVID-19 pandemic and deteriorating relations in recent years. A series of spying allegations from both sides, China's support for Russia in the Ukraine war and a crackdown on civil liberties in Hong Kong, a former British colony, have soured ties. Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey and the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority's chief executive, Nikhil Rathi, are also in the delegation, according to the Treasury. Representatives from some of Britain's biggest financial services firms will join the trip. Officials did not provide details, but media reports have said senior executives from HSBC Holdings and Standard Chartered were included. Reeves' visit comes after Foreign Secretary David Lammy travelled to China in October and Prime Minister Keir Starmer met with Chinese President Xi Jinping on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil in November. The meetings form part of a bid by Starmer, who was elected as leader in July, to strengthen political and economic ties with China, the U.K.'s fifth-largest trading partner. Officials said Starmer wanted a 'pragmatic' approach to working with Beijing on global stability, climate change and the transition to clean energy. But some in the opposition Conservative Party have criticized his stance and said trade ties should not come at the expense of national security and human rights concerns. British political leaders and intelligence chiefs have warned repeatedly of the security threats that China poses. Calls to tackle the challenge grew louder last month when it emerged that an alleged Chinese spy had cultivated close ties with Prince Andrew and carried out 'covert and deceptive activity' for China's ruling Communist Party, according to officials. Nevertheless, Lammy told reporters in London on Thursday that 'there are many areas of trade that don't impact on national security.' He said Reeves 'will repeat many of the messages that I took to China.' 'What we've said is in this complex relationship with a global superpower, we are guided by three Cs': challenge, compete and cooperate, for example in areas including health and climate challenges, Lammy added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-treasury-chief-heading-to-china-to-revive-suspended-economic-and-financial-talks-/7932014.html	2025-01-10T04:26:35-08:00

Israeli military confirms identity of Israeli hostage killed in Gaza	JERUSALEM — Israel confirmed that a hostage found killed in Gaza was Hamza Ziyadne, the son of another hostage, Youssef Ziyadne, found dead alongside him in an underground tunnel near the southern city of Rafah. The family of Hamza, an Israeli Bedouin taken hostage by Hamas-led fighters alongside his father, had been notified of his death following the conclusion of forensic tests, the Israeli military said Friday. Earlier this week, it said the bodies of both hostages had been recovered close to those of armed guards from Islamist group Hamas or another Palestinian militant group, adding their deaths did not appear to have been recent and it was not yet clear how they had been killed. There was no immediate comment from Hamas. The recovery of their bodies comes amid renewed efforts by mediators Qatar, the U.S. and Egypt to reach a deal to halt fighting in Gaza and free the remaining Israeli hostages before President-elect Donald Trump takes office on Jan. 20. The Hostages and Missing Family Forum, the organization representing most of the families, renewed its call on the Israeli government to conclude a deal with Hamas and bring back the hostages, saying Youssef and Hamza could have been saved through an earlier agreement. The negotiations have been at an impasse for a year over two key issues. Hamas has said it will only free its remaining hostages if Israel agrees to end the war and withdraw all its troops from Gaza. Israel says it will not end the war until Hamas is dismantled and all hostages are free. Israel launched its assault on Gaza after Hamas fighters stormed across its border 15 months ago, killing 1,200 people and taking more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Since then, more than 46,000 people have been killed in Gaza, according to Palestinian health officials, with much of the enclave laid waste and most of the territory's people - displaced multiple times - facing acute shortages of food and medicine due to Israel's actions, humanitarian agencies say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-military-confirms-identity-of-israeli-hostage-killed-in-gaza/7931941.html	2025-01-10T02:08:30-08:00	
Russia attacks Ukraine with 72 drones overnight, Kyiv says	KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine's air force said on Friday on Russia attacked it with 72 drones overnight though it downed 33 of them while 34 others disappeared from radar without reaching their targets. Five drones struck various buildings in the northern region of Chernihiv, wounding one person, the air force said. One downed drone fell on a building in the capital Kyiv but did not cause casualties. Video footage filmed by Reuters carried the sound of an explosion and showed a fire burning in the distance in Kyiv during the overnight attack. More footage after daybreak showed the charred corner of a high-rise apartment block in Kyiv with windows blown out and a line of cars parked below suffering damage. Massed Russian aerial attacks using long-range drones have been a near-daily occurrence over Ukraine in the past several months, as Moscow looks to exhaust Kyiv's air defenses almost three years into its full-scale war against its neighbor. Meanwhile, Ukraine's army struck a supermarket on Friday in the Russian-held city of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine in an attack that used U.S.-supplied missiles and wounded two people, a senior Russian-backed official said. There was no immediate comment from Ukraine and Reuters could not immediately confirm the report. Unverified photos posted on social media showed a burnt out car in front of a shattered two-story circular building surrounded by debris. Dashcam footage posted by a driver nearby appeared to show the moment the supermarket -- called Moloko (Milk) -- was struck, with an ensuing large explosion and flames soaring into the sky. Reuters was able to confirm the location from a nearby building's facades, signages and road layout that matched satellite imagery and street view imagery. The date was verified by a timestamp on the footage. Denis Pushilin, a senior Russian-backed official, accused the Ukrainian army of firing U.S.-supplied HIMARS missiles into the area during the morning rush hour. Russia's TASS state news agency said other buildings and around 15 cars had been damaged in the same attack. Pushilin said in a statement on his official Telegram account that an apartment building in the city of Svitlodarsk in the Donetsk region had also been struck by Ukrainian forces, killing one woman and wounding four others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-attacks-ukraine-with-72-drones-overnight-kyiv-says/7931934.html	2025-01-10T01:24:49-08:00	
Tanker hit by Houthi rebels that threatened a Red Sea oil spill has been salvaged	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — An oil tanker that burned for weeks in the Red Sea after being attacked by Yemen's Houthi rebels and threatening a massive oil spill has been salvaged, a security firm said Friday. The Sounion had been a disaster-in-waiting in the waterway, with 1 million barrels of crude oil aboard that had been struck and later sabotaged with explosives by the Iranian-backed Houthis as part of their campaign over the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. It took months for salvagers to tow the vessel away, extinguish the fires and offload the remaining crude oil. 'Over three challenging weeks, the fires were extinguished, cargo tanks patched and pressurized with inert gas, and the vessel declared safe,' said the private security firm Ambrey, which helped lead the response alongside a European naval force and salvagers. 'In early October, she was towed north to Suez for removal of her cargo, which has now been successfully completed.' The U.S. State Department had warned that a spill from the Sounion would have been 'four times the size of the Exxon Valdez disaster' in 1989 off Alaska. There was no immediate comment from the Houthis, who have held Yemen's capital, Sanaa, for over a decade and have been battling a Saudi-led coalition backing the country's exiled government for nearly as long. The Houthis initially attacked the Greek-flagged Sounion tanker on Aug. 21 with small arms fire, projectiles and a drone boat. A French destroyer operating as part of Operation Aspides rescued its crew of 25 Filipinos and Russians, as well as four private security personnel, after they abandoned the vessel and took them to nearby Djibouti. The Houthis later released footage showing they planted explosives on board the Sounion and ignited them in a propaganda video, something the rebels have done before in their campaign. The Houthis have targeted some 100 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October 2023. They seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels as well. The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel’s campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran. The tempo of Houthi attacks has slowed in recent weeks, particularly involving ships at sea. However, they have continued to launch drones and missiles targeting Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tanker-hit-by-houthi-rebels-that-threatened-a-red-sea-oil-spill-has-been-salvaged/7931925.html	2025-01-10T00:46:01-08:00	
Indonesia to intensify defense partnerships and maritime security, top diplomat says	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesia will expand its existing defense partnerships and step up its handling of strategic issues impacting its sovereignty, including maritime security and the safety of sea passage and fisheries, its foreign minister said on Friday. Sugiono, who uses only one name, said Indonesia would continue to advocate for the completion of a code of conduct between the Southeast Asian bloc ASEAN and China on the South China Sea and prioritize ASEAN's centrality. Indonesia considers itself not a party in disputes over the sea, a waterway crucial to global trade, but has recently been tested by forays by China's coast guard into its exclusive economic zone. Beijing claims sovereignty over almost the entire South China Sea, putting it at odds with Malaysia, Vietnam and the Philippines, with disputes frequent over the conduct in their EEZs of China's massive fleet of coast guard. China insists it is operating lawfully in its territory. 'In the geostrategic sense, Indonesia is close to a source of regional conflict, the South China Sea. Indonesia's position remains prioritizing conflict resolution that is peaceful,' Sugiono said, adding Indonesia would keep pushing for constructive dialogue on a code of conduct. Regional commitments to draft a code were first made in 2002 but talks towards its creation only started in 2017 and progress has been limited, with years spent discussing the framework for negotiations and numerous agreements signed to expedite the process. Thorny issues include whether the code will be legally binding, enforceable and based on international maritime law, under which a 2016 international arbitration panel ruled Beijing's expansive territorial claims had no legal basis. China does not recognize the ruling. In a wide-ranging speech setting out Indonesia's foreign policy that was attended by the diplomatic community, Sugiono also said Indonesia would prioritize completion of talks on free trade agreements and expand its international trade, including with non-traditional partners in Africa and the Pacific. He said Indonesia's joining of the BRICS grouping -- which includes Russia, China, Brazil, India, Iran, Egypt and South Africa -- was not a deviation from Indonesia's international position, but an underlining of its free and active foreign policy. He also said Indonesia would never abandon its support for the Palestinian cause, calling for a ceasefire and accountability for Israel over its role in the Gaza conflict. Sugiono was appointed in October when new President Prabowo Subianto took office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-to-intensify-defense-partnerships-and-maritime-security-top-diplomat-says/7931924.html	2025-01-10T00:37:13-08:00	
Death toll rises to 10 as Los Angeles wildfires ravage city	Authorities in the western U.S. state of California say at least 10 people have been killed in massive wildfires that have ravaged the city of Los Angeles. The Los Angeles County medical examiner late Thursday announced the new death toll, which doubled from earlier reports. Officials warn that number could increase once the fires have been brought under control and workers can comb through the ruins. Firefighting operations continued into the night, with water-dropping helicopters taking advantage of a temporary lull in winds. President Joe Biden told a White House briefing Thursday afternoon that federal resources and additional funding have been made available to California to fight the wildfires that he described as the 'worst fires to ever hit Los Angeles.' The money will be used, the president said, to cover all of the costs for 180 days for temporary shelters, the removal of hazardous materials, first responder salaries and measures to protect life. Vice President Kamala Harris, a former U.S. senator for California, also spoke at the briefing. Harris described the situation in California as 'apocalyptic' and 'something that is going to have an impact for months and years to come.' The vice president has a home in an evacuation zone, but it was not immediately clear whether her house sustained any damage. While the death toll from the Los Angeles wildfires stands at five, Southern California officials say that number will likely increase once the fires have been brought under control and workers can comb through the ruins. Authorities said the wildfires burning in and around the city of Los Angeles have prompted the evacuation of nearly 180,000 people, destroyed thousands of homes, and burned tens of thousands of hectares of land. 'This is absolutely an unprecedented, historic firestorm,' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said. At a news briefing Thursday, Los Angeles city and county officials provided an update on the fires and the efforts to bring them under control. Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley told reporters the fierce winds that had driven the fires calmed enough to allow firefighters to increase containment and air operations to resume. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said it is fighting five active wildfires in the Los Angeles area: the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, Lidia and Sunset fires, with the Palisades and Eaton fires being the largest. The sparking of a sixth fire — the Kenneth Fire, near Woodland Hills — was announced Thursday, and a mandatory evacuation order was in effect for that area, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in its last report that the fires had burned more than 11,750 hectares of land, an announcement made before the addition of the Kenneth Fire. Some people are apparently preying on the devastated neighborhoods, and at least 20 people have been arrested in recent days for looting. 'I promise you, you will be held accountable,' Los Angeles Supervisor Kathryn Barger said at a press conference Thursday. 'Shame on those who are preying on our residents during this time of crisis,' Barger said, according to the Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst and Lidia fires have prompted the evacuation of nearly 180,000 residents, and another 200,000 residents are under evacuation orders. Fire Chief Crowley called the Palisades Fire alone 'one of the most destructive natural disasters in the history of Los Angeles.' Officials said Thursday that more than 5,000 homes and other structures have been lost in Palisades. A leading national credit rating service echoed that view. In a statement Thursday, Morningstar-DBRS credit service said preliminary estimates show the fires could result in more than $8 billion in property losses. Citing local fire officials, Morningstar-DBRS said the fires have already destroyed more than 1,100 homes and threaten more than 28,000 structures. The organization, which monitors and evaluates risk, said it expects the wildfires to have an adverse but manageable impact on California property insurers. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-rises-to-10-as-los-angeles-wildfires-ravage-city/7931910.html	2025-01-09T23:59:41-08:00	
As Arakan Army gains ground in Myanmar, peace remains elusive	WASHINGTON — In Myanmar, a relatively new ethnic armed group known as the Arakan Army has recently taken control of 15 out of 17 townships in the war-torn country's western Rakhine state. This includes the Myanmar military's western regional command headquarters located in Ann Township, in central Rakhine state. This marks the second major regional command center to fall since the beginning of a surge in resistance victories by allied ethnic armed groups – the 'Three Brotherhood Alliance' – known as Operation 1027 in late 2023. The significant territorial gains by the AA are reshaping power dynamics in Myanmar's civil war, observers say. The ethnic army's growing control over Rakhine state is also drawing attention to the plight of the country's Muslim ethnic Rohingya minority. In a recent phone interview with VOA's Burmese service, AA spokesperson Khaing Thu Kha said the group continued to hold its ground. 'As of December 29, 2024, our AA has completely occupied all the military bases of the fascist military council in Gwa Township. We are pursuing and attacking retreating forces,' Khaing Thu Kha said. In response, Myanmar's military has launched heavy artillery strikes from air and sea but was unsuccessful in its attempts to retake Gwa, the spokesperson added. The junta did not respond to VOA on the issue. The Arakan Army's gains continued this week, as it seized a key oil and gas pipeline station and closed in on a major weapons factory of the Myanmar military. The fall of Gwa follows the army's seizing of Ann township earlier in December, when it captured the military's western regional command headquarters after intense fighting, marking another major loss for Myanmar's military. In July, the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army, another ethnic armed group, popularly known as the Kokang army — seized the military's regional command headquarters in Lashio, in the northern part of Shan state. 'In the history of Myanmar's military, losing two regional commands in such a short period is unprecedented,' former Myanmar army Major Naung Yoe told VOA. 'These regional commands oversee vast operational areas and are critical to military control.' Naung Yoe, who is now part of the anti-junta civil disobedience movement group People's Goal, is based along the Thai-Myanmar border. He attributes the Arakan Army's success to strategy and strong local support. 'The courage of the AA soldiers, their disciplined command structure, and the overwhelming support of the Rakhine people have played key roles in their victories,' he said. The military has not responded in the media on recent fighting in Rakhine state. Strategic battleground Rakhine state, with its abundant natural resources and access to the Bay of Bengal, is strategically significant. It is home to major China-backed infrastructure projects and holds geopolitical importance as a gateway to Southeast Asia. The state is predominantly inhabited by Rakhine Buddhists, with Rohingya Muslims making up the second-largest population. The Rohingya have faced systemic persecution, culminating in the 2017 military crackdown that forced over 700,000 to flee to Bangladesh. Myanmar's military is now facing international legal proceedings on charges of genocide and other war crimes. This latest round of fighting between the military and the Arakan Army, which began in late 2023 following Operation1027 has been fierce. Dozens of Rohingya civilians were killed during junta attacks, some with heavy artillery fired at AA troops based in Rohingya villages, according to local human rights organizations. The Arakan Army, formed in 2009 by Rakhine youth leaders, is part of the Three Brotherhood Alliance that is fighting the junta alongside the Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army and the Ta'Ang National Liberation Army. With an estimated 45,000 troops, the AA says it seeks autonomy for Rakhine state, aiming to 'restore the sovereignty of the Arakan people.' However, U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk has condemned abuses by both the military and the AA, citing forced recruitment, extrajudicial killings and indiscriminate attacks that violate international law. AA offensives have reportedly displaced tens of thousands of civilians, including many Rohingya. On Aug. 5, dozens of Rohingya were killed near the Naf River, which divides Myanmar from Bangladesh, underscoring their plight as they remain trapped between escalating violence and closed borders with little safe refuge. Rohingya calls for justice In late December, 28 Rohingya organizations issued a joint statement calling on the AA, which now controls Maungdaw and Buthidaung townships in northern Rakhine, to 'uphold and respect the rights of Rohingya and other ethnic and religious minorities' in the region bordering Bangladesh. Cox's Bazar in southeastern Bangladesh hosts over 1.2 million Rohingya refugees, most of whom fled Myanmar following the military crackdown in August 2017. Meanwhile, approximately 500,000 Rohingya remain in Myanmar, living in areas now under AA control, including territories along the Bangladesh border. 'The AA has reached a position where it can control up to 14 cities,' Tun Khin, president of the Burmese Rohingya Organization U.K., or BROUK, told VOA Burmese by phone. BROUK is among the 28 organizations behind the joint statement. 'However, human rights violations against the Rohingya continue, especially in places like Buthidaung and Maungdaw,' Tun Khin said. 'As a result, the Rohingya have not been able to return to their homes. It is critical to stop the daily abuses inflicted on the Rohingya by AA forces.' After the AA captured Buthidaung and Maungdaw, nearly 60,000 Rohingya fled to Bangladesh, Tun Khin said. 'AA, much like the Burmese military, is driving the Rohingya from their homes, perpetuating a cycle of displacement,' he said. The Rohingya and other Rakhine minorities must find a way to live peacefully together, he said. 'The Rohingya have supported the Burmese revolution and stood alongside revolutionary forces like the AA,' Tun Khin said, 'yet, they have been forcibly driven from their homes during clashes between the AA and the Burmese army. This is unacceptable. The AA is committing similar crimes to those perpetrated by the Burmese military.' A path toward dialogue? For its part, the Arakan Army reiterated its commitment to dialogue late last month. 'We remain steadfast in our belief that current internal issues can and should be resolved through political means rather than military solutions,' the group said in a statement. In his New Year's speech, however, Myanmar's military leader, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, accused ethnic armed groups of pursuing selfish interests and inciting conflict while claiming to support democracy. He also reiterated the junta's commitment to holding elections, citing the completion of a national census and other administrative milestones, and pledged that elections would take place this year. During the 50th anniversary of Rakhine State Day on Dec. 15, Min Aung Hlaing called on ethnic armed groups, including the Arakan Army, to 'abandon the armed path and choose the right course.' Myanmar's military rulers have not directly responded to the AA's offer for dialogue, according to Naung Yoe, the former Myanmar army major. 'The prospects for a resolution remain bleak. I still don't see a dialogue emerging that could resolve the differences between the two sides,' he told VOA. Junta leader Min Aung Hlaing recently reiterated his support for the 2008 constitution, framing it as essential for Myanmar’s future. That constitution allowed the formation of a partially civilian government but guaranteed the military’s continued role in politics. The military overthrew the elected government in a coup in 2021. Ethnic leaders, however, reject any political framework that involves the military. 'With the junta clinging to the 2008 constitution and ethnic leaders envisioning a political future without military involvement, the chances of reconciliation are slim,' Naung Yoe said. He also pointed to the Arakan Army's intention to control all of Rakhine state as a potential stumbling block as well. 'If political reconciliation remains unattainable, the conflict will likely escalate further in early 2025,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-arakan-army-gains-ground-in-myanmar-peace-remains-elusive-/7931879.html	2025-01-09T22:20:27-08:00

US court declines to block release of one special counsel report on Trump	A U.S. appeals court on Thursday declined to block the U.S. Justice Department from releasing a special counsel's investigative report on President-elect Donald Trump’s attempts to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. The ruling from the Atlanta-based U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit appeared to clear the way for the release of the report as early as next week. The appeals court's decision did not immediately lift an order from U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon earlier this week pausing the release of the report. But Cannon set her order to expire three days after the appeals court ruled on the issue. The appeals court invited the Justice Department to bring a separate appeal if it wished to reverse that ruling. The report is likely to be the final act from special counsel Jack Smith, who brought two historic cases against Trump for attempting to subvert the 2020 election results and for mishandling classified documents. Smith dropped both cases after Trump’s election victory and neither reached a trial. Thursday's ruling came after Trump's two former co-defendants in the classified documents case, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, asked the appeals court to block the release of the report, arguing it would interfere with their ongoing prosecution. The report for now is set to detail only the 2020 election probe after Attorney General Merrick Garland, who appointed Smith, decided not to publicly release the portion focused on the classified documents while legal proceedings against Trump’s two former co-defendants continue. The Justice Department plans to allow only certain senior members of Congress to review that section of the report, the department said in a court filing. Nauta and De Oliveira argued that even the limited release of the documents section of the report to Congress could harm their defense against obstruction charges. Both have pleaded not guilty. It is unclear how much new information the public portion of the report will contain. Smith and a House of Representatives panel have already released detailed accounts of Trump’s actions surrounding the 2020 election, including during the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges and claimed the cases against him were part of an effort to damage his political campaign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7931846.html	2025-01-09T19:14:00-08:00	
Biden releases resources to fight wildfires, shelter victims in California	U.S. President Joe Biden said at a White House briefing Thursday afternoon that federal resources and additional funding have been made available to California to fight the wildfires that he described as the 'worst fires to ever hit Los Angeles.' The money will be used, the president said, to cover all of the costs for 180 days for temporary shelters, the removal of hazardous materials, first responder salaries and measures to protect life. Vice President Kamala Harris, a former U.S. senator for California, also spoke at the briefing. Harris described the situation in California as 'apocalyptic' and 'something that is going to have an impact for months and years to come.' The vice president has a home in an evacuation zone, but it was not immediately clear whether her house sustained any damage. While the death toll from the Los Angeles wildfires stands at five, Southern California officials say that number will likely increase once the fires have been brought under control and workers can comb through the ruins. Authorities said the wildfires burning in and around the city of Los Angeles have prompted the evacuation of nearly 180,000 people, destroyed thousands of homes, and burned tens of thousands of hectares of land. 'This is absolutely an unprecedented, historic firestorm,' Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass said. At a news briefing Thursday, Los Angeles city and county officials provided an update on the fires and the efforts to bring them under control. Los Angeles Fire Chief Kristin Crowley told reporters the fierce winds that had driven the fires calmed enough to allow firefighters to increase containment and air operations to resume. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said it is fighting five active wildfires in the Los Angeles area: the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst, Lidia and Sunset fires, with the Palisades and Eaton fires being the largest. The sparking of a sixth fire — the Kenneth Fire, near Woodland Hills — was announced Thursday, and a mandatory evacuation order was in effect for that area, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. The California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said in its last report that the fires had burned more than 11,750 hectares of land, an announcement made before the addition of the Kenneth Fire. Some people are apparently preying on the devastated neighborhoods, and at least 20 people have been arrested in recent days for looting. 'I promise you, you will be held accountable,' Los Angeles Supervisor Kathryn Barger said at a press conference Thursday. 'Shame on those who are preying on our residents during this time of crisis,' Barger said, according to the Los Angeles Times. Los Angeles County Sheriff Robert Luna said the Palisades, Eaton, Hurst and Lidia fires have prompted the evacuation of nearly 180,000 residents, and another 200,000 residents are under evacuation orders. Fire Chief Crowley called the Palisades Fire alone 'one of the most destructive natural disasters in the history of Los Angeles.' Officials said Thursday that more than 5,000 homes and other structures have been lost in Palisades. A leading national credit rating service echoed that view. In a statement Thursday, Morningstar-DBRS credit service said preliminary estimates show the fires could result in more than $8 billion in property losses. Citing local fire officials, Morningstar-DBRS said the fires have already destroyed more than 1,100 homes and threaten more than 28,000 structures. The organization, which monitors and evaluates risk, said it expects the wildfires to have an adverse but manageable impact on California property insurers. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-releases-resources-to-fight-wildfires-shelter-victims-in-california/7931822.html	2025-01-09T18:44:47-08:00	
Russia turns to China to step up AI race against US	WASHINGTON — Russia's efforts to obtain China's help in enhancing artificial intelligence is seen as a bid to challenge America's lead in the field even as the outgoing Biden administration is expected to impose new export control measures to further curb Beijing's access to AI chips. As the new year began, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered the country's state-owned Sberbank, to work with China in researching and developing AI technology, according to the Kremlin. 'The Russian president sees his country in global competition for AI with the United States and has positioned the state resources to try and compete with the U.S. in information and cyberspace – two areas where artificial intelligence is supposed to aid Russia in what they see as Western narratives and influence,' said Samuel Bendett, adjunct senior fellow at the Center for a New American Security. Moscow views Beijing's success in AI as an example to follow, and its 'cooperation with China is viewed as a necessary step towards acquiring artificial intelligence-related skill sets, knowledge and technology,' Bendett told VOA in written comments. The U.S. currently leads in AI innovation, followed by China, which is falling behind by wide margins, according to a November report by the Stanford Institute for Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence. Russia ranks 31st out of 83 countries in AI implementation, innovation and investment, according to U.K.-based Tortoise Media's Global AI Index. Response to sanctions Western sanctions imposed on Russia since its invasion of Ukraine in 2022 have limited the country's AI development, and Moscow has turned to Beijing to offset the restriction, according to Bendett in his report 'The Role of AI in Russia's Confrontation with the West.' Sberbank, which Putin instructed to collaborate with China, is under Western sanctions. It is Russia's largest bank and leads the country's AI development efforts. The outgoing Biden administration is expected to impose a new set of export control measures aimed at further limiting China's ability to access chips that support AI technology. The new measures could come as early as Friday, according to Bloomberg. Sberbank CEO German Gref said in 2023 that Russia cannot obtain graphics processing units, microchips needed to support AI development, according to Reuters. But the bank's first deputy CEO, Alexander Vedyakhin, said in December that despite Western sanctions, Russia can improve its AI ranking by 2030 through its own development. Another key area where Russia has sought to further apply AI help from China is in the military. 'There already have been top level meetings between Russia and Chinese militaries in 2024,' and 'ongoing dialogue' between the defense ministries of the two countries is likely so they can understand 'how AI could aid in a large-scale conventional conflict, like the one unfolding in Ukraine,' Bendett said. Russian and Chinese officials met in Beijing early last year to discuss military application of AI, especially in developing autonomous weapons, according to Russia's Foreign Ministry. AI-powered weapons In December, Ukraine said Russia began using AI-powered strike drones with improved capabilities that can evade air defenses, identify key targets and operate offline. James Lewis, director of the Strategic Technologies Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Russia is likely to use AI technology on enhancing drones as well as in making weapons with improved target detection and attack speed. The China-Russia AI partnership 'creates new risk for the U.S.,' but military application of 'AI won't compensate for bad strategy' in the battlefield, he said. Attending an AI conference in Moscow last month, Song Haitao, president of the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Research Institute, said China plans to sign an agreement with Russia's Sberbank to promote bilateral cooperation on AI development. Speaking at the conference, Putin applauded China for 'making great strides' in advancing AI technology and its application, including in building 'smart cities' and conducting 'modern governance.' Sam Bresnick, research fellow at Georgetown University's Center for Security and Emerging Technology, said although it is not entirely clear how Beijing might benefit from helping Moscow in developing AI, China might want some military technologies and wartime data from Russia in return. 'Russia is very good at making submarines, and there's been a speculation in the past that China could benefit from acquiring that kind of technology. Another one is helicopter technology,' Bresnick said. 'The war in Ukraine has generated an astonishing amount of data,' Bresnick continued. 'China would probably be interested in getting its hands on them because having more militarily relevant data from Russia would help China develop its own AI systems for military.' Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on Thursday that 'in terms of the application of artificial intelligence, China actively advocates the principles of 'people-oriented' and 'intelligent for good,' ensuring that artificial intelligence is safe, reliable and controllable, better enabling global sustainable development, and enhancing the common well-being of all mankind.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-turns-to-china-to-step-up-ai-race-against-us/7931829.html	2025-01-09T18:21:42-08:00	
Supreme Court allows sentencing of Trump to go forward	Donald Trump will be sworn in January 20 as the only U.S. president with felony convictions, and this week saw a flurry of activity over the court cases still open against him. On Friday, a New York judge is to sentence Trump in one case. VOA Senior Washington Correspondent Carolyn Presutti reports.	https://www.voanews.com/a/supreme-court-allows-sentencing-of-trump-to-go-forward/7931818.html	2025-01-09T18:16:52-08:00	
Biden refutes Trump attacks, pledges federal aid to fight California fires	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden said wildfires ravaging Los Angeles show climate change is real, days before President-elect Donald Trump is to take office. Trump has threatened to pull back on U.S. efforts to combat global warming. 'Climate change is real. ... There is global warming, it's real,' Biden told a crisis meeting at the White House on the fires. 'This is the most widespread, devastating fire in California's history,' Biden said as he convened the meeting. Trump has used the wildfires to attack Biden and California Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom on social media. The outgoing president canceled a trip to Rome to stay in Washington and coordinate the U.S. government response to the fires, which have killed at least five people. He said the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of dealing with the disaster for the first 180 days, at Newsom's request. Biden said he was surging 400 federal firefighters and 30 firefighting planes and helicopters to Los Angeles, while the Pentagon will send eight large planes and 500 wildfire clearance personnel. Meanwhile, Biden sought to debunk claims pushed by Trump that there was a water shortage that left firefighters struggling to put out the inferno. Biden said the problem lay not with a shortage of water but with power cuts that took water pumps offline. During wildfires, utility companies can cut electricity amid fears that faulty power lines could spark more fires. Trump's remarks on Wednesday and Thursday came as firefighters were trying to contain the blazes that have killed five people and destroyed more than 2,000 structures. 'One of the best and most beautiful parts of the United States of America is burning down to the ground,' Trump said on his Truth Social network late Wednesday, blaming the fires on Newsom and calling on him to resign. Trump returned to the subject Thursday morning as the blazes continued to rage. Without providing evidence, he variously accused Newsom of 'incompetence' in managing the fires and of wasting water in drought-hit California. The California governor strongly rejected Trump's claims in an interview with CNN. 'People are literally fleeing. ... This guy wanted to politicize it. I have a lot of thoughts, and I know what I want to say. I won't,' Newsom said. Trump accused Biden on Thursday of diverting money to 'Green New Scam' climate policies instead of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Biden has repeatedly denied steering funds away from FEMA, including in October when Trump made similar accusations after hurricanes devastated the U.S. Southeast a month before the 2024 U.S. presidential election. California has long been a target of Trump's ire, with the most populous U.S. state long having voted for Democrats. He made some modest gains in the 2024 election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-refutes-trump-attacks-pledges-federal-aid-to-fight-california-fires-/7931785.html	2025-01-09T17:49:10-08:00	
Denmark says it has neglected Greenland defense for years	COPENHAGEN, DENMARK — Denmark acknowledged Thursday that it had long neglected the defense of Greenland, a vast and strategically important Arctic island - and one that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has called vital for U.S. security. Trump, who takes office Jan. 20, said this week that U.S. control of Greenland - a sovereign Danish territory - was an 'absolute necessity,' and he did not rule out using military or economic action against Denmark to make it happen. 'We have neglected for many years to make the necessary investments in ships and in aircraft that will help monitor our kingdom, and that is what we are now trying to do something about,' Danish Defense Minister Troels Lund Poulsen told journalists. The U.S. Embassy in Copenhagen said earlier Thursday that the United States had no plans to increase its military presence in Greenland. 'There are no plans to increase the United States' current military footprint in Greenland,' the spokesperson told Reuters. 'We will continue to work closely with Copenhagen and Nuuk [Greenland's capital] to ensure any proposals meet our common security needs.' Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said late Thursday that she had asked for a meeting with Trump but did not expect one to happen ahead of his inauguration. US military presence Greenland has been controlled by Denmark for centuries, though its 57,000 people now govern their own domestic affairs. Its security and foreign affairs, however, are still handled by Copenhagen. The U.S. military maintains a permanent presence at the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland's northwest. Greenland is crucial for the U.S. military and its ballistic missile early-warning system, since the shortest route from Europe to North America runs via the island. 'I think that the Americans are quite concerned that Russia could actually launch or initiate a major attack against the United States, and that could be done from the Russian side,' Jens Wenzel at Nordic Defense Analysis told Reuters. 'There is no real monitoring of the airspace in Greenland. It is largely a free-for-all,' he said. Greenland is already covered by U.S. security guarantees via Denmark's membership in NATO. Frederiksen said this week that she could not imagine the United States would use military intervention in Greenland and said it was up to the people of Greenland to decide what they want. 'Tightrope' Frederiksen summoned leaders of Denmark's political parties to a meeting Thursday for a briefing about Trump's renewed interest. She rebuffed an offer from him in 2019 to buy Greenland. On Wednesday, Frederiksen hosted Greenland's leader, Mute Egede, for talks in Copenhagen. Egede favors independence for his homeland and has said it is not for sale. Egede discussed trade and other issues with the outgoing U.S. ambassador in Copenhagen on Wednesday, the embassy said. Last month, Trump said he had picked Ken Howery as the new U.S. envoy to Denmark. As a co-founder of PayPal, Howery is considered a member of the group of former workers and executives at the digital finance firm that includes prominent Trump supporters Peter Thiel and Elon Musk. 'They're walking a tightrope,' said Lin Alexandra Mortensgaard, a Greenland expert at the Danish Institute for International Studies, referring to the Danish and Greenland prime ministers. 'It's a balance between representing an autonomous territory and representing a sovereign state while still taking the requirements of Denmark's closest ally seriously,' she said. Denmark's European allies France and Germany have responded to Trump's comments by stressing the inviolability of borders. British Foreign Minister David Lammy said Thursday that he believed Trump recognized Greenland was part of Denmark and that concerns about Russian and Chinese activity in the Arctic lay behind the U.S. president-elect's remarks. The Kremlin said Thursday that Moscow was following closely the 'dramatic development' on Greenland and that the Arctic fell within Russia's zone of strategic national interests. In Greenland, opinions on the island's future appear divided, with some warmly welcoming Trump's remarks and others responding skeptically. Danish lawmakers across the political spectrum have urged Frederiksen, a Social Democrat, to firmly reject any attempt by foreign powers to undermine Greenland's status. 'The U.S. wants to take over Denmark's role in Greenland, and the Danish government must say a clear and unequivocal no to that,' former conservative minister Rasmus Jarlov said on X. Meanwhile, the screenwriter of the hit Danish TV drama series 'Borgen,' Adam Price, joked on Instagram that it was becoming 'increasingly difficult to write political fiction when real-life politics are becoming more and more extreme.' 'All that's left is to get some popcorn,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/denmark-says-it-has-neglected-greenland-defense-for-years-/7931744.html	2025-01-09T16:30:51-08:00

Vance to resign from US Senate ahead of his inauguration as vice president	washington — Republican Vice President-elect JD Vance said Thursday that he would resign from his U.S. Senate seat from Ohio at midnight ahead of his inauguration later this month. President-elect Donald Trump and Vance defeated the Democratic presidential candidate, Vice President Kamala Harris, and her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, in the Nov. 5 U.S. election. Vance's Senate seat will be filled by a person appointed by Ohio Republican Governor Mike DeWine. The replacement will serve until a special election is held in November 2026. The winner of that election will finish the remainder of Vance's Senate term, which ends in January 2029. In his resignation letter to the Ohio governor, Vance wrote that 'it has been a tremendous honor and privilege to serve the people of Ohio in the Senate over the past two years.' Republicans won a narrow majority in both the Senate and the House of Representatives in the November elections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vance-to-resign-from-us-senate-ahead-of-his-inauguration-as-vice-president/7931504.html	2025-01-09T16:04:19-08:00	
Russia 'observing' Greenland situation; Europe cautious on Trump remarks	london — Russia has said it is closely watching the situation with Greenland, following U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's refusal to rule out military or economic measures to take control of the territory from Denmark. 'We are observing this rather dramatic development of the situation, but so far, thank God, [it remains] at the level of statements,' Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov told reporters on Thursday. 'The Arctic zone is a zone of our national and strategic interests. We are present in the Arctic zone, and we will continue to be there,' Peskov added. The vast territory of Greenland — most of which lies above the Arctic Circle — has been officially part of the Kingdom of Denmark since 1953, although the island has its own government. National security Questioned at a news conference in Florida on Tuesday, Trump said the United States needs Greenland for security purposes, and he refused to rule out using economic or military means to achieve that goal. 'People really don't even know if Denmark has any legal right to it. But if they do, they should give it up because we need it for national security. That's for the free world. I'm talking about protecting the free world,' Trump said. 'You have Chinese ships all over the place. You have Russian ships all over the place. We're not letting that happen,' he added. Like much of the Arctic, Greenland is rapidly warming. That is changing the geopolitics of the region, said analyst Liana Fix of the Council on Foreign Relations. 'The Arctic is increasingly becoming a zone of a great power competition and rivalry. And the United States is concerned it is losing this game,' Fix said. 'The Arctic becomes much more accessible, both for trading goods but also for critical minerals, especially for rare earth [minerals],' Fix said. 'And also it becomes increasingly a militarized zone,' she added, noting that Russia is cooperating with the Chinese coast guard in the region. Not for sale Denmark has made it clear that Greenland is not for sale. Foreign Minister Lars Lokke Rasmussen rejected the suggestion that Trump's comments presented a foreign policy crisis for his government. 'I see a president who is on his way into the White House, who has a heightened focus on the Arctic, and I can understand that he has that. We also have that from the Danish side, and we also have that within NATO,' Rasmussen said Wednesday. Denmark faces a dilemma, said analyst Fix. 'It is very clear for Denmark, too, that increased cooperation with the United States both on investments in Greenland but also on military cooperation would be actually in the interest of everyone,' Fix told VOA. Several European leaders rejected Trump's comments, although most stopped short of directly criticizing the incoming U.S. president. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said basic Western values were at stake. 'The principle of inviolability of borders applies to every country, regardless of whether it is to the east or west of us,' he said. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot was more direct. 'It is out of the question for the European Union to let any nation in the world, whichever it is — and let me say starting with Russia — define its sovereign borders,' he said Wednesday. Greenland independence Greenland's government, meanwhile, is pushing for a referendum on full independence and has said that only the people will decide Greenland's future. 'Greenland is on its way into a new era and a new year in which Greenland has been at the center of world attention. The Greenlandic people are one people, regardless of where they live. And as people in the times we live in, we must be united in order to be ready for a new future that our country is on its way to,' Prime Minister Mute Egede said during a trip to Copenhagen on Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-observing-greenland-situation-europe-cautious-on-trump-remarks-/7931461.html	2025-01-09T15:10:44-08:00	
African ministers meet in Uganda to shape 10-year food security, sustainability plan	NAIROBI, KENYA — Africa's agriculture ministers are meeting in Uganda this week to discuss the best way to transform the continent's food production systems. The ministers hope to agree on a 10-year action plan to reduce Africa's reliance on food from outside the continent and adapt its farming practices to climate change and modern technology. The ministers and more than 2,000 delegates are meeting in Kampala to discuss sustainable agriculture and food production systems. Speaking at the opening of the summit, Uganda's prime minister, Robinah Nabbanja, urged ministers to provide policies and solutions that can make the continent food self-reliant. 'As the continent's agriculture sector ministers, I urge you to deliberately work to reduce Africa's over-reliance on food imports from outside of the continent,' Nabbanja said. 'We must position the continent in such a manner that our agriculture sector is resilient to climate change as well as other shocks and is adaptive to advances in technology.' In recent years, Africa has witnessed a sharp increase in food prices due to droughts, floods, conflict and climate change. According to the U.N. trade and development agency UNCTAD, the number of people experiencing food insecurity worldwide increased from 512 million in 2014 to more than 790 million in 2021. The African ministers are meeting in Uganda again to review strategies for food security in the next 10 years, given the changing weather, people's food preferences, increased conflicts and shrinking agricultural farmlands. Despite the challenges ahead, David Nabarro, co-founder of the 4SD Foundation, an organization that works on the transformation of food systems, said that with cooperation between countries and organizations, Africa has the capacity to be food self-sufficient. 'This could lead Africa as a region becoming less of a region that needs to import nutritious food for its people and move to a situation perhaps in 10 years where it can be self-sufficient or even in some cases more exporting,' Nabarro said. 'So individual African country's examples would be brought together and shared because the whole cadre approach is where you monitor progress and share that progress between countries and use that as a way to bring everybody's standards up higher.' The director of the Institute of Livestock and Research Institute, Appolinaire Djikeng, said strong collaboration and greater investments in agriculture by African governments could bring lasting change in Africa's food production. 'The food systems transformations and food systems challenges demonstrated that one organization cannot do it alone,' Djikeng said. 'It is about a coalition, and I want to see that part strengthened. But more importantly, I would like to see governments really investing, committing to invest in the national budget to develop agriculture and building capacities so that we have people who are trained, we have institutions, but also linking that to policy, we need to see the right policy.' According to analysts who track the progress of the goals and targets of the Comprehensive African Agricultural Development Programme (CAADP), several countries, such as Benin, Ethiopia, Lesotho, and Malawi, have spent more than 10% of their budgets to improve their agriculture sectors. The summit ends Saturday, and heads of state are expected to attend and endorse a CAADP strategy and action plan that could shape the continent's food systems for 10 years beginning in 2026.	https://www.voanews.com/a/african-ministers-meet-in-uganda-to-shape-10-year-food-security-sustainability-plan-/7931443.html	2025-01-09T14:51:05-08:00	
UN watchdog faults Australia for treatment of migrants on Nauru	GENEVA — Australia violated the rights of asylum-seekers arbitrarily detained on the island of Nauru, a U.N. watchdog ruled Thursday, in a warning to other countries intent on outsourcing asylum processing. The U.N. Human Rights Committee published decisions in two cases involving 25 refugees and asylum-seekers who endured years of arbitrary detention in the island nation. 'A state party cannot escape its human rights responsibility when outsourcing asylum processing to another state,' committee member Mahjoub El Haiba said in a statement. Under a hard-line policy introduced more than a decade ago, Australia has sent thousands of migrants attempting to reach the country by boat to detention centers on Papua New Guinea's Manus Island and the tiny Pacific nation of Nauru, which lies further to the northwest. Victims in both cases filed complaints to the U.N. committee of 18 independent experts, charging that Australia had violated their rights under an international covenant, in particular regarding arbitrary detention. Australia rejected the allegations, insisting that abuses that occurred in Nauru did not fall within its jurisdiction. But the U.N. committee highlighted that Australia had arranged for the establishment of Nauru's regional processing center and contributed to its operation and management. El Haiba said Australia did have jurisdiction because it 'had significant control and influence over the regional processing facility in Nauru.' 'Not human rights-free zones' A number of European countries have been examining the possibility of similar arrangements to outsource their migration policies. Thursday's decisions 'send a clear message to all states: Where there is power or effective control, there is responsibility,' El Haiba said. 'The outsourcing of operations does not absolve states of accountability. Offshore detention facilities are not human rights-free zones.' The first case examined by the committee involved 24 unaccompanied minors from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. They were intercepted at sea by Australia and transferred in 2014 to Nauru's overcrowded Regional Processing Center. They were held there 'with insufficient water supply and sanitation, high temperatures and humidity, as well as inadequate health care,' Thursday's statement said. 'Almost all of these minors have suffered from deterioration of physical and mental well-being, including self-harm, depression, kidney problems, insomnia, headaches, memory problems and weight loss.' Compensation Even though all but one of the minors were granted refugee status around September 2014, they remained detained in Nauru, the committee said. It said Australia had failed to justify why the minors could not have been transferred to centers on the mainland more suitable for vulnerable individuals. The committee separately evaluated the case of an Iranian asylum seeker who arrived by boat on Christmas Island with several family members in August 2013 and was transferred seven months later to Nauru. The woman was recognized as a refugee by Nauru authorities in 2017 but was not released. In November 2018, she was transferred to Australia in November 2018 for medical reasons but remained detained in various facilities there, the committee said. It determined that Australia had failed to show that the woman's prolonged and indefinite detention was justified. The committee called on Australia to compensate the victims and take steps to ensure similar violations do not recur. The committee has no power to compel states to follow its rulings, but its decisions carry reputational weight.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-watchdog-faults-australia-for-treatment-of-migrants-on-nauru-/7931362.html	2025-01-09T13:00:58-08:00	
Italy's FM encourages post-Assad transition, calls for EU to review sanctions	ROME — Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani is traveling to Syria on Friday to encourage the country's transition following the ouster of President Bashar Assad by Islamist insurgents, and said Europe should review its sanctions on Damascus now that the political situation has changed. Tajani presided Thursday over a meeting in Rome of foreign ministry officials from five countries — Britain, France, Germany, Italy and the United States — and spoke earlier by telephone with his counterparts from Turkey and Saudi Arabia. The aim, he said, is to coordinate the various post-Assad initiatives, with Italy prepared to make proposals on private investments in health care for the Syrian population. Going into the meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and their European counterparts, Tajani said it was critical that all Syrians be recognized with equal rights. It was a reference to concerns about the rights of Christians and other minorities under Syria's new de facto authorities of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamic militant group that the U.S. and United Nations have long designated as a terrorist organization. 'The first messages from Damascus have been positive. That's why I'm going there tomorrow, to encourage this new phase that will help stabilize the international situation,' said Tajani. Speaking to reporters, he said the European Union should discuss possible changes to the sanctions regime on Syria. 'It's an issue that should be discussed because Assad isn't there anymore, it's a new situation, and I think that the encouraging signals that are arriving should be further encouraged,' he said. Syria has been under deeply isolating sanctions by the United States, the European Union and others for years as a result of Assad's brutal response to what began as peaceful anti-government protests in 2011 and spiraled into civil war. HTS led a lightning insurgency that ousted Assad on December 8 and ended his family's decades-long rule. From 2011 until Assad's downfall, Syria's uprising and civil war killed an estimated 500,000 people. The U.S. has gradually lifted some penalties since Assad departed Syria for protection in Russia. The Biden administration in December decided to drop a $10 million bounty it had offered for the capture of a Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of Assad last month. Syria's new leaders also have been urged to respect the rights of minorities and women. Many Syrian Christians, who made up 10% of the population before Syria's civil war, either fled the country or supported Assad out of fear of Islamist insurgents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-s-fm-heads-to-syria-to-encourage-post-assad-transition-calls-for-eu-to-review-sanctions-/7931357.html	2025-01-09T13:00:29-08:00	
Carter funeral brings together 1 current, 4 ex-presidents to honor one of their own	WASHINGTON — As they filed into the front pews at the National Cathedral, wearing dark suits and mostly solemn faces, one current and four former presidents came together for Jimmy Carter's funeral. For a service that stretched more than an hour, the feuding, grievances and enmity that had marked their rival campaigns and divergent politics gave way to a reverential moment for one of their own. Barack Obama and Donald Trump, the first two of the group to take their seats Thursday, shook hands and chatted at length. Trump, the former president who will retake the Oval Office in 11 days, leaned in and listened intently to his predecessor. At times, the two flashed smiles. Obama, who attended without his wife, Michelle, shared a second-row pew with former Presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, along with their spouses. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden arrived last and sat in the pew just in front of them. Members of the exclusive presidents' club were on their best behavior. Bonded by the presidency, they rarely criticize one another or the White House's current occupant — although Trump has flouted those rules frequently. He has praised and criticized Carter in recent days, and he complained that flags will still be at half-staff to honor the deceased president during his inauguration. Trump looked up when Vice President Kamala Harris — whom he defeated in November's hard-fought election — entered the cathedral, but he didn't move to greet her as she and husband Doug Emhoff took seats directly in front of him and Melania Trump. Nor did Harris acknowledge him. After the service, Emhoff turned around to shake hands with Trump. Obama, with Trump on his left, also turned to his right to chat with Bush. Clinton, with wife Hillary, was the last of the ex-presidents to take a seat and got in some chatter with Bush as well. The White House said the former presidents also met privately before taking their seats. Funerals are among the few events that bring members of the presidents' club together. In a way, former President Gerald Ford was there, too: Ford's son Steven read a eulogy for Carter that Ford had written before he died in 2006. Busy with personal pursuits, charitable endeavors and sometimes lucrative speaking gigs, the former leaders don't mingle often. They all know the protocol of state funerals well — each has been involved in planning his own. During the 2018 funeral for George H.W. Bush, then-President Trump sat with his predecessors and their spouses, including the Carters, and the interactions were stiff and sometimes awkward. This time, Trump also didn't appear to interact with Hillary Clinton, whom he defeated in the 2016 election. Trump was seated in the pew in front of his former vice president, Mike Pence — one of the few times they have coincided at events since Pence refused to overturn the results of the 2020 election after Trump lost to Biden. The two shook hands but didn't speak much beyond that. Trump, who largely avoided contact with the former presidents during his first term — and pointedly did not seek their advice — has been critical of Republican former presidents, particularly the Bush family, which made him an uneasy member of the former presidents' club. Carter himself didn't particularly relish being a member of the club, at times criticizing its staid traditions. Many past presidents have built relationships with their predecessors, including Bill Clinton, who reached out to Richard Nixon for advice on Russian policy, and Harry Truman, who sought counsel from Herbert Hoover. One of the first calls Obama made after U.S. forces killed Osama bin Laden in 2011 was to George W. Bush to spread the word that the mission had been accomplished, said Kate Andersen Brower, author of Team of Five: The Presidents Club in the Age of Trump. 'It's the loneliest job in the world, so usually they reach out and rely on each other,' said Andersen Brower. 'But Trump didn't have that the first term, so this will just be another four years where he doesn't depend on anyone who came before him.' She noted that Carter spent years as a proud Washington outsider and skipped the unveiling of his own portrait to avoid being in the same room with the man who beat him in 1980, President Ronald Reagan. 'Carter and Trump, even though they have the least in common about everything else, are similar,' Andersen Brower said, 'in just how they approach telling what they actually think.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/carter-funeral-brings-together-1-current-4-ex-presidents-to-honor-one-of-their-own/7931345.html	2025-01-09T12:59:55-08:00

Worst in Show' CES products put data at risk and cause waste, privacy advocates say	LAS VEGAS — So much of the technology showcased at CES includes gadgets made to improve consumers' lives — whether by leveraging AI to make devices that help people become more efficient, by creating companions to cure loneliness, or by providing tools that help people with mental and physical health. But not all innovation is good, according to a panel of self-described dystopia experts that has judged some products as 'Worst in Show.' The award that no company wants to win calls out the 'least repairable, least private, and least sustainable products on display.' 'We're seeing more and more of these things that have basically surveillance technology built into them, and it enables some cool things,' Liz Chamberlain, director of sustainability at the e-commerce site iFixit told The Associated Press. 'But it also means that now we've got microphones and cameras in our washing machines, refrigerators and that really is an industry-wide problem.' The fourth annual contest announced its decisions Thursday. A new smart ring every few years? Kyle Wiens, CEO of iFixit, awarded the Ultrahuman Rare Luxury Smart Ring the title of 'least repairable.' The rings, which come in colors like dune and desert sand, cost $2,200. Wiens said the jewelry 'looks sleek but hides a major flaw: its battery only lasts 500 charges.' Worse, he said, is the fact that replacing the battery is impossible without destroying the device entirely. 'Luxury items may be fleeting, but two years of use for $2,200 is a new low,' he said. Ultrahuman did not immediately respond to a request for comment. An AI-powered smart crib? Bosch's 'Revol' crib uses sensors, cameras and AI that the company says can help monitor vital signs like how an infant is sleeping, heart and respiratory rates and more. The crib can also rock gently if the baby needs help falling asleep and signal to parents if a blanket or other object is interfering with breathing. EFF Executive Director Cindy Cohn said the crib preys on parents' fears and 'collects excessive data about babies via a camera, microphone, and even a radar sensor.' 'Parents expect safety and comfort — not surveillance and privacy risks — in their children's cribs,' she said in the report. A spokesperson for Bosch told The Associated Press that all data is encrypted end-to-end and stored on Bosch-administered servers, 'while all data at rest is secured locally with individual data encryption keys.' 'Caregivers have the final say on whether data is transmitted at all. The Revol has an offline mode, which keeps data local if preferred,' the spokesperson said, adding that the smart crib helps keep children safe. Too much waste? Although AI is everywhere at CES, Stacey Higginbotham, a policy Fellow at Consumer Reports, felt that SoundHound AI's In-Car Commerce Ecosystem, powered by its Automotive AI, pushes it to unnecessary extremes. The feature 'increases energy consumption, encourages wasteful takeout consumption and distracts drivers — all while adding little value,' Higginbotham said. That landed the in-car system as 'least sustainable' on the list. Soundhound AI's platform allows drivers and passengers to order takeout for pick-up directly from the car's infotainment system. The company did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement Tuesday, Keyvan Mohajer, CEO of SoundHound AI, said the product's launch marks a moment 'decades in the making.' 'What begins here with food and restaurants will ultimately open up a whole new commercial ecosystem for vehicle and device manufacturers everywhere,' he said. Vulnerable to hacking? TP-Link's Archer BE900 router won for 'least secure' of CES. The company is a top-selling router brand in the U.S. But its products are vulnerable to hacking, said Paul Roberts, founder of The Security Ledger. 'By Chinese law, TP-Link must report security flaws to the government before alerting the public, creating a significant national security risk,' he said. 'Yet TP-Link showcased its Archer BE900 router at CES without addressing these vulnerabilities.' In an email response, TP-Link Systems contested the report. 'TP-Link Systems Inc. is a U.S.-headquartered company and does not provide any such security reporting to China as referenced by iFixit,' the company said. 'TP-Link Systems has a secure, vertically-integrated, and U.S.-owned international supply chain. Nearly all products sold in the United States are manufactured in Vietnam.' TP-Link said it controls its own supply chains, and 'is constantly assessing potential risks to its U.S. operations, customers, and supply chain,' adding that it acknowledges that vulnerabilities exist across the industry. 'However, contrary to claims of widespread vulnerabilities, comparative data places TP-Link on par with, or in some cases ahead of, other major industry players in terms of security outcomes,' the company said. Who asked for this? The awards also feature a category called 'who asked for this?' Top of that list was Samsung's Bespoke AI Washing Machine, which Nathan Proctor, senior director of U.S. PIRG, a consumer advocacy group, said is filled 'with features no one needs,' including the ability to make phone calls. 'These add-ons only make the appliance more expensive, fragile, and harder to repair,' he said. Samsung did not respond to a request for comment. At a press conference at CES Tuesday, Jong-Hee Han, vice chairman of Samsung's device experience division, said that he was 'proud of how we have introduced new technologies and intelligence to the home, connected key devices and set the standard for the home of the future.' 'We are reinforcing our commitment to delivering personalized experiences through our widespread implementation of AI and we will continue this journey of AI leadership in the home and beyond, not just for the next decade, but for the next century,' he said. Worst overall Gay Gordon-Byrne, executive director of The Repair Association, called the LG 'AI Home Inside 2.0 Refrigerator with ThinkQ' the worst product overall. The fridge adds 'flashy features,' Gordon-Byrne said, including a screen and internet connection. 'But these come at a cost,' Gordon-Byrne said. 'Shorter software support, higher energy consumption, and expensive repairs reduce the fridge's practical lifespan, leaving consumers with an expensive, wasteful gadget.' LG did not respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/worst-in-show-ces-products-put-data-at-risk-and-cause-waste-privacy-advocates-say/7931337.html	2025-01-09T12:33:06-08:00	
Venezuelan opposition leader emerges from hideout to join anti-Maduro rally	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado on Thursday left her hideout and reappeared in public for the first time in months, risking arrest as anti-government protesters made a last-ditch attempt to block President Nicolas Maduro from clinging to power. 'They wanted us to fight each other, but Venezuela is united,' Machado, waving a Venezuelan flag, shouted to a few hundred protesters from atop a truck in the capital. 'We are not afraid! We are not afraid!' shouted demonstrators who sang the Venezuelan national anthem to herald Machado's brave defiance of Maduro. The protests are taking place a day before the ruling party-controlled National Assembly is scheduled to swear in Maduro to a third six-year term despite credible evidence that he lost the presidential election. There was a relatively small turnout for Thursday's protests as riot police were deployed in force. Venezuelans who have witnessed Maduro's security forces round up scores of opponents and regular bystanders since the July election were reluctant to mobilize in the same numbers as they have in the past. 'Of course, there's fewer people,' said empanada vendor Miguel Contrera as National Guard soldiers carrying riot shields buzzed by on motorcycles. 'There's fear.' Protesters repudiate Maduro Those demonstrators who did show up blocked a main avenue in one opposition stronghold. Many were senior citizens and dressed in red, yellow and blue, answering Machado's call to wear the colors of the Venezuelan flag. All repudiated Maduro and said they would recognize Edmundo Gonzalez — Machado's last-minute stand-in on the ballot — as Venezuela's legitimate president. The deployment of security forces, as well as pro-government armed groups known as 'colectivos' to intimidate opponents, betrays a deep insecurity on the part of Maduro, said Javier Corrales, a Latin America expert at Amherst College. Since the elections, the government has arrested more than 2,000 people — including as many as 10 Americans and other foreigners — who it claims have been plotting to oust Maduro and sow chaos in the oil-rich South American nation. This week alone, masked gunmen arrested a former presidential candidate, a prominent free speech activist and even Gonzalez's son-in-law as he was taking his young children to school. 'It's an impressive show of force, but it's also a sign of weakness,' said Corrales, who co-authored an article this month in the Journal of Democracy titled, 'How Maduro Stole Venezuela's Vote.' 'Maduro is safe in office,' said Corrales, 'but he and his allies recognize they are moving forward with a big lie and have no other way to justify what they are doing except by relying on the military.' Gonzalez, who has been crisscrossing the Americas this week after fleeing to Spain in September, appeared to walk back a pledge to return to Venezuela to take office himself on January 10, saying instead he'd be back 'very soon.' 'It's evident that a regime like that represents a threat to the hemisphere,' he said while visiting the Dominican Republic, where he met with President Luis Abinader and a delegation of former presidents from across Latin America. 'That is why we Venezuelans are determined to persevere in this fight until the end.' Electoral council declares Maduro winner Venezuela's National Electoral Council, also stacked with government loyalists, declared Maduro the winner of the election. But unlike in previous contests, authorities did not provide any access to voting records or precinct-level results. The opposition, however, collected tally sheets from 85% of electronic voting machines and posted them online. They showed that its candidate, Edmundo Gonzalez, had thrashed Maduro by a more than 2-to-1 margin. Experts from the United Nations and the Atlanta-based Carter Center, both invited by Maduro's government to observe the election, have said the tally sheets published by the opposition are legitimate. The U.S. and other governments have also recognized Gonzalez as Venezuela's president-elect. Even many of Maduro's former leftist allies in Latin America plan to skip Friday's swearing-in ceremony. U.S. President Joe Biden, meeting Gonzalez at the White House this week, praised the previously unknown retired diplomat for having 'inspired millions.' 'The people of Venezuela deserve a peaceful transfer of power to the true winner of their presidential election,' Biden said following the meeting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuelan-opposition-leader-emerges-from-hideout-to-join-anti-maduro-rally/7931304.html	2025-01-09T12:23:54-08:00	
Biden administration battles on against plea deal for accused 9/11 mastermind	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration doubled down Thursday on its unusual court battle to derail a plea deal that the government itself had reached with accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed. It urged a federal appeals panel to block Mohammed's guilty plea from going forward as scheduled Friday at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Defense lawyers described the attempts to throw out the agreement as the latest in two decades of 'fitful' and 'negligent' mishandling of the case by the U.S. military and successive administrations. The fight has put the Biden administration at odds with the U.S. military officials it had appointed to oversee justice in al-Qaida's attacks on Sept. 11, 2001, that killed nearly 3,000 people. It was the latest tumult and uncertainty in two decades of troubled prosecution tied to one of the deadliest attacks on American soil. A new filing Thursday from Justice Department lawyers argued that the gravity of the 'extraordinarily important case' warranted Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin intervening to throw out the plea deal. Asked about the appeal Thursday after a meeting in Germany with allies about military support for Ukraine, Austin told reporters he had not changed his mind on the matter and cited the court challenge in declining further comment. The deal, negotiated over two years and approved by military prosecutors and the Pentagon's senior official for Guantanamo in late July, would spare Mohammed and two co-defendants the risk of the death penalty. It also obligates them to answer any lingering questions that families of the victims have about the attacks. Defense attorneys say that the plea agreements are already in effect and that Austin has no legal authority to throw them out after the fact. At Guantanamo, preparations have moved ahead for Friday's proceedings, and family members of some of the victims already have gathered. If the hearing goes forward, Mohammed would swear an oath in the military courtroom and then defense attorney Gary Sowards would enter pleas on his behalf to 2,976 counts of murder, along with other charges. Pleas by co-defendants Walid bin Attash and Mustafa al Hawsawi would follow later this month. Attorneys say months of sentencing hearings to follow would give the government an opportunity to outline its case and allow families to speak of their loss. The federal appeals panel appears on track to rule Thursday on the emergency request by the Biden administration. Legal and logistical challenges have bogged down the 9/11 case in the 17 years since charges were filed against Mohammed, who prosecutors say conceived the idea of using hijacked planes in the attacks. The case remains in pretrial hearings, with no trial date set. Years of defense and prosecution testimony have dragged on about how much the torture of Mohammed and other defendants in CIA custody renders their later statements unusable in court. With that in mind, military prosecutors notified families of the victims this summer that the senior Pentagon official overseeing Guantanamo had approved a plea deal. They called it 'the best path to finality and justice.' Austin unexpectedly announced on Aug. 2 that he was scrapping the agreement. He argued that a decision on death penalties in an attack as grave as Sept. 11 should be made only by the defense secretary. The Biden administration went to the District of Columbia federal appeals court this week after the Guantanamo judge and a military review panel rejected Austin's intervention. Mohammed's attorneys argued that Austin's 'extraordinary intervention in this case is solely a product of his lack of oversight over his own duly appointed delegate,' meaning the senior Pentagon official overseeing Guantanamo. The Justice Department said the government would be irreparably harmed if the guilty pleas were accepted. It said the government would be denied a chance for a public trial and the opportunity to 'seek capital punishment against three men charged with a heinous act of mass murder that caused the death of thousands of people and shocked the nation and the world.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-battles-on-over-plea-deal-for-accused-9-11-mastermind/7931310.html	2025-01-09T12:09:27-08:00	
Thousands protest as Austria's far-right-led coalition talks set to begin	VIENNA — Talks to form a coalition government led by Austria's far-right Freedom Party, or FPO, will begin Friday, the party said on Thursday, as thousands protested in Vienna against the prospect of the country's first FPO-led government. The eurosceptic, Russia-friendly FPO won September's parliamentary election with around 29% of the vote but was initially sidelined as centrist parties tried to form a ruling coalition without it. That effort failed at the weekend, and FPO leader Herbert Kickl was tasked with forming a government. 'First step: negotiations on the budget as of tomorrow,' Kickl said in a statement on Thursday evening while protesters carrying placards reading 'Nazis out' and 'History is repeating itself' gathered in the square that stands between the offices of the president and the chancellor. Chancellor Karl Nehammer of the conservative Austrian People's Party (OVP), who had led the centrist coalition talks, said on Saturday he was stepping down because they had collapsed. His successor as head of the caretaker government, Foreign Minister Alexander Schallenberg, is due to take over on Friday. Various nongovernmental organizations that deal with human rights, refugees and the environment called Thursday's protest. 'Our republic is at a crossroads,' the organizers said in a statement. 'The threat of an extreme right-wing chancellor looms and with him an attack on democracy, human rights, judiciary, independent media and social cohesion in our country.' More than 10,000 protesters packed tightly together on the square and streets leading into it whistled, jeered and shone their phone lights toward the chancellor's office, chanting 'Kickl out' in a peaceful atmosphere. The OVP, which under Nehammer said it would not govern with Kickl, calling him a conspiracy theorist and a security threat, now says under interim leader Christian Stocker that it prefers to reach a coalition deal with Kickl to holding a snap election. On Wednesday, however, Stocker said he demanded assurances from Kickl that he wants to keep Austria free from Russian interference — a reference to FPO positions including opposing sanctions against Moscow over Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Support for the FPO has only increased since September, polls show, and the party now has a lead of more than 10 percentage points over the OVP. 'We are entering negotiations with the FPO,' the OVP said in a statement minutes before the FPO's, confirming that Kickl and Stocker had held initial discussions and that the first issue would be the budget. 'For us, the most important cornerstones are Austria's sovereignty against foreign influence, especially from Russia, Austria as a reliable partner in the EU and our Western liberal democracy based on the rule of law,' it said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-protest-as-austria-far-right-led-coalition-talks-set-to-begin/7931300.html	2025-01-09T11:49:18-08:00

Swiss prisoner committed suicide in custody, Iran judiciary says	Iran’s judiciary said Thursday a Swiss citizen being held in the country’s Semnan prison has committed suicide. On the Iran judiciary's Mizon Online news website, Semnan Province Chief Justice Mohammad Sadeq Akbari is quoted as saying the Swiss citizen had been arrested for espionage and was being held in a suite with another prisoner. According to Akbari, the Swiss prisoner asked his cellmate to get him some food from the prison buffet and killed himself while he was alone. Akbari is quoted as saying, 'Prison officials immediately took action to save this person, but efforts to save him were unsuccessful.' The chief justice added, 'All evidence and documents from the place where this person is being held have been reviewed, and according to the documents, it is clear that he committed suicide.' There was no additional information provided regarding the identity of the prisoner or the manner of death. Iran's elite Revolutionary Guards are known for arresting dual nationals and foreigners, mostly on charges related to espionage and security. Rights groups have criticized Iran for using such arrests to extract diplomatic concessions, a claim Tehran denies. Reuters news agency reports Switzerland plays an important intermediary role between Washington and Tehran as it represents U.S. interests in Iran and shares messages between the two countries. Some information for this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/swiss-prisoner-committed-suicide-in-custody-iran-judiciary-says/7931195.html	2025-01-09T10:28:33-08:00	
World's largest dam to be built by China raises concerns in India, Bangladesh	NEW DELHI — China’s decision to build the world’s largest hydropower dam on a river that flows into India and Bangladesh has sparked concerns in both countries over the project’s potential impact on millions living downstream. Beijing last month approved the super dam’s construction — a new potential flashpoint between India and Beijing — on the lower reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River in Tibet, which is known as the Brahmaputra River in India. The river plunges some 2,000 meters (6,560 feet) along a section called the 'Great Bend' before entering India, offering huge potential to generate power. China’s Xinhua news agency describes the development as 'a safe project that prioritizes ecological protection' and says it would play a major role in meeting the country’s carbon neutrality goals. But environmentalists in India have flagged concerns about the mega-project in an ecologically sensitive, mountainous region. They say harnessing the river could affect water flow in the country’s northeastern states and Bangladesh. According to estimates, the planned project would dwarf China’s Three Gorges Dam — the world’s largest — and generate 300 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity annually. India is urging China to ensure interests of downstream states aren’t harmed by activities upstream. 'We will continue to monitor and take necessary measures to protect our interests,' Indian foreign ministry spokesman Randhir Jaiswal said last week. Defending its plans, China says the decision to build the dam was made after rigorous scientific evaluation. 'The project will not have a negative impact on the ecological environment, geological conditions and the rights and interests related to water resources of downstream countries,' Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said earlier this week in response to India’s concerns. Experts in India and Bangladesh, however, are raising questions about the project. 'The region proposed for dam construction is highly susceptible to landslides and is located on a geological fault line that intersects the Yarlung Zangbo,' said Y. Nithiyanandam, head of the Geospatial Research Programme at the Bengaluru-based Takshashila Institution. 'Planning a dam of this magnitude in such complex terrain poses significant risks to downstream regions of India and Bangladesh, especially in the event of a mishap or if there is alteration in the water flow.' The recent earthquake in Tibet that killed at least 126 people has highlighted the region’s vulnerability to such natural disasters, he said. 'This is a critical reminder to reassess the proposal for building a mega-dam in such an environment.' The proposed project’s proximity to a heavily militarized border along India’s northeastern Arunachal Pradesh state, which Beijing has renamed 'South Tibet' and claims as its own, is another point of concern. Relations between India and China witnessed a thaw last October after both sides withdrew troops from two contested border areas. But analysts say a lingering mistrust underlies the project. 'The Indian government is on alert,' Indian Defense Minister Rajnath Singh said Tuesday when asked about the Chinese project, according to the Press Trust of India. Indian foreign ministry spokesman Jaiswal said New Delhi had reiterated the need 'for transparency and consultation with downstream countries.' Some analysts say China’s failure to share details, such as environmental impact assessments about the project, exacerbate concerns. 'China acts unilaterally on issues related to trans-boundary rivers that originate in their territory. India, for example, has a treaty with Pakistan for common rivers that flow in both countries,' said Srikanth Kondapalli, professor of Chinese Studies at Jawaharlal Nehru University. 'There are also questions as to why a dam is being built in a fragile area so close to an area that is contested between the two countries.' Other analysts point to dams along the Mekong River, which flows from China into Southeast Asia. The dams have led to water scarcity in downstream countries, a fact that Beijing denies. 'When the river crosses two or three countries, it becomes important for them to have a joint look at the project and come to a joint conclusion about how it is to be managed,' said Brigadier Arun Sahgal, senior fellow at the Delhi Policy Group. 'It is especially important because, in this case, having a dam so close to the border creates a mutual vulnerability for both India and for China.' India has also planned a dam on the Brahmaputra River that it hopes will help offset the impact of China’s hydropower project. 'The Siang dam will be our counter to the Chinese mega-dam. This is a matter of national security,' Arunachal Pradesh Deputy Chief Minister Chowna Mein told reporters on Monday. China’s planned super dam has also raised worries in Bangladesh — where the river flows beyond India — that tens of thousands living along riverbanks could be affected if downstream flow is reduced. 'There would be a huge negative impact in Bangladesh,' said Malik Fida Khan, executive director of the Center for Environmental and Geographic Information Services in Dhaka. 'If there is an obstruction in the flow of the river, it could create water scarcity as well as the flow of nutrient-rich sediment, creating an ecological imbalance,' he said. 'Riverbank erosion could increase, and this will impact the lives of marginal communities as well as other economic activities in the area.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-largest-dam-to-be-built-by-china-raises-concerns-in-india-bangladesh/7931076.html	2025-01-09T08:40:06-08:00	
Chad investigates failed attack on presidential palace	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chadian troops were heavily deployed around the capital, N’Djamena, Thursday as officials said they were investigating a failed attack on the country’s presidential palace. Government troops foiled an attack by 24 heavily armed assailants on Wednesday night, officials said. President Mahamat Idriss Deby was in the palace at the time, they said, but is in good health. Eighteen attackers were killed on the spot, and the body of one attacker was found Thursday morning on the city’s streets, the military reported, adding that one member of the presidential guard died in the assault and two others were injured. Chadian Foreign Minister Abderaman Koulamallah told state TV that some 10 suspects were arrested. Koulamallah said that the reason for the attack is still undetermined but that it had nothing to do with a visit by Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi. Wang met with Deby hours earlier in the palace to discuss increased economic and military ties. The attack took place after Chad's government on Wednesday reiterated an order, first issued last month, for French troops stationed in the country to leave by Jan. 31. The reiteration followed remarks this week by French President Emmanuel Macron that African countries were ungrateful for France's role in helping to fight jihadist insurgencies. In response, Deby said that Chad is not benefiting much from military agreements with Paris and that the order for French troops to leave was irreversible and nonnegotiable. Government officials said reports on social media that the attack was carried out by armed groups that benefit from the presence of French troops and oppose military ties between Chad and China are unfounded. The unusual presence of large numbers of government troops, tactical vehicles and armored cars unsettled some residents of N’djamena, but Chadian state TV advised people to remain calm. The message, broadcast several times Thursday, said people should go about their daily activities without fear. Regardless, 27–year-old food seller Maimouna Yebgi said the presence of government troops on the streets scared people. Yebgi suggested that the troops would be better placed in villages outside the city center where the armed gangs that attacked the palace may be hiding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-investigates-failed-attack-on-presidential-palace/7931010.html	2025-01-09T08:10:38-08:00

New York's highest appeals court declines to block Trump's sentencing in hush money case	ALBANY, NEW YORK — New York's highest court on Thursday declined to block Donald Trump's upcoming sentencing in his hush money case, leaving the U.S. Supreme Court as the president-elect's likely last option to prevent the hearing from taking place Friday. One judge of the New York Court of Appeals issued a brief order declining to grant a hearing to Trump's legal team. Trump has asked the Supreme Court to call off Friday's sentencing. His lawyers turned to the nation's highest court Wednesday after New York courts refused to postpone the sentencing by Judge Juan M. Merchan, who presided over Trump's trial and conviction last May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump has denied wrongdoing. In a filing to the top New York court, Trump's attorneys had said Merchan and the state's mid-level appellate court both 'erroneously failed' to stop the sentencing, arguing that the Constitution requires an automatic pause as they appeal the judge's ruling upholding the verdict. While Merchan has indicated he will not impose jail time, fines or probation, Trump's lawyers argued a felony conviction would still have intolerable side effects, including distracting him as he prepares to take office. Trump's attorneys have argued that the Manhattan trial violated last summer's Supreme Court ruling giving Trump broad immunity from prosecution over acts he took as president. At the least, they have said, the sentencing should be delayed while their appeals play out on the immunity issue. Judges in New York have found that Trump's convictions related to personal matters rather than official acts. Trump's attorneys called the case politically motivated, and said that the sentencing threatens to disrupt the Republican's presidential transition as he prepares to return to the presidency on Jan. 20. Sentencing Trump now would be a 'grave injustice,' his attorney D. John Sauer wrote. Sauer is also Trump's pick to be solicitor general, who represents the government before the high court. The emergency motion to the U.S. Supreme Court was submitted to Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who hears emergency appeals from New York.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-york-s-highest-appeals-court-declines-to-block-trump-s-sentencing-in-hush-money-case-/7930968.html	2025-01-09T07:47:56-08:00	
UN accuses Russia of waging war of attrition against Ukraine	GENEVA — U.N. human rights experts have accused Russia of waging a war of attrition against Ukraine by pursuing a policy of mass destruction to crush the spirit of the nation. A report issued by the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, or OHCHR, Wednesday says that since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine nearly three years ago, there has been 'a dangerous escalation of hostilities,' which has had a huge, injurious impact 'on the civilian population.' U.N. Deputy High Commissioner for Human Rights Nada Al-Nashif, who presented the report to the U.N. Human Rights Council in Geneva, told the 47- member body that 'September, in fact, marked the highest number of civilian casualties since July 2022.' Most civilian casualties, she said, were caused by 'relentless attacks with aerial glide bombs, long-range missiles, and drones that contributed to the killing of some 574 civilians — an increase of 30% over the previous year.' 'Russian bombardment damaged civilian infrastructure and water, heating and transportation services, including four major attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure since mid-November,' she said. The report covers the period from Sept. 1 to Nov. 30, 2024. It documents continued and increasing gross violations of international human rights law and serious violations of humanitarian law, 'including possible war crimes.' 'We are deeply concerned by the impacts on civilians of the increased use of drones and the use of new weapons during the reporting period,' said Al-Nashif. 'Russian armed forces launched some 2,000 long-range drones in November alone, killing scores of people,' she said. 'We are also concerned about the potential increased use of anti-personnel landmines, due to the threats they pose to civilians, both now and long into the future.' The report documents 'credible allegations' of executions of Ukrainian military personnel captured by Russian armed forces, noting that 'summary executions constitute a war crime.' The OHCHR has verified the execution of 68 Ukrainian POWs captured by Russian armed forces. The office also has verified the summary executions of 170 civilians since Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, in areas controlled by Russian armed forces, including in places of detention. 'Accountability for all of these killings is essential. Instead, there is almost total impunity,' Al-Nashif said. The 26-page report also documents torture of POWs at the hands of Russian and Ukrainian armed forces, calling it 'a violation of international law.' However, the report says the torture and ill-treatment of prisoners of war carried out by Russian armed forces is far worse than it is for those captured by Ukrainian military personnel. It describes the torture of Ukrainian men and women POWs by Russia subjected to severe beatings, electric shocks, sexual violence and other abuse as 'widespread and systematic.' While Russian prisoners of war held by Ukraine also 'were subjected to torture and ill-treatment, from severe beatings to sexual violence and dog attacks,' the report notes the abuse occurred mostly in places of transit before reaching official places of internment. 'The high commissioner’s report lays bare the harrowing reality of Russia’s war against human rights and fundamental freedoms in Ukraine,' said Filipenko Yevheniia, Ukraine’s ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva. 'In the dead of winter, Russia has calculated strikes on power grids, water systems and heating infrastructure. They have left millions freezing in their homes, struggling without electricity or clean water,' she said in a statement. 'These are not unintended consequences. These are deliberate acts of terror calculated to spread suffering, target the most vulnerable, and shatter the spirit of the nation,' she said. Russia’s representative at the council sharply criticized what he called 'the selective nature and the bias of the U.N.’s pseudo human rights defender in chief' who, he said produced a report that 'hypocritically whitewashed the crimes' and numerous human rights violations in Ukraine. 'If you are so desperate to talk about Russia, then you should write about the daily shelling of Donetsk and Belgorod, of atrocities committed by Ukrainian thugs and Kursk terrorist acts on homes in various Russian regions,' said Evgeny Ustinov, first counsellor at the Russian Federation’s Permanent Mission in Geneva. 'The OHCHR clearly does not want to speak about the blatant discrimination against Russia and Russian speakers in Ukraine or about the harsh censorship, elimination of dissenters, extrajudicial executions, arbitrary detention … and crimes committed by Ukrainians against peaceful civilians in Russian cities in the Donbas, Bucha, Belgorod and other oblasts of our country,' he said. The U.S. representative disagreed with this assessment, describing the OHCHR’s documentation of Russia’s violations and abuses against Ukraine as 'exemplary.' 'Next month will mark a cruel milestone, three years of Russia’s unjust and unprovoked war in Ukraine,' said Michele Taylor, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. Human Rights Council. 'In those three years, we have seen Russia’s forces commit war crimes, and with other Russian officials, crimes against humanity,' she said, adding that 'Russia must answer for all of its reprehensible and unlawful actions.' Since Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, the OHCHR said, more than 12,300 civilians have been killed, including over 650 children, and more than 27,800 people have been injured. It said more than 700 medical facilities and 1,500 schools and colleges have been damaged or destroyed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-accuses-russia-of-waging-war-of-attrition-against-ukraine/7930919.html	2025-01-09T07:44:27-08:00	
Clock ticking on US TikTok ban	A look at some of the most popular short videos on the TikTok social media platform may prompt head-scratching about what the fuss is. There is Charli D’Amelio (nearly 156 million followers) from the state of Connecticut, dancing in an 11-second clip to a remix of a Chris Brown song. There is a smiling baby having her cheeks squeezed (400 million views). And a video clip has racked up 2.3 billion views of California illusionist Zach King riding a 'magic broomstick.' Any day now, the billions of comedy skits, dance challenges, life hacks, and cute pets and babies on TikTok could become invisible in the United States. The U.S. Supreme Court has fast-tracked oral arguments on a challenge by the Chinese company ByteDance, the owner of TikTok, to a new U.S. law that would ban the social media platform on grounds of national security. While TikTok, the most popular social media platform in the United States, has become a part of American culture, its Chinese ownership has alarmed government officials and lawmakers. Beijing’s potential access to all that personal data and the ability to shape public opinion for its American users prompted Congress to ban it, with a 352-65 bipartisan vote in the House of Representatives last March. That happened despite TikTok CEO Shou Zi Chew’s appeal to American users to fight the legislation. 'Protect your constitutional rights. Make your voices heard,' Chew, a Singaporean with a Harvard MBA, said in a TikTok video prior to the congressional action. TikTok has repeatedly stated it has ensured the data of its American users is protected from outside influence and manipulation. Parent company ByteDance has more than 150,000 employees globally, including U.S. offices in Austin, Los Angeles, New York and Seattle. Barring a reprieve by the Supreme Court, ByteDance will lose access to its largest market on Jan. 19. 'Assuming the Supreme Court upholds the law — unless the Trump administration can find some workaround, which I’m doubtful they’ll be able to — the choice is either sell TikTok or face a ban in the United States,' Alan Rozenshtein, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota School of Law, told VOA. Both President Joe Biden and President-elect Donald Trump had backed the ban. But Trump expressed a recent change of heart after his campaign videos during last year’s election performed well on the platform. 'They brought me a chart, and it was a record. It was so beautiful to see. And as I looked at it, I said, ‘Maybe we got to keep this sucker around for a little while,’' Trump said during an appearance in Phoenix in December. The Supreme Court will listen to the social media company’s appeal on Friday. The justices will weigh the national security argument against the constitutional guarantee of free speech for ByteDance’s American subsidiary and its estimated 170 million users in the United States. 'That’s one dimension of the conflict. But in another sense, it’s also a fight within free speech itself, because one thing the government is arguing is that one of the dangers of having Chinese ownership of TikTok is that the Chinese government would be able to manipulate the algorithm and therefore distort the speech environment itself,' explained Rozenshtein, who is also a senior editor at Lawfare, an online site that analyzes complicated legal and policy issues related to U.S. national security. Canadian investor Kevin O’Leary said he has informed Trump that he’s nearing a deal to buy the U.S. assets of TikTok that would save it from being banned. 'I wanted to let him know, as well as others in his Cabinet, that we’re doing this, and we’re going to need their help,' O’Leary, best known as one of the hosts of the reality TV program Shark Tank, told Fox News. Trump has asked the Supreme Court to put the case on hold so he can negotiate a sale of the platform following his second inauguration on Jan. 20 —- the day after the ban is set to go into effect. In the meantime, another sharing app owned by ByteDance — Lemon8 — is sponsoring posts on TikTok encouraging users to migrate there.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clock-ticking-on-us-tiktok-ban/7930942.html	2025-01-09T07:28:15-08:00	
Lebanon's parliament chooses army commander Aoun as president, ending long deadlock	Beirut — Lebanon's parliament voted Thursday to elect the country's army commander, Joseph Aoun, as head of state, filling a more than two-year-long presidential vacuum. The vote came weeks after a tenuous ceasefire agreement halted a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah and at a time when Lebanon's leaders are seeking international assistance for reconstruction. Aoun, no relation to former president Michel Aoun, was widely seen as the preferred candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, whose assistance Lebanon will need as it seeks to rebuild. The session was the legislature's 13th attempt to elect a successor to Michel Aoun, whose term ended in October 2022. Hezbollah previously backed another candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, the leader of a small Christian party in northern Lebanon with close ties to former Syrian President Bashar Assad. However, on Wednesday, Frangieh announced he had withdrawn from the race and endorsed Aoun, clearing the way for the army chief. Randa Slim, a senior fellow at the Washington, D.C.-based Middle East Institute, said that the military and political weakening of Hezbollah following its war with Israel and the fall of its ally, Assad, in Syria, along with international pressure to elect a president paved the way for Thursday's result. In a first round of voting Thursday, Aoun received 71 out of 128 votes but fell short of the two-thirds majority needed to win outright. Of the rest, 37 lawmakers cast blank ballots and 14 voted for 'sovereignty and the constitution.' In the second round, he received 99 votes. Lebanon's fractious sectarian power-sharing system is prone to deadlock, both for political and procedural reasons. The small, crisis-battered Mediterranean country has been through several extended presidential vacancies, with the longest lasting nearly 2 1/2 years between May 2014 and October 2016. It ended when former President Michel Aoun was elected. The president's role in Lebanon is limited under the power-sharing system in which the president is always a Maronite Christian, the prime minister a Sunni Muslim and the speaker of parliament Shiite. However, only the president has the power to appoint or remove a prime minister and cabinet. The caretaker government that has run Lebanon for the last two years has reduced powers because it was not appointed by a sitting president. Joseph Aoun is the fifth former army commander to ascend to Lebanon's presidency, despite the fact that the country's constitution prohibits high-ranking public servants, including army commanders, from assuming the presidency during their term or within two years of stepping down. Under normal circumstances, a presidential candidate in Lebanon can be elected by a two-thirds majority of the 128-member house in the first round of voting, or by a simple majority in a subsequent round. But because of the constitutional issues surrounding his election, Aoun needed a two-thirds majority in the second round to clinch the election. Aoun, 60, was appointed army chief in March 2017 and had been set to retire in January 2024, but his term was extended twice during the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. He kept a low profile and avoided media appearances and never formally announced his candidacy. Other contenders included Jihad Azour, a former finance minister who is now the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund; and Elias al-Baysari, the acting head of Lebanon's General Security agency. Al-Baisary announced Thursday that he was pulling out of the race. The next government will face daunting challenges apart from implementing the ceasefire agreement that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war and seeking funds for reconstruction. Lebanon is in its sixth year of an economic and financial crisis that decimated the country's currency and wiped out the savings of many Lebanese. The cash-strapped state electricity company provides only a few hours of power a day. The country's leaders reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF for a bail-out package in 2022 but have made limited progress on reforms required to clinch the deal. Slim, the analyst, said that 'the fact that [Aoun] has the backing of Saudi Arabia, the U.S. and the Europeans give him a big boost in terms of being able to get things done,' Slim said. But he will still have to 'navigate the contradiction that are inherent in domestic Lebanese politics,' she said, including relations with Hezbollah, which is not only a militant group but a political party with a strong base of support. Aoun 'has never had a conflictual relationship with Hezbollah, but he has also never acquiesced to Hezbollah,' Slim said. The army commander's relative lack of experience with economic matters means he will likely lean heavily on his advisors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-s-parliament-chooses-army-commander-aoun-as-president-ending-long-deadlock/7930857.html	2025-01-09T06:57:35-08:00

Militants kidnap 16 government employees in northwest Pakistan	Islamabad — Police and security officials in northwestern Pakistan said Thursday that militants have abducted at least 16 government workers and set unclear demands for their release. The group of civilian hostages are employees of a mining project related to the state-run Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) in the militancy-hit Lakki Marwat district in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province. The men were commuting to work on a minibus when they were ambushed and taken hostage at gunpoint, area police officer Mohammad Ijaz said. The kidnappers then set the vehicle on fire before fleeing with the captives. The outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, reportedly took responsibility for the kidnapping and released a video featuring the abducted workers. Some of the hostages were seen urging authorities to ensure their safe release by complying with the militant demands but did not elaborate further. VOA could not independently verify the militant claims or the authenticity of the video. Officials say the PAEC is tasked with promoting and conducting research on the peaceful applications of atomic energy in agriculture, medicine, industry, and development projects related to nuclear power stations and electric power generation. Several districts, including Lakki Marwat, in the Pakistani province bordering Afghanistan, routinely experience TTP attacks targeting security forces and government officials. Thursday’s kidnapping came a day after heavily armed separatist militants in Pakistan’s sparsely populated southwestern Balochistan province briefly seized a government office, robbed a bank, and vandalized a police station in a remote district. The outlawed Baloch Liberation Army, or BLA, claimed responsibility for staging the attack that officials said did not cause casualties. The natural resources-rich, largest Pakistani province has experienced a spike in BLA-led insurgent attacks in recent months. The insurgents claim to be fighting for the independence of Balochistan, which borders Afghanistan. Islamabad claims that TTP and Baloch insurgents operate from safe havens in Afghanistan, and their attacks have intensified since the Islamist Taliban took power in the neighboring country in 2021. However, the de facto authorities in Kabul deny the existence of foreign militant groups within their borders, asserting that they do not allow anyone to threaten neighboring countries from Afghan soil. The TTP is designated as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations. Recent U.N. security assessments have described the TTP as the 'largest terrorist' group in Afghanistan, with up to 6,000 fighters. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militants-kidnap-government-employees-in-northwest-pakistan/7930878.html	2025-01-09T06:32:34-08:00	
Zelenskyy urges coalition aiding Ukraine not to 'drop the ball’	RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, GERMANY — Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy Thursday called it 'crazy to drop the ball now' and end support for Ukraine’s defense against Russia. 'It's clear that a new chapter starts for Europe and the entire world just 11 days from now,' Zelenskyy told the Ukraine Defense Contact Group during opening remarks in Ramstein Germany, referring to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s inauguration as president. 'We have to cooperate even more, rely on one another even more and achieve even greater results together,' he said. 'No matter what’s going on in the world, everyone wants to feel sure that their country will not just be erased of the map.' As Ukrainians fight continuing Russian assaults, international support for their fight is uncertain. Trump has not indicated whether he will continue America's leadership of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group when President Joe Biden leaves office January 20. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the group of about 50 nations has provided Kyiv with more than $126 billion in weapons, training and equipment. The U.S. has provided about $66 billion, slightly more than half of the group's aid. The group came together under U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's leadership to coordinate security assistance after the invasion. Austin on Thursday announced a $500 million in additional weapons and equipment for Kyiv, which officials say will be the final military aid package before Biden leaves office. He said the package includes additional missiles for Ukrainian air defense, more artillery ammunition, more air-to-ground munitions and equipment to support Ukraine's F-16 fighter jets. The additional U.S. weapons and equipment are being pulled from the Pentagon’s existing military stockpiles. Austin, who is hosting the group for the last time, said leading the group has been 'one of the great honors of my life.' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius thanked Austin for his leadership on behalf of the allies and partners present. 'Your personal dedication has made a major difference. Without you, your commitment and your leadership. Ukraine's fight for freedom would not have yielded the same results,' he told Austin. Austin and defense analysts have warned that failing to continue coordinated support for Ukraine could prove catastrophic. 'If tyrants learn that aggression pays, we will only invite even more aggression, chaos and war, but we are still determined to not let that happen,' Austin told the group. Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said Trump, who has been very critical of the Biden administration's handling of Afghanistan, would not want to see a similar humanitarian crisis 'on his record.' 'If you have a major curtailment or end of U.S. support for Ukraine, then you could have a major disaster in Ukraine,' he told VOA. Rather than cut Kyiv's lifeline, Bowman said, the U.S. should surge support to Ukraine in the first months of the new administration 'to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position' ahead of any peace negotiations. There is still $3.8 billion in approved funds for Ukraine that was passed by Congress in April, but the Pentagon says it can't send that aid at this time because it needs additional funds from Congress to restock its own supplies. While analysts point to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group as a high point of Austin's legacy, funding delays from Congress and deliberations within the Biden administration on what weapons to give Kyiv have hampered Ukraine's fight. Bowman said that too often, when Ukraine asked for something, the Biden administration told them no and then maybe before finally saying yes. 'During that time period, we saw Russians advancing, Ukrainians dying and the delay being costly,' he said. Officials said the administration hopes the latest aid package, along with other commitments from the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, could put Kyiv in a stronger negotiating position. They also told reporters that at least 80% of the American weapons and equipment promised to Kyiv from U.S. stockpiles would reach Ukraine before Biden leaves office. One notable exception, a senior defense official said, is a group of military vehicles that are still being refurbished to be used on the battlefield.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zelenskyy-urges-coalition-aiding-ukraine-not-to-drop-the-ball/7930885.html	2025-01-09T06:26:14-08:00

China aims to deepen Central Asia influence with new railway project	Washington — A major railway project connecting China and Central Asia is set to begin construction in July, after over two decades of negotiation. Spanning more than 400 kilometers, the China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway project, or CKU, is planned to start in Kashgar City in China’s northwestern Xinjiang autonomous region, pass through the Torugart Pass into Kyrgyzstan, continue west through the Kyrgyz border city of Jalalabad, and end in the eastern Uzbek city of Andijan, according to Chinese state media. Construction of the railway was stalled for more than 20 years by financing and technical issues and attempts by Russia and Kazakhstan to dissuade Beijing from funding the project, some regional observers told VOA. However, analysts say regime changes in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan since 2016 and Russia’s Ukraine war have paved the way for the three countries to agree on starting the construction. While Uzbekistan had been concerned with some of the issues that had come up with the project, President Shavkat Mirziyoyev's government 'is opening up to the project since it has been something that Uzbekistan has been planning for decades,' said Temur Umarov, a Central Asia specialist at the Carnegie Russia Eurasia Center, in Berlin. He said Kyrgyzstan was 'skeptical' about the CKU under the previous administration because some political elites benefited from Kyrgyzstan’s geographic advantage of being between China and other Central Asian countries that do not border China. These people would 'sell some products from China to those Central Asian countries,' he told VOA by phone. 'But the current Kyrgyz president, Sadyr Japarov, has talked about the project since his early days in office and it is one of the most important political projects to his presidency,' Umarov added. In addition to the Uzbek and Kyrgyz governments’ changing attitudes, other experts say the Ukraine war has prompted China and Central Asian countries to seek new transit routes to Europe. Landlocked Central Asia’s trade mainly goes through Russia and most of China’s trade with Europe under its Belt and Road Initiative also goes through Russia, Edward Lemon, a China-Central Asia relations specialist at Texas A&M University, said. 'All three countries are seeking alternatives, including greater trade among themselves and other routes via Iran and the Middle Corridor across the Caspian Sea. The railway forms part of those routes,' he told VOA in a written response. The Middle Corridor refers to the Trans-Caspian International Transport Route that starts in Turkey and passes through the Caucasus region, the Caspian Sea, Central Asia and Western China. It is the shortest route between western China and Europe. The railway project is one of several railway projects under China’s Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, a global infrastructure project including more than 150 countries and 32 international organizations. In Southeast Asia, China is trying to build the Kunming–Singapore Railway, also known as the Pan-Asia Railway, which would include three routes linking Kunming to Singapore via Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Malaysia through connections with previously existing rail lines in those countries. Under the current plan for CKU, China will build the Chinese section of the railway, and Uzbekistan will focus on upgrading its section. A joint venture authorized by the three countries, CKU Railway Co., will help finance and build the Kyrgyz section of the railway. Leaders from China, Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan praised the project prospects last month. During a Dec. 27 commencement ceremony in the Kyrgyz city of Jalalabad, Chinese President Xi Jinping said in his congratulatory letter that the CKU should be made into a 'new demonstration project for Belt and Road cooperation' that would 'contribute to the economic and social development and the improvement of people's well-being in the region.' Kyrgyzstan’s president, Sadyr Japarov, who attended the ceremony, described the project as 'a strategic bridge' that will 'strengthen inter-regional ties' and enhance Central Asia’s competitiveness as an international transport and transit hub. In his remarks, read by Deputy Prime Minister for Trade and Investment Jamshid Khodjaev, Uzbek President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said CKU would 'further expand multifaceted cooperation and strengthen the strategic partnership among our countries.' Umarov said Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan could both benefit from the CKU. 'Uzbekistan used to rely on Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan as the middlemen in trade with China but now with the railway, it would be much easier for them to export products to the Chinese market,' he told VOA. 'Kyrgyzstan could use the project to resolve its domestic connectivity issues and this will lead to growing economic opportunities in the cities that the railway would go through,' he added. As for China, Umarov thinks the railway project could allow Beijing to 'be more present in Central Asia from the trade and economic perspective, which is part of Beijing’s strategy to deepen relations with countries in the region.' Some Chinese analysts say CKU could also play a crucial role in connecting Asia and Europe. Zhang Hong, a research fellow at the Institute of Russian, Eastern European and Central Asian Studies of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, told China’s state-run tabloid Global Times that CKU 'represents a significant opportunity for enhancing cooperation between Asia and Europe, as it will probably offer the shortest route for transporting goods from China to Europe and the Middle East via the China-Europe freight train.' In addition to increasing presence in Central Asia, experts say China will try to use CKU to promote and advance the BRI, which has struggled to attract more countries. 'The current BRI projects in place are not doing well and some have been facing a lot of delays,' said Niva Yau, an expert on China-Central Asia relations at the Atlantic Council’s Global China Hub. 'At such a time, signing on this project helps remind people what the BRI is about,' she told VOA by phone, adding that the initiation of CKU also helps maintain China’s image as a provider to Central Asia. Despite these benefits, Yau and Umarov both said there are still some problems facing construction of CKU. 'They are building a railway across mountains that requires drilling of tunnels and sophisticated technologies that only China has domestically,' Yau said. 'We're talking about a pathway in Kyrgyzstan, which does not even have [electricity] or waterways or any of those things. Various basic things have not even met the conditions yet,' she added. In addition to technical problems, Umarov said the project could make Kyrgyzstan overindebted to China. Kyrgyzstan’s debt to China is about one-third of its gross domestic product 'and relying more on Chinese investment on this big project will definitely be a big challenge for its economy,' he told VOA. Lemon said while China could boost its image in Central Asia through CKU, Russia may feel further excluded from the region once the project is completed. 'Central Asia’s dependence on Russia as a transit country for trade has been key to its leverage over the region. But in the end, as it is distracted with the war in Ukraine and in desperate need of allies in the region, there isn’t much [Russia] can really do about it,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-aims-to-deepen-central-asia-influence-with-new-railway-project/7930839.html	2025-01-09T06:01:04-08:00	
Why are students in Seychelles learning Mandarin and what's in it for China?	China has been on a building spree in the Seychelles, a small country in the Indian Ocean. But there’s more to the diplomatic push than bricks and mortar. Beijing has also been investing in education, as a soft power approach to the strategically located archipelago.

Beijing says EU imposed unfair trade barriers on Chinese firms	Beijing — China said Thursday that an investigation had found the European Union imposed unfair 'trade and investment barriers' on Beijing, marking the latest salvo in long-running commercial tensions between the two economic powers. Officials announced the probe in July after Brussels began looking into whether Chinese government subsidies were undermining European competition. Beijing has consistently denied its industrial policies are unfair and has threatened to take action against the EU to protect Chinese companies' legal rights and interests. The commerce ministry said Thursday that the implementation of the EU's Foreign Subsidies Regulation (FSR) discriminated against Chinese firms and 'constitutes trade and investment barriers.' However, it did not mention whether Beijing planned to take action in response. The two are major trade partners but are locked in a wide-ranging standoff, notably over Beijing's support for its renewables and electric-vehicle sectors. EU actions against Chinese firms have come as the 27-nation bloc seeks to expand renewable energy use to meet its target of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. But Brussels also wants to pivot away from what it views as an overreliance on Chinese technology at a time when many Western governments increasingly consider Beijing a potential national security threat. When announcing the probe, the ministry said its national chamber of commerce for importing and exporting machinery and electronics had filed a complaint over the FSR measures. The 20-page document detailing the ministry's conclusions said their 'selective enforcement' resulted in 'Chinese products being treated more unfavorably during the process of export to the EU than products from third countries.' It added that the FSR had 'vague' criteria for investigating foreign subsidies, placed a 'severe burden' on the targeted companies and had opaque procedures that created 'huge uncertainty.' EU measures such as surprise inspections 'clearly exceeded the necessary limits,' while investigators were 'subjective and arbitrary' on issues like market distortion, according to the ministry. Companies deemed not to have complied with probes also faced 'severe penalties,' which placed 'huge pressure' on Chinese firms, it said. The European Commission on Thursday defended the FSR, saying it was 'fully compliant with all applicable EU and World Trade Organization rules.' 'All companies, regardless of their seat or nationality, are subject to the rules,' a commission spokesperson said in a statement. 'This is also the case when applying State aid or antitrust rules.' Projects curtailed The Chinese commerce ministry said FSR investigations had forced Chinese companies to abandon or curtail projects, causing losses of more than $2.05 billion. The measures had 'damaged the competitiveness of Chinese enterprises and products in the EU market,' it said, adding that they also hindered the development of European national economies and undermined trade cooperation between Beijing and Brussels. The EU's first probe under the FSR in February targeted a subsidiary of Chinese rail giant CRRC, but closed after the company withdrew from a tender in Bulgaria to supply electric trains. A second probe targets Chinese-owned solar panel manufacturers seeking to build and operate a photovoltaic park in Romania, partly financed by European funds. In October, Brussels imposed extra tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars after an anti-subsidy investigation under a different set of rules concluded Beijing's state support was unfairly undercutting European automakers. Beijing in response announced provisional tariffs on brandy imported from the EU, and later imposed 'temporary anti-dumping measures' on the liquor. Last month, China said it would extend the brandy investigation, citing the case's 'complexity.' Separately, a report by the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China warned that firms were being forced to drastically localize their operations to suit China's regulations, driving up costs and reducing efficiency. Heightened trade tensions and Beijing's 'self-reliance policies' were causing many multinationals 'to separate certain China-based functions, or even entire operations, from those in the rest of the world,' it said. It added that governance rules increasingly dominated by national security concerns had heightened uncertainties for local entities in engaging with European clients. Some customers are therefore choosing to 'err on the side of caution and not take a risk by buying from a foreign service provider,' Chamber head Jens Eskelund said at a media event on Thursday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/beijing-says-eu-imposed-unfair-trade-barriers-on-chinese-firms/7930784.html	2025-01-09T05:06:39-08:00	
Jimmy Carter's woodworking, painting and poetry reveal introspective Renaissance Man	PLAINS, Ga. — The world knew Jimmy Carter as a president and humanitarian, but he also was a woodworker, painter and poet, creating a body of artistic work that reflects deeply personal views of the global community — and himself. His portfolio illuminates his closest relationships, his spartan sensibilities and his place in the evolution of American race relations. And it continues to improve the finances of The Carter Center, his enduring legacy. Creating art provided 'the rare opportunity for privacy' in his otherwise public life, Carter said. 'These times of solitude are like being in another very pleasant world.' ‘One of the best gifts of my life’ Mourners at Carter’s hometown funeral will see the altar cross he carved in maple and collection plates he turned on his lathe. Great-grandchildren in the front pews at Maranatha Baptist Church slept as infants in cradles he fashioned. The former president measured himself a 'fairly proficient' craftsman. Chris Bagby, an Atlanta woodworker whose shop Carter frequented, elevated that assessment to 'rather accomplished.' Carter gleaned the basics on his father’s farm, where the Great Depression meant being a jack-of-all-trades. He learned more in shop class and with Future Farmers of America. 'I made a miniature of the White House,' he recalled, insisting it was not about his ambitions. During his Navy years, Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter chose unfurnished military housing to stretch his $300 monthly wage, and he built their furniture himself in a shop on base. As president, Carter nurtured woodworking rather than his golf game, spending hours in a wood shop at Camp David to make small presents for family and friends. And when he left the White House, West Wing aides and Cabinet members pooled money for a shopping spree at Sears, Roebuck & Co. so he could finally assemble a full-scale home woodshop. 'One of the best gifts of my life,' Carter said. Working in their converted garage, he previewed decades of Habitat for Humanity work by refurbishing their one-story house in Plains. He also improved his fine woodworking skills, joining wood without nails or screws. He also bought Japanese carving tools, and fashioned a chess set later owned by a Saudi prince. Not just any customer Carter frequented Atlanta’s Highland Woodworking, a shop replete with a library of how-to books and hard-to-find tools, and recruited the world’s preeminent handmade furniture maker, Tage Frid, as an instructor, Bagby said. Still hanging near the store entrance is a picture of Frid, who died in 2004, teaching students including a smiling former president at the front of the class. 'He was like a regular customer,' Bagby said, other than the 'Secret Service agents who came with him.' Carter built four ladder-back chairs out of hickory in 1983, and Sotheby’s auctioned them for $21,000 each at the time, the first of many sales of Carter paintings and furniture that raised millions to benefit The Carter Center. It was rarely about the money, though. Jill Stuckey, a longtime friend who would have the Carters over to her home in Plains, recalled seeing the former president carrying out one of her chairs. 'I said, ‘What are you doing?’' she recalled. 'He said, ‘It’s broken. I’m going to take it home and fix it.’' He was at her back door at 7:30 the next morning, holding her repaired chair. Carter compared woodworking to the results of his labor as a Navy engineer, or as a boy on the farm: 'I like to see what I have done, what I have made.' ‘No special talent,’ but his paintings drive auctions Carter employed a folk-art style as a late-in-life amateur painter and claimed 'no special talent,' but a 2020 Carter Center auction drew $340,000 for his painting titled 'Cardinals,' and his oil-on-canvas of an eagle sold for $225,000 in 2023, months after he entered hospice care. Carter’s work hangs throughout the center’s campus. A room where he met with dignitaries is encircled with birds he painted after he and Rosalynn took on bird watching as a hobby. Near the executive offices are a self-portrait and a painting of Rosalynn in their early post-presidential years, hanging across from a trio of Andy Warhol prints showing Carter in office. Carter’s earliest years predominate, with boyhood farm scenes and portraits of influential figures like his father James Earl Carter Sr., whose death in 1953 led him to abandon a Navy career and eventually enter politics in Georgia. Some of his subjects, including both of his parents, are looking away. Carter's likeness of his mother shows 'Miss Lillian' as a 70-year-old Peace Corps volunteer in India. Jason Carter said the piece was particularly meaningful to his grandfather, who lost reelection at a relatively youthful 56. 'When he got out of the White House, she was standing there saying, ’Well, I turned 70 in the Peace Corps. What are you going to do?' Jason Carter said. One Carter subject who meets his gaze is a young Rosalynn — they married when she was 18 and he was 21. He described her as 'remarkably beautiful, almost painfully shy, obviously intelligent, and yet unrestrained in our discussions.' Another who doesn’t look away is Rachel Clark, a Black sharecropper who had hosted the future president after they worked in the fields. 'Except for my parents, Rachel Clark was the person closest to me,' Carter wrote of his childhood. ‘Just a word of praise’ Carter wrote more than 30 books — even a novel — but was most introspective in poetry. On his first real recognition of Jim Crow segregation: 'A silent line was drawn between friend and friend, race and race.' On his Cold War submarine’s delicate dance with enemies: 'We wanted them to understand ... to share our love of solitude ... the peace we yearned to keep.' Rosalynn’s smile, he gushed, silenced the birds, 'or may be I failed to hear their song.' Perhaps Carter’s most revealing poem, 'I Wanted to Share My Father’s World,' concerns the man who never got to see his namesake son’s achievements. He wrote that he despised Earl’s discipline, and swallowed hunger for 'just a word of praise.' Only when he brought his own sons to visit his dying father did he 'put aside the past resentments of the boy' and see 'the father who will never cease to be alive in me.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-s-woodworking-painting-and-poetry-reveal-introspective-renaissance-man/7930760.html	2025-01-09T04:32:07-08:00	
Schools cancel classes across Southern US as another burst of winter storms move in	Dallas, Texas — Schools and buildings from Texas to Georgia were shut down Thursday or prepared to close ahead of freezing rain and snow forecast for much of the Southern U.S. as another burst of plunging temperatures and winter storms threatened to again snarl travel. Texas schools canceled classes for more than 1 million students in anticipation of icy and potentially dangerous conditions that could last into Friday. Closures also kept students home in Kansas City and Arkansas' capital, Little Rock, while Virginia's capital, Richmond, remained under a weather-related boil advisory. The cold snap coincided with rare January wildfires tearing through the Los Angeles area, forcing residents to flee from burning homes through flames, ferocious winds and towering clouds of smoke. Texas braces for snow In the Dallas area, crews treated roads ahead of the expected Thursday arrival of about 5 to 10 centimeters of snow. Up to 12.7 centimeters was expected farther north near Oklahoma, according to the National Weather Service. Gov. Greg Abbott said the state deployed emergency crews in advance and urged residents to avoid driving in bad weather if possible. Boston native Gina Eaton, who stocked up on groceries in Dallas ahead of the storm, said she has some trepidation sharing roads with drivers unaccustomed to ice and snow. 'Even if there is ice, I’m very comfortable driving in it,' Eaton said. 'It’s just other people that scare me.' Roads could be slick Friday as 75,000 fans were expected head to AT&T Stadium in Arlington for the college football championship semifinal between Texas and Ohio State in the Cotton Bowl. Arlington spokesperson Susan Shrock said crews will be ready to address any hazardous road conditions. Southern discomfort A mix of sleet, snow and freezing rain was expected along a stretch from New Mexico to Alabama. Forecasters said the heaviest amounts were likely in parts of Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma and Texas. The system was expected to push northeastward by Friday with heavy snow and freezing rain all the way to the Virginia and North Carolina coasts. As much as about 20 centimeters of snow could fall in parts of Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee and West Virginia through Saturday, the weather service said. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp announced the closure of some state offices on Friday. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said city offices would be closed, with employees working remotely. Tennessee Emergency Management Agency Director Patrick Sheehan said he expected schools across the state to close Friday, although decisions will be made at the local level. The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole, but it sometimes ventures south into the U.S., Europe and Asia. Some experts say such events are happening more frequently, paradoxically, because of a warming world. The agricultural impact Some parts of Kansas have received nearly an entire year's average of snow over the past few days, hitting farmers and ranchers 'in ways that we haven't seen in this area for a very, very long time, potentially a lifetime,' said Chip Redmond, a meteorologist at Kansas State University. Calves are especially at risk and can die when temperatures slip below zero. And so much snow in rural areas can keep farmers from reaching herds with food and water In northern Florida, growers were most concerned about ferns that are cultivated for floral arrangements, with Valentine's Day only a month away.	https://www.voanews.com/a/schools-cancel-classes-across-southern-us-as-another-burst-of-winter-storms-move-in-/7930748.html	2025-01-09T04:14:45-08:00	
Palestinian health officials say Gaza death toll tops 46,000	Gaza’s Health Ministry reported 70 new deaths Thursday in the Israel-Hamas war, pushing the total number of Palestinians killed to more than 46,000 since the conflict began in October 2023. In addition to those killed, the ministry said more than 109,300 people have been injured. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count, but has said more than half the victims are women and children. The war in Gaza began with the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. There are still about 100 hostages being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Egypt, Qatar and the United States are leading efforts to try to secure a cease-fire between Israel and Hamas with the release of hostages and a surge of humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday said a deal was 'very close,' and that he hopes to secure an agreement before President Joe Biden’s term ends on January 20. 'I hope that we can get it over the line in the time that we have left, but if we don’t, then the plan that President Biden put forward for a ceasefire-hostage deal will be handed over to the incoming administration,' Blinken said. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinian-health-officials-say-gaza-death-toll-tops-46-000/7930745.html	2025-01-09T04:00:35-08:00	
Mozambique opposition leader returns from self-exile, police use tear gas on supporters	MAPUTO — Mozambique opposition leader Venancio Mondlane returned from self-exile on Thursday, defiantly claiming to have won a hotly contested October election, but security forces later used tear gas to disperse supporters who had gathered to greet him. The disputed Oct. 9 poll, which Mondlane says was rigged, has sparked demonstrations over the past few months in which hundreds of protesters have been killed in the southern African nation of 35 million. 'My return does not result from any political agreement. My return is a unilateral decision to be in Mozambique,' he told reporters at Maputo airport upon his return. 'I’m here to prove that I didn't leave Mozambique out of fear,' he said, ending a period of exile that began a few days after the vote, when Mondlane had said his life was in danger. Mondlane's return could further exacerbate protests which have continued sporadically since the electoral commission declared victory in mid-October for the candidate of the ruling Frelimo party, extending its half-century in power. The official winner of the presidential vote, Daniel Chapo, is to be sworn in next week, another potential flashpoint in Mozambique's political crisis. Chapo and Frelimo deny accusations of electoral fraud. Mondlane reiterated his view that he was the true winner of the election, despite officially only securing 20% of the vote. 'I, Venancio Mondlane, (am the) president elected by the Mozambicans,' he said at the terminal, holding a Bible. 'Not by the Constitutional Council, not by the national commission of elections, but by the genuine will of the people.' Tear gas Thousands of cheering supporters appeared near the airport to greet him, before riot police armed with tear gas moved in to disrupt the gathering. A Reuters witness said snipers were positioned on buildings around the air base. Civil society monitoring group Plataforma Decide has said at least 278 people died in post-election violence, which has also hurt businesses and disrupted border access with neighboring South Africa. Some people have fled to neighboring Malawi and Eswatini to escape the violence. Mozambique's top court confirmed in December Frelimo's election victory - despite multiple reports from observers that it was not free and fair - triggering a fresh round of protests. Frelimo has ruled Mozambique since the end of the war against Portuguese colonial rule in 1975, clinging on throughout a 15-year civil war that killed a million people before a 1992 truce.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-opposition-leader-returns-from-self-exile-police-use-tear-gas-on-supporters/7930726.html	2025-01-09T03:44:44-08:00	
South Sudan announces plan to resume oil production	Juba, South Sudan — South Sudan announced early this week its plan to produce at least 90,000 barrels of crude oil per day as the country resumes normal production. This comes after oil supply to international markets were cut off last February because of the ongoing conflict in Sudan. Ninety percent of South Sudan’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) comes from its rich fossil reserves. In the last 11 months, the country was unable to sell its oil to international markets after Sudan evoked the force majeure clause, which protected it from liability following the outbreak of conflict in Khartoum in early 2023. The ban was lifted on January 4, allowing neighboring South Sudan to resume production. Puot Kang Chol, South Sudan's minister of petroleum, said, 'With the force majeure having been officially lifted by the government of Sudan, through its letter dated the 4th 2025 and based on that, the Ministry of Petroleum and partners would like to declare that the kickoff date of resumption is tomorrow. This is basically to say our ‘D-Day’ that we have been waiting for is tomorrow, the 8th of January, 2025.' Chol is adamant that Juba will continue to pump more oil to the global market even as the work to replace fossil fuels with green energy picks up momentum. 'We will continue to produce. ... South Sudan, and not only South Sudan, the continent called Africa, will continue to use oil resources for its own survival,' he said. While Chol was making clear South Sudan’s position on clean energy, or lack of it, in Gudele, a suburb in the capital, Juba, Betty Yobu, a citizen, is battling a chronic heart condition due to prolonged exposure to toxic gases. Betty said she has been using charcoal stoves for the past six years at her restaurant which targets low-income earners. The continuous exposure to carbon monoxide gases has made her health deteriorate. 'I started feeling not OK, especially my chest. Because of the heavy work, no rest, my health became weak, and maybe I was thinking that it was because of the heavy work. I decided to go and see a doctor, and they found out that I started developing chest problems because of the firewood I was using, the charcoal. Then, I breathe in the carbon monoxide, and they affected my health,' she said. But Chol insists that Juba will use its resources for the betterment of its people. 'Now, we are faced with the reality, and the reality is, ‘I go hungry, have no food, I will die.’ We are faced with the reality that you have a woman who [has] no access to health care, and the only resource that you have that can allow you health care is the oil resources. We will not abandon it, because death is death,' he said. In 2022, then-Finance Minister Agak Achuil said that South Sudan’s oil had been sold until 2027, and that any revenue coming from the sale of crude oil was going toward the repayment of loans. Agak later said he was misquoted. He was fired by President Salva Kiir within a week. Environmentalists continue to criticize the oil sector. In 2018, South Sudan lawmakers accused the Dar Petroleum consortium operating blocks 3 and 7 of dumping chemicals near Bentiu, home to an oil block. 'For any operations to restart in block 3 and 7, I think all environmental safeguards must be put in place,' Joseph Africano Bartel, undersecretary of Ministry of Environment and Forestry. Despite the challenges that will come with the latest pronouncement of plans to resume oil production, Juba and Khartoum are optimistic that it will alleviate a significant financial burden for both governments. South Sudan, which is ranked third in sub-Saharan Africa for oil reserves, produces approximately 3.5 billion barrels annually.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-announces-plan-to-resume-oil-production/7930709.html	2025-01-09T03:33:38-08:00	
Lebanon's parliament trying again to pick a president	BEIRUT — Lebanon’s parliament convened Thursday to make yet another effort to elect a president, filling a vacuum that's lasted for more than two years. While 12 previous attempts have failed to choose a successor to former President Michel Aoun, whose term ended in October 2022, there are indications that Thursday's vote may produce a head of state. The leading candidate is Lebanese army commander Joseph Aoun, no relation to the former president. He is widely seen as the preferred candidate of the United States and Saudi Arabia, whose assistance Lebanon will need as it seeks to rebuild after a 14-month conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah. Hezbollah previously backed another candidate, Suleiman Frangieh, the leader of a small Christian party in northern Lebanon with close ties to former Syrian President Bashar Assad. However, on Wednesday, Frangieh announced he had withdrawn from the race and endorsed Aoun, apparently clearing the way for the army chief. Also Wednesday, the Lebanese Forces, which leads the main parliamentary bloc opposed to Hezbollah, endorsed Aoun. All 128 members of the legislature were present for the vote Thursday. Lebanon’s fractious sectarian power-sharing system is prone to deadlock, both for political and procedural reasons. The small, crisis-battered Mediterranean country has been through several extended presidential vacancies, with the longest lasting nearly 2 1/2 years between May 2014 and October 2016. It ended when former President Michel Aoun was elected. As a sitting army commander, Joseph Aoun is technically barred from becoming president by Lebanon's constitution. The ban has been waived before, but it means that Aoun faces additional procedural hurdles. Under normal circumstances, a presidential candidate in Lebanon can be elected by a two-thirds majority of the 128-member house in the first round of voting, or by a simple majority in a subsequent round. But because of the constitutional issues surrounding his election, Aoun would need a two-thirds majority even in the second round. Other contenders include Jihad Azour, a former finance minister who is now the director of the Middle East and Central Asia Department at the International Monetary Fund; and Elias al-Baysari, the acting head of Lebanon’s General Security agency. Al-Baissary announced Thursday that he was pulling out of the race. A president is needed to appoint a permanent prime minister and cabinet. The caretaker government that has run Lebanon for the last two years has reduced powers because it was not appointed by a sitting president. The next government will face daunting challenges apart from implementing the ceasefire agreement that ended the Israel-Hezbollah war and seeking funds for reconstruction. Lebanon is six years into an economic and financial crisis that decimated the country's currency and wiped out the savings of many Lebanese. The cash-strapped state electricity company provides only a few hours of power a day. The country's leaders reached a preliminary agreement with the IMF for a bail-out package in 2022 but have made limited progress on reforms required to clinch the deal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lebanon-s-parliament-trying-again-to-pick-a-president/7930694.html	2025-01-09T02:56:28-08:00	
As South Korea's impeached president Yoon awaits fate, his party sees signs of revival	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — A prolonged period of uncertainty over the fate of impeached South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol and a botched attempt to arrest him are giving oxygen to his backers and reviving support for his troubled party. Yoon, suspended from duties after his short-lived imposition of martial law on Dec. 3 and under criminal investigation for possible insurrection, has for weeks been holed up inside his hilltop residence in Seoul, guarded by a small army of personal security staff. In a National Barometer Survey poll released on Thursday, 59% of respondents wanted him arrested, something investigators are determined to do even though they failed last week after a widely televised six-hour standoff with his security force. Some 37% said arresting Yoon was excessive. A similar split fell in favor of the Constitutional Court, currently considering lawmakers' decision to impeach Yoon, removing him permanently. Analysts say the prospects of Yoon returning to office are unclear but the hiatus has emboldened his supporters, scores of whom braved sub-zero temperatures to gather near his residence on Thursday morning. The weeks since Yoon's impeachment have also seen a recovery in support for his ruling People Power Party (PPP), which some analysts say shows signs conservatives are uniting to fight a possible presidential election later this year. 'It seems that the attempt to arrest Yoon has reinvigorated conservatives,' said Mason Richey, a professor at Hankuk University of Foreign Studies in Seoul. He said that revival comes from both die-hard Yoon supporters, who back his reasons for declaring martial law, including unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud, and those less supportive of Yoon but concerned at the prospect of Lee Jae-myung, the liberal leader of the main opposition party, becoming president. 'If the arrest effort had succeeded, these conservatives would have been defeated for a second time, following impeachment, and that reinvigoration would possibly have been snuffed out quickly. The more that arrest attempts fail, the stronger reinvigorated conservatives will feel,' said Richey. A Realmeter poll released on Monday put the PPP's approval rating at 34.4%, up for three consecutive weeks. The main opposition Democratic Party, which commands a parliamentary majority and brought on Yoon's impeachment vote, scored 45.2%. Most pollsters in South Korea have stopped tracking Yoon's approval ratings since he was impeached by parliament, although some fringe polls have shown a rise in his personal support in recent days. As he faces the prospect of another arrest attempt, his lawyers have remained defiant, alleging that the anti-corruption officers seeking his arrest do not have authority to investigate him for insurrection, even though a court has issued a warrant. The lawyers, however, told reporters on Thursday that the Constitutional Court's decision on Yoon's political future will be accepted. Rulings by the court, one of the two highest courts in the country along with the Supreme Court, cannot be appealed. 'The president is still staying strong. He said he doesn't want people to suffer and public officials to suffer from this, but he can't accept illegal investigations,' lawyer Seok Dong-hyeon, Yoon's confidant, told supporters outside his residence on Wednesday. Jeremy Chan, senior analyst covering Northeast Asia at Eurasia Group, a U.S.-based political risk consultancy, said further attempts to arrest Yoon would likely only 'galvanize' his support and that of his party. Yoon's supporters also draw inspiration from U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who has previously made unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and faced a litany of legal troubles but made a stunning comeback in an election last year. Some of Yoon's supporters have adopted the 'Stop the Steal' slogan popularized by Trump's proponents to ramp up fraud allegations against the election watchdog. Trump has not directly commented on Yoon's situation. Lee Jun-han, professor of political science at Incheon National University, said conservative voters were more probably driven by the memory of conservatives' heavy election defeat after the impeachment of president Park Geun-hye in 2017.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-south-korea-s-impeached-president-yoon-awaits-fate-his-party-sees-signs-of-revival/7930693.html	2025-01-09T02:55:53-08:00	
Cambodian police arrest suspect in politician's Bangkok shooting	BANGKOK — Police in Cambodia arrested a former Thai marine on Wednesday over the fatal shooting of a Cambodian opposition politician in a brazen attack in downtown Bangkok. Exiled Cambodian opposition figurehead Sam Rainsy accused the country's powerful former leader Hun Sen of ordering the killing of Lim Kimya, who was also a French citizen. Lim Kimya was shot dead on Tuesday by a gunman on a motorbike as he arrived in the Thai capital from the Cambodian city of Siem Reap by bus, accompanied by his French wife. Thai police issued a warrant for the suspected shooter on Wednesday, and in the evening, Cambodia said the man had been detained at 1:50 p.m. in Battambang province, which borders Thailand. 'The gunman is a Thai national, and a former Thai marine,' Cambodian National Police spokesman Chhay Kim Khoeun told AFP. Cambodian police named the suspect as Ekkalak Pheanoi — though some Thai media gave his name as Ekkalak Paenoi — and said he would be returned to Thailand, without giving a timetable. Earlier, Sanong Sangmanee, police chief for the area of Bangkok where the shooting happened, told AFP they had little information about the suspect except that he worked as a motorbike taxi driver. Scores of Cambodian opposition activists have fled to Thailand in recent years to avoid alleged repression at home. Some were arrested and deported back to the country. Hun Sen ruled Cambodia with an iron fist for nearly four decades, with rights groups accusing him of using the legal system to crush opposition to his rule. He stepped down and handed power to his son Hun Manet in 2023 but is still seen as a major power in the kingdom. On Tuesday, Hun Sen called for a new law to label anyone who attempts to topple Hun Manet's government as 'terrorists.' 'Brutal act' Sam Rainsy, Hun Sen's long-time rival, accused the former Cambodian leader of being behind the killing. 'Hun Sen's hand can be seen behind the assassination of Lim Kimya, just as it has been behind the countless political crimes in Cambodia that have always gone unpunished,' Sam Rainsy said in a statement posted on his Facebook page. He alleged 'the motive is the same, as is the modus operandi.' Cambodian government spokesman Pen Bona told AFP the killing was in Thailand 'so Thai authorities will handle the case.' He denied the government was involved with the killing, saying opposition figures 'always accuse the government of everything groundlessly and without any evidence.' Lim Kimya became an opposition member of Cambodia's parliament following an election in 2013 in which Hun Sen's ruling party almost lost to its then-rival, the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP). The CNRP, which was founded in 2012 by Sam Rainsy and Kem Sokha and was once considered the sole viable opponent to the ruling Cambodian People's Party (CPP), was dissolved by court order in 2017. Scores of opposition politicians and MPs, including Lim Kimya, were banned from political activities following the party's dissolution. The now-dissolved CNRP said in a statement it was shocked by 'the heinous and inhumane' killing of Lim Kimya. It condemned 'the brutal act that badly threatens political freedom.' Elaine Pearson, the Asia director of Human Rights Watch, urged Thailand to carry out a 'thorough independent investigation' into the killing. 'What has happened in the last 24 hours really sends a chill down the spine for any Cambodian political activists that Bangkok is not a safe place,' she told AFP. The French embassies in Bangkok and Phnom Penh have so far declined to comment on the killing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cambodian-police-arrest-suspect-in-politician-s-bangkok-shooting/7930688.html	2025-01-09T02:48:32-08:00	
6 dead in Indian temple stampede as thousands jostle for free passes	HYDERABAD, INDIA — At least six people were killed and 35 injured in a stampede near one of India's busiest and richest temples, after thousands of devout Hindus assembled there to secure free visit passes, authorities said Thursday. The period from Friday to Jan. 19 is considered auspicious for visits to the deity at the Sri Venkateswara Swamy Temple, popularly known as Tirupati, in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, the site of Wednesday's incident. 'The stampede took place when the gate was opened,' S. Venkateswar, the district collector, or top revenue official, told reporters on Thursday. 'About 2,500 people just pushed through the gate... a few fell.' Authorities were still trying to determine what caused the stampede, he added. Tickets for visits to the nearly 2,000-year-old temple usually cost 300 rupees, or $3.50, each and are sold online. A police complaint showed the incident occurred between 7:30 p.m. and 8:30 p.m. local time, outside a school a few kilometers from the temple, where state authorities had set up counters to issue tickets. Video images showed police struggling to manage the crowd that had gathered, in clips by news agency ANI, in which Reuters holds a minority stake. People who started queuing early for the passes pushed and jostled each other, leading to the stampede, Venkateswar said, and about a dozen of the 35 injured who were taken to hospital were still being treated Thursday. Temple operator, Tirumala Tirupati Devasthanams, apologized for the incident and promised action against anyone found responsible. Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Chandrababu Naidu, a key ally of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, inspected the stampede site and visited some of the injured in hospital. YSR Congress Party, the main opposition party led by Naidu's predecessor Y S Jagan Mohan Reddy, blamed the state government for the incident, calling it an administrative failure. Modi offered condolences in a post on X, adding, 'My thoughts are with those who have lost their near and dear ones.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-in-indian-temple-stampede-as-thousands-jostle-for-free-passes/7930679.html	2025-01-09T02:38:07-08:00	
Britain plans new sanctions laws to target people-smuggling gangs	LONDON — Britain will create a new sanctions regime to target the leaders of networks that smuggle tens of thousands of people into Britain each year, as well as the often-Chinese makers of the boats and motors they use, the government said Wednesday. Under huge political pressure to cut the numbers arriving in small boats from France, the government said the laws would complement other reforms. 'We will target those profiting off putting lives at risk, and disrupt the gangs' finances,' interior minister Yvette Cooper said in a statement. The policy was due to be the centerpiece of a speech by foreign minister David Lammy on Thursday, seeking to demonstrate coordination between the foreign and interior ministries. Lammy said Britain would pursue the makers of the boats used by migrant smugglers. He told Times Radio many of the manufacturers were from China. Asked by the BBC whether the government would sanction those businesses, Lammy said: 'Absolutely, because when you look at those boats, where do the engines come from? Where does the rubber come from?' The Chinese Embassy did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The government said the sanctions would be in place by the end of the year and enable authorities to ban those linked to people-smuggling from entering Britain, punish those trying to do business with them, and freeze assets. Labour Prime Minister Keir Starmer was elected in July and immediately ditched the previous, Conservative government's plan to deport illegal migrants to Rwanda as a deterrent, instead switching focus to breaking up the gangs that organize crossings. Migrants from North Africa, the Middle East, Europe and elsewhere pay thousands of pounds to traffickers for places in small inflatable boats that then try to cross one of the world's busiest shipping channels to reach the English coast. Over 36,800 people made the crossing in 2024, 25% more than the previous year, according to government data, while dozens have died in the attempt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-plans-new-sanctions-laws-to-target-people-smuggling-gangs-/7930672.html	2025-01-09T02:08:02-08:00	
Ukraine reports destroying 46 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Thursday it shot down 46 of 70 drones that Russian forces used in attacks targeting areas in central and eastern Ukraine. Falling debris from downed drones damaged houses in the Cherkasy, Kharkiv and Sumy regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Ukraine’s air defenses also shot down drones in the Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kherson, Kyiv, Mykolaiv and Poltava and regions. The attacks came a day after Russian missiles struck the city of Zaporizhzhia, killing at least 13 people and wounding 30 others. 'There is nothing more cruel than launching aerial bombs on a city, knowing that ordinary civilians will suffer,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Wednesday. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Thursday it shot down 15 Ukrainian drones, including over the Belgorod, Bryansk and Krasnodar regions along the Russia-Ukraine border. Krasnodar Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said on Telegram that drone debris damaged a home, but that there were no casualties from the Ukrainian attack.

Imprisoned Belarus activist resurfaces after being held incommunicado for 700 days	TALLINN, ESTONIA — An imprisoned opposition activist in Belarus resurfaced Wednesday in a video shot by a pro-government blogger after more than 700 days of no contact with his family, weeks before an election that is all but certain keep the country's strongman leader in power. Viktar Babaryka, 61, has been denied meetings with his family and lawyers while serving a 14-year sentence in a penal colony after failing to get on the ballot against authoritarian President Alexander Lukashenko in a 2020 election. Babaryka was last heard from in February 2023, and other prisoners said later that year he was hospitalized with signs of beatings. Since then, authorities haven’t released any information about his condition and barred his lawyer from visits. The European Parliament has urged authorities to release him and other political prisoners. Raman Pratasevich, a former opposition journalist who later became a government supporter after being arrested himself, posted photos and a brief video in which Babaryka greeted his family. It wasn't clear when or under what conditions the images were taken, and The Associated Press could not independently verify them. Babaryka, who looked visibly thinner than in his last appearance, was pictured wearing a prison uniform bearing a yellow tag designating him as a political prisoner and thus subjecting him to particularly harsh prison conditions. Pavel Sapelka, a representative of the Viasna Human Rights Center, noted that the images were released ahead of the Jan. 26 presidential election, in which Lukashenko is seeking a seventh, five-year term to add to his more than three decades in power. 'The authorities decided to show Babaryka in the run-up to the election to avoid accusations of forced disappearance of opposition activists behind bars,' Sapelka said. 'The terribly emaciated Babaryka epitomizes the nightmare of repressions in Belarus, a sad reminder for others who dare to challenge Lukashenko.' In November, Pratasevich posted photos of Maria Kolesnikova, another prominent opposition activist who had been held for more than 20 months without any communication with relatives or friends. Babaryka is one of 1,258 political prisoners in Belarus, according to Viasna, the country's leading human rights group. Top opposition figures were imprisoned or fled the country amid the sweeping crackdown that followed the 2020 election. Authorities responded to massive demonstrations protesting vote-rigging with brutal repressions in which about 65,000 people were arrested and thousands were brutally beaten by police. At least seven political prisoners have died in custody, according to Viasna. Like Babaryka, many other opposition activists have been held incommunicado. Lukashenko pardoned some political prisoners last year but authorities launched a new wave of arrests before the election, seeking to uproot any sign of dissent. Opposition leader-in-exile Sviatlana Tsikhanouskaya, who was forced to leave the country after challenging Lukashenko in the 2020 vote, said she was happy to see Babaryka alive and demanded that authorities release information about others who have been held incommunicado, including her husband, activist Siarhei Tsikhanouski. 'We must now demand to see all others who have been held in complete isolation, and the cruel and inhumane incommunicado practice must stop,' she said. Pratasevich ran a Telegram messaging app channel widely used by participants in the 2020 protests. He was living in exile when he was arrested in 2021 after being pulled off a Ryanair flight from Greece to Lithuania that was diverted to Minsk by a bomb threat. Once in custody, he made several confessional appearances on state television that critics claimed were made under duress. He was later released and pardoned. 'We consider Pratasevich a hostage. He’s doing all what is ordered by the Belarusian authorities,' Sapelka said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/imprisoned-belarus-activist-resurfaces-after-being-held-incommunicado-for-700-days/7930665.html	2025-01-09T01:23:10-08:00	
Former President Jimmy Carter to be honored at Washington funeral	WASHINGTON — Former U.S. President Jimmy Carter is set to be honored Thursday with a funeral at Washington National Cathedral before being buried in his home state of Georgia. Carter’s living presidential successors – Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden – are due to attend the Washington funeral, with Biden delivering a eulogy. Mourners from the public were able to pay their final respects overnight at the U.S. Capitol, where Carter’s casket lay in state since Tuesday. David Smith, a professor at the Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution at George Mason University, said the former president obviously impacted his career. He told VOA that he came to the Capitol to honor the man but also to honor Carter’s causes. 'He had such an impact on so many people,' he said. 'His work on advancing minorities, appointments of women to the judiciary, protecting our environment, advocating for human rights – all those things are very important things to me.' In the Capitol rotunda – where only about 50 Americans have been recognized with this distinct honor since 1852 – Senate Majority Leader Jon Thune, in a service late Tuesday, described Carter as: 'Navy veteran, peanut farmer, governor of Georgia. And president of the United States. Sunday school teacher. Nobel Prize winner. Advocate for peace and human rights. And first and foremost, a faithful servant of his creator and his fellow man.' Vice President Kamala Harris – who on Monday in the Capitol certified the victory of the next president – extolled Carter’s policy. 'He was the first president of the United States to have a comprehensive energy policy, including providing some of the first federal support for clean energy,' she said Tuesday. 'He also passed over a dozen major pieces of legislation regarding environmental protection. And more than doubled the size of America's national parks.' Carter, who served as the 39th president, died Dec. 29 at the age of 100 after nearly two years in hospice care in the state of Georgia. Since then, his final journey has taken his remains over the skinny roads of his humble hometown of Plains; down the boulevards of Atlanta, the state capital, and through the skies to snowy Washington, for his state funeral. At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers told VOA what the 39th president meant to them. Congresswoman Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, said Carter was 'a real moral person.' 'He taught Sunday school – I did, too!' she said, smiling. 'But I think (it’s) the fact that he cared about all people. He was a people’s president.' South Carolina Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA that while he did not align with Carter politically, 'President Carter was a good man. President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved America. I didn’t agree with all of his policies, but you couldn’t (dis)agree with his patriotism, you couldn’t disagree. He just loved his country.' In late December, after receiving news of Carter’s death, Biden said, 'We may never see his like again. You know we can all do well to try to be a little more like Jimmy Carter.' Analysts say the two men have a few things in common. 'There's an obvious similarity; that is, that Carter turned out to be a one-term president, and Biden turned out to be a one-term president,' Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA on Zoom. 'And that's never a reflection of the right combination of politics and policy. In both cases, I would say that the two presidents put the policy ahead of the politics. And they paid the price for that.' When asked what Carter and Trump have in common, Galston paused. 'I don't even know how to begin to answer that question,' he said finally. 'The two are polar opposites in every respect that I can think of, except one. And that is, they both attained the presidency as outsiders.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-president-jimmy-carter-to-be-honored-at-washington-funeral/7930646.html	2025-01-09T00:16:56-08:00

Thousands more ordered to evacuate as Los Angeles wildfires spread	More than 130,000 people in the Los Angeles area were under evacuation orders early Thursday as firefighters battled multiple major wildfires that already killed at least five people and destroyed more than 1,000 structures. A new, fast-moving fire broke out late Wednesday in the Hollywood Hills, prompting the latest round of orders for people to flee to safety. Meteorologists said the dry conditions and strong winds conducive to the breakout and spread of the fires are expected to remain in place through Friday. High wind gusts had forced the grounding of planes used to help fight the fires, but officials said Wednesday the winds had eased enough for those operations to resume. 'Tonight, we have very mild wind conditions where we can get aircraft and a ton of additional resources getting their hands around this fire,' Pasadena Fire Chief Chad Augustine said. 'That’s what gives me confidence that we’re going to get a handle on this fire.' U.S. President Joe Biden has approved a federal emergency declaration for California to release federal money and resources to help battle the wildfires. The White House said late Wednesday that Biden canceled a planned trip to Italy so that he can 'remain focused on directing the full federal response in the days ahead.' 'We are prepared to do everything and anything, as long as it takes, to contain these fires and help reconstruct and make sure we get back to normal. It’s going to be a hell of a long way,' Biden said Wednesday. 'It’s going to take time.' The Defense Department pledged to provide 'additional firefighting personnel and capabilities' to California. While authorities had warned of the potential for wildfires in the Los Angeles area given the conditions this week, the blazes were more extensive than anticipated. 'The L.A. County Fire Department was prepared for one or two major brush fires, but not four, especially given these sustained winds and low humidities,' L.A. County Fire Chief Anthony Marrone said Wednesday. In addition to the Hollywood area, there were active fires in Pacific Palisades, Altadena, Pasadena and Sylmar. Thousands of hectares have burned, and the fire is continuing to spread. 'We have no percentage of containment,' Marrone said. Two thousand National Guard members have been deployed to help local firefighters. In Pacific Palisades, the fire jumped from one house to the next, pushed by hurricane-force winds. In the same area, firefighters said hydrants had run dry. 'We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades,' said Janisse Quiñones, chief executive and chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power. 'We pushed the system to the extreme.' The call for water was 'four times the normal demand ... for 15 hours straight,' she added. The fire in Pacific Palisades is the most destructive in the history of Los Angeles. With 1,000 structures burned to the ground, the Palisades fire surpasses the devastation of the 2008 Sayre Fire, which demolished 604 structures in a northern suburb of L.A.

Ex-FBI informant who made up claims about Bidens sentenced to 6 years	WASHINGTON — A former FBI informant who admitted lying about U.S. President Joe Biden and son Hunter Biden’s interactions with a Ukrainian energy company was sentenced to six years in prison Wednesday, court records showed. Alexander Smirnov pleaded guilty last month of causing the creation of a false record after falsely telling his FBI handler that he had knowledge of bribes paid by executives at Burisma Holdings to Joe and Hunter Biden, according to court documents. Hunter Biden served on the board of Burisma, a role that has attracted years of scrutiny from Republican lawmakers. Smirnov also admitted tax evasion. Prosecutors working with special counsel David Weiss, who investigated matters related to Hunter Biden, had asked U.S. District Judge Otis Wright in Los Angeles to sentence Smirnov to six years in federal prison. 'The defendant decided in 2020 to exploit the position of trust he enjoyed with the FBI in order to provide false information about one of the candidates for president of the United States in an attempt to influence the outcome of the election,' prosecutors wrote in a court filing, referring to Joe Biden’s 2020 campaign. Lawyers for Smirnov sought a four-year prison sentence, arguing Smirnov had accepted responsibility and suffered a 'personal downfall' resulting from the case. Smirnov falsely claimed in conversations with the FBI that executives at Burisma told him in 2015 or 2016, while Joe Biden was vice president, that they'd hired Hunter Biden to 'protect us, through his dad, from all kinds of problems.' Smirnov also fabricated a claim that Joe and Hunter Biden were each paid $5 million in bribes from Burisma executives, according to court documents. Republican lawmakers learned of an FBI record documenting Smirnov’s claims, which briefly became a focus of a since-abandoned effort to impeach Joe Biden. Weiss, the special counsel, also brought two criminal cases against Hunter Biden on tax and gun charges. Joe Biden issued a sweeping pardon for his son last month, ending both prosecutions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ex-fbi-informant-who-made-up-claims-about-bidens-sentenced-to-6-years-/7930576.html	2025-01-08T19:10:14-08:00	
US to pledge $500M for Ukraine at Ramstein meeting	RAMSTEIN AIR BASE, GERMANY — The United States is providing Ukraine with $500 million in additional weapons and equipment from its existing military stockpiles, in what officials told VOA will be the final military aid package before President Joe Biden leaves office. The officials were speaking to VOA on condition of anonymity ahead of the announcement, which is expected Thursday when U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin's hosts the Ukraine Defense Contact Group in Ramstein, Germany, for the last time. 'Our focus will be on maintaining momentum, delivering results, and sending a clear message: The international community stands resolute in its support for Ukraine,' Austin said. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that he will join Austin at the 25th meeting of the group, which comprises about 50 nations that came together under Austin's leadership to coordinate security assistance following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022. 'They [Ukrainians] continue to survive, but they do that with the support of the U.S. and other allied countries and coalitions through the Ukraine Defense Contact Group. And I think it's pretty clear that the Ukraine Defense Contact Group is, it's more than just a common understanding. It's a common cause,' Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said Wednesday. As Ukrainians fight to survive, that common cause to support their fight is shrouded in uncertainty. President-elect Donald Trump has not indicated whether he will continue America's leadership of the group when President Biden leaves office on Jan. 20, and current administration officials and defense analysts warn that could prove catastrophic for Kyiv. Bradley Bowman, senior director of the Center on Military and Political Power at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said that Trump, who has been very critical of the Biden administration's handling of Afghanistan, would not want to see a similar humanitarian crisis 'on his record.' 'If you have a major curtailment or end of U.S. support for Ukraine, then you could have a major disaster in Ukraine,' he told VOA. Rather than cut Kyiv's lifeline, Bowman said, the U.S. should surge support to Ukraine in the first months of the new administration 'to put Ukraine in the strongest possible position' ahead of any peace negotiations. There is still $3.8 billion in approved funds for Ukraine that was passed by Congress in April, but the Pentagon says it can't send that aid at this time because it needs additional funds from Congress to restock its own supplies. While analysts point to the Ukraine Defense Contact Group as a high point of Austin's legacy, funding delays from Congress and deliberations within the Biden administration on what weapons to give Kyiv have hampered Ukraine's fight. Bowman says that too often, when Ukraine asked for something, the Biden administration told them 'no,' then 'maybe,' before finally saying, 'yes.' 'During that time period, we saw Russians advancing, Ukrainians dying and the delay being costly,' he said. Since Russia's invasion in 2022, the group of about 50 nations has provided Kyiv with more than $126 billion in weapons, training and equipment. The U.S. has provided about $66 billion, slightly more than half of the group's aid. Officials said the administration hoped the latest aid package, along with other commitments from the Ukraine Defense Contact Group, could put Kyiv in a stronger negotiating position. They also told reporters that at least 80% of the American weapons and equipment promised to Kyiv from U.S. stockpiles would reach Ukraine before Biden left office. One notable exception, a senior defense official said, was a group of military vehicles that were still being refurbished to be used on the battlefield.

Biden administration sounds alarm about Sudan genocide	washington — The White House described Sudan’s civil war as a genocide Wednesday, a day after Washington placed sanctions on the nation’s rebel leader for his forces’ 'horrific, systematic atrocities' in a conflict that has gripped the nation for more than two years, killing tens of thousands of people and driving millions from their homes. 'This is the second genocide in a generation in Sudan,' said John Kirby, spokesperson for the White House National Security Council. He was referring to the brutal Darfur conflict, in which Sudanese Arab Janjaweed militias used scorched-earth tactics on the Fur, Masalit and Zaghawa people of western Sudan, killing at least 200,000. The scale and horror of the violence prompted the International Criminal Court to issue its first-ever warrant for genocide to Sudan’s then-president, Omar al-Bashir. 'Just think about that for a second,' Kirby said. 'The second genocide in a generation in Sudan.' Kirby named Rapid Support Forces leader Mohammad Hamdan Daglo Mousa as the leader of a wave of renewed ethnic cleansing, rape and systemic atrocities. Daglo, who is better known by his nickname, Hemedti, was a commander in the Janjaweed militia. He led the paramilitary RSF until an April 2023 clash with government forces that sparked the current conflict. The violence has plunged nearly 640,000 people in the oil-rich nation into famine, the State Department says. The United Nations estimates that 30 million people — more than half of Sudan’s population — need humanitarian assistance as a result. The U.S. sanctions target Hemedti, along with seven RSF-owned companies in the United Arab Emirates and one other individual. Among other things, the State Department said in its announcement, the sanctions block Hemedti and his immediate family members from entering the United States. The Khartoum-based Sudan Times cited an adviser to Hemedti who said, on social media, that sanctions could hamper efforts to resolve the conflict. Rights groups applauded the sanctions. Nicole Widdersheim, deputy Washington director at Human Rights Watch, called the State Department’s move 'the first step toward redefining U.S. policy in Sudan with accountability and civilian protection at the center.' She added, 'We hope to see more pressure from the United States on the parties to the conflict and U.S. allies to respond to past and ongoing atrocities and human suffering.' Brian Adeba, a senior adviser at The Sentry, a Washington-based investigative organization that tracks war crimes and human rights abuses, told VOA’s John Tanza that this was the strongest move Washington had made on Khartoum since conflict erupted in 2023. 'It is welcome, but a lot of work needs to be put into ensuring that the culprits that are committing the mass atrocities are held accountable,' he said. Adeba said it was significant that the U.S. sanctions also targeted seven Emirati firms seen to be supporting the RSF. 'And so, this one closes the loop. Not only does it target the perpetrator but also the enabler, and therefore it puts a lot of pressure on also the international community to take action against the RSF,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-sounds-alarm-about-sudan-genocide/7930555.html	2025-01-08T18:58:12-08:00	
US port strike averted as 45,000 union workers, employers reach deal	The union representing 45,000 dock workers on the U.S. East and Gulf Coasts and their employers on Wednesday said they reached a tentative deal on a new six-year contract, averting further strikes that could have snarled supply chains and taken a toll on the U.S. economy. The International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance employer group, in a joint statement, called the agreement a win-win. The deal includes a resolution in automation, which had been the thorniest issue on the table. 'This agreement protects current ILA jobs and establishes a framework for implementing technologies that will create more jobs while modernizing East and Gulf coast ports – making them safer and more efficient and creating the capacity they need to keep our supply chains strong,' the groups said. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. The talks had been extended until Jan. 15 to reach a deal on automation. Shipping industry executives, customers and analysts had been concerned that the parties would be unable to overcome their impasse, leading to a second ILA strike just days before President-elect Donald Trump's Jan. 20 inauguration. A three-day ILA strike in October had triggered a surge in shipping prices and cargo backlogs at the 36 affected ports. Longshoremen returned to work after employers agreed to a 62% wage increase over the next six years. Employers at the ports stretching from Maine to Texas include terminal operators like APM, owned by Danish container carrier Maersk, as well as the U.S. arms of other major carriers like China's COSCO Shipping and Switzerland's MSC. ILA and USMX have agreed to continue operating under the current contract until the union can meet with its full Wage Scale Committee and schedule a ratification vote, and USMX members can ratify the terms of the final contract.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-port-strike-averted-as-45-000-union-workers-employers-reach-deal/7930558.html	2025-01-08T18:51:19-08:00	
Israel says it has recovered body of hostage in Gaza	JERUSALEM — Israeli soldiers recovered the body of a 53-year-old hostage in an underground tunnel in southern Gaza, the military said Wednesday, and the army was determining if another set of remains belongs to the man's son. The discovery of Yosef AlZayadni's body comes as Israel and Hamas are considering a ceasefire deal that would free the remaining hostages and halt the fighting in Gaza. Israel says about a third of the remaining 100 hostages have died but as many as half could be dead. Yosef and his son Hamzah AlZayadni were thought to still be alive before Wednesday's announcement, and news about their fate could ramp up pressure on Israel to move forward with a deal. The military said it found evidence in the tunnel that raised 'serious concerns' for the life of Hamzah AlZayadni, 23, suggesting he may have died in captivity. Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani, an Israeli military spokesperson, said the circumstances behind Yosef AlZayadni's death were being investigated. AlZayadni and three of his children were among 250 hostages taken captive after Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel, killing 1,200 people. AlZayadni had a total of 19 children and had worked for 17 years at the dairy farm of a kibbutz that was among the communities attacked, said the Hostages Families Forum, a group representing the relatives of captives. AlZayadni's teenage children, Bilal and Aisha, were released along with about 100 hostages in a weeklong ceasefire in November 2023. The bodies of around three dozen hostages have been recovered in Gaza and eight hostages have been rescued by the army. The Hostages Families Forum said the ceasefire deal being negotiated 'comes far too late for Yosef — who was taken alive and should have returned the same way.' 'Every day in captivity poses an immediate mortal danger to the hostages,' the group said in a statement. The deaths of previous high-profile hostages have sparked large protests in Israel calling for a deal. Yosef AlZayadni's name appeared on a list of 34 hostages shared by a Hamas official with The Associated Press earlier this week, who the militant group said were slated for release. Israel said this was a list it had submitted to mediators last July, and that it has received nothing from Hamas. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Wednesday that a ceasefire and hostage deal between Israel and Hamas is 'very close,' and he hopes 'we can get it over the line' before handing over U.S. diplomacy to President-elect Donald Trump's administration later this month. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed sorrow at the news of AlZayadni's death and said in a statement he had 'hoped and worked to bring back the four members of the family from Hamas captivity.' The AlZayadni family are members of the Bedouin community, part of Israel's Palestinian minority who have Israeli citizenship. The traditionally nomadic community is particularly impoverished in Israel and has suffered from neglect and marginalization. Palestinians make up some 20% of Israel's 10 million population, and millions more live in Gaza and under Israeli military occupation in the West Bank. Eight members of Israel's Bedouin minority were abducted in the October 2023 attacks. 'We expected to bring them back alive,' said Talal Alkernawi, mayor of the city of Rahat where the men were from. 'Instead of returning them alive to their families, to raise their children, we receive them dead.' Many families fear their loved ones' fate is at risk as long as the war in Gaza rages on. Israeli forces are pressing their air and ground war against Hamas, and Palestinian health officials said Israeli airstrikes killed at least nine people in the Gaza Strip on Wednesday, including three infants — among them a 1-week-old — and two women. Israel's military says it only targets militants, accusing them of hiding among civilians. Gaza health officials say Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, while Israel says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas combatants. Hamas has been designated a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-it-has-recovered-body-of-hostage-in-gaza/7930537.html	2025-01-08T18:01:49-08:00	
Experts: Russian technology could enhance North Korea's ICBM capabilities	WASHINGTON — Russian space technologies, if transferred to Pyongyang in compensation for its support of Moscow's war on Ukraine, could enhance North Korea's intercontinental ballistic missile capabilities, U.S. experts say. 'The DPRK [North Korea] is already receiving Russian military equipment and training,' U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters Monday in Seoul. 'Now, we have reason to believe that Moscow intends to share advanced space and satellite technology with Pyongyang.' According to U.S. defense officials, North Korea has deployed an estimated 12,000 troops to Russia, of which roughly 1,000 have already fallen casualty to fighting Ukrainians in Russia's Kursk region. For months, top diplomats and defense analysts have said North Korea anticipates Russian technical assistance for nuclear and missile programs in exchange. Robert Peters, research fellow for nuclear deterrence and missile defense at the Heritage Foundation, suggested that any of Russia's technological assistance would likely aim to develop Pyongyang's ICBM program under the guise of non-military satellite programs, as solutions for space launch vehicles can be applied to ballistic missiles. 'It would be politically very challenging for Russia to announce that it is going to help North Korea with its ICBM program,' Peters told VOA's Korean Service on Tuesday. 'Russians are able to have this fig leaf of, 'Well, we're just helping North Korea with a satellite program.' But I don't think anyone's fooled by this.' According to Peters, two areas where North Korea could substantially benefit from Russia's space program: Accuracy and reliability, both of which are crucial for delivering nuclear warheads effectively. 'Getting the actual warhead package on target is no small task,' he explained. 'And the United States and also Russia has, over the past 35 years, figured out a way to get warheads on target in a way that was not possible during the Cold War.' Peters also said North Korean engineers have struggled with having warheads reliably survive reentry from space to produce yield. Vann Van Diepen, who served as deputy assistant secretary of state for international security and nonproliferation from 2009 to 2016, told VOA Korean that technologies related to satellite dispensing and maneuvering could enhance North Korea's ICBM program. 'If space launch vehicle technology or booster technology gets transferred as part of so-called 'space technology,' then that potentially could be applicable to probably liquid-propellant ICBMs,' Van Diepen said. Many satellites are known to use liquid propellants for efficiency and controllability. Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the RAND Corporation, also said satellite launch vehicles have components that could be adapted for North Korea's liquid-fueled ICBMs. 'Probably, that could be used in a liquid-fueled ICBM, giving it a longer range or a greater carrying capacity, so that it could carry more warheads,' Bennett told VOA Korean. The majority of North Korea's known ICBMs are believed to use liquid fuels. Looming threat Peters said Russia's assistance could pose a serious threat to the continental United States. 'The only reason for North Korea to build ICBMs is to target the United States, as they don't need ICBMs to target South Korea or Japan,' he said, adding that it could make East Asian allies question whether Washington, faced with a direct threat, could maintain its regional deterrence commitments. Even short of direct ICBM technology transfers, Van Diepen said enhanced North Korean satellite technology is detrimental to the U.S. and its allies. 'If Russia helps North Korea make better reconnaissance satellites — [with] higher resolution [imaging], that sort of thing — that improves North Korea's targeting ability and intelligence capability. And that, of course, is bad for the United States and for the alliance,' Van Diepen said. 'So, even without technology transfers that would help North Korea's ICBM program, it would still be a bad thing and something the United States would oppose.' In November 2023, North Korea announced it successfully launched a military reconnaissance satellite into orbit after two failed attempts. Seoul believes Russian support likely enabled that success, according to The Associated Press. Former U.S. defense intelligence officer Bruce Bechtol told VOA Korean that Pyongyang has been working to enhance satellite capabilities in intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance. 'The North Koreans put up a satellite before into orbit, but they need the specific technology that has intelligence collection on it, and that they would need to get from a benefactor, the Chinese or the Russians,' he said. 'It appears that they're getting it from the Russians, and that's disturbing.' China's stance China has been walking a fine line between the concern about Russia's possible transfer of missile technology to North Korea and its ties with Moscow and Pyongyang. 'North Korea and Russia are two independent sovereign states. How to develop bilateral relations is their own business,' Liu Pengyu, a spokesperson at the Chinese Embassy in Washington, said in an email to VOA Korean on Tuesday. On Monday, North Korea fired what it said was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile, which flew about 1,100 kilometers before landing in the sea off its east coast. The test launch was conducted two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump returns to office. Trump met North Korean leader Kim Jong Un three times during his first term, before nuclear talks between the two collapsed. Bennett and other experts suspect that Russia may well have given North Korea knowledge of materials such as the new carbon fiber, which Pyongyang claims to have used in creating the latest missile. 'They tested a hypersonic missile earlier last year, so they had already gotten some of that technology. But in almost all areas of technology, you kind of walk before you run,' Bennett said. 'The likelihood is that the Russian scientists have sat down with North Korean scientists, helping improve the vehicle from what they tested a year ago.'

Biden signs emergency declaration for California wildfires	U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday approved a federal emergency declaration for California's wildfires that will release money and resources to battle the blazes. The president warned that area's recovery will take time. The Los Angeles County Fire Department faced four life-threatening wildfires that have killed at least two people, burned more than 1,000 buildings, and forced tens of thousands of people to evacuate. 'The L.A. County Fire Department was prepared for one or two major brush fires, but not four, especially given these sustained winds and low humidities,' L.A. County Fire Chief Anthony C. Marrone said Wednesday. He said more than 2,000 hectares have burned and the fire is continuing to spread. 'We have no percentage of containment,' Marrone said. Officials have warned residents to pay attention to evacuation orders and leave when directed. Two thousand National Guard members have been deployed to help local firefighters. In the Pacific Palisades, the fire jumped from one house to the next, pushed by hurricane-force winds. In the same area, firefighters said hydrants had run dry. 'We had a tremendous demand on our system in the Palisades, Janisse Quiñones, chief executive and chief engineer of the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power, said Wednesday. 'We pushed the system to the extreme.' The call for water was 'four times the normal demand ... for 15 hours straight,' she added. Later Wednesday, support aircraft that had been grounded by the strong winds were airborne again, dropping water and fire retardant on the fire. More than 400,000 homes and businesses are without power across Los Angeles, according to poweroutage.us. Washington is supporting California's firefighting efforts with four U.S. Forest Service large air tankers and an additional tanker in on route. The federal government has also helped the firefighting efforts with 10 helicopters. Meanwhile, dozens of the Forest Service fire engines are ready to be deployed.

UN: Way forward for Syria's political transition remains unclear	UNITED NATIONS — The top U.N. envoy for Syria said Wednesday that the Syrian people and the international community need to get 'the next phase right' as the country rebuilds after nearly 14 years of civil war and the collapse of the Assad family regime. 'The way forward on political transition is unclear,' Geir Pedersen told the U.N. Security Council in a video briefing from Geneva. 'There are positive elements to build on, but also points of concern that Syrians are expressing.' A lightning offensive led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist group, seized control of Damascus one month ago, leading to President Bashar al-Assad fleeing to Russia and ending more than half a century of oppressive rule by Bashar and his late father, Hafez. Pedersen said some Syrians have expressed concerns to his office about a lack of transparency on the 'timing, framework, goals, procedures in any national dialogue conference — as well as participation, in terms of criteria for attendance and balance of representation.' The caretaker authorities said a national dialogue conference expected to take place around Jan. 5 was postponed until they could form a preparatory committee to organize a conference with broad representation. Ahmed al-Sharaa, the head of HTS and Syria's de facto leader, affirmed in an interview with Saudi television channel Al-Arabiya on Sunday that there would be an inclusive national dialogue process. He also said that drafting a new constitution could take up to three years and that elections could take up to four years. Pockets of instability U.N. envoy Pedersen also warned that there are signs of instability in some parts of the country. 'While there are many areas where law and order appears to be good, we have seen multiple reports of incidents of violence — in the coastal region and Homs and Hama in particular — including accounts of degrading and humiliating treatment,' he told the council. He said videos have been circulating of apparent abuses or extrajudicial killings of officials from the Assad government but noted reports that the new authorities had arrested some of the perpetrators. He said there are 'significant areas' outside the control of the caretaker authorities where fighting continues and poses threats to Syria’s sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity. In northeast Syria, Turkey has warned that it may step up military operations against Kurdish fighters who control a large swath of territory. Pedersen also noted that Islamic State fighters remain 'a significant concern' and said they could try to take advantage of insecurity in some areas to reassert themselves. Israel also moved quickly to eliminate potential threats from the new de facto leaders in Syria, launching hundreds of airstrikes on the country in the days after the regime collapsed. Israel’s military also moved into the zone patrolled by United Nations peacekeepers between the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and the rest of Syria. 'Such violations, along with Israeli airstrikes in other parts of Syria — reported even just last week in Aleppo — could further jeopardize the prospects for an orderly political transition,' Pedersen warned. Syria’s U.N. ambassador sought to assure the international community of the new authorities’ intentions. 'Syrian authorities also stressed that the new Syria is willing to play a positive role in the international arena,' Ambassador Koussay Aldahhak said. 'It will be a positive contributor to the promotion of international and regional peace and security, and it will not engage in any conflict or war.' He said in the month that has passed since the fall of the Assad government, the country has entered a 'new era' and Syrians have 'removed the chains of oppression and reclaimed the freedom of which they were deprived for decades.' Aldahhak said all Syrians would come together to build a state of 'freedom, equality and rule of law, to achieve prosperity and civility, to turn the page of oppression and suffering and human rights abuses.' Humanitarian situation After nearly 14 years of civil war, Syria is one of the world’s largest humanitarian crises, with 17 million people — more than 70% of the population — in need of assistance and funding in short supply. The U.N. humanitarian chief told the council that his office is releasing an additional $8 million for Syria from its emergency fund, bringing its total contribution to $20 million. Tom Fletcher urged countries to contribute to the humanitarian response plan, which calls for just over $4 billion and is only a third funded. The United States announced Tuesday it would expand authorizations for activities and transactions in Syria to help meet basic needs and provide public services or humanitarian assistance. 'This authorization is for six months, as the United States continues to monitor the evolving situation on the ground,' Deputy U.N. Ambassador Dorothy Shea told the council. 'The United States is committed to assisting Syrians in this extraordinary moment to forge a new future for and by its people.' Syria’s envoy welcomed the move and urged the U.N. and all member states to fully lift sanctions imposed on the Assad regime and provide humanitarian funding to help the country in its recovery.

Analysts weigh in ahead of ECOWAS members' exit deadline	Abuja, Nigeria — Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger are due to officially exit the West African ECOWAS bloc of nations this month, one year after announcing their withdrawal. The bloc hopes to persuade them to remain, but some analysts say growing anti-French sentiment in the region and Nigeria's own recent dealings with France could frustrate negotiations. In each of the three exiting nations, military officers seized power in recent years in the midst of jihadist insurgencies. The countries formed an alliance last year and accused ECOWAS of pandering to foreign influence while failing to secure member states’ security. In December, ECOWAS announced a six-month grace period for the countries after a summit in the Nigerian capital to try to dissuade them from leaving the bloc. Aminu Hayatu, a political science researcher at Bayero University in Kano, said Nigeria's role at the center 'in terms of leadership of ECOWAS is really in a dilemma, because at one point, it has to be able to prove to France that it is ready to diplomatically relate with France. This is very implicating for Nigeria because it has to do it in such a way that it doesn't hurt the leadership position which it is occupying in ECOWAS.' Comments by Macron Resentment of the presence of French military forces has grown across West and Central Africa in recent years and soared again recently when French President Emmanuel Macron said some African leaders showed 'ingratitude' toward French efforts to help fight jihadist insurgencies. Nigerian President Bola Tinubu, who is the chair of ECOWAS, made a three-day visit to France in late November in search of investment opportunities for Nigeria. Some analysts said that visit could be misinterpreted and cause the juntas to be more resistant to the regional bloc. In a Christmas Day interview, Niger's military leader, General Abdourahamane Tchiani, accused France of supporting militant groups in the Lake Chad region to undermine Niger's security, allegedly with Nigeria's knowledge. Nigeria has dismissed the allegations as 'baseless' and 'false.' Hayatu is worried about the trend. 'It is really a great deal of concern, and that might exacerbate the already simmering tension in terms of the diplomatic relations between Nigeria and these countries,' he said. 'It could only escalate the bitterness if Nigeria really doesn't tread carefully in the way that it is romancing the French regime in this very volatile situation that many of these countries are in.' But political affairs analyst Chris Kwaja said that 'all member states of ECOWAS are sovereign entities. Nigeria has the right to go into diplomatic relations with any other country, as long as such relationships are not designed to undermine the sovereignty of any other country. No country should decide and define for Nigeria who the friends and enemies of Nigeria should be.' Rotimi Olawale, an Abuja-based political affairs analyst, said the Sahel states could not survive long without their neighbors. 'Right now, they have strong support in their countries, [so] they will ride on that support,' Olawale said, 'but I anticipate that as economic challenges pile up, insecurities very high, citizens will demand real solutions to local problems, and with that they need a lot of support from external stakeholders, including ECOWAS.' As of now, Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso are expected to officially leave ECOWAS on January 29.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-weigh-in-ahead-of-ecowas-members-exit-deadline/7930082.html	2025-01-08T12:43:50-08:00	
US envoy says Israel will withdraw fully from Lebanon, while some Israelis call for residual presence	AMMAN, Jordan — The Israeli military withdrawal from Lebanon’s southern town of Naqoura is the second pullout since the November ceasefire agreement, analysts say. Israel is to withdraw from southern Lebanon over a 60-day period, while Lebanon’s Shiite militia Hezbollah is to retreat some 30 kilometers north from the border with Israel and dismantle its military infrastructure in the south. Filippo Dionigi, a specialist on Lebanon at Britain’s University of Bristol, told VOA there have been violations by both sides in this fragile truce. 'There was a 60-days deadline for Israel to move out of Lebanese territory and for the Lebanese army to take over control of those areas that were previously occupied by Israel. This has not happened yet for the greatest majority of the villages,' Dionigi said. 'There are 60 [villages] that are still occupied and only 3 of them have been actually evacuated by Israeli forces. On the other hand, Hezbollah has made several declarations that it reserves the right to act against Israel.' The ceasefire, brokered in part by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein, sees the Lebanese army deploying alongside United Nations peacekeepers. Hochstein told Lebanese leaders this week in Beirut that all Israeli troops will leave. 'The Israeli military started its withdrawal from Naqoura, most of the western sector, and back into Israel proper. These withdrawals will continue until all Israeli forces are out of Lebanon completely. And as the Lebanese army continues to deploy in the south and all the way to the Blue Line,' Hochstein said. The 120-kilometer Blue Line is a U.N. demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel and the Golan Heights, but it is not an official international border. Analyst Dania Koleilat Khatib, president of the Research Center for Cooperation and Peace Building in Beirut, told VOA it is necessary for Israel to withdraw fully, which also will keep Hezbollah in check. 'You should not give any excuses to Hezbollah. As long as there is a problem, it will help Hezbollah rebuild its base,' she said. However, published reports in Israel say Israeli officials are pushing to keep some troops in southern Lebanon longer than stipulated by the ceasefire agreement. Nicholas Heras of the Washington-based New Lines Institute suggested to VOA that there may be a caveat on the ceasefire deal. 'It’s very clear that the Israelis only agreed to it because the Israeli understanding is that they would have freedom of action at any point if they perceived there to be the reemergence of Hezbollah south of the Litani River, or if they felt the Lebanese army was insufficiently present south of the Litani River,' Heras said. The Litani River is situated about 30 kilometers north of the border with Israel. Heras said that from Israel’s perspective 'it’s not withdrawing its ability to act in Lebanon. It’s essentially reconsolidating its forces out of Lebanon with the posture to be able to engage in Lebanon at any point in time.' Meanwhile, analysts say it’s unclear whether Lebanon’s parliament will succeed in electing a new president Thursday, which past sessions have failed to do for more than two years amid bitter divisions between Hezbollah and its opponents. Hochstein urged political consensus to break the deadlock. His push is part of calls by both the outgoing and incoming U.S. administrations to end the fighting in Lebanon and Gaza quickly. In Gaza, Hamas leaders said they cleared a list of 34 hostages to go free in the first stage under a truce, while U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday vowed there would be 'hell to pay' if hostages are not freed before his inauguration on Jan. 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-envoy-says-israel-will-withdraw-fully-from-lebanon-while-some-in-israel-call-for-residual-presence/7930073.html	2025-01-08T12:42:05-08:00

India boosts diplomatic contacts with Afghanistan's Taliban	ISLAMABAD — India pledged Wednesday to collaborate with Taliban-ruled Afghanistan to undertake development projects in the impoverished nation that has endured years of devastating war and natural disasters. The pledge stemmed from a Wednesday meeting in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, between Indian Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri and Taliban Foreign Minister Amir Khan Muttaqi as the two countries move to strengthen bilateral trade and political ties. Misri conveyed New Delhi’s 'readiness to respond to the urgent developmental needs of the Afghan people,' India’s Foreign Affairs Ministry said after he met with Muttaqi. The Taliban said in a post-meeting announcement that the two sides reviewed the security situation in the region. Mutaqqi appreciated and thanked New Delhi for its sustained humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan. 'In view of the current need for development activities, it was decided that India would consider engaging in development projects in the near future, in addition to the ongoing humanitarian assistance program,' said the Indian statement. It added that in response to the Taliban’s request, New Delhi also agreed to provide additional material assistance to the health sector and the rehabilitation of refugees in Afghanistan. The Afghan delegation 'underlined its sensitivities to India’s security concerns.' Both countries agreed to remain in touch and continue regular contact at various levels, the Indian ministry stated. The Taliban stated that Muttaqi assured the Indian delegation that his government is pursuing a 'balanced and economy-oriented foreign policy.' He expressed his desire for political and economic relations with India, recognizing its significance as a prominent economic country in the region. '[Our] foreign minister assured the Indian side that there is no danger to anyone from Afghanistan and expressed hope for strengthening diplomatic relations and creating facilities related to visas for businessmen, patients, and students,' said the Taliban statement. It added that the Indian foreign secretary 'praised the Islamic Emirate’s fight against drugs and corruption in the country,' referring to the Taliban’s official name for Afghanistan. Misri said India was willing to expand relations with Afghanistan in political and economic areas and to promote trade through the port of Chabahar in neighboring Iran. The Taliban returned to power in August 2021 when all U.S.-led international troops withdrew from the country. No countries have formally recognized the Taliban as legitimate rulers of Afghanistan, but several neighboring and regional countries, including China, Russia, Pakistan, Iran and Qatar, have retained their embassies. India recently reopened its diplomatic mission in Kabul, manned by lower-level diplomats. New Delhi’s stepped-up engagement with de facto Afghan leaders is expected to raise tensions with neighboring archrival Pakistan, as noted by analysts. Kabul’s ties with Islamabad have lately been strained over allegations that the Taliban harbor and support fugitive militants linked to the outlawed Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, or TTP, in carrying out 'terrorist' attacks against Pakistani civilians and security forces. Last month, the Pakistani military allegedly carried out airstrikes against suspected TTP hideouts in an Afghan border province, drawing strong condemnation from the Taliban. Kabul claimed the bombardment took the lives of nearly 50 'refugees' from Pakistan. Islamabad has publicly refrained from acknowledging the cross-border attack, but Pakistani officials anonymously confirmed it and reported the death of more than two dozen TTP commanders and operatives. India also objected to Pakistan’s military aggression against Afghanistan. 'We unequivocally condemn any attack on innocent civilians. It is an old practice of Pakistan to blame its neighbors for its own internal failures,' an Indian Foreign Ministry spokesperson said while responding to Pakistan’s aerial attack on Dec. 24. Several days later, Taliban security forces said they launched retaliatory fire against multiple locations on the Pakistani side of the border that they claimed were servicing 'as centers and hideouts for malicious elements and their supporters who organized and coordinated attacks in Afghanistan.' Pakistani officials reported the death of one security personnel and injuries to several others due to the Taliban military action, marking a sharp escalation in bilateral tensions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-boosts-diplomatic-contacts-with-afghanistan-s-taliban/7930005.html	2025-01-08T12:30:57-08:00	
Former President Jimmy Carter lies in state at US Capitol	Washington — Thousands of people braved freezing temperatures to come to the U.S. Capitol to pay their respects to former President Jimmy Carter, who lay in state Wednesday in the heart of American democracy ahead of his pomp-filled state funeral. Mourners, who included numerous elected officials and Vice President Kamala Harris, highlighted the achievements and the humanity of the100-year-old, who died last month. David Smith, a professor at the Carter School for Peace and Conflict Resolution at George Mason University, said that the former president obviously impacted his career. He told VOA that he came to the Capitol to honor the man but also to honor Carter’s causes. 'He had such an impact on so many people,' he said. 'His work on advancing minorities, appointments of women to the judiciary, protecting our environment, advocating for human rights – all those things are very important things to me.' The former president’s flag-draped coffin arrived in the Capitol rotunda Tuesday, ahead of Thursday’s national funeral. In that soaring space – where only about 50 Americans have been recognized with this distinct honor since 1852 – Senate Majority Leader Jon Thune, in a service late Tuesday, described Carter as: 'Navy veteran, peanut farmer, governor of Georgia. And president of the United States. Sunday school teacher. Nobel Prize winner. Advocate for peace and human rights. And first and foremost, a faithful servant of his creator and his fellow man.' And Vice President Harris – who a day earlier, in this building, certified the victory of the next president – extolled Carter’s policy. 'He was the first president of the United States to have a comprehensive energy policy, including providing some of the first federal support for clean energy,' she said Tuesday. 'He also passed over a dozen major pieces of legislation regarding environmental protection. And more than doubled the size of America's national parks.' Carter, who served as the 39th president, died December 29 at the age of 100 after nearly two years in hospice care in the state of Georgia. Since then, his final journey has taken his remains over the skinny roads of his humble hometown of Plains; down the boulevards of Atlanta, the state capital, and through the skies to snowy Washington, for his state funeral. At the U.S. Capitol, lawmakers told VOA what the 39th president meant to them. Congresswoman Alma Adams, a North Carolina Democrat, said Carter was 'a real moral person.' 'He taught Sunday school – I did, too!' she said, smiling. 'But I think (it’s) the fact that he cared about all people. He was a people’s president.' South Carolina Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA that while he did not align with Carter politically, 'President Carter was a good man. President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved America. I didn’t agree with all of his policies, but you couldn’t (dis)agree with his patriotism, you couldn’t disagree. He just loved his country.' President Joe Biden will deliver the eulogy for his fellow Democrat on Thursday. 'We may never see his like again, you know we can all do well to try to be a little more like Jimmy Carter,' Biden said in late December after receiving news of Carter’s death. Analysts say the two men have a few things in common. 'There's an obvious similarity; that is, that Carter turned out to be a one-term president, and Biden turned out to be a one-term president,' Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, told VOA on Zoom. 'And that's never a reflection of the right combination of politics and policy. In both cases, I would say that the two presidents put the policy ahead of the politics. And they paid the price for that.' Thursday’s funeral will bring together President Biden and former presidents, including Biden’s predecessor and successor, Donald Trump. When asked what Carter and the next and previous president have in common, Galston paused. 'I don't even know how to begin to answer that question,' he said finally.

How China's national liquor greased the wheels of corruption among Communist elites	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Kweichow Moutai, the distiller of China’s most prestigious liquor, has seen three of its ex-chairmen face investigations for graft over the past five years, with a new probe into a former head of the maker of 'firewater' announced earlier this month. Over the past week, the topic has been trending on China’s social media and comes even as the company continues to see growth in sales, despite a weakening Chinese economy and lagging consumption. Industry observers say that while the latest scandal is unlikely to hurt liquor sales, it highlights how corruption continues to ferment at Moutai – the drink of China’s state banquets since the 1970s. Latest probe Late last week on Jan. 2, authorities in China’s southwestern Guizhou province announced a probe into company official Ding Xiongjun on its website. Ding stepped down in April from the state-owned liquor giant, and, according to the announcement, is under investigation for 'suspected serious disciplinary and legal violations.' It is likely that Ding may follow in the footsteps of his two predecessors, Yuan Renguo and Gao Weidong, industry observers say. Yuan and Gao were jailed for life on charges of bribery in 2021 and 2024, respectively. Yuan died of a brain hemorrhage in late 2023. While the charges against Ding remain unclear, the image of Moutai has long been tainted as businessmen in China mostly recognize it as a form of 'hard currency' used for socializing with those in power. One of the company’s most-cited quotes was from ex-U.S. diplomat Henry Kissinger to late Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping at a 1974 state dinner, 'if we drink enough Moutai, we can solve anything.' Wang Shoufeng, the former head of a construction labor force service company in Anyang, a city in central China’s Henan province, said that China’s corrupt officials only drink the pricey liquor even if that means taking extra measures to stay under the radar of anti-graft investigators. 'When our [property developers] friends invited officials for a drink, they often poured Moutai into plastic bottles, faking it as water. The liquor in the one yuan-worth bottles was valued at tens of thousands of yuan. That’s how they drank,' Wang told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview. Wang fled China late last year to Germany. Moutai as bribes Wang said that some Chinese officials in Henan were so greedy that many of his peers in the property industry had to 'buy their personal safety or get things done' by offering bribes, including gifts of aged Moutai. One such example was Wang Xiaoguang, a former vice governor of Guizhou province, who was found pouring some of his 4,000 bottles of aged Moutai down the drain when he was worried about a probe against him in late 2018, according to Chinese media reports. Many of China’s Communist elites, including Chinese President Xi Jinping himself, are also known to enjoy Moutai. Xi has also made corruption a key focus of his rule in China, purging more than five million, mostly party officials, between 2014 and 2024. Earlier this week in an address, Xi said corruption remains the biggest threat to the Chinese Communist Party. That said, officials and their love of the tipple has enabled the price to climb and peak at around 3,000 yuan, or $420, per 500ml bottle in February of last year, taking the flagship product 'Flying Fairy Moutai' as an example, which has a 53% alcohol level. Although its price has now dropped to around 2,200 yuan, or $300, the liquor’s fat margin compared to its factory price of 1,163 yuan, or $158, has created wiggle room for corruption, said Willy Lin, secretary-general of the Chinese White Spirits Research Association in Taipei. 'The [Moutai] liquor sells so well with a handsome profit that everyone wants a share of the pie. That makes it hard for those in the chairman’s seats to stay untangled with many interest groups,' Lin told VOA Mandarin in a phone interview. 'You [the chairmen] need their support to get to that position, but once you're in, you need to help them make money. That’s when corruption sets in ... it’s not an easy position to hold on to,' he added. According to state media reports, both Yuan and Gao were found to have illegally awarded distribution rights to cronies or used the liquor to gain political clout before their arrest. Sales still strong? In 2018, China launched an anti-graft campaign against the liquor giant and has since arrested a dozen top executives, but the corruption at the brand's top management remains hard to root out. For now, the liquor giant’s sales performance appears to remain unaffected. In its latest financial report, released on Jan. 2 – the same day the probe into Ding was announced – Kweichow Moutai said it is expected to deliver 173.8 billion yuan, or $23.7 billion, in revenues for last year, seeing 15% year-on-year growth. China’s weakened domestic consumption, however, is fueling concerns that the liquor giant’s future may not be bright. One Shaanxi province-based vendor who sells a variety of spirits including Moutai on China’s short video platform Douyin told VOA Mandarin on Sunday that 'now is not a good time' to buy or invest in bottles of Flying Fairy Moutai since its price may keep plunging to below 2,000 yuan. A stock analyst in Beijing, who spoke with VOA Mandarin on the condition of anonymity, also expressed concern that Chinese consumers’ slashed spending on luxury goods may spell more bad news for the company’s share price as well, which too has been falling. 'Although Moutai's sales performance remains relatively stable, the company’s falling stock price reflects concern over its future sales,' the analyst told VOA. The analyst did not want to use his full name citing the sensitivity of the topic. On Wednesday, Kweichow Moutai closed at 1442.5 yuan per share, a 45% drop from its record high of 2,627.88 yuan per share in early 2021.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-china-national-liquor-greased-the-wheels-of-corruption-among-communist-elites/7929942.html	2025-01-08T11:38:36-08:00	
Russian missile attack kills at least 13 in southern Ukraine	A Russian missile attack on the southern Ukrainian city of Zaporizhzhia killed at least 13 people Wednesday and injured dozens more, Ukrainian authorities reported. The attack came minutes after regional Governor Ivan Fedorov warned that 'high-speed missiles' and 'glide bombs' were heading toward the Zaporizhzhia region. Bodies of the victims and people injured in the attack were strewn across a road and adjacent paved areas next to damaged public transportation facilities. The debris hit a tram and a bus with passengers inside, Ukraine’s prosecutor general’s office said. High-rise apartment blocks, an industrial facility and other infrastructure were damaged in the attack. Emergency workers were trying to resuscitate a man while raging flames, smoke and burned cars could be seen in the background. Russian troops used two guided bombs to hit a residential area, Fedorov told reporters. He said at least four of the injured were rushed to a hospital in serious condition. Fedorov said Thursday would be an official day of mourning. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said on X, 'There is nothing more cruel than launching aerial bombs on a city, knowing that ordinary civilians will suffer.' As he often has, Zelenskyy urged Ukraine's Western allies to step up pressure on Russia. Russia regularly carries out airstrikes on the Zaporizhzhia region, which its forces partially occupy. Moscow claims to have annexed the Ukrainian region along with four others, including Crimea, which it unilaterally seized in 2014. Ukraine hits fuel depot Earlier Wednesday, the Ukrainian military said it struck a fuel storage depot deep inside Russia near Engels in the Saratov region about 600 kilometers east of the Ukrainian border. The attack caused a huge fire at the facility, which supplies an important Russian air base. Ukraine’s General Staff said, 'The damage to the oil base creates serious logistical problems for the strategic aviation of the Russian occupiers and significantly reduces their ability to strike peaceful Ukrainian cities and civilian objects. To be continued.' Russian officials acknowledged a major drone attack in the area and said authorities had set up an emergency command center to fight the fire. Ukraine's General Staff said the attack hit the depot that supplied a nearby airfield used by aircraft that launch missiles across the border into Ukraine, a statement on Facebook said. Ukraine has been developing its own arsenal of domestically produced long-range missiles and drones capable of reaching deep behind the front line as it faces restrictions on the range that its military can fire its Western-supplied missiles into Russia. Zelenskyy said last year that his country has developed a weapon that could hit a target 700 kilometers away. Some Ukrainian drone attacks have hit targets more than 1,000 kilometers away. Meanwhile on Wednesday, outgoing U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said any future deal to end the war in Ukraine would need to build into it deterrence to prevent Russia from once again attacking Ukraine. Speaking in Paris, Blinken warned that Russian President Vladimir Putin would try to use any ceasefire in Ukraine to refit Russian forces and eventually attack Ukraine again. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-missile-attack-kills-at-least-13-in-southern-ukraine/7929935.html	2025-01-08T11:18:43-08:00	
Poland assumes EU council presidency amid challenges	With the slogan 'Security Europe!' Poland assumed the rotating presidency of the European Union Council in 2025 at a pivotal moment. The 27-member EU country grouping faces a fragile economy, the ongoing impact of Russia’s war in Ukraine, and hurdles to enlargement. Adding to the shifting geopolitical landscape, the return of Donald Trump to the White House this month, with his 'America First' agenda, raises concerns about potential new U.S. tariffs on European exports and increased pressure on EU countries to boost defense spending. While leaders in France and Germany are preoccupied with domestic political challenges, Poland, often seen as a disruptive force in EU politics, is now moving into the driver’s seat. At an inauguration gala at the National Theatre in Warsaw on Jan. 3, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk urged his EU partners to focus on strength and resilience. 'If Europe is powerless, it won’t survive,' Tusk said. 'We must protect freedom and sovereignty and make Europe strong again.' Security, defense in focus 'Security, security, security — defense security, energy security, and food security,' Polish Foreign Minister Radoslaw Sikorski emphasized to VOA when asked about Poland’s main objectives. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and hybrid threats from Russia and Belarus put Poland at the front line of European and NATO defense. Poland, which invests 4.7% of its GDP into defense — far surpassing NATO’s 2% guideline — is pushing EU member states to ramp up defense spending and develop a collective security strategy. 'Two percent is not enough. It is the absolute minimum,' Polish Defense Minister Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz told VOA, echoing President-elect Trump on his demand for European nations to spend more on their defense. The Polish defense minister added that nations that fall short risk losing influence in strategic decisions. 'Europe must do more for security, not to replace the Americans in Europe, but to keep them in Europe,' he said. 'Poland's role will be crucial during this time,' Mykola Kniazhytsky, co-chair of the Ukrainian parliamentary group on relations with Poland, told VOA. He emphasized that Poland has been a strong ally of Ukraine, and with its leadership in the EU, he hopes it 'will help to build a stronger defense system within the union.' In addition to security, Poland aims to bolster the EU's economic resilience. That includes fostering competitiveness, enhancing trade independence, and addressing energy challenges exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. The vice president of the Res Publica Foundation, Magda Jakubowska noted that Poland sees opportunities to turn defense investments into economic advantages, creating a more robust and innovative European defense industry. EU enlargement, supporting Ukraine and Moldova One of Poland’s key goals for the presidency is to advance the EU's enlargement process, particularly for Ukraine and Moldova. Foreign Minister Sikorski stressed to VOA that while Moldova may progress more quickly due to its smaller size, Ukraine’s path is more complicated because of its large, diverse economy, as well as the war with Russia. He pointed out that Ukraine’s integration into the EU would require significant alignment with European regulations. 'It’s not really a negotiation,' Sikorski explained, 'Ukraine must align its national laws with the EU’s existing regulations.' Despite the challenges, Sikorski is confident that the rewards of EU membership would be invaluable for Ukraine, both politically and economically. Ukraine and Poland also need to address some bilateral economic and historical disputes. With Poland set to hold presidential elections in the coming months, Kniazhytsky hopes that political debates around Ukraine will not be used as a tool by political players during their campaigns. 'I hope that the strategic interests of Poland will come to the forefront and that we will see continued support for Ukraine’s aspirations,' he said. Jakubowska highlights Poland’s active role as a strong advocate for Ukraine and Moldova’s EU integration. Jakubowska emphasized Poland’s strategic interest in fostering democratic, free-market neighbors to the east, an objective that will, in her view, significantly enhance regional stability. 'European security very much depends on the neighborhood, on the secure neighborhood,' she said. 'So, the Ukraine accession is one, but also we have the Western Balkans. We have Georgia. And this is important to set a European tone, European agenda, and European priorities in those countries.' Jakubowska says the presidency offers Poland a platform to influence the EU’s stance on those nations, working to ensure that Europe’s eastern borders remain secure and politically aligned with democratic values. A test of leadership Poland’s presidency also highlights the growing influence of Central and Eastern European countries within the EU. The country’s geographic location and historical experience with authoritarian threats give it a unique perspective on Europe's challenges. The Baltic states and Poland have forged strong alliances, particularly in response to Russian aggression. With Sweden and Finland joining NATO, this regional bloc has become a crucial player in shaping EU and NATO policies. 'This is an opportunity for Central Europe to demonstrate leadership,' Jakubowska said. 'Poland’s presidency can set the tone for how the EU navigates security, integration, and economic challenges in the coming years.' Jakubowska sees Prime Minister Donald Tusk’s leadership as a valuable asset. She believes that Tusk, who was president of the European Council for 5 years, understands the intricacies of Brussels, and his leadership will be crucial for Poland’s presidency to be effective. 'We are ready to lead and fight for Europe’s freedom and sovereignty,' Tusk said during the inauguration ceremony in Warsaw. An ambitious schedule — 40 formal and 20 informal council meetings and 300 events during the next six-month tenure — will test Poland’s ability to unify the EU and drive progress on its ambitious goals for a stronger and more secure Europe.	https://www.voanews.com/a/poland-assumes-eu-council-presidency-amid-challenges/7929931.html	2025-01-08T11:04:47-08:00	
Taliban refute Trump’s claims on US financial aid to Afghanistan	ISLAMABAD — Taliban leaders in Afghanistan on Wednesday denied President-elect Donald Trump’s assertions that they have received billions of dollars in U.S. financial aid since regaining control of the country. Hamdullah Fitrat, the deputy Taliban spokesperson, responded to Trump’s claims by asserting that the Kabul administration neither anticipates nor seeks any assistance from the United States. 'In reality, the United States has not provided a single penny to the Islamic Emirate,' Fitrat stated, referring to Afghanistan’s official name under Taliban rule. 'Instead, it has confiscated and frozen billions of dollars that rightfully belong to the people of Afghanistan.' The Taliban’s sharp response followed Trump’s news conference in Florida on Tuesday, when he was asked to comment on the alleged monthly payments of millions of dollars by the Biden administration to the de facto Afghan rulers. 'It’s not even believable. Billions of dollars, not millions — billions. We pay billions of dollars to essentially the Taliban Afghanistan,' Trump stated. 'This can’t be allowed to happen.' Fitrat claimed that the U.S. funds in question were primarily utilized for the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan and the relocation and resettlement of their Afghan allies. 'A portion of this money may have also been used under the pretext of ‘humanitarian aid’ by international organizations. … [The] U.S. directed all this money to Afghanistan, primarily for its own interests, and now exploits it as propaganda against the Islamic Emirate,' the Taliban spokesperson alleged. The controversy surrounding provision of financial aid to the Taliban intensified following a Jan. 2 letter by Congressman Tim Burchett to President-elect Trump, which expressed concern over foreign aid being directed to the de facto Afghan authorities. 'These cash shipments are auctioned off, and after that, they are nearly impossible to track. This is how the Taliban is being funded and plans to fund terrorism around the world,' warned Burchett. 'The United States of America should not fund its enemies abroad.' He cited U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken as having confirmed that non-governmental organizations in Afghanistan had paid nearly $10 million in foreign aid to the Taliban in taxes. The Taliban swept back to power in August 2021, prompting Washington and the West at large to suspend development aid to the country and effectively isolate the Afghan banking sector, freezing billions of dollars of central bank assets in the United States. The flow of humanitarian assistance, however, has primarily remained intact under the United Nations' supervision. The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) refutes allegations that some of the funds it receives for humanitarian operations are being diverted to the Taliban. UNAMA has maintained that it transports cash into the country for the use of U.N. agencies and 'approved and vetted' humanitarian partners to assist millions of Afghans needing support. The mission has emphasized that all cash is deposited in designated U.N. accounts in a private bank before being distributed directly to the United Nations and other entities. It has also clarified that none of the cash brought into the country is deposited in the Central Bank of Afghanistan or provided to de facto Taliban authorities by the U.N.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-refute-trump-s-claims-on-us-financial-aid-to-afghanistan/7929790.html	2025-01-08T09:39:38-08:00	
European Union rebuffs Trump's designs on Greenland takeover	The European Union on Wednesday dismissed U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s refusal to rule out a military attack to take control of Denmark’s autonomous territory of Greenland as 'wild hypothetical stuff,' while confirming that EU states would be compelled to defend the island if Trump invaded it. Trump, set to be inaugurated for a second, nonconsecutive term in the White House on Jan. 20, refused at a news conference Tuesday to rule out military action to take control of the mineral-rich Arctic island and earlier had vowed to slap high tariffs on Denmark if it refused to cede control. The Brussels-based 27-nation bloc, long a U.S. ally, however, attempted to avoid being drawn into a verbal sparring match with Trump, saying it was 'looking forward' to working with the incoming administration. As for Trump’s refusal to rule out military action to take over Greenland, a European Commission spokesperson said, 'We are talking about fairly wild hypothetical stuff about an administration that hasn't come in yet.' Another spokesperson added that the sovereignty of states had to be respected 'as a matter of principle.' Asked if Greenland was covered by a mutual defense clause binding EU members to assist each other in case of attack, commission spokesperson Paula Pinho said that was the case. 'But we are indeed speaking of something extremely theoretical on which we will not want to elaborate,' she said. Greenland is a mineral-rich autonomous territory of EU member Denmark and an associated territory of the EU. Trump has long publicly hypothesized about taking over Greenland, saying Tuesday, 'We need Greenland for national security purposes,' arguing that Denmark should give it up to 'protect the free world.' Aside from minerals on the island, it is a strategic Arctic shipping portal, especially as ice floes melt at the top of the world as the planet warms. Trump earlier in the day wrote on social media that the potential American takeover of Greenland 'is a deal that must happen' and uploaded photos of his eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., who was visiting Greenland. 'MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN,' Trump added. Panama and Canada At his news conference, Trump also refused to rule out military action to secure control of the Panama Canal and use economic force against neighboring Canada to gain the upper hand in trade deals or merge the two countries. 'Canada and the United States, that would really be something,' Trump said. 'You get rid of that artificially drawn line, and you take a look at what that looks like, and it would also be much better for national security.' Trump posited the possibility that Canada should be the 51st U.S. state, a proposition that outgoing Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau immediately rejected. 'There isn’t a snowball’s chance in hell that Canada would become part of the United States,' Trudeau said. Germany and France Aside from the EU’s rejection of Trump eyeing a Greenland takeover, EU members Germany and France individually also rebuffed the suggestion by the incoming U.S. leader. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz expressed surprise at Trump’s comments, saying European partners agreed that the inviolability of borders was a fundamental principle of international law. 'This principle applies and is a foundation of our peaceful order,' Scholz told reporters. 'In my discussions with our European partners, a certain lack of understanding has emerged with regard to recent statements from the USA,' Scholz said in an unusually blunt statement called on short notice. 'The principle of inviolability of borders applies to every country, regardless of whether it is to the east or west of us,' said Scholz, adding that Russia had violated that principle with its nearly three-year invasion of Ukraine. French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot told France Inter radio, 'There is no question of the EU letting other nations in the world, whoever they may be ... attack its sovereign borders. We are a strong continent. We need to strengthen ourselves more.' Barrot said he did not believe the U.S. would invade the vast Arctic island that has been part of Denmark for more than 600 years. But he added, 'We have entered an era that is seeing the return of the law of the strongest. Should we be intimidated? Should we be overcome with worry? Evidently, no,' he said. 'We need to wake up and reinforce ourselves militarily in competition in a world where the law of the strongest prevails.' Barrot said he believes the United States is 'inherently not imperialistic' and said he 'did not believe' that it is changing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/european-union-rebuffs-trump-s-designs-on-greenland-takeover/7929685.html	2025-01-08T08:58:24-08:00	
Justice Department says it plans to release only part of Trump report for now	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Justice Department said Wednesday that it will release special counsel Jack Smith's findings on Donald Trump's efforts to undo the results of the 2020 presidential election but will keep under wraps for now the rest of the record focused on the president-elect's hoarding of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate. The revelation was made in a filing to a federal appeals court that was considering a defense request to block the release of the two-volume report while charges remain pending against two Trump co-defendants in the Florida case accusing the Republican former president and current president-elect of illegally holding classified documents. Aileen Cannon, the Trump-appointed judge presiding over the classified documents case, granted the request Tuesday, issuing a temporary block on the report. The Justice Department said it would proceed with plans to release the first of two volumes centered on the election interference case but would make the classified documents section of the report available only to the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees for their private review as long as the case against Trump's co-defendants is ongoing. 'This limited disclosure will further the public interest in keeping congressional leadership apprised of a significant matter within the Department while safeguarding defendants' interests,' the filing said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/justice-department-says-it-plans-to-release-only-part-of-trump-report-for-now/7929634.html	2025-01-08T08:09:24-08:00	
Chadian leaders denounce Macron's remarks, order French troops out of Chad this month	YAOUNDE — Chad's government has reiterated its order for French troops to withdraw from the central African country before the end of this month, following remarks by French President Emmanuel Macron that African countries are ungrateful for France's role in helping to fight jihadist insurgencies. Macron said on Monday that France did the right thing by deploying its military to the Sahel region but that the region failed to say thank you. Macron said the states of the Sahel region would have fallen under the control of jihadist insurgencies and would not be sovereign today without French intervention. Macron's statements sparked a wave of anger and disbelief across Africa. Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby said Tuesday that Macron’s declaration dishonored and disrespected Africa. Deby accused Macron of being in the wrong era — and said that France has until the end of January to withdraw its troops. A special commission created by Chad's government to supervise the withdrawal of French troops also met in N'Djamena. Chadian Prime Minister Allamaye Halina, who chaired the meeting, said Macron's statements are an insult to Africa, which deployed over 200,000 soldiers conscripted from French colonies to help France battle Nazi Germany during World War II. Halina said France never gave significant assistance to Chadian troops, adding that Paris often focused only on achieving what he called French strategic interests. Caman Bedaou Oumar, a political affairs consultant and researcher at Chad’s Consortium for International Migration Studies, said there is an unprecedented wave of growing anti-French sentiment all over Africa, especially in Mali, Senegal, Benin, Cameroon, the Central African Republic, Niger, Gabon and Chad. Oumar said those nations, in particular, were places where France attempts to dominate politics by imposing people loyal to Paris as presidents. He said African countries are sovereign nations with militaries strong enough to assure the integrity of their territories. He added that Africans see the presence of France in countries that are rich in natural resources such as gold, uranium and oil as exploitative. France says its troops are in Africa to fight Islamic State and other terrorist groups. In 2012, French troops helped drive out Islamist militants who had seized control of northern Mali. But Senegal’s prime minister, Ousmane Sonko, said Macron's assertion that France is helping Africa to maintain peace and protect its sovereignty is wrong. In addition to Chad, Senegal and Ivory Coast have demanded the departure of French troops from their territory. Chad says several hundred of about 1,000 French troops have left the central African state within the past month. France handed over its military base at Faya-Largeau in northern Chad as part of the withdrawal last month, according to Chadian officials. Several hundred youths assembled in Chad’s capital, N’djamena, Wednesday to express their dissatisfaction at Macron’s comments. Secondary school teacher Hassan Dibunge said it is high time African countries assume full independence by ordering French troops out of their territories and making sure France does not exploit them economically. The 32-year-old said Africans can reorganize their armies and protect their territories without the presence of what he called ‘’exploitative’’ French troops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chadian-leaders-denounce-macron-remarks-order-french-troops-out-of-chad-this-month/7929601.html	2025-01-08T08:06:06-08:00

Eswatini AGOA trade benefits renewed for 2025	Mbabane, Eswatini — The southern African nation of Eswatini has secured continued eligibility for benefits under the U.S African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) for the 39 companies currently trading under AGOA, including some of Eswatini’s biggest brands. U.S. Trade Representative spokesman Sam Michel confirmed Eswatini’s eligibility in late December. Eswatini’s exclusion from the trade agreement in 2015 followed the country’s failure to meet benchmarks for democratization and respect for human rights and highlighted how the country’s political situation negatively impacted the country’s economy. In a written statement issued on December 21, U.S. Trade Representative spokesman Sam Michel said the decision to continue Eswatini’s participation in the African Growth and Opportunity Act was based on an annual AGOA eligibility review, which concluded that the list of eligible and ineligible countries will remain unchanged for 2025. Eswatini, an AGOA member for 23 years, exported some $23.5 million worth of goods in 2022. It is among more than 30 African nations, including Namibia, South Africa, and Mozambique, eligible for the U.S.-led trade initiative, aimed at boosting trade and economic ties between the United States and Africa through duty-free access. Swazi businesswoman Sonia Paiva emphasized the importance of international trade agreements to grow businesses in Eswatini, citing the benefits of import duty removal and increased market access. She said that exclusion from such agreements could have detrimental economic implications for businesses and citizens. 'We cannot afford to be excluded from such agreements, as the country faces the highest unemployment rate to date which affects over 50 percent of our population, which are mainly youth. We hereby continue to motivate our government to effectively put policies into place that will protect export businesses. With policies in place, trade agreements should be easier monitored for its compliance and implementation,' she said. Eswatini was temporarily suspended from AGOA in 2015 due to failure to meet benchmarks in democratization and human rights. The suspension resulted in thousands of job losses. However, the country was reinstated in 2017, reinvigorating its economic prospects and reinstating its eligibility for duty-free access to the US market. Wandile Dludlu, the deputy president of the opposition People's United Democratic Movement (PUDEMO), expressed disappointment at the renewal of AGOA benefits to Eswatini, stating that the country's government continues to disregard the rule of law, arrest political activists and obstruct an international investigation into the assassination of human rights activist Thulani Maseko. 'We have MPs who are languishing in jail and have been convicted on the basis of the Suppression of Terrorism Act, for which not only was copied from the American version, but has been greatly supported by the same American government. And in our context, it is being used as a bush knife against pro-democracy forces and human rights activists. And we think it's very much an inconsistency on the part of the government of the U.S. We have a very hostile political environment [here in Eswatini], wherein the same government that they are opening markets to have refused to allow the international community to conduct an independent investigation on the murder,' said Dludlu. Sibusiso Nhlabatsi, a political analyst, criticized the renewal of AGOA benefits for Eswatini, also known as Swaziland. He argues that the American government's decision disregards the Eswatini's unfulfilled commitments, highlighted in the enduring political instability in Eswatini and the absence of a promised national dialogue to address the issues. 'The Americans are not as strict as they should when they apply these AGOA benchmarks on the Kingdom of Swaziland. But the political situation in Swaziland, regardless of the fact that they renew these AGOA benefits, which is of course beneficial to certain business people, the political climax in Swaziland, will never be the same post-2021. And it is also disingenuous on the part of the Americans because there are commitments that the King made during the unrest, the commitment for dialogue, and this was even budgeted for. But the dialogue has not taken place yet,' said Nhlabatsi. Eswatini government spokesperson Alpheous Nxumalo has reaffirmed Eswatini's commitment to comply with all AGOA requirements and maintain strong diplomatic ties with the U.S. government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eswatini-agoa-trade-benefits-renewed-for-2025/7929476.html	2025-01-08T06:13:51-08:00	
Trump asks Supreme Court to block sentencing in his hush money case in New York	Washington — President-elect Donald Trump is asking the Supreme Court to call off Friday's sentencing in his hush money case in New York. Trump's lawyers turned to the nation's highest court Wednesday after New York courts refused to postpone the sentencing by Juan M. Merchan, the judge who presided over Trump's trial and conviction last May on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump's attorneys asked for an immediate stay of Friday's sentencing 'to prevent grave injustice and harm to the institution of the Presidency and the operations of the federal government.' The Supreme Court asked for a response from New York prosecutors by Thursday. Merchan has indicated he will not impose jail time, fines or probation. Trump's attorneys have pointed to the Supreme Court's ruling giving him broad immunity from criminal prosecution as they tried to have his New York conviction tossed out. While that opinion came in a different case, Trump's lawyers say it means some of the evidence used against him in his hush money trial should have been shielded by presidential immunity. Merchan has disagreed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-asks-supreme-court-to-block-sentencing-in-his-hush-money-case-in-new-york-/7929469.html	2025-01-08T06:06:09-08:00	
Burkina Faso amnesty law is ‘risky decision’ say analysts	London — In late December, Burkina Faso passed a law granting amnesty to soldiers accused of plotting a failed 2015 military coup. Analysts say current leader Ibrahim Traore, who took power in a coup himself and has since dodged several reported coup and assassination attempts, could be setting a dangerous precedent. In late December, Burkina Faso passed a law granting amnesty to soldiers accused of a failed 2015 military coup, against then-president Michel Kafando. The country’s current military dictator, Ibrahim Traore, who is widely understood to be behind the amnesty, has himself faced several alleged coup attempts from within the military since he took power more than two years ago, according to state media. Beverly Ochieng with the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies’ Africa Program, says the move could set a precedent for anyone wishing to oust Traore. 'It’s true, Traore’s decision is risky and it might set a double standard, especially considering the fact that he himself came to power through a military coup,' said Ochieng. 'Even if it doesn’t reduce the risk of further coup attempts or undermining of legal processes, he’s still able to save face and then sustain a semblance of popularity and unity.' But why has Traore made a move that could encourage further coup attempts? Political scientist Geoffroy Julien Kouao suggests a strategic rationale behind the amnesty. He says the experience of the pardoned coup plotters could be an asset in the country’s fight against militant groups linked to Islamic State and al-Qaida. He says, their military and diplomatic expertise could be useful to the current government in their fight against terrorism. Personalities like General Gilbert Diendéré and Djibril Bassolé have great military and diplomatic experience that Ibrahim Traore wants to exploit. General Diendéré was a prominent figure in the Burkinabe military, serving as the chief of staff of the armed forces. Bassolé, a former minister of foreign affairs, was also implicated in the coup attempt and was subsequently arrested and charged with treason. Ochieng suggests it could be a defensive move on the part of Traore. She says the previous coup attempts against Traore were likely due to tension with senior members of the military, which Traore is seeking to calm by releasing their allies. 'Burkina Faso is still politically fragile under Traore,' she said. 'On the one hand, the numerous allegations of attempted coups against his government might be a means of playing up threats and also exerting more power, but they’re also a reflection of sustained opposition towards his leadership.' Burkina Faso has been battling a growing insurgency since 2015, with violence spreading across the country. The conflict has led to thousands of deaths, widespread displacement, and one of the world’s worst humanitarian crises. Data from the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project show terrorist violence has only gotten worse during Traore’s time in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/burkina-faso-amnesty-law-is-risky-decision-say-analysts-/7929444.html	2025-01-08T05:56:06-08:00	
US, China vie for influence in combating Seychelles’ drug problem	Situated in the Indian Ocean, off the east coast of Africa, the Seychelles is in the middle of a key heroin smuggling route and has among the highest rates of heroin use in the world.

US says forces struck Houthi weapons stores in Yemen	Sanaa — The U.S. military said Wednesday its forces hit weapons storage facilities used by Yemen's Houthi rebels to attack American warships and commercial vessels. The operation involved 'multiple precision strikes,' US Central Command (CENTCOM) said in a statement, adding 'there were no injuries or damage to US personnel or equipment,' The statement did not specify the location of the storage facilities. 'The strikes are part of CENTCOM's effort to degrade Iranian-backed (Houthi) attempts to threaten regional partners and military and merchant vessels in the region,' it said. The Houthis' Al-Masirah TV said there were five raids in the northwestern Amran province and two in Sanaa province, where the capital Sanaa is located. The Houthis seized Sanaa in 2014 from Yemen's internationally recognized government and control much of the war-torn country's most populated areas. For more than a year they have been firing missiles and drones at Israel and at ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, in what they say is a show of solidarity with Palestinians during the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip. The Houthis' attacks in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden have destabilized a vital shipping lane, prompting strikes by the United States and sometimes Britain that began in January 2024. Most Houthi missiles and drones launched towards Israel have been intercepted, but a missile wounded 16 people in Tel Aviv in December, according to Israel's military and emergency services.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-says-forces-struck-houthi-weapons-stores-in-yemen-/7929429.html	2025-01-08T05:27:35-08:00	
Italy says Iran released Italian journalist Sala	Italian journalist Cecilia Sala was freed from an Iranian prison Wednesday and was flying home, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni’s office said. Her release came three weeks after she was detained in Tehran while working on a journalist visa. Iran had accused Sala of 'violating the law of the Islamic Republic of Iran.' Meloni’s office praised the 'intensive work on diplomatic and intelligence channels' in securing Sala’s release. Iran has denied any link between Sala’s detention and the arrest of an Iranian businessman days earlier days by Italian authorities. The United States accused the Iranian of illegally supplying drone parts used in an attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has denied involvement in the strike. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italy-says-iran-released-italian-journalist-sala-/7929349.html	2025-01-08T03:55:29-08:00	
India's Modi looks to new economic playbook as risks mount	NEW DELHI — After world-beating economic growth last year, India's policymakers are scrambling to head off a sharp slowdown as worsening global conditions and domestic confidence wipe out a recent stock market rally. On Tuesday, Asia's third-largest economy forecast annual growth of 6.4% in the fiscal year ending in March, the slowest in four years and below the government's initial projections, weighed by weaker investment and manufacturing. The downgrade follows disappointing economic indicators and a slowdown in corporate earnings in the second half of 2024, which have forced investors to rethink the country's earlier outperformance and cast doubts over Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ambitious economic targets. The fresh worries are heightening calls for authorities to lift sentiment by loosening monetary settings and slowing the pace of fiscal tightening, especially as Donald Trump's looming second presidency throws more uncertainty over the global trade outlook. 'You have to revive the animal spirit, and you also have to ensure that consumption picks up. It's not that easy,' Madhavi Arora, chief economist at Emkay Global Financial Services, said, adding India could expand its fiscal balance sheet or cut interest rates. Such calls come amid a flurry of meetings by Indian policymakers with businesses growing increasingly worried about faltering demand. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman held a series of meetings in December with industry and economists, customary ahead of India’s annual budget, which is due Feb. 1. Some of the measures proposed in those talks to boost growth include putting more money into the hands of consumers and cutting taxes and tariffs, according to requests and demands by trade and industry associations. Growing concerns As confidence wanes, the political urge to stimulate growth appears to be broadening. India's monthly economic report published last month said the central bank's tight monetary policy was partly responsible for the hit to demand. Modi has made some high-profile changes recently that are expected to lift economic growth as a priority over price stability. In a surprise move in December, Modi appointed Sanjay Malhotra as the new central bank governor, replacing Shaktikanta Das, a trusted bureaucrat who was widely expected to get another one to two-year term as chief, having completed six years at the helm. The appointment of Malhotra, who recently said the central bank would strive to support a higher growth path, came immediately after data showed September quarter growth slowed more than expected to 5.4%. During the pandemic, Modi sought to keep the economy growing by raising infrastructure spending and limiting wasteful expenditure to keep government finances in good shape. That lifted headline GDP growth but has not supported wages or helped consumption sustain an annual expansion of more than 7% over the past three years. While India's economy may still outperform globally, the question is whether it can maintain 6.5%-7.5% growth or slow to 5%-6%, said Sanjay Kathuria, visiting senior fellow at Centre for Social and Economic Progress. Arora said the country currently is in a 'bit of a limbo' where individuals are not spending. She expects this to continue if employment does not improve and wage growth remains weak. Reuters reported last month the government plans to cut taxes for some individuals and is preparing to offer tariff cuts on some farm and other goods mainly imported from the U.S., to clinch a deal with Trump. Economists say the government will have to slow some of its fiscal tightening to support growth with the success of such measures dependent on the extent of the cuts. With regards to trade, analysts say India needs a credible plan to fight Trump's tariff wars. If China remains the main target of Trump's tariffs, that could present an opportunity for India to boost its trade profile. India needs to 'seriously implement tariff rationalization to help embed itself more deeply into global value chains,' Kathuria, also an Adjunct Professor at Georgetown University, said. This could include tariff cuts aimed at pre-emptively heading off punitive levies from a Trump White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-modi-looks-to-new-economic-playbook-as-risks-mount/7929294.html	2025-01-08T01:45:05-08:00	
Ukrainian drone attacks target Russia’s Saratov region	Ukrainian forces carried out what Russian officials said Wednesday was a mass drone attack on the Saratov region, causing damage to an industrial enterprise. Saratov Governor Roman Busargin said the attack targeted the neighboring cities of Saratov and Engels, an area that is home to an airbase for Russian bomber planes. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed 11 Ukrainian drones in the Saratov region, but did not say anything about damage in the area. Ukrainian drone attacks are typically focused on the areas directly along the Ukraine-Russia border, with some targeting regions further into Russia. Saratov is located in southwestern Russia about 450 kilometers from Ukraine. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it also destroyed 21 total Ukrainian drones over Kursk, Rostov, Belgorod, Bryansk, Krasnodar, Volgograd and the Sea of Azov. Ukraine’s military said Wednesday that Russian attacks overnight included 64 drones mostly targeting areas in central Ukraine. Air defenses destroyed 41 of the drones over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Officials in Sumy said the attacks damaged a house and injured one person.

Iran tells France to review 'unconstructive' approach ahead of meeting	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Iran's foreign ministry called upon Paris to review its 'unconstructive' approach, a few days before Tehran is set to hold a new round of talks about its nuclear program with major European countries. On Monday, Emmanuel Macron said Tehran's uranium enrichment drive is nearing a point of no return and warned that European partners in a moribund 2015 nuclear deal with Iran should consider reimposing sanctions if no progress is reached. 'Untrue claims by a government that has itself refused to fulfill its obligations under the nuclear deal and has played a major role in (Israel's) acquisition of nuclear weapons is deceitful and projective,' Iran Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baghaei wrote on X on Wednesday. France, Germany and Britain were co-signatories to the 2015 deal in which Iran agreed to curb enrichment, seen by the West as a disguised effort to develop nuclear-weapons capability, in return for lifting international sanctions. Iran says it is enriching uranium for peaceful purposes and has stepped up the program since U.S. President-elect Donald Trump pulled Washington out of the 2015 deal during his first term of office and restored tough U.S. sanctions on Tehran. French, German and British diplomats are set to hold a follow-up meeting with Iranian counterparts on Jan. 13 after one in November held to discuss the possibility of serious negotiations in coming months to defuse tensions with Tehran, as Trump is due to return to the White House on Jan. 20. Baghaei did not mention French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot's comment regarding three French citizens held in Iran. Barrot said on Tuesday that future ties and any lifting of sanctions on Iran would depend on their release.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-tells-france-to-review-unconstructive-approach-ahead-of-meeting/7929274.html	2025-01-08T00:11:26-08:00	
Second wind-whipped wildfire is burning out of control in the Los Angeles area	LOS ANGELES — A fast-moving wildfire broke out Tuesday in the inland foothills northeast of Los Angeles hours after another blaze tore through the city’s Pacific Palisades neighborhood along the coast, destroying many homes and prompting evacuation orders for tens of thousands. The Eaton fire in Altadena started near a nature preserve just before 6:30 p.m. local time. The flames spread so rapidly that staff at a senior care center had to push dozens of residents in wheelchairs and hospital beds down the street to a parking lot where they waited in their bedclothes for ambulances and other vehicles to take them to safety. To the west, the Pacific Palisades fire that started Tuesday morning burned out of control into the night. The Los Angeles Fire Department put out a plea for off-duty firefighters to help fight the flames that were being pushed by winds topping 97 kph in some places and creating chaotic scenes as residents fled. It was too windy for firefighting aircraft to fly, hampering the fight. The Pacific Palisades fire swept through a Los Angeles hillside dotted with celebrity residences Tuesday, burning homes and prompting evacuation orders. In the frantic haste to get to safety, roadways were clogged and scores of people abandoned their vehicles and fled on foot, some toting suitcases. The traffic jam on Palisades Drive prevented emergency vehicles from getting through and a bulldozer was brought in to push the abandoned cars to the side and create a path, according to the Los Angeles Fire Department. California Gov. Gavin Newsom, who was in Southern California to attend the naming of a national monument by President Joe Biden, made a detour to the canyon to see 'firsthand the impact of these swirling winds and the embers,' and he said he found 'not a few — many structures already destroyed.' Officials did not give an exact number of structures damaged or destroyed in the Pacific Palisades wildfire, but they said about 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders and more than 13,000 structures were under threat. And the worst could be yet to come. The blaze began here late morning local time, shortly after the start of a Santa Ana windstorm that the National Weather service warned could be 'life threatening' and the strongest to hit Southern California in more than a decade. The exact cause of the fire was unknown and no injuries had been reported, officials said. Only about 40 kilometers northeast, in Altadena, the Eaton fire was burning. The winds were expected to increase overnight and continue for days, producing isolated gusts that could top 160 kph in mountains and foothills — including in areas that haven’t seen substantial rain in months. 'By no stretch of the imagination are we out of the woods,' Newsom warned residents, noting high winds were expected to continue all night. He declared a state of emergency on Tuesday. As of Tuesday evening, 28,300 households were without power due to the strong winds, according to the mayor’s office. About 15,000 utility customers in Southern California had their power shut off to reduce the risk of equipment sparking a blaze. A half a million customers total were at risk of losing power preemptively. The Pacific Palisades fire quickly consumed about 11.6 square kilometers of land in the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles, sending up a dramatic plume of smoke visible across the city. Residents in Venice Beach, some 10 kilometers away, reported seeing the flames. It was one of several blazes across the area. Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. But other roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to get out of danger and waited to be picked up. Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was completely blocked. Ash fell all around them while fires burned on both sides of the road. 'We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,' Trainor said. 'People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked, for an hour.' An Associated Press video journalist saw a roof and chimney of one home in flames and another residence where the walls were burning. The Pacific Palisades neighborhood, which borders Malibu about 32 kilometers west of downtown LA, includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes along winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and stretches down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean. An AP photographer saw multi-million dollar mansions on fire as helicopters overhead dropped water loads. Roads were clogged in both directions as evacuees fled down toward the Pacific Coast Highway while others begged for rides back up to their homes to rescue pets. Two of the homes on fire were inside exclusive gated communities. Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he immediately went to pick his two kids up from St. Matthews Parish School when he heard the fire was nearby. Meanwhile, he said embers flew into his wife's car as she tried to evacuate. 'She vacated her car and left it running,' Adams said. She and many other residents walked down toward the ocean until it was safe. Adams said he had never witnessed anything like this in the 56 years he’s lived there. He watched as the sky turned brown and then black as homes started burning. He could hear loud popping and bangs 'like small explosions,' which he said he believes were the transformers exploding. 'It is crazy, it’s everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the Palisades. One home’s safe, the other one’s up in flames,' Adams said. Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. 'Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,' Woods said in the short video on X. Actor Steve Guttenberg, who lives in the Pacific Palisades, urged people who abandoned their cars to leave their keys behind so they could be moved to make way for fire trucks. 'This is not a parking lot,' Guttenberg told KTLA. 'I have friends up there and they can’t evacuate. … I’m walking up there as far as I can moving cars.' The erratic weather caused Biden to cancel plans to travel to inland Riverside County, where he was to announce the establishment of two new national monuments in the state. He remained in Los Angeles, where smoke was visible from his hotel, and was briefed on the wildfires. The Federal Emergency Management Agency approved a grant to help reimburse California for the firefighting cost. Biden said in a statement that he and his team are communicating with state and local officials and he has offered 'any federal assistance that is needed to help suppress the terrible Pacific Palisades fire.' Some trees and vegetation on the grounds of the Getty Villa were burned by late Tuesday, but staff and the museum collection remain safe, Getty President Katherine Fleming said in a statement. The museum located on the eastern end of the Pacific Palisades is a separate campus of the world-famous Getty Museum that focuses on the art and culture of ancient Greece and Rome. The fire also burned Palisades Charter High School classrooms. Film studios canceled two movie premieres due to the fire and windy weather, and the Los Angeles Unified School District said it temporarily relocated students from three campuses in the Pacific Palisades area. Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, where there’s been very little rain so far this season. Southern California hasn’t seen more than 0.25 centimeters of rain since early May.	https://www.voanews.com/a/second-wind-whipped-wildfire-is-burning-out-of-control-in-the-los-angeles-area-/7929249.html	2025-01-07T23:06:48-08:00	
India names rocket scientist Narayanan as new space agency chief	India appointed rocket scientist V. Narayanan as the new head of the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO), the government said on Tuesday, a key role as India works to become a space superpower. Narayanan takes over from S. Somanath, who became chairman in 2022 and has been credited with making the 54-year-old space agency more approachable and opening it up to engage with the next generation. Narayanan, who has worked on the key rocket launches such as ISRO's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and led the center that designs and develops liquid propulsion systems for the agency, will take over on Jan. 14 for a two-year term. Narayanan did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The $400 billion global commercial space market is expected to be worth $1 trillion by 2030. India wants to expand its share in the global space market and grab a $40 billion slice of the pie by 2040, the federal government has said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-names-rocket-scientist-narayanan-as-new-space-agency-chief/7929243.html	2025-01-07T22:43:21-08:00	
Rescuers search for survivors after China earthquake	Rescuers in China’s Tibet region searched Wednesday for survivors trapped in rubble, a day after a powerful earthquake killed at least 126 people and injured 188 others. Chinese officials said more than 400 people have been rescued so far. Some 30,000 people have also been relocated after the quake, which destroyed more than 3,600 homes. Complicating the rescue effort were several hundred aftershocks and frigid temperatures in the region. Chinese leader Xi Jinping called for a massive rescue effort to minimize casualties and to resettle those whose homes were damaged. More than 3,000 rescuers were deployed, state broadcaster CCTV said. Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing was dispatched to the area to oversee the relief work and the government allocated $13.6 million for the effort. About 6,900 people live in three townships and 27 villages within 20 kilometers of the epicenter on the Chinese side, state media said. People in northeastern Nepal strongly felt the earthquake, but there were no initial reports of injuries or damage, according to the country's National Emergency Operation Center. The area around Mount Everest was empty in the depth of winter when even some residents leave to escape the cold. The quake woke up residents in Nepal's capital of Kathmandu — about 230 kilometers from the epicenter — and sent many of them running into the streets. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 10 kilometers. China's Earthquake Networks Center recorded the magnitude as 6.8. Shallow earthquakes often cause more damage. The epicenter was in Tibet's Tingri county, where the India and Eurasia plates grind against each other and can cause earthquakes strong enough to change the heights of some of the world's tallest peaks in the Himalayan mountains. There have been 10 earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in the area where Tuesday's quake hit over the past century, U.S. officials said. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescuers-search-for-survivors-after-china-earthquake/7929232.html	2025-01-07T21:42:26-08:00	
China expands consumer trade-in scheme to revive economic growth	BEIJING — China expanded the scope of consumer trade-ins for home appliances and will give more subsidies for digital purchases this year, in efforts to revive sluggish domestic demand, an official policy document showed on Wednesday. Microwave ovens, water purifiers, dish-washing machines and rice cookers will be included in the trade-in scheme for home appliances this year, according to a document issued by the top state planner and the finance ministry. Cellphones, tablet computers, smart watches and bracelets under 6,000 yuan, or $815, could get 15% subsidies. The statement did not specify the total cost of the incentives, however, a finance ministry official, said at a press conference on Wednesday that the central government had so far allocated $11.05 billion for consumer goods trade-ins to support consumption for 2025. China last year apportioned about $20.5 billion from the $136 billion special treasury bonds issuance to subsidize replacements of old appliances, cars, bicycles and other goods. Officials said that campaign 'had achieved positive effects.' The campaign resulted in $125 billion in auto sales and $33 billion of home appliances sales in 2024, Li Gang, an official from the commerce ministry said at the same press conference. The new measures are part of a broader plan to spur growth in the world's second-largest economy in 2025, where a severe property crisis has eroded consumer wealth and hurt household spending. Top Chinese leaders have vowed to 'vigorously' boost consumption and expand domestic demand 'in all directions' this year. Reuters reported last week that millions of government workers across China were given wage increases, as part of efforts to boost consumption.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-expands-consumer-trade-in-scheme-to-revive-economic-growth/7929221.html	2025-01-07T21:10:20-08:00	
Palestinian health officials say Israeli strikes kill 17 in southern Gaza	Palestinian health officials said Israeli airstrikes killed at least 17 people late Tuesday in the southern Gaza Strip. The strikes hit the Khan Younis area, including sections where people displaced by more than a year of war were living in tents. The Israeli military said in a statement that it conducted several airstrikes in the Khan Younis area targeting terrorists who took part in the 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel. The Israel Defense Forces blamed Hamas for operating in civilian areas. Human rights groups and the United Nations have said civilians in Gaza do not have a safe place to go amid the ongoing Israeli strikes and ground operations, and in a territory where so many areas have been devastated by the conflict. Earlier Tuesday, Israel’s military said it carried out raids in the occupied West Bank, killing at least three militants and arresting 18 others. The Israel Defense Forces said an airstrike killed two militants in the village of Tamun after they fired at troops. Israeli forces killed another militant during fighting in Taluza, while an Israeli soldier was wounded. The raids came a day after gunman attacked a bus and car near the West Bank town of Al-Funduq, killing three people and wounding seven others. Violence has surged in the West Bank since the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel and the resulting Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian health officials say Israeli troop fire and attacks by Israeli settlers have killed at least 818 Palestinians in the West Bank during that time, while Palestinians have killed dozens of Israelis. The war in Gaza began with the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. There are still about 100 hostages being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,800 people and injured more than 109,000, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group.

Iraqi archaeologists piece together ancient treasures ravaged by IS	NIMRUD, IRAQ — A decade after jihadists ransacked Iraq's famed Nimrud site, archaeologists have been painstakingly putting together its ancient treasures, shattered into tens of thousands of tiny fragments. Once the crown jewel of the ancient Assyrian empire, the UNESCO-listed archaeological site was ravaged by Islamic State (IS) fighters after they seized large areas of Iraq and neighboring Syria in 2014. The precious pre-Islamic artifacts destroyed by the jihadists are now in pieces, but the archaeologists working in Nimrud are undaunted by the colossal task they face. 'Every time we find a piece and bring it to its original place, it's like a new discovery,' Abdel Ghani Ghadi, a 47-year-old expert working on the site, told AFP. Artifacts smashed into pieces More than 500 artifacts were found shattered at the site, located about 30 kilometers (19 miles) from Mosul, the city in northern Iraq where IS established the capital of their self-declared 'caliphate.' Meticulous excavation work by Iraqi archaeologists has already yielded more than 35,000 fragments. The archaeologists have been carefully reassembling bas-reliefs, sculptures and decorated slabs depicting mythical creatures, which had all graced the palace of Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II nearly 3,000 years ago. Seen from above, the pieces of the puzzle gradually come together. Shards of what was a single artifact are placed side by side, protected by sheets of green tarpaulin. Bit by bit, the image of Ashurnasirpal II appears on one bas-relief alongside a winged, bearded figure with curly hair and a flower on its wrist, as the restoration brings back to life rich details carved in stone millennia ago. Another artifact shows handcuffed prisoners from territories that rebelled against the mighty Assyrian army. Partially reconstructed depictions of lamassu — an Assyrian deity with a human head, the body of a bull or a lion and the wings of a bird — lay on their side, not far from tablets bearing ancient cuneiform text. 'These sculptures are the treasures of Mesopotamia,' said Ghadi. 'Nimrud is the heritage of all of humanity, a history that goes back 3,000 years.' A 'complex operation' Founded 15,000 years ago as Kalhu, Nimrud reached its peak 4,000 years later and was the second capital of the Assyrian empire. Propaganda videos released by IS in 2015 showed jihadists destroying monuments with bulldozers, hacking away at them with pickaxes or exploding them. One of those monuments was the 2,800-year-old temple of Nabu, the Mesopotamian god of wisdom and writing. IS fighters wreaked havoc at other sites too, like the once-celebrated Mosul Museum and ancient Palmyra in neighboring Syria. The jihadist group was defeated in Iraq in 2017, and the restoration project in Nimrud began a year later, only to be interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic and restart in 2023. Mohamed Kassim of the Academic Research Institute in Iraq told AFP that 'until now, it has been a process of collection, classification and identification.' About 70% of the collection work has been completed at the Assyrian palace site, with about a year's worth of fieldwork left before restoration can begin in full force, said Kassim, noting it was a 'complex operation.' His organization has been working closely with Iraqi archaeologists, supporting their drive to 'save' Nimrud and preserve its cultural riches, through training sessions provided by the Smithsonian Institution with financial support from the United States. Kassim said that the delicate restoration process will require expertise not found in Iraq and 'international support' due to the extent of the 'barbaric' destruction in Nimrud. 'One of the most important ancient sites of the Mesopotamian civilization,' according to Kassim, Nimrud is a testament to a golden age of 'the art and architecture of the Assyrian civilization.' The site was first excavated by archaeologists in the 19th century and received international recognition for the immense lamassu figures that were taken to Europe to be exhibited in London's British Museum and the Louvre in Paris. Other artifacts from Nimrud have been on display in Mosul and Iraq's capital Baghdad. The site has also attracted figures like British author Agatha Christie, who visited there with her archaeologist husband. On a recent tour of Nimrud, Iraq's Culture Minister Ahmed Fakak al-Badrani hailed the 'difficult' work carried out by archaeologists there, collecting broken pieces and comparing them to drawings and photographs of the artifacts they attempt to reconstruct. The vast destruction has made it impossible, at least for now, to ascertain which antiquities were stolen by IS, the minister said. And the process will take time. Badrani said he expects that it will take 10 years of hard work before the marvels of King Ashurnasirpal II's palace can be seen again, complete.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iraqi-archaeologists-piece-together-ancient-treasures-ravaged-by-is-/7929189.html	2025-01-07T20:03:10-08:00	
Trump not ruling out military force to control Greenland, Panama Canal	President-elect Donald Trump did not rule out using military or economic coercion to gain control of the Panama Canal and Greenland during a wide-ranging news conference in Florida on Tuesday.

Former Cambodian MP shot dead in Bangkok	BANGKOK — A former member of Cambodia’s opposition party was shot dead in Bangkok on Tuesday evening. Lim Kimya, a former politician of the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP), died at the scene near Wat Bowonniwet Vihara Ratchaworawihan, a Buddhist temple near the tourist area of Khao San Road in Phra Nakhon district, The Bangkok Post reports. Police say a man parked his motorbike and then shot dead Lim Kimya at about 4 p.m. before fleeing. The authorities say surveillance cameras near the scene show the man riding a red Honda motorbike, and that they are searching for the suspect. The focus is on catching the assassin, but questions remain about the motive of the killing, according to police. Phil Robertson of Asia Human Rights and Labor Advocates (AHRLA) told VOA the killing on Tuesday is an escalation of transnational repression and appears to be a political assassination. 'This brazen shooting of a former CNRP MP on the streets of Bangkok has all the hallmarks of a political assassination and looks to be a significant escalation in the use of transnational repression in Bangkok,' he said. Lim Kimya, 73, also held French citizenship and had reportedly traveled to Bangkok in recent days with his wife and uncle. He was elected as a member of Cambodia’s opposition party in 2013. Cambodian activists and politicians who have opposed the country’s regime have long been targeted at home and abroad. Those who have fled to other countries, such as Thailand, have been attacked, arrested and deported to Cambodia. Critics have coined the term 'transnational repression' to describe the phenomenon. VOA reached out to Thailand’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs for comment but has not yet received a reply. Cambodia has been ruled by Cambodia’s People’s Party for 45 years. Critics say the regime has targeted dissidents, opposition parties and independent media who pose any threat to its rule. Hun Manet took power in 2022, succeeding his father, Hun Sen, who led Cambodia for nearly four decades. For a short time, the CNRP posed a legitimate challenge to Hun Sen’s rule after it was founded in 2012. But the opposition party was dissolved five years later after a Cambodian court ruled the party had attempted to overthrow the then-president. Members of the party were banned from political activities, and its founders fled the country. Kem Sokha, one of the party’s founders, was sentenced in 2023 to 27 years for treason. Robertson said Lim Kimya’s killing will have ramifications for other Cambodians who have fled the country. 'The direct impact will be to severely intimidate the hundreds of Cambodian political opposition figures, NGO activists, and human rights defenders who have already fled to Thailand to escape PM Hun Manet's campaign of political repression in Cambodia,' he added. In August, Hay Vannith, the brother of Hay Vanna, a CNRP member, was arrested at the Cambodian border. And in November, Thailand authorities deported Pen Chan Sangkream, Hong An, Mean Chanthon, Yin Chanthou, Soeung Khunthea and Vorn Chanratana back to their homeland for criticizing an economic trade pact Cambodia was part of. Observers and rights groups say Thailand and Cambodia have unofficial agreements in place to return political dissidents should they flee to one another’s country. 'This collaborative approach is not coincidental but strategically designed. Both countries share similar authoritarian impulses, with royal institutions and political elites working in concert to maintain their grip on power. By harmonizing their approach to dissent, Thailand and Cambodia create a more comprehensive mechanism of controlling political discourse,' Prem Singh Gill, a visiting fellow at Universitas Muhammadiyah Yogyakarta, told VOA in December. Since 2014, more than 150 individuals in Thailand have been victims of transnational repression, according to a 2022 report from Freedom House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-cambodian-mp-shot-dead-in-bangkok/7929182.html	2025-01-07T18:49:57-08:00	
Venezuela's Maduro says 2 US citizens arrested, branded as 'mercenaries'	CARACAS, VENEZUELA — Two U.S. citizens have been arrested in Venezuela, part of a group of seven whom President Nicolas Maduro on Tuesday branded as 'mercenaries' in the latest roundup ahead of the embattled leader's expected inauguration to a new term later this week. Maduro said the detained U.S. citizens were 'very high level' but did not provide further details or evidence of the arrests. 'Just today we've captured seven foreign mercenaries, including two important mercenaries from the United States,' said Maduro, who is set to take office for a third term on Friday following last July's contested election that the opposition says it won in a landslide. Maduro said the group of detainees includes two Colombians who he said were captured in unspecified parts of Venezuela, as well as three others who came from the war in Ukraine. Neither the U.S. Department of State nor Colombia's Foreign Ministry responded immediately to requests for comment. Venezuelan rights groups have warned of a revolving door of prisoners, with fresh detentions coming in even as older prisoners are released, including arrests of foreign nationals. In late 2023, Venezuela's government released dozens of prisoners including 10 Americans after months of negotiations between Caracas and Washington, while the U.S. released a close ally of Maduro, Colombian businessman Alex Saab. In remarks delivered from the Miraflores presidential palace, Maduro on Tuesday claimed that his government's security forces have captured what he called 125 foreign mercenaries from 25 different countries who he said had entered the South American nation 'to practice terrorism against the Venezuelan people.' The remarks come as opposition presidential candidate Edmundo Gonzalez is touring the region in a bid to grow his international support. Gonzalez has been declared president-elect by several governments, including the United States. On Monday, outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden said Gonzalez was the 'true winner' of the July 28 vote. While the government-aligned electoral authority and Venezuela's top court have decreed that Maduro won the election, the government has not released ballot-box level results to back up the claim. The opposition, however, has published thousands of scanned copies of voting machine receipts its observers gathered days after the vote, accounting for over 80% of votes cast and showing a lopsided Gonzalez victory.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-s-maduro-says-2-us-citizens-arrested-branded-as-mercenaries-/7929175.html	2025-01-07T18:35:40-08:00	
UN report: Haitians face 'unremitting violence,' such as kidnapping, lynching	Haiti's residents are subjected to 'unremitting violence,' according to Volker Türk, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights. In a report released Tuesday, Türk's office said gang violence killed more than 5,600 people in Haiti in 2024, a figure more than 1,000 deaths higher than 2023's toll. In addition to the deaths, UNHCR said more than 2,200 people were injured by gang violence and nearly 1,500 were kidnapped by gangs. 'Restoring the rule of law must be a priority,' Türk said. 'These figures alone cannot capture the absolute horrors being perpetrated in Haiti.' Among those horrors was an incident last month in which at least 207 people, many of them senior citizens, were killed by the Wharf Jeremie gang in Port-au-Prince after a gang leader accused the group of being responsible for his son's death from the group's alleged Vodou rituals. The gang is reported to have burned and mutilated many of the elderly Haitians' bodies to destroy any evidence leading back to the gang. Other bodies were thrown into the sea. This incident was 'one of the biggest massacres reported in Port-au-Prince in recent history,' according to The Associated Press. Other horrors in the report included more than 300 lynchings. Most of those lynched were gang members and people affiliated with them, with some of the lynchings 'reportedly facilitated by Haitian police officers,' according to the U.N. human rights report. The report also disclosed that last year, there were '281 cases of alleged summary executions involving specialized police units.' 'It has long been clear that impunity for human rights violations and abuses, as well as corruption, remain prevalent in Haiti,' Türk said. He also called for more logistical and financial support for the Kenya-led mission in Haiti so that it can 'successfully implement its mandate' to deal with the unrest and violence in Haiti. Türk also called for a halt to deportations to Haiti because the country is not safe. 'The acute insecurity and resulting human rights crisis in the country simply do not allow for the safe, dignified and sustainable return of Haitians. And yet, deportations are continuing,' he said. AP reports that Haiti's neighbor, the Dominican Republic, deported more than a quarter million people to Haiti last year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-report-haitians-face-unremitting-violence-such-as-kidnapping-lynching/7928169.html	2025-01-07T18:18:18-08:00	
Biden administration asks court to block plea deal for alleged 9/11 mastermind	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration on Tuesday asked a federal appeals court to block a plea agreement for accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and two co-defendants that would spare them the risk of the death penalty. The Justice Department argued in a brief filed with a federal appeals court in the District of Columbia that the government would be irreparably harmed if the guilty pleas were accepted. It said the government would be denied a chance for a public trial and the opportunity to 'seek capital punishment against three men charged with a heinous act of mass murder that caused the death of thousands of people and shocked the nation and the world.' The military judge at Guantanamo Bay and a military appeals panel rejected Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin's effort to throw out the plea agreement, saying he had no power to do so after the senior Pentagon official for Guantanamo approved it in July. Mohammed was due to enter his guilty plea on Friday and his two co-defendants next week. The Justice Department brief said the defendants, by contrast, would not be harmed by a short delay, given that the prosecution has been ongoing since 2012 and the plea agreements would likely result in them serving long prison sentences, potentially for the rest of their lives. 'A short delay to allow this Court to weigh the merits of the government's request in this momentous case will not materially harm the respondents,' the government argued.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-administration-asks-court-to-block-plea-deal-for-alleged-9-11-mastermind-/7927869.html	2025-01-07T17:36:17-08:00	
DR Congo conflict displaces more than 100,000 people in a week	KINSHASA, Democratic Republic of the Congo — Recent fighting in part of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo has displaced more than 100,000 people over the last week, the United Nations humanitarian affairs office said Tuesday. M23 rebels on Saturday seized control of Masisi, a key town in the mineral-rich DRC. 'Between 1 and 3 January 2025, intense clashes between the Congolese army and a non-state armed group in Masisi Centre, North Kivu province, displaced an estimated 102,000 people, according to local reports,' the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said. Rwanda's foreign ministry said that the areas taken by M23 forces in recent days had been in the hands of Hutu militias linked to the 1994 mass killings of Tutsis in Rwanda. 'Many parts of Masisi territory are/were in the hands of the genocidal FDLR, which is a foreign force that is occupying a Congolese territory,' Foreign Minister Olivier Nduhungirehe said in the statement. He also denounced international criticism that had not condemned 'the continued violation of the integrity of Congolese land belonging to Congolese communities, including Tutsi Congolese.' Masisi, with a population of around 40,000 people, is about 80 kilometers north of North Kivu's provincial capital, Goma. Relative calm returned to Masisi by January 5, prompting some displaced families to begin returning, OCHA said. 'Humanitarian actors warn the influx of displaced people may worsen Masisi's dire situation, with over 600,000 displaced as of 30 November 2024,' the UN body added. Between Friday and Monday, Doctors Without Border, or MSF, and health ministry teams treated 75 people at two hospitals in the area, MSF said in a statement Tuesday. 'In addition to providing this care, these two health facilities also sheltered hundreds of civilians for several days, who sought refuge there to benefit from increased protection,' said Stephane Goetghebuer, head of mission in charge of the medical charity's projects in North Kivu. The March 23 Movement (M23), a militia that the DRC and U.N. say is being supported by neighboring Rwanda and its army, has seized vast swaths of the east of the DRC since 2021, displacing thousands and triggering a humanitarian crisis. Rwanda's statement blamed the ongoing fighting on 'the marginalization of the Congolese Tutsi, victims of hate speech, discrimination and persecution.' Angola-mediated talks between DRC President Felix Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame were abruptly canceled in mid-December over disagreements on the terms of a proposed peace deal. For 30 years, eastern DRC has been ravaged by fighting between local and foreign armed groups, dating back to the regional wars of the 1990s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-congo-conflict-displaces-more-than-100-000-people-in-a-week-/7928143.html	2025-01-07T17:34:20-08:00	
As winds fan flames, Los Angeles residents flee wildfire	LOS ANGELES — Firefighters scrambled to corral a fast-moving wildfire in the Los Angeles hillsides dotted with celebrity homes as a fierce windstorm hit Southern California on Tuesday, fanning the blaze seen for miles as scores of residents abandoned their cars and fled on foot to safety with roads blocked. One resident described seeing people crying and screaming as they ran away carrying their children and pets. Forecasters warned the worst may be yet to come with the windstorm predicted to last for days, producing isolated gusts that could top 160 kilometers per hour (100 miles per hour) in mountains and foothills — including in areas that haven't seen substantial rain in months. Roughly half a million utility customers were at risk of having their power shut off to reduce the risk of equipment sparking blazes. In the Pacific Palisades neighborhood in western Los Angeles, a fire swiftly consumed just over 5 square kilometers (nearly 2 square miles) of land, sending up a dramatic plume of smoke visible across the city. Residents in Venice Beach, some 10 kilometers 6 miles) away, reported seeing the flames. It was one of several blazes across the area. Sections of Interstate 10 and the scenic Pacific Coast Highway were closed to all non-essential traffic to aid in evacuation efforts. But other roads were blocked. Some residents jumped out of their vehicles to get out of danger and waited to be picked up. Resident Kelsey Trainor said the only road in and out of her neighborhood was completely blocked. 'We looked across and the fire had jumped from one side of the road to the other side of the road,' Trainor said. 'People were getting out of the cars with their dogs and babies and bags, they were crying and screaming. The road was just blocked, like full-on blocked for an hour.' An Associated Press journalist saw a roof and chimney of one home in flames and another residence where the walls were burning. The neighborhood that borders Malibu about 32 kilometers (20 miles) west of downtown Los Angeles includes hillside streets of tightly packed homes along winding roads nestled against the Santa Monica Mountains and stretches down to beaches along the Pacific Ocean. Long-time Palisades resident Will Adams said he was down in town when the fires started and immediately went to pick up his two children from St. Matthews Parish's school, which is now in the line of the fire. His wife, who was at home, was driving down the main evacuation road for residents in the upper part of the neighborhood when embers flew into her car. 'She vacated her car and left it running,' Adams said. She and many other residents walked down toward the ocean. Adams said he had never seen a fire this low into the neighborhood in the 56 years he's lived there. 'It is crazy, it's everywhere, in all the nooks and crannies of the Palisades. One home's safe, the other one's up in flames,' Adams said. Actor James Woods posted footage of flames burning through bushes and past palm trees on a hill near his home. The towering orange flames billowed among the landscaped yards between the homes. 'Standing in my driveway, getting ready to evacuate,' Woods said in the short video on X. Actor Steve Guttenberg, who lives in Pacific Palisades, urged people who abandoned their cars to leave their keys behind so they could be moved to make way for fire trucks. 'This is not a parking lot,' Guttenberg told KTLA. 'I have friends up there and they can't evacuate … I'm walking up there as far as I can moving cars.' The erratic weather caused President Joe Biden to cancel plans to travel to inland Riverside County, California, where he was to announce the establishment of two new national monuments in the state. Biden will deliver his remarks in Los Angeles instead. The National Weather Service said the wind event that was expected to peak early Wednesday could be the strongest Santa Ana windstorm in more than a decade across Los Angeles and Ventura counties. The winds will act as an 'atmospheric blow-dryer' for vegetation, bringing a long period of fire risk, said Daniel Swain, a climate scientist with the University of California, Los Angeles, and the National Center for Atmospheric Research. Recent dry winds, including the notorious Santa Anas, have contributed to warmer-than-average temperatures in Southern California, where there's been very little rain so far this season. Southern California hasn't seen more than 0.25 centimeters (0.1 inches) of rain since early May. Much of the region has fallen into moderate drought conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-winds-fan-flames-los-angeles-residents-flee-wildfire-/7928154.html	2025-01-07T17:25:24-08:00	
North Korea says it tested hypersonic intermediate-range missile aimed at remote Pacific targets	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea said Tuesday its latest weapons test was a new hypersonic intermediate-range missile designed to strike remote targets in the Pacific as leader Kim Jong Un vowed to further expand his collection of nuclear-capable weapons to counter rival nations. The North Korean state media report came a day after South Korea's military said it detected North Korea launching a missile that flew 1,100 kilometers (685 miles) before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan. The launch, conducted weeks before Donald Trump returns as U.S. president, came off a torrid year in weapons testing. North Korea demonstrated multiple weapons systems last year that can target its neighbors and the United States, including solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missiles, and there are concerns that its military capabilities could advance further through technology transfers from Russia, as the two countries align over the war in Ukraine. North Korea in recent years has flight tested various intermediate-range missiles, which if perfected, could reach the U.S. Pacific military hub of Guam. In recent months, North Korea has been testing combining these missiles with purported hypersonic warheads to improve their survivability. Since 2021, North Korea has been testing various hypersonic weapons designed to fly at more than five times the speed of sound. The speed and maneuverability of such weapons aim to withstand regional missile defense systems. However, it's unclear whether these missiles are consistently flying at the speeds the North claims. The North's state media said Kim supervised Monday's launch, and that the weapon traveled 1,500 kilometers (932 miles), during which it reached two different peaks of 99.8 kilometers (62 miles) and 42.5 kilometers (26.4 miles) and achieved a speed amounting to 12 times the speed of sound, before accurately striking a sea target. Lee Sung Joon, spokesperson of South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the South Korean military believes North Korea was exaggerating capabilities of the system, saying the missile covered less distance and that there was no second peak. Lee said the test was likely a follow-up to another hypersonic intermediate-range ballistic missile test last April and said it would be difficult to use such systems in a relatively small territory like the Korean Peninsula. He said the South Korean and U.S. militaries were continuing to analyze the missile. Kim described the missile as a crucial achievement in his goals to bolster the North's nuclear deterrence by building an arsenal 'no one can respond to,' according to the official Korean Central News Agency. 'The hypersonic missile system will reliably contain any rivals in the Pacific region that can affect the security of our state,' the agency quoted Kim as saying. Kim reiterated that his nuclear push was aimed at countering 'different security threats the hostile forces posed to our state,' but KCNA didn't mention any direct criticism toward Washington, Seoul or Tokyo. The launch took place while U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting Seoul for talks with South Korean allies over the North Korean nuclear threat and other issues. In a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul on Monday, Blinken condemned North Korea's launch, which violated U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North's weapons programs. He also reiterated concerns about the growing alignment between North Korea and Russia in Moscow's war on Ukraine. He described the military cooperation between Pyongyang and Moscow as a 'two-way street,' saying Russia has been providing military equipment and training to the North and 'intends to share space and satellite technology.' According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war campaign. There are concerns that Russia could transfer to North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, which could potentially enhance the threat posed by Kim's nuclear-armed military. At a year-end political conference, Kim vowed to implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy and criticized the efforts of the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a 'nuclear military bloc for aggression.' North Korean state media did not specify Kim's policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term as president, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Even when Trump returns to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely. Kim's strengthened position — built on his expanded nuclear arsenal, deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of U.S. international sanctions — presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff, experts say.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-says-it-tested-hypersonic-intermediate-range-missile-aimed-at-remote-pacific-targets-/7928137.html	2025-01-07T17:21:09-08:00	
Peter Yarrow of folk music trio Peter, Paul and Mary dies at 86	LOS ANGELES — Peter Yarrow, the singer-songwriter best known as one-third of Peter, Paul and Mary, the folk-music trio whose impassioned harmonies transfixed millions as they lifted their voices in favor of civil rights and against war, has died. He was 86. Yarrow, who also co-wrote the group's most enduring song, 'Puff the Magic Dragon,' died Tuesday in New York, publicist Ken Sunshine said. Yarrow had bladder cancer for the past four years. 'Our fearless dragon is tired and has entered the last chapter of his magnificent life. The world knows Peter Yarrow the iconic folk activist, but the human being behind the legend is every bit as generous, creative, passionate, playful, and wise as his lyrics suggest,' his daughter Bethany said in a statement. During an incredible run of success spanning the 1960s, Yarrow, Noel Paul Stookey and Mary Travers released six Billboard Top 10 singles and two No. 1 albums and won five Grammys. They also brought early exposure to Bob Dylan by turning two of his songs, 'Don't Think Twice, It's All Right' and 'Blowin' in the Wind,' into Billboard Top 10 hits as they helped lead an American renaissance in folk music. They performed 'Blowin' in the Wind' at the 1963 March on Washington at which the Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous 'I Have a Dream' speech. After an eight-year hiatus to pursue solo careers, the trio reunited in 1978 for a 'Survival Sunday,' an anti-nuclear-power concert that Yarrow had organized in Los Angeles. They would remain together until Travers' death in 2009. Upon her passing, Yarrow and Stookey continued to perform both separately and together. Born May 31, 1938, in New York, Yarrow was raised in an upper-middle-class family he said placed high value on art and scholarship. He took violin lessons as a child, later switching to guitar as he came to embrace the work of such folk music icons as Woody Guthrie and Pete Seeger. Upon graduating from Cornell University in 1959, he returned to New York, where he worked as a struggling Greenwich Village musician until connecting with Stookey and Travers. Although his degree was in psychology, he had found his true calling in folk music at Cornell when he worked as a teaching assistant for a class in American folklore his senior year. Soon after returning to New York, he met impresario Albert Grossman, who would go on to manage Dylan, Janis Joplin and others and who at the time was looking to put together a group that would rival the Kingston Trio, which in 1958 had a hit version of the traditional folk ballad 'Tom Dooley.' But Grossman wanted a trio with a female singer and a member who could be funny enough to keep an audience engaged with comic patter. For the latter, Yarrow suggested a guitar-strumming Greenwich Village comic he'd seen named Noel Stookey. Stookey, who would use his middle name as a member of the group, happened to be a friend of Travers, who as a teenager had performed and recorded with Pete Seeger and others. After months of rehearsal, the three became an overnight sensation when their first album, 1962's eponymous 'Peter, Paul and Mary,' reached No. 1 on the Billboard chart. Their second, 'In the Wind,' reached No. 4 and their third, 'Moving,' put them back at No. 1. From their earliest albums, the trio sang out against war and injustice in songs like Seeger's 'If I Had a Hammer' and 'Where Have all the Flowers Gone,' Dylan's 'Blowin' in the Wind' and 'When the Ship Comes In,' and Yarrow's own 'Day is Done.' They could also show a soft and poignant side, particularly on 'Puff the Magic Dragon,' which Yarrow had written during his Cornell years with college friend Leonard Lipton. It tells the tale of Jackie Paper, a young boy who embarks on countless adventures with his make-believe dragon friend until he outgrows such childhood fantasies and leaves a sobbing, heartbroken Puff behind. As Yarrow explains: 'A dragon lives forever, but not so little boys.' After recording their last No. 1 hit, a 1969 cover of John Denver's 'Leaving on a Jet Plane,' the trio split up the following year to pursue solo careers. That same year Yarrow had pleaded guilty to taking indecent liberties with a 14-year-old girl who had come to his hotel room with her older sister to ask for autographs. The pair found him naked when he answered the door and let them in. Yarrow, who resumed his career after serving three months in jail, was pardoned by President Jimmy Carter in 1981. Over the decades, he apologized repeatedly. Over the years, Yarrow continued to write and co-write songs, including the 1976 hit 'Torn Between Two Lovers' for Mary MacGregor. He received an Emmy nomination in 1979 for the animated film 'Puff the Magic Dragon.' Later songs include the civil rights anthem 'No Easy Walk to Freedom,' co-written with Margery Tabankin, and 'Light One Candle,' calling for peace in Lebanon. In addition to his wife and daughter, he is survived by a son, Christopher, and a granddaughter, Valentina.	https://www.voanews.com/a/peter-yarrow-of-folk-music-trio-peter-paul-and-mary-dies-at-86-/7928142.html	2025-01-07T16:53:47-08:00	
Meta to offer wider range of speech on platforms, CEO says	OAKLAND, CALIFORNIA — Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced Tuesday that there would be a wider range of speech on Facebook and other Meta platforms. 'We're going to get back to our roots around free expression on Facebook and Instagram,' he said. Here are some of the key changes: Gone will be third-party fact-checkers eyeing Facebook posts for violations in the United States. Instead, Facebook will rely on 'community notes,' a system used on X (formerly Twitter) that allows community members to flag posts and vote on the legitimacy of them. Restrictions on topics such as immigration and gender identity will be lifted. 'What started as a movement to be more inclusive has increasingly been used to shut down opinions and shut out people with different ideas, and it's gone too far. So, I want to make sure that people can share their beliefs and experiences on our platforms,' Zuckerberg said. Civic and political content, which the company stopped presenting to users in recent years, will be recommended again on Facebook, Instagram and Threads. And the firm's trust and safety and content moderation teams will move from California, considered a liberal state, to Texas, considered a conservative-leaning state. The move 'will help us build trust to do this work in places where there is less concern about the bias of our teams,' he said. Preparing for Trump Zuckerberg's announcement comes as Meta and other technology companies prepare for major policy and regulatory changes with the return of President-elect Donald Trump to the White House this month. In his attacks on the dominant technology companies, known collectively as Big Tech, Trump has been particularly critical of Meta, which suspended his account in 2021 after the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol Building. His accounts were restored in 2023. At a press conference Tuesday, Trump was asked about Zuckerberg's announcement. 'Honestly, I think they've come a long way,' he said. He said the firm was 'probably' responding to his threats that he had planned to do something about Big Tech and censorship. Reactions mixed 'This is cool,' Elon Musk said of the Meta announcement. Musk bought Twitter in 2023 and renamed it X and is a close adviser to Trump. X Corp. CEO Linda Yaccarino said on X that 'fact-checking and moderation doesn't belong in the hands of a few select gatekeepers who can easily inject their bias into decisions. It's a democratic process that belongs in the hands of many.' Also on X, Representative Jim Jordan, a Republican from Ohio and chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, praised Zuckerberg's announcement as a 'huge step in the right direction.' 'Social media, AI, and other technology companies must resist governments' censorship pressure and instead work to ensure the open expression of ideas on their platforms,' Jordan posted. 'We hope that other Big Tech companies, including Google, follow the lead of X and Meta in upholding freedom of speech online.' Kate Starbird, a University of Washington professor of human-centered design and engineering, said on the social media site Bluesky that Meta's decision will hamper people's ability to find out the truth. 'One remaining concern for me is that even people who WANT to find accurate information are going to be challenged to do it, because we're going to lose the groups that do this fact-checking work — unless non-profits step in to fill what is going to be a huge funding gap,' she posted. Yoel Roth, a former head of Twitter's trust and safety department, said on Bluesky that he was 'genuinely baffled by the unempirical assertion that Community Notes 'works.' Does it? How do Meta know? The best available research is pretty mixed on this point.' 'Too many mistakes' In his statement Tuesday, Zuckerberg described a complex system of filters the company created to identify 'legitimately bad stuff out there. Drugs, terrorism, child exploitation.' But the systems, while well-intentioned, made mistakes, resulting in wrongly censored postings, he said. 'We've reached a point where it's just too many mistakes and too much censorship,' he said. The company will be 'dialing back' content filters that scanned for policy violations with the goal to 'dramatically reduce the amount of censorship on our platforms,' Zuckerberg said. Joel Kaplan, Meta's chief global affairs officer, said in a separate statement that 'too much harmless content gets censored, too many people find themselves wrongly locked up in 'Facebook jail,' and we are often too slow to respond when they do.' Biden 'repeatedly pressured' Without offering examples, Zuckerberg said in August that the U.S. government under the Biden administration pushed for censorship. In August, Zuckerberg said in a letter to Jordan that Biden officials 'repeatedly pressured' Facebook to take down some COVID-19 content, including humor and satire. 'By going after us and other American companies, it has emboldened other governments to go even further,' Zuckerberg said Tuesday. 'But now we have the opportunity to restore free expression, and I'm excited to take it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/meta-to-offer-wider-range-of-speech-on-platforms-ceo-says/7927856.html	2025-01-07T16:21:51-08:00	
US lawmakers honor former President Jimmy Carter in Capitol Rotunda	WASHINGTON — U.S. lawmakers honored Jimmy Carter on Tuesday, as the body of the nation's 39th president arrived to lie in state in the U.S. Capitol. 'Today, we gather to celebrate the life of a man whose works will echo for generations to come,' Vice President Kamala Harris said to the distinguished guests and members of Carter's family assembled in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda. Carter, a one-term Democratic president and Nobel Peace Prize winner, will lie in state in Washington for two days, allowing the American public to pay its final respects. Harris recognized Carter's role in brokering the Camp David Accords, instituting ethics reforms and founding the departments of Education and Energy. Congressional leadership also recalled his presidency, which occurred during a tumultuous time in American history. 'President Carter's life, his selfless service, his fight against cancer and his lasting contributions to his fellow man are all truly remarkable,' Speaker of the House Mike Johnson said. 'President Carter was willing to roll up his own sleeves to serve and get the job done.' Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said on the Senate floor earlier Tuesday that Carter was 'one of the most decent men ever to hold the office of president. He was a gentleman in every sense of the word: kind, honorable, intelligent, humble, deeply patriotic. These are the virtues he brought to the Oval Office, in an era where trust in government was arguably at a low in the 20th century.' Carter's presidency began while the nation was still recovering from the aftermath of the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal, the latter of which resulted in the resignation of President Richard Nixon and the decline of American trust in public institutions. Carter's term (1977-1981) was marked by economic inflation and crises in Iran and Afghanistan. 'President Carter was a man who served his country. He loved America. I didn't agree with all of his policies, but you could agree with his patriotism,' Republican Representative Ralph Norman told VOA. Carter was the longest-living U.S. president, dying at 100 years old. His post-White House career traveling the world engaged in diplomacy and charity work redefined how American presidents lived after their terms in office. 'Jimmy Carter had a presidency at a time of tumult — the Iranian hostage crisis, inflation. Frankly, not dissimilar to Joe Biden's presidency in some respects,' Republican Representative Mike Lawler told VOA. 'But I think Jimmy Carter has always been viewed by the American people as a decent man, someone who really cared deeply about this country and its people and certainly in his post-presidential life was very focused on what he could do to help the American people and his work with Habitat for Humanity.' According to the Architect of the Capitol, only 46 individuals have lain in state or in honor in the U.S. Capitol Rotunda since the nation's founding. Carter's remains will return to his home state of Georgia on Thursday for a private family burial. Kateryna Lisunova and Mykhailo Komadovsky contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-honor-former-president-jimmy-carter-in-capitol-rotunda-/7928119.html	2025-01-07T16:16:49-08:00	
Man who exploded Tesla Cybertruck in Las Vegas used generative AI, police say	LAS VEGAS — The highly decorated soldier who exploded a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump hotel in Las Vegas used generative AI including ChatGPT to help plan the attack, Las Vegas police said Tuesday. A laptop, cellphone and watch are still under review nearly a week after 37-year-old Matthew Livelsberger fatally shot himself just before the truck blew up. An investigation of Livelsberger's searches through ChatGPT indicate he was looking for information on explosive targets, the speed at which certain rounds of ammunition would travel and whether fireworks were legal in Arizona. Kevin McMahill, sheriff of the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department, called the use of generative AI a 'game-changer' and said the department was sharing information with other law enforcement agencies. 'This is the first incident that I'm aware of on U.S. soil where ChatGPT is utilized to help an individual build a particular device,' he said. 'It's a concerning moment.' During a roughly half-hour-long news conference, Las Vegas police and federal law enforcement officials unveiled new details about the New Year's Day explosion. Among the details law enforcement disclosed: Livelsberger stopped during the drive to Las Vegas to pour racing-grade fuel into the Cybertruck, which then dripped the substance. The vehicle was loaded with 27 kilograms (60 pounds) of pyrotechnic material, and officials are still uncertain exactly what detonated the explosion but said it could have been the flash from the firearm that Livelsberger used to fatally shoot himself. Livelsberger, an Army Green Beret who deployed twice to Afghanistan and lived in Colorado Springs, Colorado, left notes saying the explosion was a stunt meant to be a 'wake up call' for the nation's troubles, officials said last week. He left cellphone notes saying he needed to 'cleanse' his mind 'of the brothers I've lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took.' The explosion caused minor injuries to seven people but virtually no damage to the Trump International Hotel. Authorities said that Livelsberger acted alone. Livelsberger's letters touched on political grievances, societal problems and domestic and international issues, including the war in Ukraine. He wrote that the U.S. was 'terminally ill and headed toward collapse.' Investigators had been trying to determine if Livelsberger wanted to make a political point, given the Tesla and the hotel bearing the president-elect's name. Livelsberger harbored no ill will toward President-elect Donald Trump, law enforcement officials said. In one of the notes he left, he said the country needed to 'rally around' Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk.	https://www.voanews.com/a/man-who-exploded-tesla-cybertruck-in-las-vegas-used-generative-ai-police-say-/7927870.html	2025-01-07T15:50:36-08:00	
VOA Mandarin: Japanese PM postpones US visit, expresses willingness to visit China	Japan Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has postponed his visit to the U.S. and once again expressed his willingness to visit China. Yoichi Shimada, a Japanese House of Representatives member, told VOA that if Ishiba visits China first, it will cause distrust from the Trump administration and will also cause the U.S. Congress to have considerable doubts about Japan's policies on the Japan-U.S. alliance and Japan-China relations.

VOA Persian: Victims' group continues to seek justice after Iran's 2020 downing of passenger plane	An Iranian missile downed a Ukraine International Airlines plane as it took off from Tehran on Jan. 8, 2020, killing all 176 people on board. Iran says its forces mistook the plane for an incoming U.S. missile. On the fifth anniversary of the 'crime of shooting down a Ukrainian passenger plane,' the Association of Families of Flight PS752 Victims emphasized in a statement that they 'will not relent for a moment, in seeking justice.'

Russian gas shipments through Ukraine end; creating trouble for Transnistria	With temperatures dipping below freezing this week in Moldova's Russian-backed breakaway region of Transnistria, the end of an agreement to ship natural gas from Russia through Ukraine has led to rolling blackouts, idle factories and a lack of hot water. Ukraine decided not to renew a five-year gas transfer deal with Russia's state-controlled energy giant Gazprom. The agreement, which was negotiated before the February 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, allowed natural gas shipments across Ukrainian territories to countries in Europe. Before the war, Russian pipelines supplied 40% of Europe's natural gas. Now, that figure is about 8%, according to data from the European Commission. Ukraine's energy minister, Herman Halushchenko, confirmed Kyiv had stopped the transit 'in the interest of national security,' according to the Associated Press. The European Commission has repeatedly emphasized that ending the transfer of Russian natural gas across Ukraine was not a surprise and that countries had time to prepare for it. But in Transnistria, a sliver of territory wedged between the Dniester River and the Ukrainian border, the end of the agreement is a serious matter. The pro-Russia separatist enclave, which fought against Moldova in 1992, declared a state of emergency over the end of the shipments. Moldova's Foreign Ministry told VOA in a statement that parts of the country west of the Dniester River -- which includes most of Moldova's population and the nation's capital, Chișinau — was preparing to stop supplies from Russia and has been buying gas on European markets, albeit at a higher price. Moldovan authorities said they offered to help the breakaway region obtain gas from European markets. In response, Transnistria's 'foreign ministry' claimed Moldova was attempting 'to manipulate public opinion by providing false information.' In a statement issued on January 6, it said: 'Transnistria has not received any specific forms of assistance or adequate practical support from the Moldovan side. There is none today.' Moldova's pro-Western prime minister, Dorin Recean, said that by 'jeopardizing the future of the protectorate it has supported for three decades in an attempt to destabilize Moldova, Russia is demonstrating the inevitable outcome for all its allies: betrayal and isolation.' 'We view this as a security crisis aimed at allowing pro-Russian forces to return to power in Moldova and use our territory as a weapon against Ukraine, with which we share a 1,200-kilometer border,' Recean said. 'The Moldovan government remains committed to supporting all citizens with simple solutions for those in the Transnistrian region. Alternative energy solutions such as biomass systems, generators, humanitarian aid and basic medical supplies are ready to be delivered if the separatist leadership accepts support,' he added. Oazu Nantoi, a member of the Moldovan parliament, said he also believes that Transnistria is refusing help from official Moldovan authorities on the Kremlin's orders. Nantoi told VOA that most of Moldova is supplied until March. 'There, we are no longer dependent on Gazprom's monopoly. We can buy gas at market prices,' he said. 'Sometimes these prices bite, but Gazprom cannot influence consumption.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-gas-shipments-through-ukraine-end-creating-trouble-for-transnistria-/7927794.html	2025-01-07T14:25:15-08:00	
Son-in-law of Venezuela's opposition leader kidnapped	Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez, who insists he won the July presidential election against incumbent president Nicolas Maduro, said his son-in-law was kidnapped Tuesday morning in the capital, Caracas. In a statement on X, Gonzalez said Rafael Tudares was abducted as he was taking his children to school. 'Rafael was on his way to my grandchildren's school to drop them off for the start of classes, he was intercepted by hooded men, dressed in black, they put him in a gold-colored van,' Gonzalez said in the statement on X. Gonzalez did not provide any information on the status of his grandchildren, whom the Associated Press reports are 6 and 7 years old. The abduction comes as tensions are mounting in Venezuela. Both Gonzalez and Maduro claim to have won the presidential election. Maduro has continued to claim victory in Venezuela's July election, even though electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts following the election. The opposition said its collection of tally sheets from more than 80% of Venezuela's electronic voting machines prove that Gonzalez was the clear winner. Gonzalez has visited several countries in the Americas recently as he seeks to rally support for his effort to oust Maduro. On Monday, he met with U.S. President Joe Biden at the White House. The U.S., most European countries and several Latin American countries have rejected Maduro's claims to victory, which have been recognized by Venezuela's top court and electoral authority. Gonzalez, who has been living in exile in Spain since the election, has promised to return to Venezuela on Friday for the presidential inauguration. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said Monday that Gonzalez would be 'arrested and tried if he sets foot in Venezuela.' Venezuela is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of Gonzalez. The controversial presidential election sparked mass protests that left nearly 30 people dead and more than 2,000 arrested. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/son-in-law-of-venezuela-s-opposition-leader-kidnapped-/7927763.html	2025-01-07T13:27:12-08:00	
Clashes in northwest Pakistan kill 19 militants, 3 soldiers, military says	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan’s armed forces said Tuesday that 19 militants and three soldiers were killed during counter-terrorism operations in its northwestern province bordering Afghanistan. The fatalities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa occurred during what the military called intelligence-driven raids on suspected militant hideouts in three districts, including the provincial capital of Peshawar. The military statement identified the slain insurgents as 'khwarij,' a term the government uses for the outlawed armed group Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, known by the acronym TTP, which has been waging deadly attacks in the country. Official claims about insurgent deaths cannot be independently verified, and the TTP did not issue any immediate comment on the military’s claim. These were the first major clashes of the year between security forces and anti-state militants in Pakistan, following a dramatic surge in militant activity during 2024. In 2024, insurgent attacks resulted in the deaths of more than 1,600 Pakistanis nationwide. The death toll included nearly 700 troops and police force members. TTP and separatist groups active in southwestern Balochistan province claimed responsibility for much of the bloodshed. The Islamabad-based Independent Center for Research and Security Studies documented the casualties, stating that 2024 was the deadliest year for Pakistani security forces in a decade. This week, the TTP issued a warning that it would persist in targeting security personnel and escalate its attacks to encompass commercial enterprises run by the Pakistani military. TTP, designated as a global terrorist group by the United Nations, urged employees of military-operated companies to find alternative sources of income within three months and warned civilians to refrain from engaging with these businesses. Neither the Pakistani government nor the military has responded to the TTP threat. The militant warning comes as a surge in terrorist activities in Pakistan has strained its relations with Afghanistan’s Taliban government. Last month, the Pakistani military reported that 27 Afghan nationals were among more than 900 militants killed during counterterrorism operations in 2024. Islamabad asserts that the TTP operates from Afghan sanctuaries and receives support from the Taliban government to perpetrate cross-border attacks. Kabul has vehemently denied the presence of foreign militants in Afghanistan or the use of its soil to threaten neighboring countries. In December, Pakistan allegedly conducted airstrikes against TTP-suspected hideouts in an Afghan border province, resulting in the deaths of dozens of individuals. Taliban authorities condemned the bombardment, saying it killed nearly 50 civilians and describing the victims as 'Pakistani refugees.' While the Pakistani government has publicly refrained from acknowledging the attack, officials have anonymously confirmed it and said the airstrikes killed more than 25 prominent TTP commanders and operatives. Neither the Pakistani nor the Afghan assertions regarding the strikes could be independently verified.	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-in-northwest-pakistan-kill-19-militants-3-soldiers-military-says/7927732.html	2025-01-07T13:10:01-08:00	
Trump: 'All hell will break out' if Hamas hostages not returned	WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Tuesday held an omnibus press conference at his Florida estate, where he explained his stances on key foreign policy issues as he prepares to take office in two weeks. He forcefully called for the release of hostages seized in Israel more than a year ago by militant group Hamas, saying, emphatically — six times — that 'all hell will break loose' otherwise. The Palestinian group’s stunning terror attack on civilians in Israel sparked a brutal conflict that has since inflamed the region and killed tens of thousands of civilians. His Middle East envoy had, moments before, joined Trump at the podium to brief reporters on his recent high-level talks in the region, saying that his team was 'on the verge' of a deal and that he would travel back in coming days. 'I don’t want to hurt your negotiation,' Trump said to Steve Witkoff. 'But if they’re not back by the time I get into office, all hell will break out in the Middle East, and it will not be good for Hamas, and it will not be good, frankly, for anyone.' On Ukraine, he expressed interest in meeting with Russia’s leader and repeated his vow to get the conflict in Ukraine 'straightened out.' Trump has not explained how he would do this. When asked about a key demand in Ukraine’s peace plan — that it be allowed to join NATO — Trump said, 'My view is that it was always understood' that Ukraine would not be admitted to the security alliance. He repeated his tariff threats against Canada and Mexico and his line that Canada should be a U.S. state, and he floated a name change, saying: 'We're going to be changing the name of the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America.' Thessalia Merivaki, an associate teaching professor at Georgetown University, said Trump often uses bluster as a strategy. 'So, Trump has a record of just floating controversial ideas and positions to attract attention and generate interest and media coverage,' she said. Foreign policy Trump has not said how the United States will acquire control of Greenland, the large North American island that is an autonomous territory of Denmark. On Tuesday, he repeated his stance that 'we need them for economic security.' When asked directly if he would commit to not use military or economic coercion to back his increasingly voluble desire for control of Greenland and, also, the Panama Canal, Trump replied: 'I can’t assure you on either of those two.' Trump has accused Panama of violating the treaty under which the U.S. ceded control of the famous canal more than four decades ago, under then-President Jimmy Carter. 'Giving the Panama Canal to Panama was a very big mistake,' Trump said. 'Giving that away was a horrible thing, and I believe that's why Jimmy Carter lost the election.' Trump added that he liked Carter 'as a man.' He is expected to attend Carter’s national funeral on Thursday in Washington. President Joe Biden will deliver the eulogy. First day and beyond Trump also said he would be 'making major pardons' on his first day in office, when asked about his previous vow to issue clemency to some of the more than 1,500 people charged with crimes in connection to the riot on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He also repeated past commitments to loosen what he called the 'quagmire' of U.S. environmental regulations and smooth the path for billionaire investors. He described his reelection victory as a 'landslide' for winning the Electoral College and the popular vote, although official results show he did not win the majority of the ballots, as third-party candidates shaved off votes. He promised to have future election results counted earlier on election night. He repeated his vow to 'drill, baby drill' on his first day in office by reversing Biden’s recent orders seeking to protect against offshore drilling. He accused Biden of botching foreign policy, saying, 'Now I’m going into a world that’s burning.' Trump will assume office Jan. 20.

Arrest of activist spotlights alleged illegal lithium mining in central Namibia	Windhoek, Namibia — Namibian activist Jimmy Areseb appeared in court Monday after being arrested for allegedly violating public order laws during a protest at a local traditional authority’s offices. Areseb and others at the rally accused officials of accepting bribes from a Chinese mining company in return for access to lithium deposits. The confrontation highlights growing tensions in Namibia’s Erongo region, where activists say the Chinese company, Xinfeng, is acting illegally. Images of an elderly woman being carried off by members of Namibia’s paramilitary Special Field Force on Saturday set the Namibian social media space abuzz, with some comments likening it to the apartheid era when the country was controlled by South Africa. In another circulating video, members of the widely feared police unit are seen confronting elderly men and women who had gathered at offices of traditional chiefs and councilors, whom they accuse of allowing the Chinese company Xinfeng permission to mine for lithium without following the proper channels and procedures. The tensions at Uis, a mining settlement in the mineral-rich Erongo region, culminated in the arrest of activist Jimmy Areseb for interfering with the Special Field Force, who were enforcing a court order for demonstrators to vacate the offices where they had camped for a week demanding to see the chief. At the center of the storm is Xinfeng, a company that Namibia’s commissioner of mines has charged with illegal mining. Community members are asking why police arrested Areseb but not anyone from Xinfeng. Speaking to VOA, police spokesperson Kauna Shikwambi said the two cases cannot be compared. 'Those, were obstructing officers, right there at the scene, now. The other one requires investigation, and there must be evidence, that’s why investigations take so long, to have evidence, that indeed an arrest can be affected or not. You can never compare that and that! It doesn’t make sense,' said Shikwambi. Xinfeng is accused by the activists of paying bribes to the chiefs, in order to gain consent for the mining. However, a Xinfeng spokesperson, Kuvee Kangueehi, said those claims are false. He said the company makes a contribution of about $550 per month to the traditional authority as part of its corporate social responsibility and this is being misconstrued by the community as a bribe. 'EPL’s, and mining claims, and all the rights are granted by the Ministry. So for what reason will Xinfeng bribe an entity that does not grant the license? And it’s not in the business of Xinfeng to bribe anybody,' he said. Local chief Sagarias Seibeb, who is being accused of turning a blind eye to the interests of his community in favor of the Chinese company, told VOA the people camping at his office, including Jimmy Areseb, are his in-laws. He said family members feel they are not benefiting from his position as a chief, and are using the Xinfeng issue to settle family disputes. 'I cannot deny someone access to do prospecting, or whatever, in my area. I am just a custodian of the area. The land belongs to the state and there is a section that deals with that consent letter, and that can be done with or without my consent letter,' said Seibeb. On Tuesday, the chief is to meet with protesters in the presence of police officers and officials from the central government to try and find a solution to the tensions troubling the community. Meanwhile, police say they are investigating the charge against Xinfeng.	https://www.voanews.com/a/arrest-of-activist-throws-spotlight-on-alleged-illegal-lithium-mining-in-central-namibia/7927638.html	2025-01-07T11:52:14-08:00	
Critical minerals, waning Western influence a focus of Chinese FM’s African tour, analysts say	JOHANNESBURG — Critical minerals and oil, a renewed focus on the Atlantic coast, and the West’s loss of influence in the Sahel are some of the reasons analysts believe Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi has chosen the Republic of Congo, Nigeria, Chad and Namibia as the stops in his visit to Africa this week. For decades it has been tradition that Beijing’s top diplomat makes his first foreign foray of the year to the African continent, and each time experts try to analyse the reasons behind the specific itinerary. 'It’s always a mix of big states and small ones. The main point of all of this is to show that China is a non-discriminatory partner; that it doesn’t have 'important countries,' the way Western powers would tend to cherry pick, Cobus van Staden, an editor at the China Global South Project, told VOA in a WhatsApp voice message. During his first stop to Namibia on Monday, Wang said the 35-year-old tradition of starting the year with an Africa trip shows the world that 'China remains Africa’s most reliable friend' and its 'strongest supporter…on the global stage,' Chinese state news agency Xinhua reported. Namibia and minerals Namibia is Wang’s southern African pit-stop this year. The country 'is China’s major maritime partner on Africa’s Atlantic seaboard, where the largest concentration of China’s port developments are located,' Paul Nantulya, a research associate at the Africa Center for Strategic Studies in Washington, D.C., told VOA. Van Staden echoed this, noting that 'the last year or two there seems to have been an emphasis on the Indian Ocean, this year they seem to be rebalancing towards the Atlantic.' Namibia is also rich in uranium and critical minerals like lithium, cobalt and manganese. Namibia’s president, Nangolo Mbumba, said at his meeting with Wang this week that Chinese investment 'continues to play a significant role in developing Namibia’s uranium sector as one of the biggest global uranium producers.' Mbumba and Wang also spoke about Chinese investments in infrastructure such as a planned desalination plant. Chinese companies are also starting to build Namibia’s largest solar power plant this year. Republic of Congo and oil After Namibia, Wang heads next to the Republic of Congo, another Atlantic seaboard country and the incoming African co-chair of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, or FOCAC. The country, which is next to mineral-rich Democratic Republic of Congo, has untapped mineral deposits, but its economy is mainly based around oil, which accounts for some 80% of its exports, according to the World Bank. Van Staden said 'the diversification of Chinese oil imports' could be part of the reason for Wang’s visit to the country, as well as to the other two oil producers on the agenda: Chad and Nigeria. 'The Republic of Congo used to be a big oil exporter to China, but over the years China’s diversified its oil supplies,' he said. However, the Republic of Congo is trying to increase production and last year Cogo, the Congolese subsidiary of China Oil Natural Gas Overseas, announced a $150 million investment in two oil fields there. A Chinese company also holds a controversial permit to conduct oil exploration near a national park. In a September meeting between Chinese President Xi Jinping and Congolese President Denis Sassou Nguesso in Beijing last year, the Chinese foreign ministry readout stated, 'China supports the Republic of the Congo in developing a diversified economy, and encourages Chinese enterprises to participate in the construction of major infrastructure and regional connectivity projects in the country.' Over the years, China and its companies have been investing in major infrastructure projects in the Republic of Congo, building roads and modernizing the airport. It has gifted the country a new parliament building and construction is set to begin on a $9 billion hydropower dam this month. Chad and security Another country Wang will visit this week is Chad, the Central African nation that saw relations with Bejing elevated to a 'strategic partnership' during last year’s FOCAC. 'Chad and its immediate neighbors play a key role in China’s effort to secure global supply chains of critical minerals in the high-tech and clean energy sectors, including the EV industry which China dominates so far,' said Nantulya. Situated in the volatile Sahel region, which has seen a spate of coups in recent years, oil-rich Chad has been under military rule since a 2021 putsch. Chad is also one of several regional countries that have asked troops belonging to former colonial power France to leave amid rising anti-French sentiment. In December, Chad ordered France to withdraw about 1,000 troops from the country, where it had long been helping to fight jihadist insurgents. The void left by the West could be China’s gain, analysts said. 'It is the fifth former African French colony to remove French forces from its territory,' said Nantulya of Chad. 'China has been showing great interest in ramping up its strategic security engagements with these countries as seen by the sharp increase in Chinese military engagement in Mali, Burkina Faso, Niger, and Senegal in particular, as well as Ivory Coast.' Nigeria and trade Analysts say one of the more obvious stops on Wang’s 2025 tour is Nigeria, Africa’s most populous country and one of its biggest economies. Cliff Mboya, a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Africa-China Studies at the University of Johannesburg, said trade would be a major item on the agenda. 'Looking at Nigeria, one of the issues that also came out strongly during the last FOCAC was market access for African products into China, and Nigeria was one of the leading countries pushing for this idea,' he told VOA. 'So that will feature more prominently during Wang Yi’s visit to Nigeria.' Security is also a factor, said Oluwole Ojewale, a Nigerian researcher at the Institute for Security Studies. 'If you also look at the things that bind Nigeria and Chad together, one of them is the counter insurgency operations that both countries have been involved in for a while now,' he told VOA. 'Maybe the Chinese foreign affairs minister is also going to talk about security partnerships.' Filling the void Ojewale added that the stops on Wang’s trip can also be seen through the lens of regional geopolitical competition. 'Where the Western alliance and establishment have vacated in Africa, we’re seeing in equal proportion China or Russia in particular occupying those places — supplanting the Western alliance,' he said. And while such trips happen every year, Van Staden said this year’s trip is especially significant given that on Jan. 20th the U.S. will see a change of government when president-elect Donald Trump starts his 2nd term in office. 'I think the main message that [the Chinese are] trying to send is that they’re a constant partner, that they’re not fickle,' he said. 'This message is of course reinforced right ahead of the Trump inauguration, you know, where a lot of people expect a low level of interest in Washington in relation to Africa.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/critical-minerals-waning-western-influence-a-focus-of-chinese-fm-s-african-tour-analysts-say/7927642.html	2025-01-07T11:45:17-08:00	
9 million children in Ethiopia out of school; hijab ban in Tigray adds tension	ADDIS ABABA/MEKELLE, ETHIOPIA — Over nine million children are currently out of school across Ethiopia due to conflict, violence and natural disasters, with more than 6,000 schools shut down, according to the United Nations. In a report published on Thursday, the United Nations Children’s Fund, or UNICEF, said the highest numbers of out-of-school children are found in the Amhara region with 4.4 million, followed by the Oromia region with 3.2 million, and the Tigray region with about 1.2 million children. UNICEF said Ethiopia’s education sector has been 'devastated' because of conflicts, natural disasters and internal displacement. 'Over 10,000 schools, representing 18% of schools across the country, have been damaged by conflict and climate shocks, further reducing the availability of safe and functional learning spaces,' the report said. Yohannes Wogasso, the head of educational programs and quality improvement at the Ethiopia Ministry of Education, said the U.N. figure does not reflect the ministry’s own data and may be a result of different definitions of 'out-of-school student.' He said, 'I think the discrepancy may arise from the fact that they are not collecting real-time data, as it often takes a long time to gather accurate data.' Fighting forces children from class Conflict has forced the closure of many schools in the Amhara and Oromia regions, where rebel groups are fighting government forces. On Sept. 18, two teachers were killed in the Sinan district of East Gojam in the Amhara region, which created fear and concern among the region’s school workers, education workers said. Without naming a particular group, the local administration at the time accused armed groups 'who swear in the name of the Amhara people' of being behind the killing. The Amhara rebel group known as Fano denies targeting the teachers and civilians but admits it’s against the reopening of some schools 'for the safety of students and community.' Headscarf dispute at Tigray region school Meanwhile, some public schools in the ancient Tigray city of Axum have banned Islamic headscarves, forcing 159 female students to miss school, Muslim organizations in Ethiopia said. The Tigray region’s Ethiopian Islamic Affairs Supreme Council said Axum school’s move to block Muslim female students who wear the headscarf 'undermines the values of religious tolerance in the country, where different religions respect each other.' The council alleged that 'Muslim girl students are being threatened, arrested and pressured by the police to remove their hijab.' Ethiopia’s Ministry of Education allows Muslim female students to wear headscarves in schools. The Islamic affairs council said the actions of Axum schools are not acceptable. 'While my classmates are at school, I am at home,' said a 12th-grade student at Axum Secondary School, one of the schools that imposed the ban, who asked to remain anonymous for fear of repercussions. She said she wishes that authorities would reconsider their decision. 'Because of the war in Tigray, I didn’t go to school for three years, and now, because of the hijab,' said another 10th-grader, who also requested anonymity for safety reasons. 'Going to school at this time is scary; the police are arresting and threatening female Muslim students who wear the hijab around the school.' Kindeya Elementary School is another school that refused attendance of students wearing headscarves, parents said. Nuruya Mohamed, 55, is the mother of four daughters. Three of them are students at Kindeya Elementary School, the fourth in Axum Secondary School. She said all her four daughters are now staying at home because they are 'scared of the authorities.' 'I have never seen female Muslim students with hijabs being blocked from school in my life,' Nuruya said. The schools have defended their stance. 'Schools are not religious or political areas,' said Axum Secondary School Vice Director Gebremeskel Gebregziabher. He added that students are not allowed to enter school with religious symbols or dress, a policy that has been in place for decades. Some support for the ban The school has the support of some of the parents. Mulu Tamene, the mother of a sixth-grade student at Kindeya Elementary School, believes that banning headscarves in schools is justified. 'Schools should not be religious spaces. Students can wear the hijab up to the school entrance, but they should remove it once inside,' she said. Natnael Fitsum, a former Axum student, said that during his time in school between 1999 to 2010, 'teachers would remove the hijab and other headscarves from students,' he said, adding that 'it’s common for schools in Axum to ban the hijab.' A source from the Education Bureau in Axum who requested anonymity as he is not allowed to speak with media, told VOA that out of the 15 schools in Axum, four have banned the wearing of the hijab. However, the students said they wore the hijab when attending schools in previous years, including last year. Contacted by VOA, the head of the public relations department at Ethiopia's Ministry of Education, Mesfin Bogale, said, 'This issue concerns the regional education bureau.' The mayor of Axum, the head of the city’s education office and the head of the Tigray Education Bureau did not answer calls from VOA. 'This must be resolved urgently,' the Ethiopia Islamic Affairs Supreme Council said.

Trump special prosecutor temporarily blocked from releasing report on probe	Washington — A U.S. judge temporarily blocked Special Counsel Jack Smith from releasing a report on his investigations into President-elect Donald Trump for his mishandling of classified documents and attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, a court order showed on Tuesday. U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon, who presided over the now-dismissed case accusing Trump of illegally holding onto classified documents, directed the Justice Department not to release the report until a federal appeals court rules on a request from Trump's two former co-defendants in the case. Lawyers for the co-defendants, Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, who were charged with obstructing the documents investigation, moved late Monday to block release of the report. Nauta and De Oliveira argued the report would improperly interfere in their case, which remains ongoing. Smith led both the classified documents case against Trump and a second prosecution accusing Trump of attempting to overturn his defeat in the 2020 election. Both cases have since been dropped. Trump, who dismissed the federal probe and the two other criminal investigations he faced as a politically motivated attempt to block him from returning to power, said he welcomed the news. 'It was a fake case against a political opponent,' Trump told reporters at his Florida resort on Tuesday. 'If they're not allowed to issue the report, that's the way it should be ... that's great news.' A spokesperson for Smith's office declined to comment on the order. Justice Department regulations require Smith, who plans to wrap up his probe before Trump returns to office on Jan. 20, to submit a final report to Attorney General Merrick Garland. Garland has previously pledged to make public all reports from special counsels during his tenure. Prosecutors said in a court filing earlier on Tuesday that Garland, who appointed Smith, had not yet decided how to handle the portion of the report that relates to the classified documents case. Cannon, a Trump appointee, dismissed the case against Trump and his two co-defendants in July 2024 after ruling that Smith was improperly appointed. Prosecutors are appealing the ruling as it pertains to Nauta and De Oliveira.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-special-prosecutor-temporarily-blocked-from-releasing-report-on-probe/7927507.html	2025-01-07T10:28:55-08:00	
Calls grow for better protection after brutal killing of journalist in India	New Delhi — At a candlelight vigil for Mukesh Chandrakar, supporters called for justice for the slain journalist. Chandrakar, who was part of the Mahar community in the Indian city of Bijapur, was known for his coverage of corruption. He worked for the TV news channel NDTV and ran a YouTube channel 'Bastar Junction,' which has 170,000 subscribers. At the vigil on Sunday, RD Jhadi, who speaks for the Mahar community, told the media, 'We want a safe environment for journalists so they can work freely and without fear.' In the wake of the killing, the Press Club of India — one of the country’s largest media associations — demanded that the government pass protective measures for media workers. The body of the 33-year-old Chandrakar was discovered in a septic tank on Jan. 3. His brother had filed a missing person report to police on Jan. 1, noting that the journalist had been receiving threats. Chandrakar’s body showed evidence of a brutal attack, with broken ribs and fractures to the skull, according to local media reports. Chandrakar had recently investigated a road construction scam in Bijapur, which resulted in an official investigation into contractors. The state of Chhattisgarh deputy chief minister was cited in local media as saying that police suspect the murder is directly linked to the coverage. He said that the journalist’s report on corruption was aired on Dec. 25, and it was possible that the coverage was the reason for the attack. He added that charges are expected to be filed within a week. Chhattisgarh’s chief minister, Shri Vishnu Deo Sai, condemned the murder and the state government has set up a special investigation team. So far, at least three arrests have been made. One of those is an individual identified as Suresh Chandrakar, a distant relative of the journalist who, according to local media, was allegedly upset by the state government's investigation into the construction project after the corruption was uncovered, The police tracked hours of security video and phone records before making the arrest of Suresh Chandrakar. The killing was widely condemned by media groups in India. As well as his investigations into corruption, Mukesh Chandrakar was known for his reporting on the Naxalite-Maoist insurgency in India. Gautam Lahiri, president of the Press Club of India, told VOA the case is not the first instance of a journalist being killed in Chhattisgarh. Lahiri said that the press club is demanding 'strict and swift' action. He added that the government needs to do more to protect journalists and should act on a long-standing call for better legislation to ensure media members are safe. 'The Press Club of India has been raising its voice for the protection of journalists,' said Lahiri, adding that the press club demands that central and state governments 'ensure the safety of journalists in the country.' The Editors' Guild of India, in a letter, described the killing as a matter of grave concern. The guild demanded that the state government 'spare no efforts in investigating the case speedily and bringing the guilty to book.' Media watch dogs have been expressing concerns over the declining state of press freedom in India under the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Journalists who cover corruption in remote areas are said to be the most vulnerable. At least 24 journalists have been killed in India in relation to their work in the past decade, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. The media freedom organization is investigating a further nine cases to see if reporting was a motive. Among those cases is Subhash Kumar Mahato, a reporter based in Bihar who covered illegal mining. Mahato was shot in May 2022. India ranks 159 out of 180, where 1 is the best environment on the World Press Freedom Index. Indian authorities deny any threats to press freedom and say that the media enjoys complete freedom in the country.

President-elect Donald Trump tries again to get Friday's hush money sentencing called off	NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump tried again Tuesday to delay this week's sentencing in his hush money case, asking a New York appeals court to intervene as he fights to avoid the finality of his conviction before he returns to the White House. Trump turned to the Appellate Division of the state's trial court a day after the trial judge, Judge Juan M. Merchan, rebuffed his bid to indefinitely postpone sentencing and ordered it to go ahead as scheduled on Friday. Trump is seeking an emergency order that would spare him from being sentenced while he appeals Merchan's decision last week to uphold the historic verdict. Oral arguments were expected before a single judge later Tuesday, with a decision likely soon thereafter. A quick decision is necessary 'to prevent ongoing violations' of Trump's constitutional rights 'and a threatened disruption' of the presidential transition process, Trump lawyer Todd Blanche wrote in a filing with the Appellate Division. Trump, less than two weeks from his inauguration, is poised to be the first president to take office convicted of crimes. If his sentencing doesn't happen before his second term starts Jan. 20, presidential immunity could put it on hold until he leaves office. Merchan has signaled that he is not likely to punish Trump for his conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records and will accommodate the transition by allowing him to appear at sentencing by video, rather than in person at a Manhattan courthouse. Still, the Republican and his lawyers contend that his sentencing should not go forward because the conviction and indictment should be dismissed. They have previously suggested taking the case all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. Merchan last Friday denied Trump's request to throw out his conviction and dismiss the case because of his impending return to the White House, ruling that Trump's current status as president-elect does not afford him the same immunity from criminal proceedings as a sitting president. Merchan wrote that the interests of justice would only be served by 'bringing finality to this matter' through sentencing. He said giving Trump what's known as an unconditional discharge — closing the case without jail time, a fine or probation — 'appears to be the most viable solution.' In his filing Tuesday, Blanche argued that Merchan's interpretation of presidential immunity was wrong and that it should extend to a president-elect during 'the complex, sensitive process of presidential transition.' 'It is unconstitutional to conduct a criminal sentencing of the president-elect during a presidential transition, and doing so threatens to disrupt that transition and undermine the incoming president's ability to effectively wield the executive power of the United States,' Blanche wrote. Trump's lawyers are also challenging the judge's prior decision rejecting Trump's argument that the case should be thrown out because of the U.S. Supreme Court's ruling last July that gave presidents broad immunity from prosecution. Manhattan prosecutors have pushed for sentencing to proceed as scheduled, 'given the strong public interest in prompt prosecution and the finality of criminal proceedings.' Trump was convicted last May on charges involving an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump's 2016 campaign to keep her from publicizing claims she'd had sex with him years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong. The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who had made the payment to Daniels. The conviction carried the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. Trump's sentencing initially was set for last July 11, then postponed twice at the defense's request. After Trump's Nov. 5 election, Merchan delayed the sentencing again so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/president-elect-donald-trump-tries-again-to-get-friday-s-hush-money-sentencing-called-off-/7927434.html	2025-01-07T09:39:36-08:00	
UN calls for halt to all executions in Iran as numbers surge	GENEVA — U.N. human rights chief Volker Türk expressed alarm Tuesday at the sharp increase in executions in Iran and called on the Islamic Republic to halt all further executions of people facing the death penalty for a range of crimes. 'It is deeply disturbing that yet again we see an increase in the number of people subjected to the death penalty in Iran year-on-year,' Türk said in a statement. 'It is high time Iran stemmed this ever-swelling tide of executions.' According to the high commissioner’s office, at least 901 people reportedly were executed in 2024, including some 40 in one week in December. It says the highest number of executions in recent decades was reached in 2015 when at least 972 individuals were executed in Iran. After a decline in the number of executions, it notes that the numbers have risen sharply since 2022. 'At least 853 people were executed in 2023,' Liz Throssell, spokesperson for the high commissioner, told journalists at a briefing in Geneva, adding that the 2024 number of 901 executions 'is alarmingly, shockingly high.' The human rights office reports that most of the executions last year were for drug-related offenses, but that 'dissidents and people connected to the 2022 protests also were executed.' That’s a reference to the nationwide protests that erupted following the Sept. 16, 2022, death in police custody of Mahsa Amini, who was arrested by the so-called morality police for the alleged improper wearing of the hijab. The International Fact-Finding Mission on Iran, which presented a report to the U.N. human rights council in March 2024 found 'credible figures' of up to 551 deaths, including at least 49 women and 68 children had 'occurred in 26 out of the 31 provinces of Iran over multiple months.' Throssell said there was a rise in the number of women executed last year. 'We understand that at least 31 women were reportedly executed in 2024. Now, that marks the highest number in 15 years. 'The majority of cases involve charges of murder. A significant number of the women were victims of domestic violence, child marriage or forced marriage. A number of them were convicted of murdering their husbands,' she said, adding that 'The method of execution, we understand, is by hanging.' She said it was difficult to know how much recourse people accused of crimes had to the judicial system because 'of the opacity of the system' in Iran. 'I mean, people will have lawyers, but it is very hard to determine how free and fair a particular trial may be,' she said. 'So, this is why we believe it is so important to be speaking out on the executions and also to highlight that there are people who are awaiting execution, who are on death row.' 'We are concerned because of this lack of transparency around what happens in Iran with regard to the sentencing and the carrying out of the death penalty,' she said. Human Rights chief Türk doubled down on his concerns by urging Iranian authorities to place a moratorium on the use of the death penalty 'with a view to ultimately abolishing it.' 'We oppose the death penalty under all circumstances,' he said. 'It is incompatible with the fundamental right to life and raises the unacceptable risk of executing innocent people. 'And, to be clear, it can never be imposed for conduct that is protected under international human rights law,' he asserted. International standards prohibit the imposition of the death penalty for any but the 'most serious crimes' — crimes of extreme gravity, involving intentional killing — and 'may be imposed only when the guilt of the person charged is based upon clear and convincing evidence leaving no room for an alternative explanation of the facts.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-calls-for-halt-to-all-executions-in-iran-as-numbers-surge/7927391.html	2025-01-07T09:05:14-08:00	
US determines Sudan's RSF committed genocide, sanctions leader	WASHINGTON — The United States determined on Tuesday that members of Sudan's Rapid Support Forces and allied militias committed genocide in Sudan and it imposed sanctions on the group's leader over a conflict that has killed tens of thousands of people and driven millions from their homes. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in a statement the RSF and aligned militias had continued to direct attacks against civilians, adding that they had systematically murdered men and boys on an ethnic basis and had deliberately targeted women and girls from certain ethnic groups for rape and other forms of sexual violence. The militias have also targeted fleeing civilians and murdered innocent people escaping conflict, Blinken said. 'The United States is committed to holding accountable those responsible for these atrocities,' Blinken said. Washington announced sanctions on the leader of the RSF, Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, who is also known as Hemedti, barring him from traveling to the United States and freezing any U.S. assets he might hold. 'For nearly two years, Hemedti’s RSF has engaged in a brutal armed conflict with the Sudanese Armed Forces for control of Sudan, killing tens of thousands, displacing 12 million Sudanese, and triggering widespread starvation,' the Treasury Department said in a separate statement. Sudan's army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces have been locked in conflict for more than 18 months, creating a humanitarian crisis in which U.N. agencies have struggled to deliver relief. The war erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the RSF ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-determines-sudan-s-rsf-committed-genocide-sanctions-leader/7927309.html	2025-01-07T08:37:36-08:00	
Trump Jr. arrives in Greenland after his father said US should own it	The eldest son of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump arrived in Greenland on Tuesday for a private visit that heightened speculation that the incoming U.S. administration could seek to take control of the mineral-rich Danish territory. The Danish state broadcaster reported that Donald Trump Jr.'s plane landed in Nuuk, capital of the vast and icy territory that has some 57,000 residents. Local media broadcast footage of him walking across a snowy tarmac. In a statement, Greenland's government said that Trump Jr.'s visit would take place 'as a private individual' and not as an official visit and that Greenlandic representatives would not meet with him. Greenland is an autonomous territory that's part of Denmark. Mininguaq Kleist, permanent secretary for the Greenland Foreign Affairs department, told The Associated Press that authorities were informed that Trump Jr. would stay for about four to five hours. Neither Trump Jr.'s delegation nor Greenlandic government officials had requested a meeting, Kleist said. The visit nonetheless had political overtones. The president-elect recently voiced a desire — also expressed during his first presidency — to acquire the territory in the Arctic, an area of strategic importance for the United States, China, Russia and others. The world's largest island, Greenland sits between the Atlantic and Arctic oceans and is home to a large U.S. military base. It is 80% covered by an ice sheet. 'I am hearing that the people of Greenland are 'MAGA.' My son, Don Jr., and various representatives, will be traveling there to visit some of the most magnificent areas and sights,' the president-elect posted on his social media site Monday night, referring to his 'Make America Great Again' slogan. 'Greenland is an incredible place, and the people will benefit tremendously if, and when, it becomes part of our nation,' Trump wrote. 'We will protect it, and cherish it, from a very vicious outside world. MAKE GREENLAND GREAT AGAIN!' Greenland Prime Minister Mute Egede has called for independence from Denmark, saying in a New Year's speech that it would be a way for Greenland to free itself from its colonial past. But Egede has also said he has no interest in Greenland becoming part of the United States, insisting that the island is not for sale. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Tuesday that the future of Greenland would be decided by Greenland and called the United States Denmark's most important ally. Denmark's King Frederik X has been asserting the kingdom's rights to Greenland as well as the Faroe Islands, a self-governing archipelago located between Iceland and Norway in the North Atlantic Ocean. Last month, the king changed Denmark's coat of arms to include fields that represent Greenland and the Faroe Islands. Greenland is represented by a silver bear with a red tongue. The royal announcement noted that since 1194, the royal coat of arms 'visually symbolized the legitimacy and sovereignty of the state and the monarch.' 'We are all united and each of us committed for the Kingdom of Denmark,' the king said in his New Year's address, adding: 'all the way to Greenland.' During his first term, the U.S. president-elect mused about purchasing Greenland, which gained home rule from Denmark in 1979. He canceled a scheduled trip to Denmark in August 2019 after its prime minister dismissed the idea. Reviving the issue in a statement last month as he announced his pick for U.S. ambassador to Denmark, Trump wrote: 'For purposes of national security and freedom throughout the world, the United States of America feels that the ownership and control of Greenland is an absolute necessity.' Trump's eldest son has become a prominent player in his father's political movement and has served on his presidential transition team, helping to select the people who will staff the incoming White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-jr-arrives-in-greenland-after-his-father-said-u-s-should-own-it/7927226.html	2025-01-07T07:08:24-08:00	
Why Ivory Coast, Senegal asked French troops to leave	London — In a major shift in West Africa's security landscape, Ivory Coast and Senegal, regional economic powerhouses, have ordered France to remove its troops from their territories. The withdrawals will mark the effective end of a decadeslong military presence by France in Senegal and Ivory Coast. But why is this happening? Geoffroy Julien Kouao, an Ivorian political scientist, explained that it is part of a broader strategy by African nations wanting to forge new partnerships. 'I think that African politicians want to diversify their relations, especially with the countries of the global south, such as China, Turkey, Brazil, the Arab monarchies of the Gulf, but also with Russia,' he said. Ivory Coast and Senegal are following in the footsteps of Sahel countries that are fighting a war against jihadis linked to Islamic State and al-Qaida. After almost 10 years of French military involvement failed to stop escalating terrorist violence in the Sahel, the former colonial power began removing its troops from the region in 2022. 'Coastal countries like Senegal and Ivory Coast are part of the new dynamic initiated by the Sahel states, such as Burkina Faso, Mali, Niger and Chad,' Kouao said. 'These countries are looking for more sovereignty and above all [politicians] don’t want to go against public opinion, which favors the departure of French troops.' Public opinion in West Africa has become critical of French and Western military presence in the region. Many see it as a continuation of colonial ties. It has even become the source of debunked conspiracy theories that France is supporting terrorist groups. Rinaldo Depagne, West Africa project director for the International Crisis Group, doubts the French military departure will improve security in Senegal and Ivory Coast, which border the Sahel countries and have seen terrorist attacks spilling over from them. 'The expansion of jihadism in the north of the coastal countries has been slow, but fairly constant since 2020,' Depagne said. 'It is not certain that the departure of French troops, and more broadly of foreign troops, will make a big difference, except perhaps in terms of information.' Asked if Senegal and Ivory Coast could seek military partnerships with Russia, as some Sahel countries have, Depagne said that.the presence of French troops in the Sahel between 2013 and 2022 did not restore security, and that the Russian troops currently engaged in the Sahel haven’t done any better. He said that this is largely because the solution to Sahelian armed jihadism is not only military but also political. Analyst Andrew Lebovich, a research fellow at the Clingendael Institute in the Netherlands, noted that as French troops depart West Africa, France continues to train troops fighting terrorism. 'Certainly, French troops are going to remain involved in training and cooperation in Cote d’Ivoire, in Benin, likely in a few other places, so it’s not an end to the post-colonial military presence, but it certainly is an important shift,' he said. Other Western nations are offering military assistance to coastal West African countries. The U.S. will hold its annual West African military exercise, Flintlock, in Ivory Coast this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/why-ivory-coast-senegal-asked-french-troops-to-leave/7927218.html	2025-01-07T06:55:15-08:00	
Protests over power outages block Pakistan’s trade route with China	ISLAMABAD — Thousands continued their blockade of a crucial Pakistani trade route with China for a fifth day on Tuesday, protesting chronic, prolonged power outages in the mountainous region. The organizers of the sit-in demonstration in Hunza, a picturesque city with a population of more than 70,000, have pledged to remain in place until their demands are met. Rally leaders emphasized the town’s persistent inadequate power supply, noting that residents endure up to 23-hour electricity outages amid a harsh winter season. Both men and women participated in the protest, braving average daytime temperatures of -4 degrees Celsius and nighttime temperatures of -10 degrees Celsius, as reported by rally participants to VOA via phone. Rahim Aman, a Hunza resident, reported a gradual and substantial increase in protesters, saying female activists were seen using vehicles and loudspeakers to encourage participation in the rally. He said representatives of local political parties, traders and hotel associations were also present. Local authorities negotiated with the protesters but failed to persuade them to disperse and restore traffic flow along the Karakoram Highway connecting Pakistan to China. Hunza is situated on the scenic roadway traversing the Gilgit-Baltistan region, bordering China’s western Xinjiang province. Traders reported that numerous containers carrying commercial goods were stuck on both sides of the highway due to the sit-in demonstration. The crippling protest erupted more than a month after Pakistan and China announced that they would keep open their sole land port, the Khunjerab Pass, for year-round operations to foster trade connectivity between the two nations. The world’s highest paved border crossing, approximately 190 kilometers from Hunza, stands at an elevation exceeding 4,600 meters and was previously closed for four months annually due to heavy snowfall. The impoverished Gilgit-Baltistan region heavily relies on hydropower, but generation almost ceases during the winter months due to the freezing of rivers and lakes. Consequently, residents and business establishments, including hotels, must operate expensive thermal generators to maintain power supply. Residents and area experts have noted that the growing use of such generators by major hotels and other commercial entities is damaging the atmosphere in Hunza and surrounding areas. The United Nations reports that the Pakistani regions are home to some of the largest stretches of glaciers outside the northern pole and already face the growing threat of global warming. The Khunjerab Pass is an integral component of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, or CPEC. The multibillion-dollar corridor seeks to establish a comprehensive trade and transit infrastructure between the two nations, the most populous and fifth-most populous in the world. Beijing has invested more than $25 billion in Pakistan since the two countries launched the CPEC a decade ago and is eager to use Gwadar, a Chinese-managed Pakistani port on the Arabian Sea, as a strategic gateway to international markets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-over-power-outages-block-pakistan-s-trade-route-with-china/7927174.html	2025-01-07T06:53:07-08:00	
Chinese-owned gold mine stirs controversy in eastern Zimbabwe	Mutare, Zimbabwe — Government officials in Zimbabwe have been scrutinizing a Chinese mining company that has been operating a gold mine in the country’s east since at least 2021. The scrutiny comes as residents voice concern about the impact on health and the environment. The company in question is Sino Africa Huijin Holdings, which faces accusations of severe environmental destruction and community harm. Its gold prospecting operations have been taking place in an area known as Premier Estate in the Mutasa District of Manicaland. Villagers and community groups have complained about the blasting that has taken place at the mine. Nearby residents have reported widespread ecological damage, including the decimation of a mountain and the displacement of wildlife. They also say tremors from the blasts have caused structural damage to homes. Residents further complain of dust pollution and the potential contamination of water sources due to alleged leaching of cyanide. Cyanide leaching is a method of extracting gold from ore that can pollute water resources. Adding to these concerns, Sino Africa is accused of forging community signatures on their Environmental Impact Assessment document, raising questions about the transparency and legitimacy of their operations. The complaints prompted the government to shut down the mine’s operations twice in 2024. In the past two months, however, mining has resumed. 'We are between a rock and a hard place. If it's possible, let them compensate us and relocate us because it's no longer appealing,' Ishewedenga Moyo, one of 30 residents living within some 300 meters of the Sino Africa Huijin mine, told VOA in December. 'The vibrations and noise generated by mining blasting are disrupting wildlife habitats and ecosystems, damaging biodiversity, and causing cracks in our homes,' Moyo added. Government-ordered suspensions A Manicaland Joint Command Task Force, composed of a number of government entities, ordered the temporary closure of Sino Africa Huijin's gold mining operations twice. Officials say the shutdowns were enforced to ensure the mine met all necessary requirements. The first suspension occurred in October and lasted two weeks. Sino Africa Huijin made pledges to improve the situation and was allowed to resume operations. Then, the task force ordered the mine to close a second time in mid-November. Traditional Chief James Kurauone of the Mutasa district told VOA on Dec. 11 that officials forced Sino Africa Huijing's operations to stop each time because the company 'failed to address critical concerns raised by the local community.' 'These concerns that led to the temporary closure included severe air pollution, destructive blasting activities impacting local homes, and the company's failure to fulfill its corporate social responsibility obligations,' said Mutasa in recent comments. Mutasa added that he plans to convene a meeting with mining officials and members from the community to discuss a path forward in a couple of weeks. Mining compliance Mining operations resumed on November 25 at the conclusion of discussions among government officials, community leaders and company representatives. Daniel Panganai, the current HR manager of Sino Africa Huijin, was involved in the discussions. He told VOA in mid-December that the company 'complied with all the requirements outlined in writing, but I cannot divulge much information at this time.' Misheck Mugadza, the Manicaland minister of state, also said in December that Sino Africa Huijin committed to adhering to all mining and environmental regulations. He said the Chinese company had acted on its social responsibility obligations by donating to the local hospital and drilling a well to provide water to the local school. The government is closely monitoring the company's operations, Mugadza said, and some households have already received full compensation for damages. He further stated that the company is obligated to compensate all affected residents. Chinese investments in Zimbabwean mines The controversy surrounding the Sino Africa Huijin mine is not isolated, according to a September report by the Center for Natural Resource Governance, or CNRG, a Harare-based community rights organization. The report, which assessed the impact of Chinese investment on Zimbabwe's mining industry, found that 'Chinese mining ventures have led to widespread environmental degradation, disregard for the cultural rights of host communities, and, in many cases, the violation of the country’s labor laws, often with apparent impunity.' Chinese investors control an estimated 90% of the of Zimbabwe’s mining industry, according to the report. 'In 2023 alone, Sino investments in Zimbabwe’s mining sector saw 121 investors contributing a staggering $2.79 billion,' said CNRG Executive Director Farai Maguwu, who was quoted in a post on the organization’s website. Separately, another area resident voiced criticism of the government’s response to the mining. 'There are times when the mine uses explosives of higher magnitude, and there will be tremors,' said area resident Thobekile Mhenziwamukuru. 'When we call the government officials about the crisis, they always go directly alone to the Sino mine offices without any community leaders, then they will come and address us, just saying they will use explosives of low magnitude next time and we now know that it's now their cash cow. 'Even in terms of closing and reopening of the mine, instead of solving our grievances, there is no fairness in everything because money is being exchanged to slow the progress and we hope higher offices in government will come to rescue us,' she concluded. Maguwu accused local lawmakers of corruption, saying, 'Instead of enforcing the law, they are cashing in on this illegality by forcing them to close down, demanding bribes for reopening, and then returning to close them down again and demand another bribe.' Despite repeated phone calls and visits to the offices of government stakeholders to address these accusations, including the Ministry of Mines and the Environmental Management Agency, VOA received no response. 'This cycle goes on and on while the environment is being sacrificed,' Maguwu said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-owned-gold-mine-stirs-controversy-in-eastern-zimbabwe/7927141.html	2025-01-07T06:01:33-08:00	
Meta shelves fact-checking program in US, adopts X-like 'Community Notes' model	Meta is ending its fact-checking program in the U.S. and replacing it with a 'Community Notes' system similar to that on Elon Musk-owned X, the Facebook parent said on Tuesday. The Community Notes model will allow users on Meta's social media sites Facebook, Instagram and Threads to call out posts that are potentially misleading and need more context, rather than placing the responsibility on independent fact checking organizations and experts. 'Experts, like everyone else, have their own biases and perspectives. This showed up in the choices some made about what to fact check and how ... A program intended to inform too often became a tool to censor,' Meta said. Meta added that its efforts over the years to manage content across its platforms have expanded 'to the point where we are making too many mistakes, frustrating our users and too often getting in the way of the free expression we set out to enable.' The company said it would begin phasing in Community Notes in the United States over the next couple of months and would improve the model over the course of the year. It will also stop demoting fact-checked content and use a label notifying users there is additional information related to the post, instead of the company's current method of displaying full-screen warnings that users have to click through before even viewing the post.	https://www.voanews.com/a/meta-shelves-fact-checking-program-in-us-adopts-x-like-community-notes-model-/7927124.html	2025-01-07T05:53:07-08:00

South Korean anti-corruption agency receives new court warrant to detain impeached President Yoon	Seoul, South Korea — South Korea's anti-corruption agency said it received a new court warrant on Tuesday to detain impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol after its previous attempt was blocked by the presidential security service last week. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which plans to question the embattled president on rebellion allegations over his short-lived martial law decree on Dec. 3, didn't immediately confirm how long the warrant would remain valid. The agency's chief prosecutor, Oh Dong-woon, refused to answer when asked by lawmakers when the warrant would expire, saying such information is sensitive as the agency and police contemplate ways to execute it. Detention warrants typically last seven days but can be extended to around 10 days. Oh didn't say when investigators planned to make their next attempt to detain Yoon. The Seoul Western District Court last week had initially issued a warrant to detain Yoon and a separate warrant to search his residence after he repeatedly defied authorities by refusing to appear for questioning. About 150 anti-corruption agency investigators and police officers attempted to detain Yoon on Friday but retreated from his residence in Seoul after a tense standoff with the presidential security service that lasted more than five hours. The investigators did not make another attempt to detain Yoon and the previous court warrants expired after a week on Monday. If investigators manage to detain Yoon, they will likely ask a court for permission to make a formal arrest. Otherwise, he will be released after 48 hours. The anti-corruption agency and police have pledged to make a more forceful effort to detain Yoon, which could be a complicated process as long as he remains in his official residence. The anti-corruption agency is leading a joint investigation with the police and military into Yoon's brief power grab, which included declaring martial law and dispatching troops to surround the National Assembly. Lawmakers who managed to get past the blockade voted to lift martial law hours later. Yoon's presidential powers were suspended after the opposition-dominated Assembly voted to impeach him on Dec. 14, accusing him of rebellion. The Constitutional Court has started deliberations on whether to formally remove Yoon from office or reinstate him. Members of the presidential security staff were seen installing barbed wire near the gate and along the hills leading up to the presidential compound over the weekend. Oh confirmed to lawmakers that the agency was debating with police on whether to arrest members of the presidential security staff if they forcefully obstruct efforts to detain Yoon. Police have said they are considering 'all available options' to bring Yoon into custody and haven't publicly ruled out the possibility of deploying SWAT teams, although it's unclear whether investigators would risk escalating a confrontation with presidential security forces, who are also armed. Park Jong-joon, chief of the presidential security service, has hit back against criticism that it has become Yoon's private army, saying it has legal obligations to protect the incumbent president. He and his deputy have so far defied summonses by police, who planned to question them over the suspected obstruction of official duty following Friday's events. In a parliament hearing Tuesday, Oh criticized the country's acting leader, Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok, for instructing police to oblige with the presidential security service's request to deploy personnel to Yoon's residence to beef up security ahead of Friday's detention attempt. The police did not carry out Choi's instruction, and Oh said the agency was reviewing whether Choi's actions constituted an obstruction of official duty. The agency has repeatedly called for Choi to instruct the presidential security service to comply with the execution of the detention warrant against Yoon. Choi hasn't commented. Yoon's lawyers argued the detention and search warrants against the president cannot be enforced at his residence due to a law that protects locations potentially linked to military secrets from search without the consent of the person in charge — which would be Yoon. They also argue the anti-corruption office lacks the legal authority to investigate rebellion charges and delegate police to detain Yoon. Yoon's lawyers on Monday filed complaints with public prosecutors against Oh and six other anti-corruption and police officers over Friday's detention attempt, which they claim was illegal. The lawyers also filed complaints against the country's acting national police chief, the acting defense minister and two Seoul police officials for ignoring the presidential security service's request to provide additional forces to block Yoon's detention attempt.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-anti-corruption-agency-receives-new-court-warrant-to-detain-impeached-president-yoon-/7927069.html	2025-01-07T05:09:51-08:00	
Jean-Marie Le Pen, French far-right leader, dies at 96	Paris — Jean-Marie Le Pen, the founder of France's far-right National Front who was known for fiery rhetoric against immigration and multiculturalism that earned him both staunch supporters and widespread condemnation, has died. He was 96. Jordan Bardella, president of the National Rally as the party is now known, confirmed Le Pen's death in a post on social media platform X on Tuesday. A polarizing figure in French politics, Le Pen's controversial statements, including Holocaust denial, led to multiple convictions and strained his political alliances. Le Pen, who once reached the second round of the 2002 presidential election, was eventually estranged from his daughter, Marine Le Pen, who renamed his National Front party, kicked him out and transformed it into one of France's most powerful political forces while distancing herself from her father's extremist image Despite his exclusion from the party in 2015, Le Pen's divisive legacy endures, marking decades of French political history and shaping the trajectory of the far right. His death came at a crucial time for his daughter. She now faces a potential prison term and a ban on running for political office if convicted in the embezzling trial currently underway. A fixture for decades in French politics, the fiery Jean-Marie Le Pen was a wily political strategist and gifted orator who used his charisma to captivate crowds with his anti-immigration message. The portly, silver-haired son of a Breton fisherman viewed himself as a man with a mission — to keep France French under the banner of the National Front. Picking Joan of Arc as the party's patron saint, Le Pen made Islam, and Muslim immigrants, his primary target, blaming them for the economic and social woes of France. A former paratrooper and Foreign Legionnaire who fought in Indochina and Algeria, he led sympathizers into political and ideological battles with a panache that became a signature of his career. 'If I advance, follow me; if I die, avenge me; if I shirk, kill me,' Le Pen said at a 1990 party congress, reflecting the theatrical style that for decades fed the fervor of followers. Le Pen had recently been exempted from prosecution on health grounds from a high-profile trial over his party's suspected embezzlement of European Parliament funds that opened in September. Le Pen had 11 prior convictions, including for violence against a public official and antisemitic hate speech. French judicial authorities placed Le Pen under legal guardianship in February at the request of his family as his health declined, French media reported. He had been in frail health for some time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jean-marie-le-pen-french-far-right-leader-dies-at-96-/7927063.html	2025-01-07T04:56:49-08:00	
France commemorates victims of Charlie Hebdo attacks 10 years on	Paris — France on Tuesday commemorated the victims of the deadly assault on the Charlie Hebdo satirical magazine 10 years ago that began a spate of Islamist militant attacks on the country and stoked a debate on press freedoms that still rages today. Two masked al Qaeda-linked gunmen with assault rifles stormed what were then the offices of Charlie Hebdo and killed 12 people. The attackers sought to avenge the Prophet Mohammad nearly a decade after the atheist and frequently provocative weekly published cartoons mocking the Prophet. The killings spurred an outpouring of national sympathy expressed in the slogan 'Je Suis Charlie' (I am Charlie) and prompted an impassioned debate about freedom of expression and religion in secular France. 'There were scenes I will never forget,' former French President Francois Hollande told Reuters. 'We had to act and we did so responsibly, aware that we weren't finished and that there would be other tragedies. And there were.' President Emmanuel Macron and Paris Mayor Anne Hidalgo will lead the commemorations, which include a wreath-laying ceremony and a minute's silence at three locations in the capital. Al Qaeda's Yemen branch had placed Charlie Hebdo's then editor, Stephane Charbonnier, on its 'wanted list' after the magazine first ran the images of the Prophet Mohammad in 2006. Two attackers born and raised in France stormed Charlie Hebdo's offices on Jan. 7, 2015, spraying gunfire. They killed eight members of the editorial team, including Charbonnier, and four other people before being shot dead by police. Over the next two days, another French-born man killed a policewoman and four Jewish hostages in a kosher supermarket in a Paris suburb. He was also shot dead by police. More than 250 people have been killed in France in Islamist violence since then, laying bare the struggle the country has faced to counter the threat posed by militants. Freedom of speech The anniversary has prompted renewed reflection in France about press freedoms. Hollande expressed concern that there was growing self-censorship stemming from fear. 'Should we publish drawings, project certain images, or compile reports when we know they may hurt personalities or communities? There is a form of self-censorship that has taken root,' he said. Charlie Hebdo published a special edition to mark the anniversary, depicting a man sitting on the butt of gun in front of the word 'Indestructible!' on its cover. 'Today the values of Charlie Hebdo — such as humor, satire, freedom of expression, ecology, secularism, feminism, to name a few - have never been so under threat,' it said in an editorial. Charlie Hebdo's no-taboo journalism divides France. For Muslims any depiction of the Prophet Mohammad is blasphemous. Critics of Charlie Hebdo accuse it of crossing the line and straying into Islamophobia by repeatedly publishing cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad. The magazine denies this and says it lampoons all religions, including Christianity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-commemorates-victims-of-charlie-hebdo-attacks-10-years-on-/7927008.html	2025-01-07T03:48:08-08:00	
Israeli military says it killed 3 militants in West Bank raids	Israel’s military said Tuesday it carried out raids in the occupied West Bank, killing at least three militants and arresting 18 others. The Israel Defense Forces said an airstrike killed two militants in the village of Tamun after they fired at troops. Israeli forces killed another militant during fighting in Taluza, while an Israeli soldier was wounded. The raids came a day after gunman attacked a bus and car near the West Bank town of Al-Funduq, killing three people and wounding seven others. Violence has surged in the West Bank since the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel and the resulting Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian health officials say Israeli troop fire and attacks by Israeli settlers have killed at least 818 Palestinians in the West Bank during that time, while Palestinians have killed dozens of Israelis. The war in Gaza began with the October 7, 2023 Hamas attack in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. There are still about 100 hostages being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,800 people and injured more than 109,000, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group. Some information for this report was provided by from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-military-says-it-killed-3-militants-in-west-bank-raids-/7926996.html	2025-01-07T03:26:20-08:00	
Blinken visits Japan as Nippon Steel decision weighs on relations	WASHINGTON/TOKYO — U.S. President Joe Biden's decision to block Nippon Steel's $14.9 billion bid for U.S. Steel cast a shadow over Secretary of State Antony Blinken's visit to Japan on Tuesday for farewell meetings with Washington's most important ally in Asia. The rejection, announced on Friday, has jolted U.S. efforts to boost ties with Asian allies just as South Korea's political crisis potentially complicates a revived relationship between Washington, Seoul and Tokyo. The trilateral alliance is a key plank in the countries' efforts to counter China's military buildup. Investment into the U.S. could also be chilled, but analysts say any damage to the wider U.S.-Japan relationship will likely be limited given shared security concerns about China. On Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba described Biden's decision to block the sale of U.S. Steel to Nippon Steel as 'perplexing.' Accompanied by White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Blinken met Japan's Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya in Tokyo and will hold talks later in the day with Ishiba and other senior Japanese officials Numerous trips to Japan over the last four years 'is evidence, not just of the importance, but of the centrality the United States attaches to our partnership. President Biden asked me to come on this last trip to underscore that,' Blinken told Iwaya. 'We have, between our two countries, a partnership that started out focusing on bilateral issues, that worked on regional issues and that now is genuinely global,' he added. Ahead of his trip, the State Department said that Blinken wanted to build on the momentum of U.S.-Japan-South Korea trilateral cooperation. In Seoul on Monday, Blinken reaffirmed confidence in South Korea's handling of its political turmoil as investigators there sought an extension of a warrant to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. Allies of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump have also reassured Seoul and Tokyo that he will support continuing to improve ties and advance military, economic and diplomatic cooperation to counter China and North Korea, Reuters reported ahead of Trump's Nov. 5 re-election. Tension, limited damage from Nippon Steel decision Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel filed a lawsuit on Monday charging that Biden violated the U.S. Constitution by blocking their $14.9 billion merger through what they termed a sham national security review. They called for the U.S. federal court to overturn the decision. Nicholas Szechenyi, a Japan expert at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, said Biden's decision would make Blinken's Tokyo visit 'awkward.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-visits-japan-as-nippon-steel-decision-weighs-on-relations-/7926990.html	2025-01-07T03:15:16-08:00	
Chinese vessel suspected of damaging undersea cable near Taiwan	Taiwan is investigating a Chinese-owned ship suspected of severing an undersea fiber-optic cable north of the island. While the incident caused minimal disruption to internet services, analysts say it reflects the vulnerability of Taiwan and its undersea infrastructure in the event of a Chinese military attack or blockade. 'It’s a vulnerability shared by a lot of countries in a globalized world,' said Drew Thompson, a senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore and a former Pentagon official. 'The real challenge for Taiwan is how do they increase their resilience now [that] there is growing awareness that they could be intentionally held vulnerable through direct attacks that are difficult to attribute to a particular actor,' he told VOA by phone. Taiwan’s government-run telecommunications operator Chunghwa Telecom received a warning about damage to a subsea cable near the Keelung Harbor in northern Taiwan Friday morning. Chunghwa Telecom said the disruption, which didn’t affect internet service across the island, may have been caused by a vessel dragging its anchor along the seabed where the undersea cable is located. Within hours, Taiwan’s coast guard dispatched a ship and found the Cameroon-flagged vessel Shunxin-39 in waters north of Taiwan. Taiwanese authorities ordered the ship to return to waters off Keelung Harbor for inspection but failed to board the ship due to rough weather conditions. Taipei has sought assistance from South Korea to investigate the ship, which is sailing toward the South Korean city of Busan. The Taiwanese coast guard said in a statement shared with VOA that the ship is owned by a Hong Kong company headed by a Chinese national. The seven crew members on board are Chinese nationals. In addition to carrying a Cameroon flag, Taiwanese authorities said the ship was also registered in Tanzania and seemed to operate under two sets of Automatic Identification System equipment, which shows the vessel’s basic information and coordinates. The coast guard said while the Chinese vessel’s intention remains unclear, the incident could be part of China’s gray zone operations that aim to exert pressure on Taiwan through irregular tactics short of combat. China views Taiwan as part of its territory and has repeatedly vowed to reunify with the island, with force if necessary. China has increased the frequency of its gray zone operations around Taiwan in recent years, regularly deploying military aircraft, naval vessels, and coast guard ships to airspaces and waters near Taiwan. Ray Powell, director of Stanford University’s Sealight project, which tracks Chinese maritime activities across the Indo-Pacific region, told VOA that the Chinese vessel has been operating between in waters near Taiwan’s Keelung Harbor, South Korea’s Busan and along the Chinese coast under two different names, two different flags, and six different identification numbers over the last six months. 'Having at least six different registration numbers indicates this ship is devoted to being off-grid or hard to track,' he said in a phone interview. Powell said the vessel may be conducting a gray zone operation against Taiwan’s key infrastructure in the region. 'The reason we would classify the incident as a potential gray zone activity is because it’s hidden behind a private company based out of Hong Kong with an owner in China and flags of African countries, which keep the Chinese government from the vessel’s activities,' he told VOA. The Chinese embassy in Washington, D.C., told VOA in a written response that it is unaware of the severing of the undersea cable near northern Taiwan, adding that Beijing 'has always welcomed and supported other countries and telecommunications companies laying international submarine cables in waters under China’s jurisdiction.' The incident comes amid a growing number of damages to undersea cables and pipelines caused by Chinese and Russian vessels in the Baltic Sea since 2023. It is also not the first time a Chinese vessel has been suspected of cutting undersea cables near Taiwan. In February 2023, Taiwanese authorities found evidence that two Chinese ships cut two internet cables near Taiwan’s outlying island of Matsu, causing a month-long internet outage on the tiny island. Since then, Taiwan has poured more resources into preparing for potential internet outages caused by damage to undersea cables. Last October, Chunghwa Telecom announced that signals from low-earth orbit satellites should cover the entire island. It was part of the efforts to reduce Taiwan’s dependence on undersea cables for external communication. During the first tabletop military exercise held by Taiwan’s presidential office last month, response to internet blackouts caused by damage to undersea cables was one of the scenarios simulated by top Taiwanese officials. While Chunghwa Telecom said the cable will be fixed later this month, Taiwan’s Ministry of Digital Affairs has vowed to secure more funding to help the telecom operator build more facilities to increase the island’s connection to international undersea cables. Some Taiwanese lawmakers also urged the coast guard to strengthen its capabilities to monitor activities in areas concentrated with undersea cables and update protocols in case similar incidents happen in the future. Some analysts say the coast guard needs to enhance its capabilities to address challenges posed by China, which have become more frequent in recent years. That includes monitoring 'irregular activities conducted by fishing or commercial vessels in waters near Taiwan’s undersea cables,' said Shen Ming-shih, a defense analyst at the Taipei-based Institute for National Defense and Security Research. He told VOA in a phone interview that Taiwan should also enhance its efficiency in repairing 'damaged undersea cables within the shortest amount of time.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-vessel-suspected-of-damaging-undersea-cable-near-taiwan/7926977.html	2025-01-07T02:31:06-08:00	
Indonesia is admitted to the BRICS bloc of developing nations	SAO PAULO — Indonesia has been admitted as a full member of the BRICS bloc of developing economies, the group's presiding country, Brazil, announced Monday. Indonesia's candidacy was endorsed by BRICS leaders in August 2023, according to the foreign ministry of Brazil, which holds the group's presidency for 2025. However, the world's fourth most populous nation opted to formally join the bloc only after the formation of its newly elected government last year. 'The Brazilian government welcomes Indonesia's entry into the BRICS,' the government said in a statement. 'With the largest population and economy in Southeast Asia, Indonesia shares with other members a commitment to reforming global governance institutions and contributes positively to deepening South-South cooperation.' Indonesia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a written statement Tuesday said that it reflects Indonesia's increasingly active role in global issues, and its commitment to strengthening multilateral cooperation. 'Indonesia views its membership in BRICS as a strategic step to increase collaboration and cooperation with other developing countries, based on the principles of equality, mutual respect, and sustainable development,' said the statement. BRICS was formed by Brazil, Russia, India and China in 2009, and South Africa was added in 2010. Last year, the alliance expanded to embrace Iran, Egypt, Ethiopia and the United Arab Emirates. Saudi Arabia has been invited to join but has not yet done so. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have formally applied to become members and a few others have expressed interest. The organization was created as a counterweight to the Group of Seven, comprised of developed nations. Its name derives from an economic term used in the early 2000s to describe rising countries expected to dominate the global economy by 2050. Before Indonesia's membership, the bloc accounted for nearly 45% of the world's population and 35% of global gross domestic product, measured using purchasing power parity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-is-admitted-to-the-brics-bloc-of-developing-nations/7926970.html	2025-01-07T02:17:46-08:00	
Strong earthquake kills at least 95 people in western China near Mount Everest	BEIJING — A strong earthquake killed at least 95 people in Tibet on Tuesday and left many others trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the high-altitude region of western China and across the border in Nepal. Officials in the region said at a brief news conference that 130 others were injured, state broadcaster CCTV said. Video on CCTV showed orange-suited rescue workers climbing piles of debris blocking homes in a heavily damaged village, while chunks that had been knocked off buildings littered streets and crushed cars in other areas. State media reported that about 1,000 houses were damaged and 130 people were injured in addition to the deaths, citing the Tibet earthquake relief headquarters. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles). China recorded the magnitude as 6.8. The epicenter was about 75 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Mount Everest, which straddles the China-Nepal border. The area is seismically active and is where the India and Eurasia plates clash and cause uplifts in the Himalayan mountains strong enough to change the heights of some of the world's tallest peaks. About 50 aftershocks were recorded in the three hours after the earthquake, and the Mount Everest scenic area on the Chinese side was closed after the quake. About 1,500 fire and rescue workers were deployed to search for people, the Ministry of Emergency Management. Two hundred soldiers joined the search, CCTV said. Chinese leader Xi Jinping. called for all-out efforts to rescue people, minimize casualties and resettle those whose homes were damaged. Vice Premier Zhang Guoqing, was dispatched to the area to guide the work. CCTV said there are a handful of communities within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of the epicenter, which was 380 kilometers (240 miles) from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and about 23 kilometers (14 miles) from the region's second-largest city of Shigatse, known as Xigaze in Chinese. The average altitude in the area around the epicenter is about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet), the China Earthquake Networks Center said in a social media post. In Nepal, authorities asked officials in the mountainous area near the epicenter to search for any casualties or damage. The National Emergency Operation Center in Kathmandu said people in northeastern Nepal strongly felt the earthquake but there were no immediate reports of injuries or damage to houses. A police officer in Solukhumbu district, where Mount Everest is located, said by telephone that there were no reports of damage. The area, often crowded with climbers and hikers, was empty in the depth of winter. Many residents move to the south to avoid the harsh winter. About 230 kilometers (140 miles) from the epicenter in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, the earthquake woke up residents and sent them running out of their homes into the streets. There have been 10 earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in the area where Tuesday's quake hit over the past century, the USGS said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/strong-earthquake-kills-at-least-95-people-in-western-china-near-mount-everest/7926895.html	2025-01-07T02:03:24-08:00	
What future awaits Syria’s Christian minority?	De facto Syrian leader Ahmed al-Sharaa — whose Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) fighters drove President Bashar al-Assad from power last month — recently met with the Mideast nation's Christian leadership after a string of menacing attacks on religious minorities, giving some observers hope the sanctioned militants are ushering in an era of greater inclusion and tolerance, though others remain skeptical. Protests broke out in Syria over the Dec. 23 burning of a Christmas tree in a Christian-majority town in Hama amid other reports of harassment, prompting calls for the new Islamist authorities to take steps to safeguard ethnic minorities. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), an independent U.K.-based human rights organization, 'Uzbek gunmen set fire to the Christmas tree in Al-Saqilibiya in Hama... that is inhabited by Christian residents.' The state-run Syrian Arab News Agency reported on Sharaa’s meeting with Catholic, Orthodox, and Anglican clerics, including publishing pictures from the event. Syrian Catholic Archbishop Jacques Mourad of Homs, who attended the meeting, said Sharaa avoided using the term 'minority,' according to France-based La Croix International, a general-interest Catholic publication. 'He said that Christians and other groups are part of the Syrian people,' the archbishop told La Croix. 'He is aware that we Christians are foundational to this country.' Hope and skepticism Rafif Jouejati, nonresident scholar at the Washington-based Middle East Institute, expressed optimism about the public rallies to demand accountability. 'If you watch the demonstrations taking place in Syria, you see immediately that people are out freely expressing their views,' she told VOA. 'This is not something we've been able to do in half a century.' She also shared her belief that Syria is moving in the right direction, dismissing concerns about a country transitioning to an Islamist state. But others aren't so sure. Richard Ghazal, executive director of In Defense of Christians, told VOA there was no 'difference [between HTS] and their organizational predecessor, Jabhat al-Nusra, which is the Nusra Front, al-Qaida or even [Islamic State].' 'They've taken the lessons from the mistakes of ISIS and al-Qaida,' he said, using another term for Islamic State, which is also known as ISIS, ISIL, IS or Daesh. 'They've used those to polish their message, their media engagement, and try to fool the West if not convince the West.' Although Sharaa was quick to emphasize the language of tolerance upon ousting Assad from power, declaring 'a Syria for everyone' the day after taking Damascus, Ghazal says how they will govern remains to be seen. Jouejati points to 2016, when HTS leaders distanced themselves from more radical militant groups. 'They have shown themselves to be far more moderate than their Islamist counterparts,' she said. 'We're observing a gradual shift away from any semblance of an Islamic dictatorship. Increasingly, they are beginning to resemble civilians more than soldiers.' Sanctions U.S. officials recently lifted a $10 million bounty on Sharaa, a decision that top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East Barbara Leaf called a 'policy decision' aimed at facilitating engagement with HTS. U.N. Syria envoy Geir Pedersen in late December expressed hope for a swift end to the U.N. sanctions on Sharaa’s organization to help facilitate Syria's economic recovery. But Syria's economic rebound, say some observers, also requires an inclusive constitutional framework. 'The main challenge today, of course, is putting together a government that is in accordance and in adherence with U.N. resolution 2254,' said Ghazal said, which 'calls for a new Syrian government that actively involves the Syrian people and putting that government together with full sight and visibility to the international community and full transparency.' Jouejati envisions Syria evolving into a 'Middle Eastern-style democracy.' 'I believe we will have a country that is based on ... all human rights. I believe we have an opportunity to establish a state that is grounded on the rule of law, that incorporates transitional justice, that has free and fair elections, that has a separation of powers, and perhaps most importantly, a separation of religion and state,' she said. The 2023 U.S. Department of State Report on International Religious Freedom regarding Syria notes that approximately 2.5% of the population remaining in the country are Christians. Ghazal said he anticipates a new wave of emigration. Signs of intolerance Despite calls for inclusion by HTS leadership, Ghazal said signs of intolerance are already evident, including a ban on alcohol, the separation of women from men in public transport, and the presence of the Islamic State flags near some Damascus suburbs. 'This is very alarming that we're seeing this in Christian neighborhoods,' he told VOA. 'Signs like this tell you that while violence has not been witnessed on a large scale just yet, I'm afraid it may be looming in the future.' Jouejati emphasized the importance of unity and a shared Syrian identity for the country's future. 'I believe that right now [the] minorities’ biggest problem is their own fears,' she told VOA. 'We have seen and heard and, we've seen examples of this complete willingness to accept that there are Christian and other minorities. We have seen them being very respectful of everybody, not just minorities.' Nadine Maenza, of the Washington-based International Religious Freedom Secretariat, recorded at least a dozen eyewitness accounts of attacks on religious and ethnic minorities in the Shehba region outside Aleppo in late December. 'Both HTS and the Turkish-backed militias have a history of severe religious violations against [minorities],' she told VOA. 'Atrocities are continuing against Kurds, Yazidis, Christians, and other religious minorities, but particularly we are seeing them from the Turkish-backed Islamist militias.' Ghazal said he anticipates an exodus of religious minorities from the country. 'The only reason the Christians who are currently in Syria have not migrated west to Europe, to the United States, Australia, it's not because they haven't wanted to,' he told VOA. 'It's simply because they haven't had the opportunity. And that's the tragic part.' Jouejati, however, described the reports of harassment as isolated cases rather than a consistent pattern of broader intolerance. 'I have seen some individual incidents where spoilers have instigated trouble, but I’ve also seen communities banding together,' she told VOA. 'Syrian Sunnis, who make up the majority, are reaching out to their Kurdish and Alawite and Christian and other counterparts to join hands. And I'm seeing an overwhelmingly positive response to being free of the Assad regime.' Asked to comment about Sharaa's direct engagement with Christian leaders, Italian Archbishop Mario Zenari, the pope’s envoy to Syria, said the fact of the meeting itself speaks volumes. 'This event would have been unimaginable only three weeks ago and the bishops and priests ... left with a sense of hope for Syria's future,' Zenari, who met with Syria's top diplomat last month, told Vatican News.

The next round of bitter cold and snow will hit the southern US	Annapolis, Maryland — The next round of bitter cold was set to envelop the southern U.S. on Tuesday, after the first significant winter storm of the year blasted a huge swath of the country with ice, snow and wind. The immense storm system brought disruption even to areas of the country that usually escape winter’s wrath, downing trees in some Southern states, threatening a freeze in Florida and causing people in Dallas to dip deep into their wardrobes for hats and gloves. By early Tuesday, wind chill temperatures could dip as low as minus 10.5 C from Texas across the Gulf Coast, according to the National Weather Service. A low-pressure system is then expected to form as soon as Wednesday near south Texas, bringing the potential of snow to parts of the state that include Dallas, as well as to Oklahoma, Arkansas and Louisiana. The polar vortex that dipped south over the weekend kept much of the country east of the Rockies in its frigid grip Monday, making many roads treacherous, forcing school closures, and causing widespread power outages and flight cancellations. Ice and snow blanketed major roads in Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the National Guard was activated to help stranded motorists. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings for Kansas and Missouri, where blizzard conditions brought wind gusts of up to 72 kph. The warnings extended to New Jersey into early Tuesday. A Kentucky truck stop was jammed with big rigs forced off an icy and snow-covered Interstate 75 on Monday just outside Cincinnati. A long-haul driver from Los Angeles carrying a load of rugs to Georgia, Michael Taylor said he saw numerous cars and trucks stuck in ditches and was dealing with icy windshield wipers before he pulled off the interstate. 'It was too dangerous. I didn’t want to kill myself or anyone else,' he said. The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole, but it sometimes plunges south into the U.S., Europe and Asia. Studies show that a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its grip. Temperatures plunge across the country The eastern two-thirds of the U.S. dealt with bone-chilling cold and wind chills Monday, with temperatures in some areas far below normal. A cold weather advisory will take effect early Tuesday across the Gulf Coast. In Texas’ capital of Austin and surrounding cities, wind chills could drop as low as minus 9.4 C. The Northeast was expected to get several cold days. Transportation has been tricky Hundreds of car accidents were reported in Virginia, Indiana, Kansas and Kentucky, where a state trooper was treated for non-life-threatening injuries after his patrol car was hit. Virginia State Police responded to at least 430 crashes Sunday and Monday, including one that was fatal. Police said other weather-related fatal accidents occurred Sunday near Charleston, West Virginia, and Monday in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. Kansas saw two deadly crashes over the weekend. More than 2,300 flights were canceled and at least 9,100 more were delayed nationwide as of Monday night, according to tracking platform FlightAware. Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport reported that about 58% of arrivals and 70% of departures had been canceled. A record of more than 20 centimeters of snow fell Sunday at the Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, leading to dozens of flight cancellations that lingered into Monday. About 10 centimeters fell Monday across the Cincinnati area, where car and truck crashes shut at least two major routes leading into downtown. More snow and ice are expected In Indiana, snow covered stretches of Interstate 64, Interstate 69 and U.S. Route 41, leading authorities to plead with people to stay home. 'It’s snowing so hard, the snow plows go through and then within a half hour the roadways are completely covered again,' State Police Sgt. Todd Ringle said. Tens of thousands are without power Many were in the dark as temperatures plunged. More than 218,000 customers were without power Monday night across Kentucky, Indiana, Virginia, West Virginia, Illinois, Missouri and North Carolina, according to electric utility tracking website PowerOutage.us. In Virginia’s capital city, a power outage caused a temporary malfunction in the water system, officials said Monday afternoon. Richmond officials asked those in the city of more than 200,000 people to refrain from drinking tap water or washing dishes without boiling the water first. The city also asked people to conserve their water, such as by taking shorter showers. City officials said they were working nonstop to bring the system back online.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-next-round-of-bitter-cold-and-snow-will-hit-the-southern-us-/7926920.html	2025-01-06T23:48:31-08:00	
Strong earthquake kills at least 53 people in western China	BEIJING — A strong earthquake killed at least 53 people in Tibet on Tuesday and left many others trapped as dozens of aftershocks shook the region of western China and across the border in Nepal. The official Xinhua News Agency said 62 other people were injured, citing the regional disaster relief headquarters. About 1,500 fire and rescue workers were deployed to search for people in the rubble, the Ministry of Emergency Management said. The U.S. Geological Survey said the earthquake measured magnitude 7.1 and was relatively shallow at a depth of about 10 kilometers (6 miles). China recorded the magnitude as 6.8. The epicenter was about 75 kilometers (50 miles) northeast of Mount Everest, which straddles the border. The area is seismically active and is where the India and Eurasia plates clash and cause uplifts in the Himalayan mountains strong enough to change the heights of some of the world's tallest peaks. The average altitude in the area around the epicenter is about 4,200 meters (13,800 feet), the China Earthquake Networks Center said in a social media post. State broadcaster CCTV said there are a handful of communities within 5 kilometers (3 miles) of the epicenter, which was 380 kilometers (240 miles) from Lhasa, the capital of Tibet, and about 23 kilometers (14 miles) from the region's second-largest city of Shigatse, known as Xigaze in Chinese. About 230 kilometers (140 miles) away in Nepal's capital, Kathmandu, the earthquake woke up residents and sent them running out of their homes into the streets. No information was immediately available from the remote, mountainous areas of Nepal closer to the epicenter. There have been 10 earthquakes of at least magnitude 6 in the area where Tuesday's quake hit over the past century, the USGS said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/strong-earthquake-kills-at-least-53-people-in-western-china/7926895.html	2025-01-06T22:28:20-08:00	
How Carter’s covert aid to Afghan rebels redefined his foreign policy record	President Ronald Reagan is often credited with defeating the Soviet Union, in part by helping Afghan rebels, but it was the administration of President Jimmy Carter that laid the groundwork. Considered a foreign policy novice by many when he entered the White House, Carter made the early decision to provide covert aid to Afghan insurgents months before the Soviet invasion. The move offers a window into one of the defining issues of his presidency, showing a president unafraid to confront the Soviets while pursuing a policy of détente. 'I think people’s image of Carter as a deeply religious man, a deeply moral man, is very much influenced by the activities he’s done after he left office. [But] he definitely had a ruthless side to him, and he had a side that was very willing to use force, including nuclear weapons,' said David Gibbs, a history professor at the University of Arizona. The covert aid program initiated under Carter became the backbone of the Afghan insurgency, setting the stage for the Soviet Union’s eventual withdrawal in 1989. In a bold move six months before the Soviets' December 1979 invasion, Carter signed a secret directive known as a 'presidential finding' that authorized the CIA to provide nonlethal aid to rebels fighting Afghanistan’s Soviet-backed communist government. That finding stayed under wraps for nearly two decades, coming to light only when several Carter administration officials, including former CIA Director Robert Gates and national security adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski, disclosed its existence in the 1990s, suggesting the Carter administration aimed to lure the Soviets into a Vietnam-style quagmire. ‘Afghan trap’ Brzezinski’s revelations were the most striking. In a 1998 interview with a French magazine, Carter’s Polish-born, ardently anti-communist adviser denied provoking the Soviets but claimed the administration had 'knowingly increased the probability' of a Soviet invasion. Calling the program 'an excellent idea,' he said it had the 'effect of drawing the Russians into the Afghan trap.' Although Brzezinski later disputed the accuracy of the interview and never repeated the claim, the so-called 'Afghan trap' thesis gained traction, with critics excoriating the Carter administration for instigating the Soviet invasion and causing decades of conflict in Afghanistan. Among scholars who see the aid program as a deliberate provocation, Gibbs said he was initially loath to read too much into the Brzezinski interview before becoming convinced of its veracity. As Gibbs described it to VOA, a military aide once told historian Jonathan Haslam that Brzezinski, upon learning of the Soviet invasion, 'pumped his first in the air in triumph and said, ‘They’ve taken the bait!’' 'The implication was that the decision to supply aid to the mujahideen was bait,' Gibbs said. 'That, to me, is a strong indication that what he said is true, because it was said twice over a period of time, and it’s from the horse’s mouth.' The Afghan trap thesis has permeated the works of other prominent experts, although most now dismiss it as baseless, according to historian Conor Tobin of the University College Dublin, who has researched it. The problem with the theory, Tobin argues, is that it views the Carter administration’s involvement in Afghanistan through a 21st century lens, 'working backwards from the events of 9/11.' 'They rely almost exclusively on Gates’ memoirs, the controversial French interview and other circumstantial and limited anecdotal evidence without exploring the subject in detail, and without using any other sources to corroborate the statements made,' Tobin told VOA via email. A close look at recently declassified Carter-era documents tells a different story, Tobin said. 'It reveals that there was no attempt to ensnare the Soviet Union in the Afghan trap, and U.S. policies were in fact marginal in leading to the Soviet military intervention,' he said. Nonlethal aid What is not up for debate, however, is that the aid program was launched in response to rising Soviet influence in Afghanistan. A communist coup in April 1978 toppled the government of President Mohammad Daoud. The new regime then initiated radical reforms, sparking public opposition and eventually a full-blown insurgency. According to Tobin, the Carter administration initially took a 'wait-and-see' approach. That policy ended with the kidnapping and murder of U.S. Ambassador Adolph Dubs the following February. Brzezinski then ordered a new plan for Afghanistan. 'Should we help any insurgents?' he asked an aide to investigate, according to Tobin. 'With whom would we have to work?' A popular revolt in the western Afghan city of Herat, however, 'led to a shift in attitude in Washington and the consensus began to slide towards a more active role,' Tobin wrote in his analysis, 'The Myth of the ‘Afghan Trap’.' CIA operatives sprang into action, developing a plan of action while reaching out to U.S. allies Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Several options were formulated, ranging from small-scale propaganda campaigns and nonlethal support to lethal arms supplies and military training via a third country. After determining that military assistance may 'provoke vigorous Soviet countermeasures,' the administration settled on nonlethal aid. 'The decision-making process demonstrated caution, rather than an effort to induce an invasion,' Tobin wrote. On July 3, 1979, Carter authorized the CIA to provide up to $695,000 in aid to the insurgents. By mid-August, $575,000 of the funds had been allocated for cash, medical equipment and radio transmitters to Pakistan’s Inter-Services Intelligence, who then delivered them to the mujahideen, according to Tobin’s account. The aid program, says Tobin, was modest but significant in two key respects. It helped establish links with the mujahideen through Pakistani intelligence that would prove invaluable after the Soviet invasion. It also underscored American resolve to allies Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, reassuring them at a time when concerns about diminishing U.S. influence in the region were mounting. The aid program came against a backdrop of escalating Cold War tensions. The Iranian Revolution of February 1979 had robbed the U.S. of a key strategic ally in the region. Rather than seeking to provoke the Soviets, Brzezinski worried about a 'creeping intervention' in Afghanistan, fearing ‘’Moscow would continue to expand its influence until a de factor invasion had taken place,’’ Tobin wrote. 'The objectives in mid-1979 were essentially to do something, anything, to counter the Soviet advance in Afghanistan,' Tobin said. Historian Scott Kaufman of Francis Marion University and author of a book on Carter’s foreign policy, said the late president also had to consider his bid for re-election the following year. 'He was already under attack for having ‘lost’ Nicaragua to communists and for being ‘soft’ on the Soviet Union,' Kaufman told VOA via email. 'How would it look to voters if Carter, who wanted to get SALT II [Strategic Arms Limitations Talks] approved, made moves that encouraged what would be seen by them as further Soviet aggression.' ‘Carter Doctrine’ Kaufman took issue with the popular perception of Carter as a foreign policy novice. Though he lacked the foreign policy experience of a Richard Nixon or even Gerald Ford, Carter sat on the Trilateral Commission and had traveled overseas as governor of Georgia, Kaufman noted. 'That said, his support for the mujahideen reflected a foreign policy that since at least 1978 reflected a hardening insofar as U.S. policy toward the Soviet Union,' he said. Carter’s tougher stance, Kaufman said, was driven by growing anti-Soviet sentiment in Congress, Brzezinski’s influence, and his personal disdain for Soviet repression and machinations. 'This does not mean that he had given up on seeking detente with the Soviets, as reflected by his desire to get SALT II ratified,' he said. 'But his foreign policy vis-a-vis the U.S.S.R. [Soviet Union] demonstrated a preparedness to take a harder line.' Nothing demonstrated Carter's resolve more forcefully than the 'Carter Doctrine,' his bold Persian Gulf policy adopted in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Unveiling the new policy during his 1980 State of the Union address, Carter warned that the U.S. was prepared to use 'any means necessary' to prevent a Soviet takeover of the Persian Gulf region. With the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Carter administration upped the ante. On December 28, 1979, the day after Soviet commandos assassinated Afghan President Hafizullah Amin in Kabul, Carter signed a new finding that authorized the supply of weapons and training for the mujahideen. The first batch of weapons arrived in Pakistan in less than two weeks. Carter went on to lose the 1980 election to Reagan, whose administration largely continued Carter’s Afghan policy for several years before dramatically building up the covert aid program to the tune of several hundred million dollars a year. Instead of merely harassing the Soviets, the Reagan administration sought its defeat, according to Tobin. 'The criticism of the Carter administration as weak on defense, therefore, is unjustified, with Carter largely laying the groundwork for the renewed global containment of the 1980s,' Tobin said. 'So, despite enduring orthodox assessments of Carter as a foreign policy failure, he departed office in January 1981 leaving a clear foreign policy direction for the incoming Reagan administration that arguably contributed to the end of the Cold War a decade later — an outcome that was almost incomprehensible as the Carter administration took office in January 1977.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-carter-s-covert-aid-to-afghan-rebels-redefined-his-foreign-policy-record/7926876.html	2025-01-06T21:28:12-08:00

Russia claims capture of town in Ukraine’s Donetsk region	Russia’s military said Monday its forces captured an important town in eastern Ukraine, while Ukrainian officials cited tens of thousands of Russian casualties in the fighting in Russia’s Kursk region. The Russian Defense Ministry said its control of the town of Kurakhove after several months of fighting for the logistics hub will allow the Russian military to more quickly advance elsewhere in the Donetsk region. Ukrainian officials did not confirm the loss of Kurakhove on Monday, with the military’s General Staff saying in a late Monday report that Russian forces had launched attacks on Ukrainian positions in the town. Russian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Monday that the Ukrainian offensive in Kursk, which began five months ago, had caused 38,000 Russian military casualties. 'The Russians have deployed their strongest units to Kursk, including soldiers from North Korea. Importantly, all this manpower cannot now be redirected to other fronts – neither to the Donetsk region, nor against Sumy, the Kharkiv region or Zaporizhzhia,' Zelenskyy said. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said earlier Monday that North Korea and China are the 'biggest ongoing drivers' allowing Russia to carry out its war in Ukraine, and that security assurances will need to be a part of potential future negotiations ending the conflict. Speaking during a visit to South Korea, Blinken said North Korean supplies of artillery, ammunition and troops, along with Chinese support for Russia’s military industrial base are giving the Russian military the backing it needs to continue carrying out the fight it started in February 2022. He said North Korea is already seeing a return on its involvement in the conflict in the form of Russian military equipment and training for North Korea troops. 'We believe it has the intent to share space and satellite technology with the DPRK,' Blinken said. With only two weeks left in the Biden administration, the United States has been rushing to send remaining authorized aid to Ukraine amid uncertainty about how President-elect Donald Trump may approach the war. Blinken said Monday the U.S. has been trying to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself, and to have the 'strongest possible hand' at a future negotiating table with Russia. 'If there is going to be, at some point, a ceasefire, it's not going to be, in Putin's mind, 'game over',' Blinken said. 'His imperial ambitions remain, and what he will seek to do is to rest, to refit, and eventually to re-attack.' Blinken said it is necessary to have an 'adequate deterrent in place so that he doesn't do that, so that he thinks twice – three times – before engaging in any re-aggression.' Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 79 of the 128 drones that Russian forces deployed overnight in attack targeting multiple Ukrainian regions. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Officials in Cherkasy reported damage to residential buildings and a grain warehouse from falling drone debris. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed 12 Ukrainian aerial drones, all in areas along the Russia-Ukraine border. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region, said the attacks injured three people and damaged several residential buildings. Some information for this report was provided by from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-claims-capture-of-town-in-ukraine-s-donetsk-region/7926860.html	2025-01-06T20:18:45-08:00

U.S. accuses Russia of funding both sides of Sudan's war	UNITED NATIONS — The United States accused Russia at the United Nations on Monday of funding the two warring parties in Sudan, an apparent step up from Washington's previous assertion that Moscow was playing both sides of the conflict to advance its political objectives. The war erupted in April 2023 amid a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) ahead of a planned transition to civilian rule, triggering the world's largest displacement and hunger crisis. In November Russia vetoed a U.N. Security Council draft resolution that called on the warring parties to immediately cease hostilities and ensure the delivery of humanitarian aid. The remaining 14 council members voted in favor of the text. 'Russia chose obstruction: standing alone as it voted to imperil civilians, while funding both sides of the conflict – yes, that's what I said: both sides,' the U.S. Ambassador to the U.N., Linda Thomas-Greenfield, told the council on Monday, without giving further details. When asked to elaborate, a spokesperson for the U.S. mission to the U.N. said Washington was aware of Russia's 'ongoing interest in Sudan's gold trade' and condemns any material support for the warring parties – 'whether it be through illicit gold trading or the provision of military equipment.' 'We believe Sudanese authorities' gold mining cooperation with sanctioned Russian entities and individuals could prove inimical to Sudan's long-term interests and the aspirations of the Sudanese people for an end to the war,' the U.S. mission to the U.N. spokesperson said. In response, Russia's deputy U.N. Ambassador Dmitry Polyanskiy said: 'We regret that the U.S. tries to judge other world powers by its own yardstick.' 'It's obvious that in the Pax Americana which our American colleagues try to preserve at any price, relations with other countries are built only on their exploitation and criminal schemes aimed at U.S. enrichment,' he said. Reuters was unable to immediately contact Sudan's warring parties for comment. In December, Russia's U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia rejected what he called 'fabrications spread by Western countries and their media' that Moscow was trying to play both sides to gain an advantage from the war. At what she said would likely be her last council meeting, Thomas-Greenfield became visibly emotional while addressing her counterparts on Sudan, a crisis that has been a focus for her during her four years at the world body. 'For all the disappointment that I couldn't do more, that we – all of us – didn't do more – I still remain hopeful,' she said. 'Hopeful that the representatives sitting around this table – the colleagues who have become friends – will continue this sacred mission, this ultimate responsibility.' Thomas-Greenfield was appointed by President Joe Biden. Donald Trump will succeed Biden on Jan. 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/u-s-accuses-russia-of-funding-both-sides-of-sudan-s-war/7926845.html	2025-01-06T19:34:02-08:00	
US adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military	WASHINGTON/NEW YORK — The U.S. Defense Department said on Monday it has added Chinese tech giants including gaming and social media leader Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL to a list of firms it says work with China's military. The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless and drone maker Autel Robotics, according to a document published on Monday. The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under U.S. law as the 'Section 1260H list,' designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register. U.S.-traded shares of Tencent, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell 8% in over-the-counter trading. Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was 'clearly a mistake.' It added: 'We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business.' CATL called the designation a mistake, saying it 'is not engaged in any military related activities.' A Quectel spokesperson said the company 'does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error.' The other companies and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to requests or did not immediately comment. Amid strained relations between the world's two biggest economies, the updated list is one of numerous actions taken by Washington in recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies it says pose security risks. Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the additions showed that it was 'reckless' for American firms to conduct business with a growing swath of Chinese corporations. 'The U.S. isn’t just safeguarding a handful of technologies anymore,' he said. 'The garden of sensitive technologies is growing, and the fence protecting them is being fortified. Today's list lays bare that these aren’t just commercial companies. They’re critical enablers of China’s military modernization, directly fueling Beijing’s strategic ambitions.' Other companies added include MGI Tech, which makes genomic sequencing instruments, and Origincell Technology, which lawmakers have alleged operates a cell bank network and bio-storage technologies. Neither firm immediately responded to requests for comments. U.S. lawmakers had pushed the Pentagon throughout 2024 to add some of the companies, including CATL, to the list. Ford Motor is building a battery plant in Michigan and plans to license CATL technology to produce low-cost lithium-iron batteries at the facility -- a move that has sparked concerns by some lawmakers. Ford did not immediately comment on Monday. While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to U.S. entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them. It could also add pressure on the Treasury Department to sanction the companies. Two previously listed companies, drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker Hesai Technologies, both sued the Pentagon last year over their previous designations but remain on the updated list. The Pentagon also removed six companies it said no longer met the requirements for the designation, including AI firm Beijing Megvii Technology, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, China State Construction Group Co. and China Telecommunications Corporation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-adds-tencent-catl-to-list-of-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijing-s-military/7926843.html	2025-01-06T19:23:10-08:00	
Powerful earthquake hits holy city in China's Tibet	BEIJING — A magnitude 6.8 earthquake struck near one of Tibet's holiest cities on Tuesday morning, the China Earthquake Networks Center said, damaging buildings around Shigatse and sending people running to the streets in neighboring Nepal and India. The trembler at 9:05 a.m. had an epicenter depth of 10 kilometers (6.2 miles), the report added, revising the magnitude from an earlier 6.9. Crumbled shop fronts could be seen in a video showing the aftermath from the nearby town of Lhatse, with debris spilling out onto the road. Reuters was able to confirm the location from nearby buildings, windows, road layout, and signage that match satellite and street view imagery. The date could not be verified independently. Tremors were felt in Nepal's capital Kathmandu some 400 kilometers (250 miles) away, where residents ran from their houses. Tremors were felt in the northern Indian state of Bihar which borders Nepal. As walls shook, people rushed out of their homes and apartments to open areas. So far, no reports of any damage or loss to property have been received, officials in India said. A magnitude 6.8 quake is considered strong and is capable of causing severe damage. Southwestern parts of China are frequently hit by earthquakes. A huge quake in Sichuan province in 2008 killed almost 70,000 people. According to China's state broadcaster CCTV, there have been 29 earthquakes with magnitudes of 3 or higher within 200 km of the Shigatse quake in the past five years, all of which were smaller than the one that struck on Tuesday morning. In 2015, a magnitude 7.8 tremor struck near Kathmandu in neighboring Nepal, killing about 9,000 people and injuring thousands in that country's worst earthquake.	https://www.voanews.com/a/powerful-earthquake-hits-holy-city-in-china-s-tibet/7926841.html	2025-01-06T19:20:57-08:00	
North Korea's Kim oversees successful test of new hypersonic missile	SEOUL, South Korea — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un oversaw a successful test of a new intermediate-range hypersonic ballistic missile (IRBM) on Monday, state media KCNA said on Tuesday, pledging to accelerate the country's nuclear and missile capabilities. It was North Korea's first missile launch since Nov. 5 and coincided with a visit by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken to South Korea, where he pledged bilateral and trilateral cooperation including Japan to respond to Pyongyang's growing military threats. The test occurred less than two weeks before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who held unprecedented summits with Kim during his first term and has touted their personal rapport, returns to office. The missile was fired on the outskirts of Pyongyang and flew some 1,500 kilometers (932 miles) at 12 times the speed of sound and reached the maximum altitude of nearly 100 km before accurately landing at a target off the east coast, KCNA said. New carbon fiber composite materials were used in the missile's engine, and it could 'effectively penetrate any dense defense barrier and inflict a serious military blow on the opponent,' it said. Kim hailed the missile as a powerful weapon to cope with security threats posed by hostile forces and the changing regional security environment. 'The development of new-type hypersonic missile is mainly aimed to steadily put the country's nuclear war deterrent on an advanced basis by making the means of changing the war situation, the weapon system to which no one can respond, the linchpin of strategic deterrence,' he said, according to KCNA. South Korea's military said on Monday a suspected IRBM traveled more than 1,100 kilometers (690 miles) eastwards before falling into the sea. Blinken condemned the latest launch together with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, and also warned of Pyongyang's deepening ties with Moscow, including illicit cooperation on space and satellite technology. North Korea has been developing a new solid-fuel hypersonic IRBM amid an intensifying race for the next generation of long-range rockets that are difficult to track and intercept. Last year's tests featured a new solid-fuel design and carried what Pyongyang said was a hypersonic glide vehicle, a warhead designed to be able to maneuver and evade missile defenses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-kim-oversees-successful-test-of-new-hypersonic-missile/7926830.html	2025-01-06T18:53:16-08:00	
Homes talk and tables walk at AI-dominated Consumer Electronics Show	LAS VEGAS — Home appliances that do chores, cars that know your favorite cafe, and robot pets aiming to please are among artificial intelligence-infused offerings at the Consumer Electronics Show opening Tuesday. All these will compete for attention at the annual CES extravaganza in Las Vegas, as vendors behind the scenes seek ways to deal with tariffs threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. AI is once again a major theme of the show, along with autonomous vehicles ranging from tractors and boats to lawn mowers and golf club trollies. South Korean consumer electronics giant LG kicked off a media day Monday by outlining a vision for 'Affectionate Intelligence' in which home appliances watch over people — from tracking how well they sleep to making sure they remember umbrellas when rain is in the forecast. 'At LG, we're seamlessly integrating AI into physical living spaces around us,' said CEO William Cho. 'We see space not merely as a physical location but as an environment where holistic experiences come to life — across the Home, Mobility, Commercial and even Virtual spaces.' Before the show floor even opened, vendors enticed visitors with electric roller skates, hologram booths for life-size remote collaboration, and even a robot that looked like a lamp affixed to the top of a walking table. Most offerings boasted being enhanced with AI. 'Everybody is going to be talking about AI ... whether it is there or not,' Creative Strategies analyst Carolina Milanesi told AFP. AI on the move CES will also be a gigantic auto show, with carmakers and those supplying software and parts showing off self-driving and automated safety capabilities. 'CES has been an auto show for a while now, and if anything, it is more so this year,' said Techsponential analyst Avi Greengart. Tesla CEO Elon Musk's close relationship with Trump is expected to reduce regulatory speed bumps regarding autonomous vehicles. And while still far from being a part of everyday life, flying cars will be part of the CES scene, according to independent tech analyst Rob Enderle. 'You should start seeing flying vehicles you can buy,' Enderle said. 'Getting approval to fly them is a whole other matter.' Robots designed to handle work tasks or be comforting companions — and even adorable pets — are among CES' exhibits. Gadgets for calming the mind, beautifying the body, or helping get a sound night's sleep are on display as tech continues to seep into every aspect of existence. 'Digital health is going to be huge,' said Greengart. 'We are seeing a lot more tech being worn or used to track your health markers.' AI-enhanced tech will also be infusing homes, from a spice dispenser that 'learns' a cook's taste and robot swimming pool cleaners. Tariff anxiety? Tariffs talked about by Trump would raise costs for imported items, and that will likely be on the minds of CES attendees targeting the U.S. market, according to analysts. A lot of the products at the show have imported components, and if Trump hits Canada, China and Mexico with tariffs, it will mean a spike in prices, analyst Enderle said. 'There will be a lot of concerned vendors at CES,' Enderle said of the tariff trepidation. Talk at CES will include how to navigate supply chain constraints that could be caused by tariffs, according to Greengart. 'But a lot of the talk will happen behind closed doors to not anger the coming administration,' he added. Chinese companies with significant U.S. presence, like smart television rivals TCL and Hisense, are at CES. But Greengart warns of a 'growing bifurcation of market between China and the rest of the world' as trade frictions play out.	https://www.voanews.com/a/homes-talk-and-tables-walk-at-ai-dominated-consumer-electronics-show-/7926828.html	2025-01-06T18:45:07-08:00

US dramatically shrinks Guantanamo prisoner population to 15 men	WASHINGTON — U.S. President Joe Biden's administration slashed the prisoner population at Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba by nearly half on Monday, sending 11 detainees to Oman. The U.S. military said only 15 detainees remained there after the transfer, following a major push toward closing the facility by Biden's administration in its final days in office. The detention center was first opened on Jan. 11, 2002, by President George W. Bush to hold terrorism suspects and 'illegal enemy combatants' during the U.S. 'War on Terror' following the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks on New York and Washington. Guantanamo Bay housed roughly 680 prisoners at the detention center's peak in 2003, according to Pentagon data. The latest transfer of the 11 men, all of whom are from Yemen, leaves the U.S. naval base in Cuba with fewer detainees than when it opened with the arrival of prisoners from Afghanistan. 'The United States appreciates the willingness of the government of Oman and other partners to support ongoing U.S. efforts focused on responsibly reducing the detainee population and ultimately closing the Guantanamo Bay facility,' the U.S. military said in a statement. The Pentagon named the 11 men transferred as: Uthman Abd al-Rahim Muhammad Uthman, Moath Hamza Ahmed al-Alwi, Khalid Ahmed Qassim, Suhayl Abdul Anam al Sharabi, Hani Saleh Rashid Abdullah, Tawfiq Nasir Awad Al-Bihani, Omar Mohammed Ali al-Rammah, Sanad Ali Yislam Al Kazimi, Hassan Muhammad Ali Bib Attash, Sharqawi Abdu Ali Al Hajj and Abd Al-Salam Al-Hilah. Of the remaining 15 detainees, the Pentagon said three are eligible for transfer and an equal number are eligible for a periodic review board to examine their cases. The remainder have been charged or convicted of war crimes. The facility has long been criticized by human rights groups and legal advocates over potential breaches of international human rights laws and conditions at the camp.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-dramatically-shrinks-guantanamo-prisoner-population-to-15-men/7926795.html	2025-01-06T17:01:30-08:00

Biden will honor tribal requests by designating 2 new national monuments in California	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden is signing a proclamation to establish two new national monuments in California, in part to honor two tribes, a person familiar with the decision said Monday. The proclamation will create the Chuckwalla National Monument in Southern California near Joshua Tree National Park and the Sattitla National Monument in Northern California, said the person, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity to discuss the plans that were to be announced Tuesday in California. The declaration bars drilling and mining and other development on the 600,000-acre (2,400-square-kilometer) area in Southern California and roughly 200,000 acres (800 square kilometers) in Northern California. The establishment of the new monuments was first reported in The Washington Post. Biden, who has two weeks left in office, is in New Orleans on Monday meeting with the families of the victims in the New Year's attack in the French Quarter and was heading to California later Monday. The flurry of activity has been in line with the Democratic president’s 'America the Beautiful' initiative launched in 2021, aimed at honoring tribal heritage, meeting federal goals to conserve 30% of public lands and waters by 2030, and addressing climate change. The Pit River Tribe has worked to get the federal government to designate the Sattitla National Monument. A number of Native American tribes and environmental groups began pushing Biden to designate the Chuckwalla National Monument, named after the large desert lizard, at the start of 2023. The area would protect public lands south of Joshua Tree National Park, spanning the Coachella Valley region in the west to near the Colorado River. Advocates say the monument will protect a tribal cultural landscape, ensure access to nature for local residents and preserve military history sites. The California Legislature passed a resolution in August 2024 to urge Biden to establish the Chuckwalla National Monument and another National Park Service-managed national monument adjacent to Joshua Tree National Park, as well as the Kw’tsan National Monument, which would border Mexico and Arizona. Tribal leaders have also called for the Chuckwalla monument to honor tribal sovereignty to include local tribes as co-stewards, following in the footsteps of a recent wave of monuments such as the Bears Ears National Monument in Utah, which is overseen in conjunction with five tribal nations. 'The protection of the Chuckwalla National Monument brings the Quechan people an overwhelming sense of peace and joy,' the Fort Yuma Quechan Tribe said in a statement. 'Tribes being reunited as stewards of this landscape is only the beginning of much-needed healing and restoration, and we are eager to fully rebuild our relationship to this place.' In May, the Biden administration expanded two national monuments in California — the San Gabriel Mountains in the south and Berryessa Snow Mountain in the north. In October, Biden designated the Chumash Heritage National Marine Sanctuary along the coast of central California, which will include input from the local Chumash tribes in how the area is preserved. Last year, the Yurok Tribe in Northern California also became the first Native people to receive tribal land back from the National Park Service under a historic memorandum of understanding signed by the tribe, Redwood National and State Parks and the nonprofit Save the Redwoods League.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-will-honor-tribal-requests-by-designating-2-new-national-monuments-in-california-/7926771.html	2025-01-06T16:44:33-08:00

Minneapolis to revamp police training, force policies after George Floyd's murder	MINNEAPOLIS — The Minneapolis City Council on Monday approved an agreement with the federal government to overhaul the city's police training and use-of-force policies in the wake of the murder of George Floyd. The deal incorporates and builds on changes the Minneapolis Police Department has made since Floyd, a Black man, was killed by a white officer in 2020, prompting a national reckoning with police brutality and racism. The 171-page agreement, filed in federal court shortly after the council's 12-0 vote, says the department will require its officers to 'promote the sanctity of human life as the highest priority in their activities.' It says officers must 'carry out their law enforcement duties with professionalism and respect for the dignity of every person.' And it says they must not allow race, gender or ethnicity 'to influence any decision to use force, including the amount or type of force used.' The agreement, known as a consent decree, means the department will be under long-term court supervision. It had been under negotiation since the Department of Justice issued a scathing critique of the city’s police in June 2023. The report alleged that police systematically discriminated against racial minorities, violated constitutional rights and disregarded the safety of people in custody for years before Floyd’s killing. The Justice Department report was the result of a sweeping two-year investigation that confirmed many citizen complaints about police conduct. The investigation found that Minneapolis officers used excessive force, including 'unjustified deadly force,' and violated the rights of people engaged in constitutionally protected speech. An independent monitor will oversee the changes, and a judge must approve them. During his first administration, President-elect Donald Trump was critical of consent decrees as anti-police. Finalizing the Minneapolis agreement before he returns to office Jan. 20 would make it harder for him to undercut the deal, because changes would require court approval. The council approved the deal 12-0 Monday during a brief public vote that followed an hours-long, closed-door discussion. 'I’d like to thank our community for standing together, united in this, and for having patience with us as we have traveled a very, very long and challenging journey,' Council President Elliott Payne said after the vote. 'We’re just beginning, and we know we have a long way to go. Our success will only be realized when we all work together on what is arguably one of the most important issues in the life of our city.' Council Member Robin Wonsley said in a statement before the vote that she has 'no faith that the Trump administration will be a serious partner' in implementing the agreement. 'Having a federal consent decree signed and in place is valuable to police reform efforts, but we need to be sober about the fact that it will take local political will to hold the city and the (Mayor Jacob) Frey administration accountable to implementing and enforcing the terms of the consent decree,' she said. A state court judge in 2023 approved a similar agreement between Minneapolis and the Minnesota Department of Human Rights after the state agency issued its own blistering report in 2022. The state investigation found that the city's police had engaged in a pattern of race discrimination for at least a decade. The Justice Department has opened 12 similar investigations of state and local law enforcement agencies since April 2021, many in response to high-profile deaths at the hands of police. It has reached agreements with Seattle, New Orleans, Baltimore, Chicago and Ferguson, Missouri. A consent decree with Louisville, Kentucky, after an investigation prompted by the fatal police shooting of Breonna Taylor is awaiting court approval. In Memphis, Tennessee, the mayor last month pushed back against pressure for a consent decree there, saying his city has made hundreds of positive changes since the beating death of Tyre Nichols. Consent decrees require law enforcement to meet specific goals before federal oversight is removed, a process that often takes years and millions of dollars. A major reason Minneapolis hired Brian O’Hara as police chief in 2022 was his experience implementing a consent decree in Newark, New Jersey. If the Minneapolis federal agreement gets court approval, the city would be in the unusual position of operating under both federal and state consent decrees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/minneapolis-to-revamp-police-training-force-policies-after-george-floyd-s-murder/7926520.html	2025-01-06T15:38:38-08:00	
Two Indian companies indicted in US for importing ingredients used in opioid fentanyl	NEW YORK — Two Indian chemical companies have been indicted for allegedly importing ingredients for the highly addictive opioid fentanyl into the United States and Mexico, the U.S. Department of Justice said Monday. Athos Chemicals and Raxuter Chemicals, both based in Gujarat, were each charged in Brooklyn with distributing the ingredients and conspiring to distribute them. Raxuter and senior executive Bhavesh Lathiya, 36, were also charged with smuggling, and introducing misbranded drugs into interstate commerce. Lathiya was arrested on Saturday in New York and ordered detained pending trial, after prosecutors called him a flight risk and a substantial danger to the community. 'The Justice Department is targeting every link in fentanyl trafficking supply chains that span countries and continents and too often end in tragedy in the United States,' U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. A federal public defender representing Lathiya declined to comment. Athos and Raxuter did not immediately respond to similar requests outside business hours. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid about 50 times more powerful than heroin and 100 times more powerful than morphine. Opioids accounted for about 82,000 U.S. deaths in 2022, 10 times the number in 1999, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Prosecutors said that since February 2024, the defendants supplied 'precursor' chemicals they knew would be used to make fentanyl, and hid their efforts by mislabeling packages, falsifying customs forms, and making false declarations at border crossings. One indictment said that in October 2024 video calls with an undercover agent posing as a fentanyl manufacturer, Lathiya agreed to sell 20 kilograms of the precursor chemical 1-boc-4-piperidone, and suggested mislabeling them as an antacid. Lathiya did this after the agent told him his Mexico clients were 'very happy with the quality of what you sent me,' and with the 'yield' from the resulting fentanyl, the indictment said. The other indictment said Athos agreed last February to sell 100 kilograms of the same chemical to a known drug trafficker in Mexico who was making fentanyl in connection with a drug trafficking organization. Lathiya faces up to 53 years in prison if convicted, the Justice Department said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/two-indian-companies-indicted-in-us-for-importing-ingredients-used-in-opioid-fentanyl-/7926509.html	2025-01-06T15:10:55-08:00	
Former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani found in contempt of court in defamation case	NEW YORK — A judge on Monday found Rudy Giuliani to be in civil contempt of court in a case brought by two Georgia election workers that the former New York City mayor falsely accused of trying to help steal the 2020 U.S. presidential election for Democrat Joe Biden. U.S. District Judge Lewis Liman in Manhattan said Giuliani had not complied with requests from the election workers, Ruby Freeman and her daughter Wandrea Moss, for information that could help them determine which of his assets may be turned over to pay off the defamation judgment. 'The fact that he is a busy person who in the past relied on others is not an excuse for noncompliance,' Liman said. The contempt citation in the district where Giuliani had been the top federal prosecutor marks a further fall from grace for Giuliani, once known as 'America's Mayor' for his response to the September 11, 2001, attacks. The ruling stems from a lawsuit Freeman and Moss brought against Giuliani in 2021. They accused the former personal lawyer to Republican President-elect Donald Trump of destroying their reputations by lying that they tried to help steal the 2020 election. Giuliani made repeated false claims that a surveillance video showed the pair concealing and counting suitcases filled with illegal ballots at a basketball arena in Atlanta that was used to process votes. Giuliani has been disbarred for making false claims about the 2020 election, and pleaded not guilty to criminal charges in Georgia and Arizona that he aided Trump's failed attempt to overturn his loss. In July 2023, Giuliani conceded he made defamatory statements about Freeman and Moss, and a judge that August ruled he was liable for defamation as a sanction against him for failing to turn over electronic records to the two election workers. A Washington, D.C., jury later ordered he pay Freeman and Moss roughly $73 million in compensation and $75 million as punishment. Liman said on Monday he had not yet determined the punishment Giuliani would face for contempt. But the judge also ruled that Giuliani had not responded to questions from Moss and Freeman about a Palm Beach, Florida, condominium he owns. Liman said he would presume Giuliani's lack of response suggested the answers would be unfavorable to him at an upcoming Jan. 16 trial over whether he treated the condominium as his permanent residence. Freeman and Moss contend Giuliani did not live there full time, meaning it could be turned over. Lawyers for Freeman and Moss have also urged Liman to hold Giuliani in contempt for ignoring his orders to give up his Manhattan apartment, the title to a 1980 Mercedes and sports memorabilia. That request is still pending. Giuliani, 80, has claimed that his day-to-day life has been upended by the two election workers, making it difficult to obtain necessary paperwork, and that he has not 'willfully disobeyed' any court orders. Giuliani's lawyer, Joseph Cammarata, said on Monday that the time frame for Giuliani to respond to the election workers' demands was tight but that he sought to comply. 'There's been substantial compliance,' Cammarata said. 'There is no defiance to the court.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-new-york-city-mayor-rudy-giuliani-found-in-contempt-of-court-in-defamation-case-/7926497.html	2025-01-06T14:56:10-08:00	
Louisiana reports 1st bird flu-related death in US, state agency says	WASHINGTON — The Louisiana Department of Health said Monday that a U.S. patient hospitalized with H5N1 bird flu had died, the country's first death from an outbreak of the virus that has sickened dozens of people and millions of poultry and cattle. Nearly 70 people in the U.S. have contracted bird flu since April, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most of them livestock workers exposed to sick chickens or dairy cattle. The patient in Louisiana, the first person in the country to be hospitalized with the virus, contracted bird flu after exposure to a combination of backyard chickens and wild birds, said Louisiana health officials. The patient was hospitalized on Dec. 18, state health officials said. The patient was over 65 and had underlying medical conditions, the officials said. 'While the current public health risk for the general public remains low, people who work with birds, poultry or cows, or have recreational exposure to them, are at higher risk,' the department said in a statement. The CDC did not immediately respond to a request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/louisiana-reports-1st-bird-flu-related-death-in-us-state-agency-says-/7926498.html	2025-01-06T14:54:39-08:00	
Post-Assad Syria faces challenges in building unified military	WASHINGTON — The newly appointed defense minister in Syria’s caretaker government, Murhaf Abu Qasra, has been holding meetings with various rebel factions in the country, aiming to bring them under the command of Syria’s defense ministry. Abu Qasra said in a statement Monday that such meetings 'aim to develop a roadmap for stabilizing the military’s organizational structure.' Syria’s new authorities announced shortly after the ouster of former President Bashar al-Assad last month that unifying all rebel groups and other armed forces under a national military would be a top priority in the post-Assad era. Dozens of rebel factions and armed forces emerged over the course of Syria’s conflict, which began in 2011, with the aim of either fighting the Assad regime or protecting local communities. Before taking up his current role as defense minister, Abu Qasra served as a key commander in Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the main rebel group that spearheaded the 11-day offensive culminating in Assad’s ouster on Dec. 8, 2024. HTS, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization with former ties to al-Qaida, has emerged as the dominant force within Syria’s new leadership. Its leader Ahmad al-Sharaa, formerly known as Abu Mohammed al-Jolani, recently called on all armed groups in the country to join a unified military, pledging to dissolve the HTS as part of the process. Nicholas Heras, a Middle East expert at the Washington-based New Lines Institute, said the HTS-led caretaker government is facing the reality that there are heavily armed, well-organized actors within Syria who mistrust its intentions and do not see it as the permanent successor to the Assad regime. 'The consequence of Syria’s multi-factional civil war is that despite the relative strength of HTS compared to other armed groups in western Syria, the HTS-led caretaker government is still limited in its resources and operating under the shadow of distrust and terrorist designation from powerful foreign actors,' he told VOA. One of the major groups that the interim government seeks to integrate into the Defense Ministry is the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). The SDF, a Kurdish-led military alliance, has been a key U.S. partner in the fight against the Islamic State terror group. It controls a vast territory in northeast Syria, but Turkey considers it a terrorist organization and has vowed to eliminate it unless its fighters disarm. Since Assad’s fall, Turkish-backed Syrian proxies have intensified their clashes with the SDF in parts of northern Syria, dislodging them from several towns in Aleppo province. The SDF has stated it will not lay down its arms without a genuine political process in Syria, one in which it can play a key role in shaping the country’s future military. Last week, a meeting took place between Syria’s de facto leader al-Sharaa and SDF officials in Damascus, but details of the discussion haven’t been disclosed. 'While I'm sure the group wants to do the right thing by the Syrian people and for the country of Syria, when locked in an existential fight against a powerful military like Turkey, not to mention threats from a resurgent Islamic State and other non-state armed groups, it would be crazy for the SDF to unilaterally disarm,' said Colin Clarke, director of research at The Soufan Group. 'The SDF's number one priority is survival, and Syria is not the kind of country where any minority group can afford to readily give up its arms, even if a government promises security and safety,' he told VOA. Analyst Heras believes there are limitations in the power of HTS to impose its order on Syria at this point, 'because the Druze community in Sweida [in the south] doubts that HTS can restrain the more extremist elements in its coalition, the SDF will not surrender the autonomy of its region of control, and other actors such as the Southern Operations Room, the Turkish-backed Turkmen majority groups in northern Syria, the Christian militias in Homs, and the slowly gathering Alawite clans in the mountains by the coast are all demanding a stake in the future of Syria.' He said militias in Syria, even many within the Sunni Arab community, 'want HTS to bask in the glory of dealing the death blow to the Assad regime, and then exit left to allow a future Syrian state to take center stage. At this time, however, many of the Syrian militias believe that HTS is looking to replace the Baath [the former ruling party] with its own form of authoritarianism.' Myles Caggins, a former spokesperson for the global coalition against IS, said the new government in Syria should take inclusive steps to secure international support. 'Syria must form a government that respects human rights, protects the rights of minorities and is inclusive, including within the security forces,' he told VOA. 'Only then Syria will rise quickly to a place of international relevance.'

Venezuela’s opposition leader Gonzalez meets with Biden	Venezuelan opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez who claims he won last year’s presidential election against incumbent President Nicolas Maduro met with U.S. President Joe Biden on Monday. After the White House meeting, Gonzalez said he had 'a long, fruitful and cordial conversation' with Biden. 'We, of course, thanked the United States government for the support it has given us in this fight for democratic recovery in Venezuela.' Gonzalez also said he expects a close relationship with the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The meeting between Gonzalez and Biden happened just days before Maduro is set to be sworn into office Friday for a third term. Maduro has continued to claim that he was the victor in Venezuela’s July election, despite the fact that electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts following the election. The opposition maintains its collection of tally sheets from more than 80% of Venezuela’s electronic voting machines prove that Gonzalez was the clear winner of the July election. The U.S., most European countries and several Latin American countries have rejected Maduro’s claims to victory, which have been recognized by Venezuela’s top court and electoral authority. The controversial election sparked mass protests which left nearly 30 people dead and over 2,400 arrested. Gonzalez, a 75-year-old former diplomat, has been living in exile in Spain since the election, but has promised to return to Venezuela to be sworn into office Friday. Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello said Monday Gonzalez would be 'arrested and tried if he sets foot in Venezuela.' Venezuela is offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to Gonzalez’s capture.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuela-s-opposition-leader-gonzalez-meets-with-biden/7926464.html	2025-01-06T14:09:13-08:00

US eases restrictions on Syria while keeping sanctions in place	WASHINGTON — The U.S. on Monday eased some restrictions on Syria's transitional government to allow the entry of humanitarian aid after Islamist insurgents ousted Syrian leader Bashar al-Assad last month. The U.S. Treasury Department issued a general license lasting six months that authorizes certain transactions with the Syrian government, including some energy sales and incidental transactions. The move does not lift sanctions on the nation that has been battered by more than a decade of war but indicates a limited show of U.S. support for the new transitional government. The general license underscores America's commitment to ensuring its sanctions 'do not impede activities to meet basic human needs, including the provision of public services or humanitarian assistance,' a Treasury Department statement said. Treasury Deputy Secretary Wally Adeyemo said his agency 'will continue to support humanitarian assistance and responsible governance in Syria.' Since Assad's ouster, representatives from the nation's new de facto authorities have said the new Syria will be inclusive and open to the world. The U.S. has gradually lifted some penalties since Assad departed Syria for protection in Russia. The Biden administration in December decided to drop a $10 million bounty it had offered for the capture of a Syrian rebel leader whose forces led the ouster of Assad last month. The announcement followed a meeting in Damascus between the leader of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS; Ahmad al-Sharaa, who was once aligned with al-Qaida; and the top U.S. diplomat for the Middle East, Barbara Leaf, who led the first U.S. diplomatic delegation into Syria since Assad's ouster. The U.S. and U.N. have long designated HTS as a terrorist organization. HTS led a lightning insurgency that ousted Assad on Dec. 8 and ended his family's decades-long rule. From 2011 until Assad's downfall, Syria's uprising and civil war killed an estimated 500,000 people. Much of the world ended diplomatic relations with Assad because of his crackdown on protesters and sanctioned him and his Russian and Iranian associates. Most of the Western-led sanctions targeted Assad and his associates for the brutal crackdown on protesters and their manufacturing of the amphetamine-like stimulant Captagon, which reportedly generated billions of dollars as packages of the little white pills were smuggled across Syria's porous borders. With Assad out of the picture, Syria's new authorities hope the international community will pour money into the country to rebuild its battered infrastructure and make its economy viable again. Syria's infrastructure has been battered, with power cuts rampant in the country and some 90% of its population living in poverty. About half the population won't know where its next meal will come from as inflation surges. The pressure to lift sanctions has mounted in recent years as aid agencies continue to cut programs due to donor fatigue and a massive 2023 earthquake that rocked Syria and Turkey. The tremor killed over 59,000 people and destroyed critical infrastructure that couldn't be fixed due to sanctions and overcompliance, despite the U.S. announcing some humanitarian exemptions. Qutaiba Idlbi, a research fellow at the Atlantic Council who leads work on Syria, said ahead of the general license issuance: 'There is a general agreement,' among regional and international governments, 'that we need to avoid driving Syria back into chaos.' 'The only path forward is to engage positively,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-eases-restrictions-on-syria-while-keeping-sanctions-in-place-/7926421.html	2025-01-06T13:23:55-08:00	
US cyber watchdog: No signs Treasury breach hit other federal agencies	WASHINGTON — The U.S. cyber watchdog agency CISA said Monday there was 'no indication' the recently reported breach at the U.S. Treasury Department had affected any other federal agency. Late last month the U.S. Treasury reported that an unspecified number of computers had been compromised by Chinese hackers following a breach at contractor BeyondTrust, which provides cybersecurity services. BeyondTrust said last month that a limited number of clients were affected but has not elaborated. 'As the forensic investigation is ongoing, BeyondTrust is unable to confirm the other customers who may or may not have been impacted,' the company said Monday in an email. The Washington Post has reported that the hackers breached the U.S. Treasury office that administers economic sanctions, aiming to steal information about Chinese entities that the U.S. government might be considering designating for financial sanctions. Republican lawmakers have demanded a briefing about the breach, which is the latest in a series of intrusions blamed on Beijing. Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, has previously described the Treasury hack reports as 'irrational' and represented 'smear attacks' against China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-cyber-watchdog-no-signs-treasury-breach-hit-other-federal-agencies/7926415.html	2025-01-06T13:12:18-08:00	
VOA Turkish: Tensions rise in Syria’s Christian town of Malula after Assad’s fall	Following the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham's (HTS) takeover of the government in Syria, everyday life has become tense in Malula, an ancient Christian town in the Damascus countryside, for over a week. The tensions have escalated but stopped short of turning into a clash between Muslims and the majority Christians in the town. Some residents claim that the tensions derive from sectarian differences within the community while others say that the tensions arose from a feud between a Muslim family and a Christian family. Some residents also say that there are concerns over the HTS, which has no clear policy toward groups of different religions and sects, including Christians.

VOA Russian: Collapse of Kremlin's strategy of gas blackmail against Europe	A major natural gas pipeline supplying Russian energy to Europe ran dry Wednesday after Ukraine stopped Moscow’s six-decade supply in the hopes of hurting Russia financially. The planned move marks the end of an era in which many European countries kept warm using gas pumped by Russia. Ukraine is losing up to $1 billion a year in transit fees it charged Russia to use its pipeline. That’s less than the $5 billion Gazprom, Russia’s state-owned energy giant, is set to lose annually in gas sales. VOA correspondent Victor Vasilyev talked to regional experts about these topics.

US adds Tencent, CATL to list of Chinese firms allegedly aiding Beijing's military	Washington/New York — The U.S. Defense Department said on Monday it has added Chinese tech giants including gaming and social media leader Tencent Holdings and battery maker CATL to a list of firms it says work with China's military. The list also included chip maker Changxin Memory Technologies, Quectel Wireless and drone maker Autel Robotics, according to a document published on Monday. The annually updated list of Chinese military companies, formally mandated under U.S. law as the 'Section 1260H list,' designated 134 companies, according to a notice posted to the Federal Register. U.S.-traded shares of Tencent, which is also the parent of Chinese instant messaging app WeChat, fell 8% in over-the-counter trading. Tencent said in a statement that its inclusion on the list was 'clearly a mistake.' It added: 'We are not a military company or supplier. Unlike sanctions or export controls, this listing has no impact on our business.' CATL called the designation a mistake, saying it 'is not engaged in any military related activities.' A Quectel spokesperson said the company 'does not work with the military in any country and will ask the Pentagon to reconsider its designation, which clearly has been made in error.' The other companies and the Chinese embassy in Washington did not respond to requests or did not immediately comment. Amid strained relations between the world's two biggest economies, the updated list is one of numerous actions taken by Washington in recent years to highlight and restrict Chinese companies it says pose security risks. Craig Singleton, a China expert at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the additions showed that it was 'reckless' for American firms to conduct business with a growing swath of Chinese corporations. 'The U.S. isn’t just safeguarding a handful of technologies anymore,' he said. 'The garden of sensitive technologies is growing, and the fence protecting them is being fortified. Today's list lays bare that these aren’t just commercial companies. They’re critical enablers of China’s military modernization, directly fueling Beijing’s strategic ambitions.' Other companies added include MGI Tech, which makes genomic sequencing instruments, and Origincell Technology, which lawmakers have alleged operates a cell bank network and bio-storage technologies. Neither firm immediately responded to requests for comments. U.S. lawmakers had pushed the Pentagon throughout 2024 to add some of the companies, including CATL, to the list. Ford Motor is building a battery plant in Michigan and plans to license CATL technology to produce low-cost lithium-iron batteries at the facility - a move that has sparked concerns by some lawmakers. Ford did not immediately comment on Monday. While the designation does not involve immediate bans, it can be a blow to the reputations of affected companies and represents a stark warning to U.S. entities and firms about the risks of conducting business with them. It could also add pressure on the Treasury Department to sanction the companies. Two previously listed companies, drone maker DJI and Lidar-maker Hesai Technologies, both sued the Pentagon last year over their previous designations, but remain on the updated list. The Pentagon also removed six companies it said no longer met the requirements for the designation, including AI firm Beijing Megvii Technology, China Railway Construction Corporation Limited, China State Construction Group Co and China Telecommunications Corporation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-adds-tencent-catl-to-list-of-chinese-firms-allegedly-aiding-beijing-s-military/7926307.html	2025-01-06T11:56:46-08:00	
UK’s Starmer slams 'lies and misinformation' after attacks from Elon Musk	LONDON — British Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Monday condemned 'lies and misinformation' that he said are undermining U.K. democracy, in response to a barrage of attacks on his government from Elon Musk. The billionaire Tesla CEO has taken an intense and erratic interest in British politics since the center-left Labour Party was elected in July. Musk has used his social network, X, to call for a new election and demand Starmer be imprisoned. On Monday he posted an online poll for his 210 million followers on the proposition: 'America should liberate the people of Britain from their tyrannical government.' Asked about Musk’s comments during a question session at a hospital near London, Starmer criticized 'those that are spreading lies and misinformation as far and as wide as possible,' particularly opposition Conservative politicians in Britain who have echoed some of Musk’s claims. Musk often posts on X about the U.K., retweeting criticism of Starmer and the hashtag TwoTierKeir — shorthand for an unsubstantiated claim that Britain has 'two-tier policing' with far-right protesters treated more harshly than pro-Palestinian or Black Lives Matter demonstrators. Recently Musk has focused on child sexual abuse, particularly a series of cases that rocked northern England towns in which groups of men, largely from Pakistani backgrounds, were tried for grooming and abusing dozens of girls. The cases have been used by far-right activists to link child abuse to immigration, and to accuse politicians of covering up the 'grooming gangs' out of a fear of appearing racist. Musk has posted a demand for a public inquiry into the cases. An inquiry was held under the previous Conservative government, though many of the recommendations it made in 2022 have yet to be implemented. Musk also has accused Starmer of failing to bring perpetrators to justice when he was England's director of public prosecutions between 2008 and 2013. Answering questions after a speech near London, Starmer defended his record as chief prosecutor, saying he had reopened closed cases and 'changed the whole prosecution approach' to child sexual exploitation. He also condemned language used by Musk about Jess Phillips, a government minister responsible for combating violence against women and girls. Musk called Phillips a 'rape genocide apologist' and said she deserved to be in prison. 'When the poison of the far-right leads to serious threats to Jess Phillips and others, then in my book, a line has been crossed,' Starmer said. 'I enjoy the cut and thrust of politics, the robust debate that we must have, but that’s got to be based on facts and truth, not on lies.' Musk has also called for the release of Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, a far-right activist who goes by the name Tommy Robinson and is serving a prison sentence for contempt of court. Starmer said people 'cheerleading Tommy Robinson … are trying to get some vicarious thrill from street violence that people like Tommy Robinson promote.' Starmer largely avoided mentioning Musk by name in his responses, likely wary of giving him more of a spotlight — or of angering Musk ally Donald Trump, who is due to be inaugurated as U.S. president on Jan. 20. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, another target of the X owner's ire, has taken a similar approach. Scholz said he is staying 'cool' over critical personal comments made by Musk, but finds it worrying that the U.S. billionaire makes the effort to get involved in a general election by endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party. Starmer said the main issue was not Musk's posts on X, but 'what are politicians here doing to stand up for our democracy?' He said he was concerned about Conservative politicians in Britain 'so desperate for attention they are amplifying what the far right are saying.' 'Once we lose the anchor that truth matters … then we are on a very slippery slope,' he said. While some Conservatives, including party leader Kemi Badenoch, have echoed Musk’s points, the main U.K. beneficiary of his interest has been Reform U.K., the hard-right party led by Nigel Farage that has just five seats in the 650-seat House of Commons but big expansion plans. Farage said last month that Musk was considering making a multimillion-dollar donation to the party. But Farage is critical of Tommy Robinson, refusing to let him join Reform, and on Sunday Musk posted: 'The Reform Party needs a new leader. Farage doesn’t have what it takes.' Farage tweeted in response: 'Well, this is a surprise! Elon is a remarkable individual but on this I am afraid I disagree.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-s-starmer-slams-lies-and-misinformation-after-attacks-from-elon-musk/7926187.html	2025-01-06T10:46:54-08:00	
Grievously wounded Ukrainian soldier gets second chance in US	Just before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, nearly three years ago, 23-year-old Ukrainian army Lieutenant Myroslav Pylypchuk was preparing to become a father. Instead, he found himself confronting the invaders on the frontlines, where he repeatedly faced death, including a face-off with a Russian tank in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region. During subsequent fighting in the Kharkiv region, he stepped on a Russian landmine. The explosion cost him his left leg. Just four months later, he was conquering a mountain peak on crutches. Today, he's a father of two young children, living in the U.S. state of Ohio, where he was given a new limb and a new lease on life. In an interview with VOA’s Ukrainian Service, Pylypchuk shared the story of his close encounter with a tank, how a tourniquet from an American benefactor saved his life, and his journey to recovery. ‘This tank is already coming straight at me’ In the spring of 2022, Myroslav Pylypchuk found himself face-to-face with a Russian tank. The duel between the 23-year-old man from the western Ukrainian city of Khmelnytskyi and the enemy tank was captured on video by a Ukrainian drone operator. 'This tank is already coming straight at me, its gun is rising and aiming at me,' he told VOA. 'I think to myself: either I shoot now, or it shoots first. I take the first shot, the grenade from the grenade launcher ricochets off the ground, flies up over the turret, and explodes. The tank stopped and fired exactly at the spot where I was. But all I got were shrapnel pieces that flew through these bushes and hit me. 'The tank drives into the ditch, turns its turret, and once again targets the spot where I was standing, as if I had really annoyed it, as if I had ruined its day. Then it turns the turret and fires again at the place where I had been. The shell landed where I was, but thank God I had already managed to run about 20 meters away, and the shrapnel from that shell just flew past me.' Just two weeks before Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, Pylypchuk found out he was going to be a father. On Feb. 24, he packed his things and joined his military unit in Kyiv, where he was then living and stationed. A graduate of the Lviv Academy of Ground Forces, Pylypchuk served in the Ukrainian army in the Donetsk region, and ended up commanding a company of 80 soldiers. By May 2022, his unit had taken the village of Tsyrkuny in Kharkiv region back from Russian forces. During just a few months on the front lines, he nearly lost his life three times. 'Shrapnel in one case, a rocket in another, then the tank missed,' he recalled. A gift from an American that saved his life However, Lieutenant Pylypchuk’s luck ran out during the Kharkiv fighting, when he stepped on a landmine. 'I’m walking at one point, I hear an explosion and fall. I try to take a step with my left leg and fall again,' he told VOA. 'I look at my leg — I was wearing new gear, light-colored — and I look at my leg, and it's already completely red.' The blast from the landmine also destroyed two of Pylypchuk’s first aid kits and all his medical supplies. He said it was like he’d been turned into a human sieve — even the scissors for cutting clothing were twisted and scattered in all directions. However, he still had another tourniquet on him — a gift that Ron Jackson, an American volunteer who had been traveling to Ukraine for years to help its military, had given him just before the war started. Jackson’s tourniquet was applied around his chest, saving his life. But the landmine explosion had completely shattered the bone in Pylypchuk’s upper left leg. The medics who treated Pylypchuk at the scene loaded him into the trunk of a Soviet-made Niva SUV for transport to a hospital in Kharkiv. 'The Niva pulls up, and I’m thinking, ‘Where am I supposed to sit?’, because there were two in the car already: one was driving, and the other was covering the window, just in case, God forbid, any sabotage groups showed up. And then they just threw me into the trunk like a sack of potatoes,' he recalled with a smile. With every bump in the road, the adrenaline wore off, and the pain got worse: 'I felt like the donkey from Shrek, asking, ‘How much longer? When is it going to get better?’ They drove me around Kharkiv for about half an hour to forty minutes. I was holding on with every last bit of strength just to stay conscious. As soon as I saw the hospital doors open and that bright light, I closed my eyes. The doctors were shocked that I’d stayed conscious until the very last moment.' Doctors fought for over six hours to save Pylypchuk’s life, and he was unconscious for three days. However, the shrapnel that entered his body had passed through the ground and trees, causing a blood infection — one so serious that his left leg had to be amputated. Recovery in the US Pylypchuk needed a prosthetic for his leg, but the waiting list in Ukraine was long, so he looked for other options. He called Jackson, the American whose tourniquet had saved his life, who introduced Pylypchuk to Ihor, a Ukrainian immigrant who knew a prosthetist in Ohio. Thanks to Ihor, who became Pylypchuk’s sponsor during his move to Ohio, the prosthetic was fitted in the U.S. in October 2022. Pylypchuk also received help through individual donations and free consultations from the prosthetist. In just two weeks — an incredibly fast recovery — he was walking on his own. 'What motivated me was the desire to live, because, well, God didn’t give me a second chance for no reason — He gave me the opportunity to stay alive,' Pylypchuk told VOA. More than two years after stepping on the landmine, Pylypchuk is still undergoing rehabilitation and preparing for additional surgeries. Now living in the U.S. temporarily thanks to Uniting for Ukraine, a special U.S. government parole program for Ukrainians fleeing the Russian invasion, he continues to raise funds for and send essential supplies to his fellow soldiers on Ukraine’s front lines. Pylypchuk has a two-year-old son, Mark, and a daughter, Evelina, who was born in the United States. He hopes that by the time he fully recovers, the war in Ukraine will be over and he, his wife and two children can return home. He would like to pursue a career in information technology. For now, he is focusing on his recovery and enjoying fatherhood. 'You only have one life, and you have to live it fully, without being afraid of not doing something. If you want to do something, you need to do it. And appreciate what you have. Above all — your life,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/grievously-wounded-ukrainian-soldier-gets-second-chance-in-us/7926170.html	2025-01-06T10:23:28-08:00

US-Somali operation kills 10 al-Shabab militants	WASHINGTON — The Somali government said 10 al-Shabab militants were killed in an operation conducted in collaboration with the United States military. In a statement, Somalia’s information ministry said the operation took place in Beer Xaani town, approximately 60 northwest of Kismayo. The statement was issued on Sunday but did not specify when the operation took place. 'The operation destroyed a group of Khawaarij [deviants] who were planning to launch an attack. No civilians were harmed during the operation' which, according to the statement, was conducted 'with the help of US strikes.' The United States military on Monday confirmed the killing of senior al-Shabab leader Mohamed Mire in an airstrike on Dec. 24 near the town of Kunyo Barrow in Lower Shabelle region. The killing was initially reported by the Somali government two days after the operation. 'Mire, also known as Abu Abdirahman, was responsible for al-Shabaab’s regional governance in Somalia for the last 15 years. In addition to being one of al-Shabaab's longest-serving members, Mire served as the interior minister and played a key role in the group's strategic decision-making,' the United States military command in Africa, AFRICOM said in a statement. AFRICOM said it cannot disclose specifics of the mission, stating only that no civilians were harmed. 'The command will continue to assess the results of the operation and provide additional information as appropriate,' said U.S. Marine Corps Gen. Michael Langley, AFRICOM commander, according to the statement. 'As our National Security Strategy outlines, America remains steadfast in countering the evolving threats of terrorism,' Langley said. Al-Shabab, which has been fighting the Somali government for more than 15 years, controls large areas in southern Somalia and pockets in the central region of the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-somali-operation-kills-10-al-shabab-militants/7926036.html	2025-01-06T08:58:47-08:00	
Pope Francis names 1st woman to head major Vatican office	Rome — Pope Francis on Monday named the first woman to head a major Vatican office, appointing an Italian nun, Sister Simona Brambilla, to become prefect of the department responsible for all the Catholic Church's religious orders. The appointment marks a major step in Francis’ aim to give women more leadership roles in governing the church. While women have been named to No. 2 spots in some Vatican offices, never has a woman been named prefect of a dicastery or congregation of the Holy See Curia, the central governing organ of the Catholic Church. The historic nature of Brambilla’s appointment was confirmed by Vatican Media, which headlined its report 'Sister Simona Brambilla is the first woman prefect in the Vatican.' The office is one of the most important in the Vatican. Known officially as the Dicastery for the Institutes of Consecrated Life and Societies of Apostolic Life, it is responsible for every religious order, from the Jesuits and Franciscans to smaller newer movements. In an indication of the novelty of the appointment, and the theological implications involved, Francis simultaneously named as a co-leader, or 'pro-prefect,' a cardinal: Ángel Fernández Artime, a Salesian. But the appointment, announced in the Vatican daily bulletin, lists Brambilla first as 'prefect' and Fernández second as her co-leader, which theologically is necessary since the prefect must be able to celebrate Mass and perform other sacramental functions that currently can only be done by men. Brambilla, 59, is a member of the Consolata Missionaries religious order and had served as the No. 2 in the religious orders department since last year. She takes over from the retiring Cardinal Joao Braz de Aviz, 77. Francis made Brambilla’s appointment possible with his 2022 reform of the Holy See’s founding constitution, which allowed laypeople, including women, to head a dicastery and become prefects. Brambilla, a nurse, worked as a missionary in Mozambique and led her Consolata order as superior from 2011-2023, when Francis made her secretary of the religious orders department. Her appointment is the latest move by Francis to show by example how women can take leadership roles within the Catholic hierarchy, albeit without allowing them to be ordained as priests. Catholic women do much of the church’s work in schools, hospitals and passing down the faith to future generations. But they have long complained of second-class status in an institution that reserves the priesthood for men. Francis has upheld the ban on female priests and tamped down hopes that women could be ordained as deacons. But there has been a marked increase in the percentage of women working in the Vatican during his papacy, including in leadership positions, from 19.3% in 2013 to 23.4% today, according to statistics reported by Vatican News. In the Curia alone, the percentage of women is 26%. Among the women holding leadership positions are Sister Raffaella Petrini, the first-ever female secretary general of the Vatican City State, responsible for the territory’s health care system, police force and main source of revenue, the Vatican Museums, which are led by a laywoman, Barbara Jatta. Another nun, Sister Alessandra Smerilli, is the No. 2 in the Vatican development office while several women have been appointed to under-secretary positions, including the French nun, Sister Nathalie Becquart, in the synod of bishops' office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-names-1st-woman-to-head-a-major-vatican-office/7926027.html	2025-01-06T08:55:02-08:00	
US to remove barriers to civil nuclear cooperation with India	New Delhi — The United States is finalizing steps to lift barriers on civil nuclear cooperation with Indian firms, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in New Delhi on Monday, calling it a significant step in cementing the bilateral partnership between the two countries. A landmark deal signed in 2007 between India and the United States had ended three decades of sanctions imposed on New Delhi for conducting nuclear tests and opened the door for India to get civil nuclear technology. The agreement was expected to help India meet its burgeoning energy needs. But Indian rules which require the liability in the case of accidents to be met by the firm that sets up a nuclear power plant rather than the operator — which do not align with global norms — had posed a hurdle to U.S. companies establishing power plants in India. Saying that the 'formal paperwork' to remove long-standing regulations on civil nuclear cooperation will be done soon, Sullivan said that 'this will be an opportunity to turn the page on some of the frictions of the past and create opportunities for entities that have been on restricted list in the United States to come off those lists and enter into deep collaborations with our private sector, with our scientists and technologists.' Sullivan’s visit to India came two weeks before a new administration under incoming President-elect Donald Trump takes charge. Speaking at the Indian Institute of Technology in New Delhi, he called India-U.S. collaboration crucial for peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific. Analysts say the visit underlines the strong Indo-U.S. partnership built in recent years and the likely continuity in those ties amid common concerns over China and strong bipartisan support for the relationship. In an editorial, The Indian Express newspaper noted that an important common thread between Trump’s previous term and President Biden’s administration has been the U.S. policy to strengthen the strategic partnership with India. 'These bilateral conversations during the final days of the transition between two administrations in Washington underline a growing strategic congruence,' the newspaper said. Sullivan said that an initiative launched by the two countries two years ago to bolster their strategic technology partnership was an important component of the relationship. Under the Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology, both countries are moving to deepen cooperation in areas like quantum computing, defense, artificial intelligence, 5G wireless networks and semiconductors — areas in which China has acquired a dominant position. Pointing out that supply chains are moving out of China, he said that the 'United States, India and other key democratic partners have been reminded abruptly and sharply that we cannot ignore the ways in which interdependencies can be weaponized against us.' 'The visit is basically a signal from the Biden administration that the India-U.S. relationship is important and their cooperation on critical technologies is an important aspect of this relationship,' according to Manoj Joshi, distinguished fellow at the Observer Research Foundation in New Delhi. 'But while the stars are all aligned for New Delhi and Washington, we really don’t know how it will all play out under Trump.' Sullivan met Indian national security adviser Ajit Doval and Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar in New Delhi. In a post on social media platform X, Jaishankar said 'Continued our ongoing discussions on deepening bilateral, regional and global cooperation. Valued the openness of our conversations in the last four years.' New Delhi and Washington have built close ties in recent years despite differences over India’s continuing ties with Moscow since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and tensions over the alleged involvement of a former Indian government employee in a foiled plot in 2023 to assassinate a Sikh separatist who is a U.S. national.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-remove-barriers-to-civil-nuclear-cooperation-with-india/7926010.html	2025-01-06T08:41:29-08:00	
Trump's lawyers ask judge to halt Friday's hush money case sentencing while they appeal to block it	NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump on Monday moved to halt this week's sentencing in his hush money case while he appeals a judge's decision that upheld the historic verdict and put him on course to be the first president to take office convicted of felony crimes. Trump's lawyers said they will ask a New York appeals court to reverse Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan's ruling last week, which set the case for sentencing on Friday — a little more than a week before his inauguration. Merchan rejected Trump's bid to throw out the May 30 verdict because of his impending return to the White House. Trump's lawyers said they will also appeal a prior decision in which the judge refused to dismiss the case on presidential immunity grounds. In his decision last week, the judge signaled he is not likely to sentence Trump, a Republican, to any punishment for his historic conviction on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records. Trump has said that it 'would be the end of the Presidency as we know it' if the ruling is allowed to stand. Trump's lawyers argued Monday that their appeal to the Appellate Division of the state's trial court should trigger what's known as an automatic stay, or pause, in the proceedings. If that doesn't happen, they said, Merchan should step in and halt Friday's sentencing. They asked Merchan to inform them by Monday afternoon of his decision 'to allow sufficient time for President Trump to seek an emergency appellate review.' 'Today, President Trump's legal team moved to stop the unlawful sentencing in the Manhattan D.A.'s Witch Hunt,' Trump spokesperson Steven Cheung said. 'The Supreme Court's historic decision on Immunity, the state constitution of New York, and other established legal precedent mandate that this meritless hoax be immediately dismissed.' A message seeking comment was left for the Manhattan district attorney's office, which prosecuted the case. Any delay in sentencing Trump could run out the clock on closing the case before his second term begins Jan. 20. As president, he will again be immune from criminal proceedings, making it unlikely he can be sentenced while in office. If sentencing doesn't happen before Trump is sworn in, waiting until he leaves office in 2029 'may become the only viable option,' Merchan said last week. While Trump asserted that presidential immunity and his looming second term necessitated nixing the verdict, Merchan wrote in his Jan. 3 ruling that only 'bringing finality to this matter' by sentencing Trump would serve the interests of justice. The judge wrote that sentencing Trump to what's known as an unconditional discharge — closing the case without jail time, a fine or probation — 'appears to be the most viable solution.' Acknowledging the demands of the transition process, Merchan had given Trump the option to attend in person or appear virtually by video. Whenever he is sentenced, Trump will have an opportunity to speak, as will his lawyers and prosecutors. Once he is sentenced, he can appeal the verdict, as he has vowed to do. The charges involved an alleged scheme to hide a hush money payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels in the last weeks of Trump's 2016 campaign to keep her from publicizing claims she'd had sex with him years earlier. He says that her story is false and that he did nothing wrong. The case centered on how Trump accounted for reimbursing his then-personal lawyer Michael Cohen, who had made the payment to Daniels. The conviction carried the possibility of punishment ranging from a fine or probation to up to four years in prison. Cohen, a key prosecution witness who had previously called for Trump to be put in prison, said that 'based upon all of the intervening circumstances' Merchan's decision to sentence Trump without punishment 'is both judicious and appropriate.' Trump's sentencing initially was set for last July 11, then postponed twice at the defense's request. After Trump's Nov. 5 election, Merchan delayed the sentencing again so the defense and prosecution could weigh in on the future of the case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-lawyers-ask-judge-to-halt-friday-s-hush-money-case-sentencing-while-they-appeal-to-block-it-/7925987.html	2025-01-06T08:29:29-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau expected to announce his political future after facing growing calls to resign	Toronto — Facing growing calls to resign, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is expected to make an announcement about his political future this week. Trudeau — who has become deeply unpopular over a range of issues, including the soaring cost of food and housing — has kept publicly mum in recent weeks, despite intensifying pressure for him to step down after the abrupt resignation of his finance minister on Dec. 16. The prime minister has now returned to Ottawa after the Christmas holidays. 'His long silence following this political drama speaks volumes about the weakness of his current position,' said Daniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. While all three opposition parties now say they would support a vote to topple Trudeau's minority government, Parliament is not currently in session so that threat isn't immediate. But members of his own party are increasingly calling for his resignation — making his situation appear more and more untenable. Still, there is no mechanism for Trudeau's party to force him out in the short term. If he hangs on until Parliament returns later this month, his Liberal party could be forced from power by a no-confidence vote that would trigger an election, which would very likely favor the opposing Conservative Party. The 53-year-old was initially hailed for returning the country to its liberal past when he was elected in 2015, but he has become widely unpopular in recent years. The political upheaval comes at a difficult moment for Canada. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on all Canadian products if Canada does not stem what he calls a flow of migrants and drugs in the United States — even though far fewer of each cross into the U.S. from Canada than from Mexico. Trudeau is scheduled to participate virtually in a meeting of the Cabinet Committee on Canada-U.S. Relations on Monday. If Trudeau does step down as party leader, the Liberals could potentially delay the return of Parliament to give them time to choose a new leader. Because Trudeau's Liberals do not hold an outright majority in Parliament, they have for years depended on the support of the NDP to pass legislation and stay in power. But that support has vanished — NDP leader Jagmeet Singh made clear last month the NDP will vote to bring down the government. The other opposition parties have said the same.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-s-trudeau-expected-to-announce-his-political-future-after-facing-growing-calls-to-resign/7925894.html	2025-01-06T07:31:11-08:00	
France's former President Sarkozy standing trial over alleged campaign funding by Libya's Gadhafi	Paris — A trial of France's former President Nicolas Sarkozy and 11 co-defendants started Monday over alleged illegal financing of his 2007 presidential campaign by the government of then-Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. Sarkozy, who served as president from 2007 to 2012, did not speak to the press at arrival. He has denied any wrongdoing. He faces charges of passive corruption, illegal campaign financing, concealment of embezzlement of public funds and criminal association, punished by up to 10 years in prison. The trial is scheduled to run until April 10. The Libyan case, the biggest and possibly most shocking of several scandals involving Sarkozy, is scheduled to run until April 10, with a verdict expected at a later date. The trial involves 11 other defendants, including three former ministers. Franco-Lebanese businessman Ziad Takieddine, accused of having played the role of intermediary, has fled in Lebanon and is not expected to appear at the Paris court. Sarkozy is looking forward to the hearings 'with determination,' his lawyer Christophe Ingrain said in a statement. 'There is no Libyan financing of the campaign,' the statement said. 'We want to believe the court will have the courage to examine the facts objectively, without being guided by the nebulous theory that poisoned the investigation.' Gadhafi's alleged agreement The case emerged in March 2011, when a Libyan news agency reported that the Gadhafi government had financed Sarkozy's 2007 campaign. In an interview, Gadhafi himself said 'it's thanks to us that he reached the presidency. We provided him with the funds that allowed him to win,' without providing any amount or other details. Sarkozy, who had welcomed Gadhafi to Paris with great honors in 2007, became one of the first Western leaders to push for a military intervention in Libya in March 2011, when Arab Spring pro-democracy protests swept the Arab world. Gadhafi was killed by opposition fighters in October that same year, ending his four-decade rule of the North African country. The next year, French online news site Mediapart published a document said to be a note from the Libyan secret services, mentioning Gadhafi's agreement to provide Sarkozy's campaign 50 million euros in financing. Sarkozy strongly rejected the accusations, calling the document a 'blatant fake' and filing complaints for forgery, concealment and spreading false news. However, French investigative magistrates eventually said in 2016 the document has all the characteristics of an authentic one, although there is no definitive evidence that such a transaction took place. The official cost for Sarkozy's 2007 campaign was 20 million euros. Accusations of witness tampering French investigators scrutinized numerous trips to Libya made by people close to Sarkozy, then the interior minister, between 2005 and 2007, including his chief of staff Claude Guéant. They also noted dozens of meetings between Guéant and Takieddine, a key player in major French military contracts abroad. The investigation gained traction when Takieddine told news site Mediapart in 2016 that he had delivered three suitcases from Libya containing millions in cash to the French Interior Ministry. However, Takieddinne reversed his statement four years later. Since then, a separate investigation has been launched into alleged witness tampering as magistrates suspect an attempt to pressure Takieddine in order to clear Sarkozy. Sarkozy and his wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni-Sarkozy, were given preliminary charges as financial prosecutors said the former president is suspected of 'benefitting from corruptly influencing' Takieddine. 11 other defendants The other accused are three former French ministers, including Guéant, and a former adviser close to Sarkozy. Like Takieddine, Franco-Algerian businessman Alexandre Djouhri is accused of having been an intermediary. The case also involves Gadhafi's former chief of staff and treasurer Bashir Saleh, who sought refuge in France during the Libyan civil war then moved to South Africa, where he survived a shooting in 2018, before settling in the United Arab Emirates. Other defendants include two Saudi billionaires, a former Airbus executive and a former banker accused of having played a role in the alleged money transfers. Shukri Ghanem, Gadhafi's former oil minister who was also suspected, was found dead in the Danube River in Vienna in 2012 in unclear circumstances. French investigators were able to find Ghanem's notebook, which is believed to document payments made by Libya. Gadhafi's spy chief and brother-in-law Abdullah al-Senoussi told investigative judges millions have indeed been provided to support Sarkozy's campaign. Accused of war crimes, he is now imprisoned in Libya. Sarkozy convicted in 2 other cases Sarkozy has been convicted in two other scandals. France's highest court, the Court of Cassation, last month upheld a conviction against Sarkozy of corruption and influence peddling while he was the head of state. He was sentenced to one year in house arrest with an electronic bracelet. The case was revealed as investigative judges were listening to wiretapped phone conversations during the Libya inquiry. In February last year, an appeals court in Paris found Sarkozy guilty of illegal campaign financing in his failed 2012 reelection bid.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-s-former-president-sarkozy-standing-trial-over-alleged-campaign-funding-by-libya-s-gadhafi-/7925757.html	2025-01-06T05:49:16-08:00	
Seychelles: Small nation where big powers compete	Victoria, Seychelles — It has been 18 months since the United States reopened its embassy in Victoria, Seychelles, 27 years after Washington left the island nation. Seychelles is an archipelago of 115 islands strategically located in the Indian Ocean at the confluence of Africa, South Asia and the Gulf states. The small African country is not only attractive to the U.S. for its trade and investment potential but is also a place of importance to U.S. foreign policy, given its 'open sea-lanes, fisheries and the marine environment,' according to the U.S. Embassy. With the U.S. reestablishing a diplomatic presence in the country, it has also become a geopolitical playing field for Washington and Beijing as they compete for influence in Africa and the world. During the Cold War, the U.S. had a tracking station in Seychelles to monitor Russian satellites. Several years after the Iron Curtain fell, the U.S. closed the station and its embassy. In Washington’s absence, China filled the void and gained influence in the island nation through construction projects, education initiatives and other soft power ventures. Washington, aware that Beijing had gained a foothold, began reengaging with the country in 2023. Seychelles is one of several island nations the U.S. has deemed strategically important in its attempt to counter China on the global stage. In the Pacific, the U.S. reopened its embassy in the Solomon Islands in 2023 and established an embassy in Tonga. The following year, the U.S. opened an embassy in Vanuatu. While it is yet to be seen what direction the second Trump administration will take globally in its China policy, VOA traveled to the main island of Mahe in Seychelles to look at how China and the U.S. have impacted the country, and how each is fairing in that competition for influence there.

China's Xi: Corruption 'biggest threat' to ruling Communist Party	Beijing — Corruption is the biggest threat to China's Communist Party, President Xi Jinping said on Monday, in a clear warning that the ruling party is resolved to tackle a long-running problem that is now entrenched in many strata of Chinese society. China was rocked last year by corruption probes into high-profile individuals ranging from a deputy central bank governor to a former chairman of its biggest oil and gas company, adding to unease in an economy struggling to secure a firm footing and a society grappling with a fading sense of wealth. The list also included a top Chinese admiral, Miao Hua, whose fall from grace comes at a time when Beijing is trying to modernize its armed forces and boost its battle readiness. Not only is corruption still pervading China, it is actually on the rise, Xi said at the start of a three-day congress of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, CCDI, the country's top anti-graft watchdog. 'Corruption is the biggest threat to our party,' he warned. To underline the scale of the problem, the CCDI said in recent days that a record 58 'tigers,' or senior officials, were probed last year. Of those investigated, 47 were at the vice-ministerial level or above, including Tang Renjian, former minister of agriculture and rural affairs, and Gou Zhongwen, former head of the General Administration of Sport. Even former high-ranking officials were not spared, such as Wang Yilin, who stepped down as chairman of state-owned China National Petroleum Corp in 2020 on reaching retirement age. The crackdown will continue, said Andrew Wedeman, a professor at Georgia State University. 'I don't see how Xi could afford to back off at this point,' Wedeman said. 'A dozen years after he set out to cleanse the senior ranks, Xi is still finding widespread corruption at the top of the party-state and the PLA.' China's People's Liberation Army (PLA) has also been swept by a wave of purges since 2023. Li Shangfu was removed as defense minister after seven months and his predecessor Wei Fenghe was expelled from the party for 'serious violations of discipline,' a euphemism for corruption. Challenges Wedeman said it appeared that the pool that Xi is drawing on as replacements also included corrupt officials. 'If Xi is promoting corrupt officials, this suggests the party's internal vetting apparatus is not functioning effectively or, more seriously, is itself corrupted.' China admits its anti-corruption efforts face new challenges, with traditional forms of corruption such as accepting cash becoming more insidious. 'A businessman might offer me money directly, and I'd refuse,' said Fan Yifei, a former deputy governor of the People's Bank of China sentenced to death with a two-year reprieve. 'But if he gives it in the form of stocks or other assets, not directly to me but to my family, that's a whole different matter,' state media quoted Fan as saying. Even the lowly 'flies' and 'ants' in China's vast bureaucracy will not be spared, a program aired on Sunday by the national television broadcaster showed. The first of four episodes of 'Fighting Corruption for the People' that ran ahead of the CCDI meeting focused on grassroots corruption, including a case of how a primary school director profited from kickbacks from on-campus meals and another on how a rural official took bribes from farm project contractors. 'Compared to the 'tigers' far away, the public feels more strongly about the corruption around them,' said Sun Laibin, a professor at Peking University's School of Marxism. The anti-corruption fight must reach the 'hearts' of the masses, he said on the program, so that they can 'deeply feel' the care of the party.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-xi-corruption-biggest-threat-to-ruling-communist-party/7925734.html	2025-01-06T05:19:49-08:00	
Nippon, US Steel file suit after Biden administration blocks $15 billion deal	Washington — Japan’s Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel are filing a federal lawsuit challenging the Biden administration's decision to block a proposed nearly $15 billion deal for Nippon to acquire Pittsburgh-based U.S. Steel. The suit, filed Monday in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, alleges that it was a political decision and violated the companies' due process. Nippon Steel had promised to invest $2.7 billion in U.S. Steel's aging blast furnace operations in Gary, Indiana, and Pennsylvania's Mon Valley. It also vowed not to reduce production capacity in the United States over the next decade without first getting U.S. government approval. Biden on Friday decided to stop the Nippon takeover — after federal regulators deadlocked on whether to approve it — because 'a strong domestically owned and operated steel industry represents an essential national security priority. ... Without domestic steel production and domestic steel workers, our nation is less strong and less secure,' he said in a statement. While administration officials have said the move is unrelated to Japan's relationship with the U.S. — this is the first time a U.S. president has blocked a merger between a U.S. and Japanese firm. Biden departs the White House in just a few weeks. The president's decision to block the deal comes after the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, known as CFIUS, failed to reach consensus on the possible national security risks of the deal last month, and sent a long-awaited report on the merger to Biden. He had 15 days to reach a final decision.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nippon-us-steel-file-suit-after-biden-administration-blocks-15-billion-deal-/7925729.html	2025-01-06T05:12:17-08:00	
Biden, in 11th hour action, bans new offshore oil and gas drilling in most federal waters	Washington — President Joe Biden is moving to ban new offshore oil and gas drilling in most U.S. coastal waters, a last-minute effort to block possible action by the incoming Trump administration to expand offshore drilling. Biden, whose term expires in two weeks, said he is using authority under the federal Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to protect offshore areas along the East and West coasts, the eastern Gulf of Mexico and portions of Alaska's Northern Bering Sea from future oil and natural gas leasing. 'My decision reflects what coastal communities, businesses and beachgoers have known for a long time: that drilling off these coasts could cause irreversible damage to places we hold dear and is unnecessary to meet our nation’s energy needs,' Biden said in a statement. 'As the climate crisis continues to threaten communities across the country and we are transitioning to a clean energy economy, now is the time to protect these coasts for our children and grandchildren,' he said. Biden's orders would not affect large swaths of the Gulf of Mexico, where most U.S. offshore drilling occurs, but it would protect coastlines along California, Florida and other states from future drilling. Biden's actions, which protect more than 625 million acres of federal waters, could be difficult for President-elect Donald Trump to unwind, since they would likely require an act of Congress to repeal. Trump himself has a complicated history on offshore drilling. He signed a memorandum in 2020 directing the Interior secretary to prohibit drilling in the waters off both Florida coasts, and off the coasts of Georgia and South Carolina until 2032. The action came after Trump initially moved to vastly expand offshore drilling, before retreating amid widespread opposition in Florida and other coastal states. Trump has vowed to establish what he calls American 'energy dominance' around the world as he seeks to boost U.S. oil and gas drilling and move away from Biden’s focus on climate change. Environmental advocates hailed Biden's action, saying new oil and gas drilling must be sharply curtailed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to global warming. 2024 was the hottest year in recorded history. 'This is an epic ocean victory!' said Joseph Gordon, campaign director for the environmental group Oceana. Gordon thanked Biden 'for listening to the voices from coastal communities' that oppose drilling and 'contributing to the bipartisan tradition of protecting our coasts.' Biden's actions build on the legacy of Democratic and Republican presidents to protect coastal water from offshore drilling, Gordon said, adding that U.S. coastlines are home to tens of millions of Americans and support billions of dollars of economic activity that depend on a clean environment, abundant wildlife and thriving fisheries. In balancing multiple uses of America’s oceans, Biden said it was clear that the areas he is withdrawing from fossil fuel use show 'relatively minimal potential' that does not justify possible environmental, public health and economic risks that would come from new leasing and drilling. A spokeswoman for Trump mocked Biden, saying, 'Joe Biden clearly wants high gas prices to be his legacy.' The spokeswoman, Karoline Leavitt, called Biden's action 'a disgraceful decision designed to exact political revenge on the American people who gave President Trump a mandate to increase drilling and lower gas prices. Rest assured, Joe Biden will fail, and we will drill, baby, drill.' Biden has proposed up to three oil and gas lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico, but none in Alaska, as he tries to navigate between energy companies seeking greater oil and gas production and environmental activists who want him to shut down new offshore drilling in the fight against climate change. A five-year drilling plan approved in 2023 includes proposed offshore sales in 2025, 2027 and 2029. The three lease sales are the minimum number the Democratic administration could legally offer if it wants to continue expanding offshore wind development. Under the terms of a 2022 climate law, the government must offer at least 60 million acres (24.2 million hectares) of offshore oil and gas leases in any one-year period before it can offer offshore wind leases. Biden, whose decision to approve the huge Willow oil project in Alaska drew strong condemnation from environmental groups, has previously limited offshore drilling in other areas of Alaska and the Arctic Ocean.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-in-11th-hour-action-bans-new-offshore-oil-and-gas-drilling-in-most-federal-waters-/7925695.html	2025-01-06T04:36:41-08:00	
Blinken expresses confidence in South Korea democratic process	SEOUL — South Korean investigators sought an extension of a warrant to arrest impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, as visiting U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken reaffirmed confidence in the key Asian ally's handling of the political turmoil. Investigators probing Yoon over his Dec. 3 martial law proclamation failed to serve an arrest warrant on Friday, blocked by presidential security service guards who formed a human chain to prevent access to Yoon. The arrest warrant, the first for a sitting president, was due to expire at midnight on Monday (1500 GMT). Investigating authorities said in a statement on Monday they had requested an extension of the warrant in court, but declined to say how long the extension will last. Yoon, who has been impeached over his martial law declaration, is also under criminal investigation for possible insurrection. The brief six-hour martial law declaration plunged one of Asia's strongest democracies into uncharted territory with the impeachment of not only Yoon, but also the prime minister who become acting president. Yoon's action drew a rare rebuke from officials in Washington including Blinken's deputy, Kurt Campbell, who has said it was 'badly misjudged.' Speaking after his meeting with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, Blinken said Washington had expressed 'serious concerns' to Seoul over some of the actions Yoon took over the course of his martial law declaration. But the events unfolding since then have reflected South Korea's brand as a democratic success, 'which is remarkably strong,' Blinken said at a news conference. 'The response that we’ve seen, and that we expect to continue to see, is one that is peaceful and fully consistent and in accordance with the constitution and the rule of law.' Yoon was impeached by parliament on Dec. 14 and suspended from presidential duties. The Constitutional Court is trying the case to decide whether to remove him from office permanently or reinstate him. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-ranking Officials (CIO), which is leading the criminal insurrection probe into Yoon, had sent a notice to police requesting them to take over execution of the arrest warrant. A police official said at a news briefing that police believed there was a legal dispute over such a transfer and would discuss it with the CIO. Yonhap news agency cited a police official as saying the arrest warrant will now be executed under the authority of the police joint investigation team and the CIO. Yoon's lawyers have argued that the CIO anti-graft force has no authority under South Korean law to investigate any case involving insurrection. On Monday, Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer advising Yoon, said the bid to transfer the execution of the arrest warrant is effectively an admission by the CIO that its probe and the warrant were 'illegal.' The unprecedented attempt to arrest an incumbent president has intensified dueling rallies by those supporting Yoon, with the 'Stop the Steal' slogans popularized by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump voters, and those calling for Yoon's punishment. On Monday, a group of hardcore Yoon supporters led by Christian pastor Jun Kwang-hoon held a news conference and described the fight for Yoon as an 'international battle' for freedom. 'Sadly, there's no Fox News in Korea,' it said in a statement, referring to the American cable news channel popular with Trump supporters. Jun said Yoon supporters would continue rallies outside his residence until they 'reap the results.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-expresses-confidence-in-south-korea-democratic-process-/7925693.html	2025-01-06T04:22:20-08:00	
Winter blast of snow, ice and bitter cold grips US from Midwest to East Coast	A major winter blast of snow, ice, wind and plunging temperatures in the U.S. stirred dangerous travel conditions from central and southern states all the way to the East Coast early Monday, prompting schools and government offices in several states to close. Snow and ice blanketed major roads across Kansas, western Nebraska and parts of Indiana, where the state’s National Guard was activated to help stranded motorists. At least 20 centimeters of snow was expected, along with gusting winds up to 72 kph. The National Weather Service issued winter storm warnings from Kansas and Missouri all the way to New Jersey. 'For locations in this region that receive the highest snow totals, it may be the heaviest snowfall in at least a decade,' the weather service said. Gary Wright wore a parka as he and his husband chipped away at thick ice coating his SUV in a slippery apartment parking lot in Missouri. Wright said he will work remotely Monday, but wanted to scrape off his vehicle as an excuse to spend a little time in the snow. He also is seeking boots for their two older dogs that 'won’t budge at all' when their paws hit the cold ground. The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually spins around the North Pole. People in the U.S., Europe and Asia experience its intense cold when the vortex escapes and plunges southward. Studies show a fast-warming Arctic is partly to blame for the increasing frequency of the polar vortex extending its icy grip. Classes canceled School closings are expected to be widespread Monday. Districts in Indiana, Virginia and Kentucky began announcing cancellations and delays on Sunday afternoon. Kentucky’s Jefferson County Public Schools canceled classes, extracurricular activities and athletics for its nearly 100,000 students. Classes also have been cancelled in Maryland, where Gov. Wes Moore declared a state of emergency Sunday and announced the state government would be closed Monday. 'Keeping Marylanders safe is our top priority. Please stay off the roads during this storm. Prepare your home and family and charge your communications devices in case you lose power,' Moore said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/winter-blast-of-snow-ice-and-bitter-cold-grips-us-from-midwest-to-east-coast-/7925660.html	2025-01-06T03:40:01-08:00	
Uganda's military leader says he wants to behead opposition leader	NAIROBI, KENYA — The head of Uganda's military, who is also the son of longstanding President Yoweri Museveni, said he wanted to behead the country's most prominent opposition leader. Muhoozi Kainerugaba is widely believed to be the heir apparent to his father, who has governed Uganda since 1986. Kainerugaba routinely makes inflammatory posts on social media, including a threat in 2022 to invade neighboring Kenya. Kainerugaba later apologized for that threat. He sometimes says that certain posts are meant ironically. In a post on X on Sunday evening, Kainerugaba said his father, whom he referred to by the honorific Mzee, was the only person protecting opposition leader Bobi Wine from him. 'If Mzee was not there, I would cut off his head today,' Kainerugaba posted. Bobi Wine, whose legal name is Robert Kyagulanyi and who finished second to Museveni in the 2021 presidential election, responded on X that he did not take the threat lightly, saying there had been several previous attempts on his life. Kainerugaba responded: 'Finally! I woke you up? Before I behead you, repay us the money we loaned you,' suggesting the government had previously bought off Wine to undermine the opposition. Spokespeople for the government and Kainerugaba were not immediately reachable for comment. A spokesperson for the armed forces declined to comment. The government spokesperson has previously said Kainerugaba's social media posts should be understood as 'casual' comments and not taken seriously or as reflecting government policy. Wine, a popular musician turned politician has parlayed his star power into a career as Museveni's most formidable challenger. He rejected the results of the 2021 election, alleging ballot stuffing and intimidation. Human rights activists have also accused Museveni's government of widespread human rights abuses, including torture and arbitrary detention. Uganda's government has repeatedly denied allegations of election fraud and human rights abuses.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uganda-s-military-leader-says-he-wants-to-behead-opposition-leader/7925642.html	2025-01-06T02:59:53-08:00	
China's top diplomat heads to Africa as West's attention dwindles	BEIJING — China's top diplomat began his annual New Year tour of Africa on Sunday, maintaining a 35-year-long tradition, to quietly advance Beijing's already sizeable influence across the resource-rich continent as Europe's presence wanes and America's wavers. While global capitals and investors brace for the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to the White House, and wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and domestic politics keep German and French ministers occupied, Foreign Minister Wang Yi being in Namibia, the Republic of Congo, Chad and Nigeria highlights the consistency of China's engagement with Africa, analysts say. Wang's visit through to Saturday also comes as the world's No.2 economy ramps up its financial support for the debt-laden continent and looks to strike more critical minerals deals and find markets to absorb its exports. 'The decision on which countries to go to each year rarely follows any external logic,' said Eric Orlander, co-founder of the China-Global South Project. '(But) it resonates in Africa as a reminder of China's consistent commitment to the continent, in contrast to the approaches of the U.S., United Kingdom and European Union.' 'China firmly believes that Africa has never been a forgotten continent, but rather a source of vitality and a land full of development potential,' Guo Jiakun, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson, told a regular news conference on Monday. As China's economy slows, Africa offers a much-needed avenue for its state-owned infrastructure firms struggling for projects as indebted local governments hold off on spending, and a market for its electric vehicles and solar panels, areas where the U.S. and EU say it has over-capacity. Africa's 50-plus votes at the United Nations could also help advance Beijing's efforts to reshape multilateral institutions and reinterpret global norms so that they are more in line with its interests, particularly on issues such as human rights. While current U.S. President Joe Biden's December trip to Angola was his only visit to sub-Saharan Africa in his presidency, China puts Africa at the front of its diplomatic calendar. 'China has become central to Africa's policy, as an actor and an inspiration,' said Hannah Ryder, founder of Development Reimagined, an African-owned consultancy, referring to how candidates vying to chair the African Union Commission have talked up Beijing's ability to improve Africa's manufacturing capabilities and China's track record in mass education ahead of February's election. The commission is the secretariat of the 55-nation African Union. Security issues Wang's decision to visit the Republic of Congo, which this year takes over as co-chair of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) that sets the agenda for China-Africa relations, also points to China's commitment to implementing the outcomes of last year's summit, Ryder said, where China pledged $51 billion in fresh financial assistance. Beijing is also beginning to make its presence felt on pressing regional security issues, analysts say, which partly explains why Wang will travel to Chad. France last month began the withdrawal of its military from the Central African country, after its government unexpectedly ended a defense cooperation pact that had made it a key Western ally in the fight against Islamic militants in the region. 'China has been a reliable and stable partner for the new military juntas in the Sahel and West Africa,' Orland said. 'For the French and U.S., who see a dilution of Western power in the region, China's presence is seen as 'controversial,' but it's a very different view from African perspectives.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-s-top-diplomat-heads-to-africa-as-west-s-attention-dwindles/7925632.html	2025-01-06T02:42:01-08:00	
Israeli officials say bus shooting kills 3 in West Bank	Gunmen attacked a bus and car Monday in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, killing at least three people and wounding seven others, Israeli emergency services said. The attack happened near the Palestinian town of Al-Funduq. Israel’s military said its forces were pursuing the attackers and using blockades to cordon off villages in the area. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expressed condolences for the victims and vowed to find those responsible. 'No one will get away,' Netanyahu said on X. Violence has surged in the West Bank since the October 2023 Hamas attack on southern Israel and the resulting Israeli military campaign in the Gaza Strip. Palestinian health officials say Israeli troop fire and attacks by Israeli settlers have killed at least 818 Palestinians in the West Bank during that time, while Palestinians have killed dozens of Israelis. Gaza ceasefire U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday the United States wants to achieve a ceasefire in the Gaza Strip before U.S. President Joe Biden leaves office in two weeks. But Blinken said if there is no deal by then, he is 'confident that it will get its completion at some point, hopefully sooner rather than later.' The United States, Egypt and Qatar have worked for months to broker a deal between Israel and Hamas, but the warring sides have not come close enough in their terms to reach an agreement. Basic parameters of a proposed deal include a halt in fighting in Gaza, an increase in humanitarian aid for Palestinian civilians and the release of hostages still being held by Hamas militants. The war began with the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack in which the militants killed 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. There are still about 100 hostages being held in Gaza, with at least one-third of them believed to be dead. Israel’s counteroffensive has killed at least 45,800 people and injured more than 109,000, according to the health ministry in Gaza. The ministry does not differentiate between militants and civilians in its count. The United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others have designated Hamas as a terror group.

Philippines deploys maritime and air assets to monitor China's 'monster ship'	Manila, Philippines — The Philippines has deployed air and sea assets of its military and coast guard in its exclusive economic zone to monitor China's largest coast guard vessel, calling the ship's presence an act of Chinese 'intimidation, coercion and aggression.' According to the Philippine coast guard, the 165 m long vessel 5901, referred to by the Philippines as 'the monster,' was on Sunday 65 to 70 nautical miles off the coast of the province of Zambales. 'We have all our assets pointed at this monster ship. The moment it (carries out) any provocative action, it will be met with appropriate response,' Jonathan Malaya, spokesperson for the National Security Council, told state television on Monday. China's embassy in Manila did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Ties between China and U.S. ally the Philippines have soured in the past few years, with spats frequent as Manila, under President Ferdinand Marcos Jr, pushes back at what it sees as aggression by Beijing. China has accused the Philippines of repeated encroachment in its waters. China claims most of the South China Sea, a key conduit for $3 trillion of annual ship-borne trade, as its own territory, with a massive coast guard presence in and around the EEZs of neighbors Vietnam, the Philippines and Malaysia. Beijing rejects a 2016 ruling by The Hague-based Permanent Court of Arbitration that said those expansive maritime claims had no legal basis. According to video shared by the Philippine coast guard, it ordered the Chinese vessel to leave the area, warning it has no authority to operate there. In its radioed response, the Chinese ship said it was conducting law enforcement duties within its jurisdictional waters. 'This is part of China's intimidation, coercion, aggression and deception. They are showcasing their ship to intimidate our fishermen,' Malaya said, adding the Philippine maritime presence would be boosted to support fishermen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-deploys-maritime-and-air-assets-to-monitor-china-s-monster-ship-/7925622.html	2025-01-06T02:23:27-08:00	
Malaysia's jailed ex-leader Najib wins appeal to pursue bid to serve corruption sentence at home	PUTRAJAYA, Malaysia — Malaysia's imprisoned former Prime Minister Najib Razak on Monday won an appeal to pursue his bid to serve his remaining corruption sentence under house arrest. In an application in April last year, Najib said he had clear information that then-King Sultan Abdullah Sultan Ahmad Shah issued an addendum order allowing him to finish his sentence under house arrest. Najib claimed the addendum was issued during a pardons board meeting on Jan. 29 last year chaired by Sultan Abdullah that also cut his 12-year jail sentence by half and sharply reduced a fine. But the High Court tossed out his bid three months later. The Court of Appeals, in a 2-1 ruling on Monday, ordered the High Court to hear the merits of the case. The decision came after Najib's lawyer produced a letter from a Pahang state palace official confirming that then-Sultan Abdullah had issued the addendum order. 'We are happy that finally Najib has got a win,' his lawyer Mohamad Shafee Abdullah said. 'He is very happy and very relieved that finally they recognized some element of injustice that has been placed against him.' The lawyer said Najib gave a thumbs-up in court when the ruling was read. He said it was 'criminal' for the government to conceal the addendum order. Shafee noted that a new High Court judge will now hear the case. In his application, Najib accused the pardons board, home minister, attorney-general and four others of concealing the sultan's order 'in bad faith.' Sultan Abdullah hails from Najib's hometown in Pahang. He ended his five-year reign on Jan. 30 last year under Malaysia's unique rotating monarchy system. A new king took office a day later. Home Minister Saifuddin Nasution Ismail has said he had no knowledge of such an order since he wasn't a member of the pardons board. The others named in Najib's application have not made any public comments. Najib, 71, served less than two years of his sentence before it was commuted by the pardons board. His sentence is now due to end on Aug. 23, 2028. He was charged and found guilty in a corruption case linked to the multibillion-dollar looting of state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad. The pardons board didn't give any reason for its decision and wasn't required to explain. But the move has prompted a public outcry over the appearance that Najib was being given special privileges compared to other prisoners. Najib set up the 1MDB development fund shortly after he took office in 2009. Investigators allege at least $4.5 billion was stolen from the fund and laundered by Najib's associates through layers of bank accounts in the United States and other countries, financed Hollywood films and extravagant purchases that included hotels, a luxury yacht, art and jewelry. More than $700 million landed in Najib's bank accounts. Najib is still fighting graft charges in the main trial linking him directly to the scandal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-s-jailed-ex-leader-najib-wins-appeal-to-pursue-bid-to-serve-corruption-sentence-at-home/7925619.html	2025-01-06T02:13:49-08:00	
South Korea says North Korea fired a ballistic missile into the sea	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — North Korea on Monday fired a ballistic missile that flew 1,100 kilometers (685 miles) before landing in waters between the Korean Peninsula and Japan, South Korea's military said, extending its weapons testing weeks before Donald Trump returns as U.S. president. The South's Joint Chiefs of Staff said the midrange missile was fired from an area near the North Korean capital Pyongyang and that the launch preparations were detected in advance by the U.S. and South Korean militaries. It denounced the launch as a provocation that poses a serious threat to peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. The joint chiefs said the military was strengthening its surveillance and defense posture in preparation for possible additional launches. Japan's Defense Ministry said the missile landed outside its exclusive economic zone and that there were no reports of damage to vessels or aircraft. Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba expressed concern that the North's accelerated pace in missile tests is advancing its capabilities. The North last year tested various nuclear-capable systems that threaten its neighbors and the United States, including a new solid-fuel intercontinental ballistic missile that achieved both the highest altitude and longest flight time of any missile the country has launched. Blinken holds talks in Seoul as political turmoil shakes South Korea The launch came as U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken was visiting Seoul for talks with South Korean allies over the North Korean nuclear threat and other issues. Blinken's visit comes amid political turmoil in South Korea following President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived martial law decree and subsequent impeachment by parliament last month, which experts say puts the country at a disadvantage in getting a steady footing with Trump ahead of his return to the White House. In a news conference with South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul, Blinken condemned North Korea's latest launch, which violates U.N. Security Council resolutions against the North. He also reiterated concerns about the growing alignment between North Korea and Russia in Moscow's war on Ukraine. According to U.S., Ukrainian and South Korean assessments, North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops and conventional weapons systems to support Moscow's war campaign. There are concerns that Russia could transfer to North Korea advanced weapons technology in return, which could potentially enhance the threat posed by leader Kim Jong Un's nuclear-armed military. Blinken described the military cooperation between Russia and North Korea as a 'two-way street,' saying Russia has been providing military equipment and training to the North and 'intends to share space and satellite technology.' Blinken and Cho both dismissed concerns about damage to the U.S.-South Korea alliance in the aftermath of the political turmoil in Seoul. Experts had warned that Yoon's martial law decree — which lasted only hours but has rattled politics, high-level diplomacy and financial markets for weeks — exposed the fragility of South Korea's democratic system in a divided society. 'We had serious concerns about some of the actions that President Yoon took and we communicated those directly to the government,' Blinken said. 'At the same time we have tremendous confidence in the resilience of South Korea's democracy, in the strength of its institutions and in the efforts that it's making to work through those institutions, pursuant to the constitution and the rule of law to resolve differences and to do so peacefully.' Kim's warning ahead of Trump's return In a year-end political conference, Kim, the North Korean leader, vowed to implement the 'toughest' anti-U.S. policy and criticized the Biden administration's efforts to strengthen security cooperation with Seoul and Tokyo, which he described as a 'nuclear military bloc for aggression.' North Korean state media did not specify Kim's policy plans or mention any specific comments about Trump. During his first term, Trump met Kim three times for talks on the North's nuclear program. Even if Trump returns to the White House, a quick resumption of diplomacy with North Korea could be unlikely. Kim's strengthened position — built on his expanded nuclear arsenal, deepening alliance with Russia and the weakening enforcement of U.S. international sanctions — presents new challenges to resolving the nuclear standoff, experts say. It's unclear whether Trump would be as active as Biden in strengthening U.S. alliances in Asia. During his first term, Trump complained about the cost of keeping 28,000 U.S. troops in South Korea to deter North Korean threats and constantly pushed for significant increases in Seoul's defense contributions. There are also concerns in Seoul that Trump's 'America first' approach would damage South Korean interests in trade through increased tariffs and other measures.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-says-north-korea-fired-a-ballistic-missile-into-the-sea-/7925611.html	2025-01-06T01:44:51-08:00	
Jimmy Carter raised climate change concerns 35 years before the Paris Accords	PLAINS, GEORGIA — When Jimmy Carter chose branding designs for his presidential campaign, he passed on the usual red, white and blue. He wanted green. Emphasizing how much the Georgia Democrat enjoyed nature and prioritized environmental policy, the color became ubiquitous. On buttons, bumper stickers, brochures, the sign rechristening the old Plains train depot as his campaign headquarters. Even the hometown Election Night party. 'The minute it was announced, we all had the shirts to put on — and they were green, too,' said LeAnne Smith, Carter’s niece, recalling the 1976 victory celebration. Nearly a half-century later, environmental advocates are remembering Carter, who died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100, as a president who elevated environmental stewardship, energy conservation and discussions about the global threat of rising carbon dioxide levels. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to abandon the renewable energy investments that President Joe Biden included in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, echoing how President Ronald Reagan dismantled the solar panels Carter installed on the White House roof. But politics aside, the scientific consensus has settled where Carter stood two generations earlier. 'President Carter was four decades ahead of his time,' said Manish Bapna, who leads the Natural Resources Defense Council. Carter called for cuts in greenhouse gas emissions well before 'climate change' was part of the American lexicon, he said. Wearing cardigans and setting standards Former Vice President Al Gore, whose climate advocacy earned him the 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, called Carter 'a lifelong role model for the entire environmental movement.' As president, Carter implemented the first U.S. efficiency standards for passenger vehicles and household appliances. He created the U.S. Department of Energy, which streamlined energy research, and more than doubled the wilderness area under National Park Service protection. Inviting ridicule, Carter asked Americans to conserve energy through personal sacrifice, including driving less and turning down thermostats in winter amid global fuel shortages. He pushed renewable energy to lessen dependence on fossil fuels, calling for 20% of U.S. energy to come from alternative sources by 2000. But laments linger about what 39th president could not get done or did not try before his landslide defeat to Ronald Reagan. Addressing climate change Carter left office in 1981 shortly after receiving a West Wing report linking fossil fuels to rising carbon dioxide levels in Earth’s atmosphere. Carter’s top environmental advisers urged 'immediate' cutbacks on the burning of fossil fuels to reduce what scientists at the time called 'carbon dioxide pollution.' 'Nobody anywhere in the world in a high government position was talking about this problem' before Carter, biographer Jonathan Alter said. The White House released the findings, which drew forgettable news coverage: The New York Times published its story on the 13th page of its front section. And with scant time left in office, there were no tangible moves Carter could make, beyond the energy legislation he had already signed. The report recommended limiting global average temperatures to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit) above preindustrial levels. Thirty-five years later, in the 2015 Paris climate accords, participating nations set a similar goal. 'If he had been reelected, it’s fair to say that we would have been beginning to address climate change in the early 1980s,' Alter told the AP. 'When you think about that, it adds a kind of a tragic dimension, almost, to his political defeat.' Reagan ended high-level conversations about carbon emissions. He opposed efficiency standards as government overreach and rolled back some regulations. His chief of staff, Don Regan, called the solar panels 'a joke.' Pursuing energy independence Despite Carter’s emphasis on renewable sources, the fossil fuel industry benefited from his push toward U.S. energy independence. Collin O’Mara, CEO of the National Wildlife Foundation, pointed to coal-fired power plants built during and shortly thereafter Carter’s term, and his deregulation of natural gas production, a move O'Mara called 'a precursor' to widespread fracking. Bapna noted Carter backed drilling off the coasts of Long Island in New York and New England. Steven Nadel, executive director of the American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy, pointed to Carter’s Synthetic Fuels Corporation, a short-lived effort to produce fossil fuel alternatives that 'would have meant much higher carbon emissions.' But Carter had the right priorities, especially on research and development coordinated through the Energy Department, Nadel said. 'He allowed us to have a national approach rather than one agency here and another there.' Stewarding God's creation Carter’s environmental interests had deep roots going back to a a rural boyhood filled with hunting and fishing and working his father’s farmland. 'Jimmy Carter was an environmentalist before it was a real part of the political discussion — and I’m not talking about solar panels on the White House,' said Dubose Porter, a longtime Georgia Democratic Party leader. 'Just focusing on that, misses how early and how committed he was.' His early years as a youth, influenced Carter as governor, Porter said, when he boosted Georgia's state parks system and opposed Georgia congressmen who wanted to dam a river. Carter paddled the waterway himself and decided its natural state trumped the lucrative federal construction proposal. In Washington, Carter continued sometimes unwinnable fights against funding for projects he deemed damaging and unnecessary. He found more success extending federal protection for more than 60.7 million hectares, including redwood forests in California and vast swaths of Alaska. Randall Balmer, a Dartmouth College professor who has written on Carter's faith, said he saw himself as a custodian of divinely granted natural resources. 'That’s a real connection that young evangelicals still have with him today,' Balmer said. Condemning consumerism Carter won the presidency amid energy shortages rooted in global strife, especially in the oil-rich Middle East, so national security and economic interests dovetailed with Carter’s religious beliefs and affinity for nature, Nadel noted. Carter compared the energy crisis to 'the moral equivalent of war,' and as inflation and gas lines grew, he called for individual sacrifice and sweeping action on renewable energy. 'Human identity is no longer defined by what one does, but by what one owns,' Carter warned in 1979. 'But we’ve discovered that owning things and consuming things does not satisfy our longing for meaning.' That 'malaise' speech — dubbed so by the media despite Carter not using the word — was unique in presidential politics for its condemnation of unchecked American consumerism. Carter celebrated that more than 100 million Americans watched. By 2010, Carter acknowledged in his annotated 'White House Diary' that his speech was a flop, but said it proved to be prescient for advocating bold and direct action on energy. 'You can say the Carter presidency is still producing results today,' said Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, whose 2020 presidential run focused on climate action. 'I’ve learned in politics that timing is everything and serendipity is everything.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-raised-climate-change-concerns-35-years-before-the-paris-accords-/7925609.html	2025-01-06T01:40:36-08:00	
Afghans arrive in the Philippines to complete visa processing for resettlement in US	MANILA, Philippines — A group of Afghan nationals arrived in the Philippines on Monday to process special immigrant visas for their resettlement in the United States, as part of an agreement between Manila and Washington. The Philippines agreed last July to temporarily host a U.S. immigrant visa processing center for a limited number of Afghan nationals aspiring to resettle in America. Department of Foreign Affairs spokesperson Teresita Daza said the Afghan nationals who landed in the Philippines on Monday were provided entry visas. She said they had completed extensive security vetting and undergone full medical screenings prior to their arrival. The U.S. government will cover the costs for the Afghan nationals' stay in the Philippines, including their food, housing, security, medical and transportation expenses, she said. She didn't specify how many Afghans arrived or how long the visa processing will take. Under the Philippines' rules, visa applicants can stay for no longer than 59 days. A senior Philippine official told The Associated Press last year that only 150 to 300 applicants would be accommodated in the Philippines under the 'one-time' deal. The official who had knowledge of the negotiations agreed to speak on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to speak publicly. The Afghan nationals seeking resettlement primarily worked for the U.S. government in Afghanistan or were deemed eligible for U.S. special immigrant visas but were left behind when Washington withdrew from the country and Taliban militants took back power in a chaotic period in 2021. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken first relayed the request to his Philippines counterpart in 2022, and President Joe Biden discussed the request with Philippines leader Ferdinand Marcos Jr. when he visited the U.S. last year, Philippine officials said. Marcos has rekindled relations with the U.S. since winning the presidency by a landslide margin two years ago. In February last year, he allowed an expansion of the American military presence under a 2014 defense agreement in a decision that upset China.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghans-arrive-in-the-philippines-to-complete-visa-processing-for-resettlement-in-us/7925603.html	2025-01-06T01:28:15-08:00	
Taiwan says cyberattacks double in 2024, China main culprit	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Chinese hackers were involved in most of the cyberattacks against Taiwan last year, which doubled to a daily average of 2.4 million, Taiwanese security officials said. China regards Taiwan as part of its territory and for years has been ramping up military, diplomatic and political pressure on the island to accept its claims of sovereignty. Taiwan says cyberattacks have also increased as Beijing uses a range of 'grayzone' methods to harass the islan— tactics that fall short of an act of war. Most of the daily attacks received by Taiwan's Government Service Network were attributed to China's 'cyber force,' the National Security Bureau said in a report on Sunday. Defense, telecommunications and transport were among the top targets, with many of the cyberattacks 'effectively detected and blocked,' it said. 'The growing numbers of attacks pinpoint the increasingly severe nature of China's hacking activities,' the report said. 'Its techniques have become increasingly sophisticated and covered a wide range of targets, such as government agencies, critical infrastructure and high-tech manufacturing industry.' Chinese hackers carried out Distributed Denial of Service attacks on Taiwan's transport and financial sectors when Beijing held military drills near the island, 'intending to intensify the harassment effect and military intimidation,' the bureau said. Several countries, notably the United States, have voiced alarm in recent years at what they say is hacking activity backed by Beijing targeting their governments, militaries and businesses. China has denied the allegations, previously insisting it opposes and cracks down on all forms of cyberattacks. Beijing last week rejected accusations that a China state-sponsored actor was behind a cyber breach at the U.S. Treasury Department, calling the claims 'groundless.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-cyberattacks-double-in-2024-china-main-culprit/7925596.html	2025-01-06T01:07:26-08:00	
Blinken: China, North Korea helping drive Russia’s war in Ukraine	U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said Monday that North Korea and China are the 'biggest ongoing drivers' allowing Russia to carry out its war in Ukraine, and that security assurances will need to be a part of potential future negotiations ending the conflict. Speaking during a visit to South Korea, Blinken said North Korean supplies of artillery, ammunition and troops, along with Chinese support for Russia’s military industrial base are giving the Russian military the backing it needs to continue carrying out the fight it started in February 2022. He said North Korea is already seeing a return on its involvement in the conflict in the form of Russian military equipment and training for North Korea troops. 'We believe it has the intent to share space and satellite technology with the DPRK,' Blinken said. With only two weeks left in the Biden administration, the United States has been rushing to send remaining authorized aid to Ukraine amid uncertainty about how President-elect Donald Trump may approach the war. Blinken said Monday the U.S. has been trying to make sure Ukraine has what it needs to defend itself, and to have the 'strongest possible hand' at a future negotiating table with Russia. 'If there is going to be, at some point, a ceasefire, it's not going to be, in Putin's mind, 'game over',' Blinken said. 'His imperial ambitions remain, and what he will seek to do is to rest, to refit, and eventually to re-attack.' Blinken said it is necessary to have an 'adequate deterrent in place so that he doesn't do that, so that he thinks twice – three times – before engaging in any re-aggression.' Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 79 of the 128 drones that Russian forces deployed overnight in attack targeting multiple Ukrainian regions. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Kirovohrad, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Officials in Cherkasy reported damage to residential buildings and a grain warehouse from falling drone debris. Russia’s Defense Ministry said it destroyed 12 Ukrainian aerial drones, all in areas along the Russia-Ukraine border. Vyacheslav Gladkov, governor of the Belgorod region, said the attacks injured three people and damaged several residential buildings.

US Congress to certify Trump’s election win	The U.S. Congress is set to meet Monday to certify Donald Trump’s presidential election victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. The vice president is in charge of presiding over the count of results from each of the country’s 50 states, putting Harris in the position of certifying her own loss. The procedure was long a formality in the election process, but four years ago turned to chaos as Trump supporters stormed the Capitol, injuring about 140 police officers, vandalizing the building and sending lawmakers rushing for safety. Similar scenes are not expected Monday, with Harris having conceded defeat and President Joe Biden highlighting the need for a peaceful process. Authorities have prepared just in case, erecting tall metal barriers around the Capitol complex. Speaking Sunday at the White House, Biden called what happened on Jan. 6, 2021 'one of the toughest days in American history.' 'We’ve got to get back to the basic, normal transfer of power,' Biden said. He added that Trump’s conduct four years ago, which included repeated false claims that he won the election, 'was a genuine threat to democracy.' 'I’m hopeful we’re beyond that now,' Biden said.

South Korean anti-corruption agency seeks police help in arresting impeached president	South Korea’s anti-corruption agency is seeking an extension of the arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, and for police to assist in so-far unsuccessful efforts to arrest Yoon. The warrant approved by a court last week to arrest Yoon was set to expire Monday afternoon. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials wants to question Yoon in response to the martial law decree he issued Dec. 3, which set off a political crisis in the country and quickly led to his impeachment. Investigators tried to execute the warrant last week, but hundreds of security forces blocked access to Yoon’s residence. The failure prompted the anti-corruption agency to try to enlist the help of the police to execute the warrant and arrest Yoon. Yoon’s lawyers have rejected the authority of the anti-corruption agency and called the arrest warrant unlawful. Some information for this report was provided by from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-anti-corruption-agency-seeks-police-help-in-arresting-impeached-president/7925541.html	2025-01-05T21:52:13-08:00	
The Brutalist,' 'Emilia Perez' triumph at Golden Globes	Two wildly audacious films — Brady Corbet's 215-minute postwar epic 'The Brutalist' and Jacques Audiard's Spanish language, genre-shifting trans musical 'Emilia Perez' — won top honors at the 82nd Golden Globes on Sunday. The Globes, which are still finding their footing after years of scandal and makeover, scattered awards around to a number of films. But the awards group put its strongest support behind a pair of movies that sought to be unlike anything else. 'The Brutalist' was crowned best film, drama, putting one of 2024’s most ambitious films on course to be a major contender at the Academy Awards. The film, shot in VistaVision and released with an intermission, also won best director for Corbet and best actor for Adrien Brody. 'I was told that this film was un-distributable,' said Corbet. 'No one was asking for a three-and-half-hour film about a mid-century designer in 70mm. But it works.' 'Emilia Perez' won best film, comedy or musical, elevating the Oscar chances of Netflix’s top Oscar contender. It also won best supporting actress for Zoe Saldaña, best song ('El Mal') and best non-English language film. Karla Sofia Gascon, the film's transgender star who plays a Mexican drug lord who undergoes gender-affirming surgery, spoke for the film. 'The light always wins over darkness,' said Gascon, gesturing to her brightly orange dress. 'You can maybe put us in jail. You can beat us up. But you never can take away our soul or existence or identity.' 'I am who I am. Not who you want.' The night's big actor winners included some surprises. One shocker was Moore's win for best actress in a comedy or musical. Her comeback performance in 'The Substance,' about a Hollywood star who resorts to an experimental process to regain her youth, landed the 62-year-old Moore her first Globe — a victory that came over the heavily favored Mikey Madison of 'Anora.' 'I’m just in shock right now. I’ve been doing this a long time, like over 45 years, and this is the first thing I’ve ever won as an actor,' said Moore, who was last nominated by the Globes for a film role in 1991 for 'Ghost.' 'Thirty years ago, I had a producer tell me that I was a popcorn actress.' Best actress, in a drama film, was a surprise, too. The Brazilian actress Fernanda Torres won for her performance in 'I’m Still Here,' a based-on-a-true-story drama about a family living through the disappearance of political dissident Rubens Paiva in 1970s Rio de Janeiro. Best supporting actor in a musical or comedy went to Sebastian Stan for another movie about physical transformation: 'A Different Man,' in which Stan plays a man with a deformed face who's healed. Stan, who was also nominated for playing Donald Trump in 'The Apprentice,' noted that both films were hard to get made. 'These are tough subject matters but these films are real and they're necessary,' said Stan. 'But we can't be afraid and look away.' Glaser lightly roasts the Globes Comedian Nikki Glaser kicked off the Globes, with a promise: 'I'm not here to roast you.' But Glaser, a stand-up whose breakthrough came in a withering roast of Tom Brady, made her way around the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on Sunday picking out plenty of targets in an opening monologue she had worked out extensively in comedy clubs beforehand. While Glaser might not have reached Tina Fey and Amy Poehler levels of laughs, the monologue was mostly a winner, and a dramatic improvement over last year’s host, Jo Koy. Last year's Globes, following a diversity and ethics scandal that led to the dissolution of the Hollywood Foreign Press Association, were widely panned, but delivered where it counted. Ratings rebounded to about 10 million viewers, according to Nielsen. CBS, who waded in after NBC dumped the Globes, signed up for five more years. Hosting the Globes two weeks before the inauguration of Donald Trump, Glaser reserved perhaps her most cutting line for the whole room of Hollywood stars. 'You could really do anything ... except tell the country who to vote for,' said Glaser. 'But it’s OK, you’ll get ’em next time ... if there is one. I’m scared.' The Globes are now owned by Todd Boehly’s Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions, which acquired the award show from the now defunct Hollywood Foreign Press Association. After diversity and ethics scandals, the HFPA sold off the Globes and dissolved. However, more than a dozen former HFPA members are seeking to have the sale to Eldridge Industries and Dick Clark Productions rescinded. A win for ‘Wicked’ The Globes' award for cinematic and box-office achievement went to Jon M. Chu's 'Wicked,' which has nearly collected $700 million in theaters. In a heavily arthouse Oscar field, 'Wicked' is easily the biggest hit seen as having a chance to win best picture. Accepting the award, Chu argued for 'a radical act of optimism' in art. Though few film awards have been predictable this season, Kieran Culkin is emerging as the clear favorite for best supporting actor. Culkin won Sunday for his performance in Jesse Eisenberg’s 'A Real Pain,' his second Globe in the past year following a win for the HBO series 'Succession.' He called the Globes 'basically the best date night that my wife and I ever have,' and then thanked her for 'putting up what you call my mania.' The papal thriller 'Conclave' took best screenplay, for Peter Straughan's script. 'Flow,' the wordless Latvian animated parable about a cat in a flooded world, took best animated film, winning over studio blockbusters like 'Inside Out 2' and 'The Wild Robot.' Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross won best score for their thumping music for 'Challengers.' TV prizes Most of the TV winners were oft-awarded series, including the Emmy champ 'Shogun.' It won four awards, including best drama series and acting wins for Hiroyuki Sanada, Anna Sawai and Tadanobu Asano. Other repeat winners were: 'Hacks' (best comedy series, actress for Jean Smart), 'The Bear' (Jeremy Allen White for best actor) and 'Baby Reindeer' (best limited series). Ali Wong won for best stand-up performance, Jodie Foster for 'True Detective' and Colin Farrell for his physical transformation in 'The Penguin.' 'I guess it's prosthetics from here on out,' said Farrell.	https://www.voanews.com/a/the-brutalist-emilia-perez-triumph-at-golden-globes/7925538.html	2025-01-05T21:45:44-08:00

Sunday school class with Jimmy Carter: What it was like	Plains, Georgia — It never got old. No matter how many times one crammed into the modest sanctuary at Maranatha Baptist Church, there was always some wisdom to be gleaned from the measured, Bible-inspired words of Jimmy Carter. This was another side of the 39th president, a down-to-earth man of steadfast faith who somehow found time to teach Sunday school classes when he wasn't building homes for the needy, or advocating for fair elections, or helping eradicate awful diseases. For young and old, straight and gay, believers and nonbelievers, Black and white and brown, Maranatha was a far-off-the-beaten path destination in southwest Georgia where Carter, well into his 90s, stayed connected with his fellow citizens of the world. Anyone willing to make the trek to his hometown of Plains, with its one blinking caution light and residents numbering in the hundreds, was rewarded with access to a white-haired man who once occupied the highest office in the land. Carter taught his Sunday school class roughly twice a month to accommodate crowds that sometimes swelled to more than 500. (On the other Sundays, no more than a couple dozen regulars and a handful of visitors usually attended services). Here, the former commander-in-chief and the onetime first lady, his wife of more than seven decades, were simply Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. And when it came to worshipping with them, all were welcome. Sundays with Mr. Jimmy Before the former president entered the sanctuary, with a bomb-sniffing dog outside and Secret Service agents scattered around, a strict set of rules would be laid out by Ms. Jan — Jan Williams, a longtime church member and friend of the Carters. She would have made quite a drill sergeant. It felt like a good-cop, bad-cop routine. Ms. Jan barking out rules you knew had come straight from Mr. Jimmy, who studied nuclear physics and approached all things with an engineer's orderly mind. Most important for those wanting a photo with the Carters — and nearly everyone did — you had to stay for the main 11 a.m. church service. Picture-taking began around noon. If you left the church grounds before that, there was no coming back. If you stayed, you followed rules. No autographs. No handshakes. No attempts at conversation beyond a brief 'good morning' or 'thank you.' Carter, consistently in sports jacket, slacks and bolo tie, would start his lesson by moving around the sanctuary, asking with a straight face if there were any visitors — that always got a laugh — and where they were from. In my many trips to Maranatha, I'm sure I heard all 50 states, not to mention an array of far-flung countries. If anyone answered Washington, D.C., the answer was predictable. 'I used to live there,' the one-term president would say, breaking into that toothy grin. Carter's Bible lessons focused on central themes: God gives life, loves unconditionally and provides the freedom to live a completely successful life. But the lesson usually began with an anecdote about what he'd been up to or his perspective on world affairs. Carter could talk about building homes with Habitat for Humanity or bemoan U.S. conflicts since World War II. He could talk about his work with The Elders, a group of former world leaders, or a trip out West to go trout fishing with Ted Turner. He could talk about The Carter Center's successes in eliminating the guinea worm, or his long friendships with Willie Nelson and Bob Dylan. 'Willie Nelson is an old friend. He used to come visit me in the White House,' Carter related once, touching ever so gently on Nelson's affection for weed. 'I don't know what Willie and my children did after I went to bed. I've heard rumors,' the former president said, with a sly grin and a wink that suggested he believed every word. My favorite: Carter telling of his latest book project and how he had long used encyclopedias for research. Carter decided the collection was taking up too much space, so he boxed it up and headed out to local schools and libraries, figuring someone would eagerly take a donation from an ex-president. Instead, he got a standard refrain: Sorry, no one uses encyclopedias anymore. I recall the punchline. 'How do I look up things now?' asked the man born five years after World War I ended. Pause. Then: 'Google.' Memories of visits During most of my visits to Maranatha, Carter spoke for 45 minutes without sitting down. His mind remained sharp, with only an occasional glance at the notes tucked inside his Bible, but his body became more and more feeble as he moved deeper into his 90s. He talked openly about the ravages of aging. He resisted church members' pleadings to take a seat while teaching. I was there the first time he tried it, in August 2018. 'I'm uncomfortable sitting down,' he said, 'but I guess I'll get used to it.' Not that time. Carter sat for less than 10 minutes before rising. He stood at the table for the rest of class. Returning the following year, Carter had relented to using a white, remote-controlled chair. After climbing aboard — voilà — a flick of a switch would slowly lift him above the lectern, visible even to those sitting in the back. If there wasn't enough room in the sanctuary, rows of folding chairs were set up in the fellowship hall and a handful of tiny classrooms. Carter's lesson would be shown on TVs linked to a feed from the main room. A letdown for visitors? Perhaps. But relegation to a back room had its benefits. Carter, who usually arrived about 15 minutes before the start of his 10 a.m. lesson, would swing by these rooms before heading to the sanctuary. He would even take a few questions, which didn't happen in front of the big crowd. After a 2018 profile by The Washington Post told of the Carters having regular Saturday night dinners at friend Jill Stuckey's house, which included one glass each of 'bargain-brand Chardonnay,' I asked Carter how many glasses of wine he'd had the night before. 'I'll say one,' Carter replied with a sly grin. Stuckey, standing behind him, shook her head and held up two fingers. No matter where you sat — main sanctuary or back room — everyone got their picture taken with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn. For many, this seemed the biggest reward. When we first started attending, those pictures were taken under a tree just outside the church. After being diagnosed with cancer in 2015, Carter and his wife would pose with visitors inside the sanctuary. Carter liked to joke about what a burden it was to sit for all those pictures, which surely numbered in the hundreds of thousands. 'I'll be delighted to have photographs made with all of you,' he quipped after one of his final lessons. 'Actually, since I'm in church, I better say I'll be willing to have photographs made with all of you.' For my family, those pictures show a son growing from boy to man with Mr. Jimmy and Ms. Rosalynn filling out the frames. What a treasure they are. The final lesson Turnout for Carter's Sunday school lessons dipped during the Great Recession. But the crowds returned after his cancer announcement, with some folks lining up outside the church the night before. Carter declared himself cancer-free, but other health challenges began to catch up with him. After an October 2019 fall at his home left him with a slightly fractured pelvis, the church announced Carter would not teach his next class on Nov. 3, a lesson we had planned to attend. Disappointed, we canceled our hotel reservation. But Mr. Jimmy wasn't done just yet. The church had canceled without checking with him. He made it clear that he was NOT cancelling. We quickly rebooked. Carter's lesson that day, based on the Book of Job, was especially poignant in retrospect. 'I'm going to start by asking you a very profound question,' he said. 'How many of you believe in life after death?' Carter conceded to having doubts for most of his life, right up to being stricken by cancer, which finally erased any skepticism. When the end on this world came, he would be ready. 'We don't have anything to dread after death,' Carter said with a reassuring smile. At the end of his lesson, he challenged everyone to do one good deed for a stranger. 'I'm going to hold you to it,' Carter promised. He never got the chance. His health continued to decline, sidelining him through the Christmas season. Then, the COVID-19 pandemic shut down the world in 2020. By that summer, it was clear that Mr. Jimmy's treasured role as spreader of the gospel, which he began at 18 and resumed after his presidency, was over.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sunday-school-class-with-jimmy-carter-what-it-was-like/7925467.html	2025-01-05T16:54:01-08:00	
TikTok creators in US left in limbo while awaiting decision on potential platform ban	Will TikTok in the U.S. be banned this month? That's the pressing question keeping creators and small business owners in anxious limbo as they await a decision that could upend their livelihoods. The fate of the popular app will be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court, which will hear arguments on Jan. 10 over a law requiring TikTok to break ties with its Chinese-based parent company, ByteDance, or face a U.S. ban. At the heart of the case is whether the law violates the First Amendment with TikTok and its creator allies arguing that it does. The U.S. government, which sees the platform as a national security risk, says it does not. For creators, the TikTok doomsday scenarios are nothing new since President-elect Donald Trump first tried to ban the platform through executive order during his first term. But despite Trump's recent statements indicating he now wants TikTok to stick around, the prospect of a ban has never been as immediate as it is now with the Supreme Court serving as the final arbiter. If the government prevails as it did in a lower court, TikTok says it would shut down its U.S. platform by Jan. 19, leaving creators scrambling to redefine their futures. 'A lot of my other creative friends, we're all like freaking out. But I'm staying calm,' said Gillian Johnson, who benefited financially from TikTok's live feature and rewards program, which helped creators generate higher revenue potential by posting high-quality original content. The 22-year-old filmmaker and recent college graduate uses her TikTok earnings to help fund her equipment for projects such as camera lens and editing software for her short films 'Gambit' and 'Awaken! My Neighbor.' Johnson said the idea of TikTok going away is 'hard to accept.' Many creators have taken to TikTok to voice their frustrations, grappling with the possibility that the platform they've invested so much in could soon disappear. Online communities risk being disrupted, and the economic fallout could especially be devastating for those who mainly depend on TikTok and have left full-time jobs to build careers and incomes around their content. For some, the uncertainty has led them to question whether to continue creating content at all, according to Johnson, who says she knows creators who have been thinking about quitting. But Nicla Bartoli, the vice president of sales at The Influencer Marketing Factory, said the creators she has interreacted with have not been too worried since news about a potential TikTok ban has come up repeatedly over the years, and then died down. 'I believe a good chunk think it is not going to happen,' said Bartoli, whose agency works to pair influencers and brands. It's unclear how quickly the Supreme Court will issue a decision. But the court could act swiftly to block the law from going into effect if at least five of the nine justices deem it unconstitutional. Trump, for his part, has already asked the justices to put a pause on the ban so he could weigh in after he takes office. In a brief — written by his pick for solicitor general — Trump called the First Amendment implications of a TikTok ban 'sweeping and troubling' and said he wants a 'negotiated resolution' to the issue, something the Biden administration had pursued to no avail. While waiting for the dust to settle in Washington, some creators are exploring alternatives ways to promote themselves or their business, encouraging users to follow them on other social media platforms or are investing more time producing non-TikTok content. Johnson says she is already strategizing her next move and exploring alternative opportunities. While she hasn't found a place quite like TikTok, she's begun to spend more of her time on other platforms, such as Instagram and YouTube, both of whom are expected to benefit financially if TikTok vanishes. According to a report by Goldman Sachs, the so-called creator economy, which has been fueled in part by TikTok, could be worth $480 billion by 2027. Because the opportunity to monetize content exists across a range of platforms, a vast amount of creators have already diversified their social media presence. However, many TikTok creators have credited the platform — and its algorithm — with giving them a type of exposure they did not receive on other platforms. Some say it has also boosted and provided opportunities for creators of color and those from other marginalized groups. Despite fears about the fate of TikTok, industry analysts note creators are generally avoiding making any big changes, like abandoning platform, until something actually happens. 'I'm anxious but also trying to be hopeful in a weird way,' said Brandon Hurst, who credits TikTok with rescuing his business from obscurity and propelling it into rapid growth. A year after joining TikTok, the 30-year-old Hurst, who sells plants, said his sales doubled, outpacing the traction he'd struggled to gain on Instagram. He built his clientele through the live feature on TikTok, which has helped him sell more than 77,000 plants. The business has thrived so much that he says he now employs five people, including his husband and mom. 'For me, this has been my sole way of doing business,' Hurst said. Billion Dollar Boy, a New York-based influencer marketing agency, has advised creators to download all of their TikTok content into a personal portfolio, which is especially important for those who post primarily on the platform, said Edward East, the agency's founder and group CEO. This can help them quickly build their audiences elsewhere. Plus, it can serve as a resume for brands who might want to partner with them for product advertisements, East said. But until the deadline of Jan. 19 comes around, East said creators should continue to post regularly on TikTok, which has 170 million monthly U.S. users and remains highly effective in reaching audiences. If the Supreme Court does not delay the ban, as Trump is asking them to do, app stores and internet service providers would be required to stop providing service to TikTok by Jan. 19. That means anyone who doesn't have TikTok on their phone would be unable to download it. TikTok users would continue to have access, but the prohibitions — which will prevent them from updating the app — will eventually make the app 'unworkable,' the Justice Department has said. TikTok said in court documents that it estimates a one-month shutdown would cause the platform to lose approximately a third of its daily users in the U.S. The company argues a shutdown, even if temporary, will cause it irreparable harm, a legal bar used by judges to determine whether to put the brakes on a law facing a challenge. In under three weeks, Americans will know if the Supreme Court agrees.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tiktok-creators-in-us-left-in-limbo-while-awaiting-decision-on-potential-platform-ban/7925460.html	2025-01-05T16:45:26-08:00	
Heavy snow brings widespread disruptions across UK, Germany	London — Heavy snow and freezing rain brought widespread disruptions across Europe on Sunday, particularly in the U.K. and Germany, with several major airports forced to suspend flights. With the weather set to stay inclement on Sunday in the U.K., there are concerns that many rural communities, particularly in the north of England, could be cut off, with up to 40 centimeters (15 inches) of snow on the ground above 300 meters (985 feet). The National Grid, which oversees the country's electricity network, said it had been working to restore power after outages across the country. Power cuts were reported in the English cities of Birmingham and Bristol, and Cardiff, Wales. Many sporting events have already been postponed, though the heavyweight Premier League fixture between rivals Liverpool and Manchester United is on, following an inspection at Liverpool's Anfield stadium and of local conditions. Liverpool's John Lennon Airport and Manchester Airport had to close runways overnight, but operations were returning back to normal Sunday. Leeds Bradford Airport took longer to get flights back in the air. The road network was heavily impacted too on what would have been a very busy day with many families returning home from the Christmas and New Year's break, and students heading back to universities. Many roads had been preemptively closed by local authorities, but stranded vehicles and collisions have caused disruption elsewhere. Several U.K. train services were canceled, with National Rail warning of disruptions continuing into the workweek. Britain's main weather forecaster, the Met Office, says sleet and snow will continue to push north Sunday and will be heaviest in northern England and into southern Scotland. After experiencing freezing rain, which occurs when super-cold rain freezes on impact, the south will turn milder. The Environment Agency has also issued eight flood warnings across southern England on the Taw and Avon rivers. Snow and ice were also causing havoc in Germany, where a bout of wintry weather is spreading from the southwest. Authorities have issued black ice warnings for drivers and pedestrians, advising people to stay home where possible. Frankfurt airport canceled 120 of its 1,090 planned takeoffs and landings Sunday, according to the Fraport press office. At Munich airport, only one runway was open while the other one was being cleared. In Baden-Wuerttemberg, eight people were injured when a bus skidded off the road near the town of Hemmingen. Long-distance train connections also experienced irregularities in the Frankfurt area.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-snow-brings-widespread-disruptions-across-uk-germany/7925447.html	2025-01-05T16:12:58-08:00	
Nun from Brazil tops list of world's oldest living person at nearly 117	A soccer-loving nun from Brazil is believed to have become the world's oldest living person at nearly 117 following the recent death of a woman from Japan. Sister Inah Canabarro was so skinny growing up that many didn't think she would survive childhood, Cleber Canabarro, her 84-year-old nephew, told The Associated Press. LongeviQuest, an organization that tracks supercentenarians around the globe, released a statement on Saturday declaring the wheelchair-bound nun the world's oldest person validated by early life records. In a video shot by the organization last February, the smiling Canabarro can be seen cracking jokes, sharing miniature paintings she used to make of wildflowers and reciting the Hail Mary prayer. The secret to longevity? Her Catholic faith, she says. 'I'm young, pretty and friendly — all very good, positive qualities that you have too,' the Teresian nun tells the visitors to her retirement home in the southern Brazilian city of Porto Alegre. Her nephew spends time with her every Saturday and sends her voice messages between visits to keep her spirits up following two hospitalizations that left her weak, with difficulty talking. 'The other sisters say she gets a jolt when she hears my voice,' he says. 'She gets excited.' Canabarro was born on June 8, 1908, to a large family in southern Brazil, according to LongeviQuest researchers. But her nephew said her birth was registered two weeks late and she was actually born on May 27. Her great-grandfather was a famed Brazilian general who took up arms during the turbulent period following Brazil's independence from Portugal in the 19th century. She took up religious work still a teenager and spent two years in Montevideo, Uruguay, before moving to Rio de Janeiro and eventually settling in her home state of Rio Grande do Sul. A lifelong teacher, among her former students was Gen. Joao Figueiredo, the last of the military dictators who governed Brazil between 1964 and 1985. She was also the beloved creator of two marching bands at schools in sister cities straddling the border between Uruguay and Brazil. For her 110th birthday, she was honored by Pope Francis. She is the second oldest nun ever documented, after Lucile Randon, who was the world's oldest person until her death in 2023 at the age of 118. Local soccer club Inter — which was founded after Canabarro's birth — celebrates every year the birthday of its oldest fan. Her room is decorated with gifts in the team's red and white colors, says her nephew. 'White or black, rich or poor, whoever you are, Inter is the team of the people,' she says in one video posted on social media celebrating her 116th birthday with the club's president. Canabarro took the title of the oldest living person following the death of Japan's Tomiko Itooka in December, according to LongeviQuest. She now ranks as the 20th oldest documented person to have ever lived, a list topped by Frenchwoman Jeanne Calment, who died in 1997 at the age of 122, according to LongeviQuest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nun-from-brazil-tops-list-of-world-s-oldest-living-person-at-nearly-117/7925444.html	2025-01-05T16:02:42-08:00	
Central US pummeled by snow, ice as major storm heads east	Washington — Dangerous wintry conditions descended Sunday on a large swath of the central United States as a severe storm system tracked eastward, prompting travel and work disruptions from Kansas City to Washington. Around a dozen states from Kansas to New Jersey were under winter storm warnings Sunday afternoon, according to the National Weather Service (NWS), while areas across the U.S. South faced possible tornado and cold weather threats. Nationwide, over 60 million people were under some sort of weather alert, according to broadcaster CNN, while air traffic monitoring site FlightAware showed almost 2,200 flight cancellations and over 25,000 delays. Gusty winds from the storm system, the first of the year, brought blizzard conditions to Kansas and Missouri, while states farther east were blanketed in multiple inches of snow. Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear implored residents to 'please stay home' after reporting multiple vehicle crashes had closed a major highway. The NWS also warned that accumulations of up to a half inch of ice in some areas — as well as widespread tree damage from powerful wind gusts — could lead to 'prolonged power outages.' A mix of freezing rain, sleet and snow began hitting Kansas early Sunday morning. Storm chaser Brian Emfinger said on X that roads around Kansas City were 'a skating rink.' Video posted by the Weather Channel showed cars skidding off ice-coated highways and tractor trailers jack-knifing in Kansas, where some areas were expecting more than 30 centimeters of snow. 'Areas of heavy snow will spread eastward through the Ohio Valley and central Appalachians tonight, reaching the northern Mid-Atlantic by Monday morning,' the NWS said in an update. Areas around Washington could see up to 25 centimeters overnight from Sunday into Monday, making 'hazardous travel and closings' likely, The Washington Post reported. That could complicate the task of U.S. lawmakers, who by constitutional mandate must meet on Capitol Hill on Jan. 6 to certify the winner of last year's presidential election. 'Whether we're in a blizzard or not,' House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Fox News Sunday, 'we cannot delay that certification... I hope we have full attendance.' A joint session is to convene at 1:00 pm (1800 GMT) on Monday. Bitter cold With the jet stream diving southward, temperatures are expected to plunge, in some places to minus 18 degrees Celsius, while strong wind gusts compound the dangers. The mercury could sink tens of degrees below seasonal norms down to the U.S. Gulf Coast. Before then, severe thunderstorms are expected across the lower Mississippi Valley, the NWS forecast. Another major concern is freezing rain and sleet. A thick coating of ice could make travel hazardous, bring down trees and topple electricity lines. The NWS predicted more than 1 centimeter of freezing rain over parts of the Middle Mississippi and Ohio Valley area, and warned that 'long-lasting power outages' could leave millions of customers without power from Kansas to the central Appalachian Mountains. Conditions could prove especially perilous in Appalachia, where a deadly hurricane in late September devastated communities and ravaged multiple southeastern states including Kentucky. The new storm 'will likely cause significant disruption and dangerous conditions on our roads and could cause significant power outages just 24 hours or so before it's going to get really cold in Kentucky,' Governor Andy Beshear told an emergency meeting. The governors of Kentucky, Missouri and Virginia have declared a state of emergency in their states, and have taken to social media to warn residents to stay home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-us-pummeled-by-snow-ice-as-major-storm-heads-east/7925209.html	2025-01-05T15:50:59-08:00	
Israel helps ex-soldier leave Brazil over probe of alleged war crimes in Gaza	Jerusalem — Israel has helped a former soldier leave Brazil after legal action was initiated against him by a group accusing Israelis of war crimes in the Gaza Strip based in part on soldiers' social media posts. Israel’s Foreign Ministry said Sunday it had helped the former soldier safely leave Brazil on a commercial flight after what it described as 'anti-Israel elements' who sought an investigation last week. It warned Israelis against posting on social media about their military service. The Hind Rajab Foundation, named for a 5-year-old Palestinian girl killed in Gaza, said Brazilian authorities had launched an investigation into the soldier after it filed a complaint based on video footage, geolocation data and photographs showing him taking part in the demolition of civilian homes. The foundation described the move as a 'pivotal step toward accountability for crimes committed in Gaza' during nearly 15 months of war. There was no immediate comment from Brazilian authorities. Brazilian media reported Saturday that the investigation was ordered by an on-call federal judge in Brazil’s Federal District. The decision was issued on Dec. 30 but first reported over the weekend. Israel has faced heavy international criticism over its war against Hamas in Gaza, with the International Criminal Court issuing arrest warrants for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister. The International Court of Justice is separately investigating genocide allegations. The Brazil case raised the prospect that rank-and-file Israeli troops could also face prosecution while abroad. Israel rejects the international allegations, saying its forces in Gaza are acting in accordance with international law and that any violations are punished within its judicial systems. It blames Hamas for civilian deaths, saying the militant group conceals tunnels and other infrastructure in residential buildings, necessitating their demolition. Throughout the war, Israeli soldiers have posted numerous videos from Gaza that appear to show them rummaging through homes and blowing up or burning residential buildings. In some, they chant racist slogans or boast about destroying the Palestinian territory. The war began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 hostages are still inside Gaza, at least a third are believed to be dead. Israel’s offensive has killed over 45,800 Palestinians in Gaza, according to local health officials. They say women and children make up over half the dead but do not distinguish between civilians and militants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-helps-ex-soldier-leave-brazil-over-probe-of-alleged-war-crimes-in-gaza/7925201.html	2025-01-05T15:37:58-08:00	
Ecuador's ex-VP Glas evacuated from prison after attempted killing, lawyer says	GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador — Ecuador's former Vice President Jorge Glas has been evacuated from prison after an attempt on his life, his lawyer said Sunday, blaming the government for the situation. Sonia Gabriela Vera called for the United Nations and other international organizations to intervene after what she called an 'attempted assassination' of Glas in La Roca prison. The attack 'is the result of a State that has condemned him to danger, torture and slow death,' Vera said on social media platform X, commenting on a post that claimed Glas had been taken from the prison amid a threat on his life from mutinying prisoners. 'His emergency evacuation confirms what we have denounced time and again: they are deliberately playing with his life,' Vera added. 'If anything happens to him, it will be a crime of the State.' Ecuador's SNAI prisons agency did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Glas was detained in April after Ecuadorean security forces stormed Mexico's Embassy in Quito, where he was holed up after seeking asylum. While Glas' supporters say the arrest is politically motivated, the ex-vice president has been convicted for corruption on two other occasions. Glas also faces charges of misusing funds collected to aid reconstruction of coastal Manabi province after a devastating 2016 earthquake.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ecuador-ex-vp-glas-evacuated-from-prison-after-attempted-killing-lawyer-says/7925198.html	2025-01-05T15:03:26-08:00	
Mali rebels: Army, Russian fighters killed 9 civilians in car attack	Nine civilians including women and children were killed in an attack on a vehicle in Mali's Segou region last week, a civil society group and a rebel coalition said late Saturday, accusing the army and Russian mercenaries of being responsible. The vehicle was traveling from the town of Niono to a refugee camp in Mauritania on Thursday when it came under fire, said Mohamed Elmaouloud Ramadane, spokesperson for the coalition of Tuareg groups that are fighting for an independent homeland in northern Mali. He and local civil society association Kal Akal said Malian armed forces and allied fighters from Russia's Wagner private military contractor group had carried out the attack. In a separate statement, the head of Kel Ansar, one of the largest Tuareg groups, called for an investigation but said Malian troops were not behind the bloodshed. The Malian army did not respond to a request for comment. Wagner could not immediately be reached. Wagner fighters have been in Mali since the army seized power in two coups in 2020 and 2021 and kicked out French and U.N. troops. They have been supporting Malian forces in their battle with Islamist insurgents and the Tuareg separatists. In December, Human Rights Watch said Mali's armed forces, supported by Wagner, and Islamist armed groups had committed serious abuses against civilians in violation of the laws of the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-rebels-army-russian-fighters-killed-9-civilians-in-car-attack/7925194.html	2025-01-05T14:40:07-08:00	
Viola Davis, Ted Danson celebrated in film and TV at Golden Globes event	Beverly Hills, California — Viola Davis' journey to becoming one of Hollywood's most revered actors was driven by a straightforward mantra: Embrace every role, using each as a paycheck and a chance to explore new characters while honing her skills. Davis delivered a moving, 16-minute speech while accepting the prestigious Cecil B. DeMille Award at the Golden Gala: An Evening of Excellence on Friday night. She reflected on how her turbulent upbringing fueled her passion for acting as an escape and how financial necessity often influenced her choice of roles. 'If I waited for a role that was written for me, well crafted, then I wouldn't be standing up here,' said Davis, who along with Ted Danson, recipient of the Carol Burnett Award, were celebrated for their career achievements in film and television during a star-studded, black-tie gala dinner in Beverly Hills, California, just two nights before the 82nd annual Golden Globes on Sunday. Some of the popular names in attendance included Carol Burnett, Jane Fonda, Anthony Anderson, Steve Guttenberg and singer-songwriter Kenneth 'Babyface' Edmonds. It's the first time the Globes hosted a separate event dedicated to both awards. Davis said she couldn't afford to wait for the perfect role, especially as a 'dark-skinned Black woman with a wide nose and big lips.' 'So I took it for the money,' said Davis, who won praise for a string of compelling characters in films such as 'Fences,' 'The Woman King,' 'The Help' and 'Ma Rainey's Black Bottom' while captivating TV audiences through the legal thriller drama 'How to Get Away with Murder.' 'I don't believe that poverty is really the answer to craft,' she said. 'I don't think there's any nobility in poverty.' Meryl Streep presented the award to Davis, who she called a pure artist who 'delivers the truth every time.' Both actors worked together in the 2008 film 'Doubt,' where Streep first became in awe of Davis, who she called her 'favorite actor in the world.' The DeMille Award has been bestowed on Hollywood's greatest talents. Past recipients include Tom Hanks, Jeff Bridges, Oprah Winfrey, Morgan Freeman, Streep, Barbra Streisand and Sidney Poitier. When Danson accepted his award, he congratulated Davis, calling her an 'amazing actor.' 'It's such a pleasure to be in the same room with you,' said Danson, a three-time Globes winner, who has been a fixture on TV since he broke out as Boston bartender Sam Malone on NBC's comedy 'Cheers.' His other credits include 'The Good Place,' 'Mr. Mayor,' 'Fargo,' 'CSI' and 'CSI: Cyber,' 'Damages' and 'Becker.' Danson currently stars in Netflix's 'A Man on the Inside,' which earned his first nomination since 2008 and 13th overall. 'Bia Iftikhar, who does his hair on set, said it best: 'Ted sets the tone,'' said his wife, actor Mary Steenburgen, who presented Danson with the Carol Burnett Award, which was inaugurated in 2019. Past recipients include Norman Lear, Ryan Murphy and Ellen DeGeneres. The first was Burnett herself. Danson and Steenburgen appeared in a few projects together including 'Pontiac Moon,' 'Gulliver's Travels' and 'It Must Be Love.' 'He's so loving and takes such joy in acting that all of us who are hard at work away from our families for long hours get to work on a set that is dictated by his kindness,' Steenburgen said. 'As his wife, watching the respect and love ... for Ted, it made me very proud.' Danson traded 'I love you' with Burnett, showing admiration for each other. He thanked a number of writers, producers and actors along with the 'Cheers' co-creators Glen and Les Charles, who surprised him by showing up to the event. 'I feel so grateful,' he said. 'I'm truly the luckiest... on Earth.' Davis quipped, 'Little Viola is squealing,' referring to how her younger self would be overjoyed at the actor's journey from an impoverished childhood to Hollywood stardom. 'She's standing behind me and she's pulling on my dress,' said Davis, who achieved EGOT status after winning a Grammy last year for best audio book, narration, and storytelling for the recording for her memoir 'Finding Me.' 'She's wearing the same red rubber boots that she wore rain or shine because they her feel 'purty'' she continued. 'What she's whispering is: 'I told you I was a magician.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/viola-davis-ted-danson-celebrated-in-film-and-tv-at-golden-globes-event/7925189.html	2025-01-05T14:29:55-08:00	
Thousands in Montenegro demand ouster of security officials over mass shooting	Podgorica, Montenegro — Several thousand people rallied in Montenegro on Sunday demanding the resignations of top security officials over the shooting earlier this week that left 12 people dead, including two children. Chanting 'Resignations' and 'Killers,' protesters outside the Interior Ministry building in the capital, Podgorica, demanded that Interior Minister Danilo Saranovic and Deputy Prime Minister for Security and Defense Aleksa Becic step down. Milo Perovic, from a student-led group that helped organize the rally, told the crowd that innocent people died during their watch. 'You failed to protect us, so resign!' Perovic said. Hours earlier, hundreds of people held 12 minutes of silence for the 12 victims at a rally in Cetinje, Montenegro's historic capital where the shooting took place Wednesday. It was the second such massacre in the town in less than three years. Many residents of Cetinje and other Montenegrins believe that police mishandled the situation and haven't done enough to boost security since the first massacre, which happened in August 2022. Wednesday's shooting resulted from a bar brawl. A 45-year-old local man went home to get his gun before returning to the bar and opening fire. He killed four people there and eight more at various other locations before killing himself. The massacre fueled concerns about the level of violence in Montenegrin society, which is politically divided. It also raised questions about the readiness of state institutions to tackle the problems, including gun ownership. Police have said the shooting was impossible to predict and prevent, though the gunman, identified as Aco Martinovic, had been convicted for violent behavior and illegal weapons possession. His victims were mostly friends and family. Montenegrin authorities swiftly announced a new, strict gun law and other tough measures to curb illegal weapons, which are abundant in the Balkan nation of around 620,000 people. On Sunday, police said they raided several locations in the country and confiscated about 20 weapons, more than 500 rounds of ammunition and explosives. Protesters in Cetinje and Podgorica also demanded a 'demilitarization' of the population through the destruction of illegal weapons, high taxes on gun ownership and a moratorium on new licenses while existing ones are reconsidered under strict criteria. The attacker in 2022 in Cetinje gunned down 10 people, including two children, before he was shot and killed by a passerby. Maja Gardasevic, a protest organizer, said during the rally in Cetinje that 'we came here looking for answers' to several questions. 'Why did a massacre happen in Cetinje for the second time?' Gardasevic asked. 'Why is no one responsible? Why is it so hard to resign?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-in-montenegro-demand-ouster-of-security-officials-over-mass-shooting/7925181.html	2025-01-05T13:59:11-08:00	
Driving into Manhattan? It'll cost you; new congestion toll starts Sunday	NEW YORK — New York’s new toll for drivers entering the center of Manhattan debuted Sunday, meaning many people will pay $9 to access the busiest part of the Big Apple during peak hours. The toll, known as congestion pricing, is meant to reduce traffic gridlock in the densely packed city while also raising money to help fix its ailing public transit infrastructure. Drivers of most passenger cars will pay $9 to enter Manhattan south of Central Park on weekdays between 5 a.m. and 9 p.m. and on weekends between 9 a.m. and 9 p.m. During off hours, the toll will be $2.25 for most vehicles. After years of studies, delays and a last-ditch bid by New Jersey to halt the toll, the program launched without major hiccups early Sunday. But transit officials cautioned the first-in-the-nation scheme could require adjustments — and likely would not get its first true test until the workweek. 'This is a toll system that has never been tried before in terms of complexity,' Metropolitan Transportation Authority Chair and CEO Janno Lieber said at a news conference held at Grand Central Terminal Sunday. 'We don’t expect New Yorkers to overnight change their behavior. Everybody’s going to have to adjust to this.' The fee — which varies for motorcyclists, truck drivers and ride-share apps — will be collected by electronic toll collection systems at over 100 detection sites now scattered across the lower half of Manhattan. It comes on top of tolls drivers pay for crossing various bridges and tunnels to get to the city in the first place, although there will be a credit of up to $3 for those who have already paid to enter Manhattan via certain tunnels during peak hours. On Sunday morning, hours after the toll went live, traffic moved briskly along the northern edge of the congestion zone at 60th Street and 2nd Avenue. Many motorists appeared unaware that the newly activated cameras, set along the arm of a steel gantry above the street, would soon send a new charge to their E-Z Passes. 'Are you kidding me?' said Chris Smith, a realtor from Somerville, New Jersey, as he drove against traffic beneath the cameras, circumventing the charge. 'Whose idea was this? Kathy Hochul? She should be arrested for being ignorant.' Some residents and transit riders, meanwhile, said they were hopeful the program would lessen the bottlenecks and frequent honking in their neighborhoods, while helping to modernize the subway system. 'I think the idea would be good to try to minimize the amount of traffic down and try to promote people to use public transportation,' said Phil Bauer, a surgeon who lives in midtown Manhattan, describing the constant din of traffic in his neighborhood as 'pretty brutal.' President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, has vowed to kill the program when he takes office, but it’s unclear if he will follow through. The plan had stalled during his first term while it waited on a federal environmental review. In November, Trump, whose namesake Trump Tower is in the toll zone, said congestion pricing 'will put New York City at a disadvantage over competing cities and states, and businesses will flee.' Lieber, the MTA head, said he was not overly concerned that the president-elect would succeed in unwinding the program, even if he did follow through. 'I think he understands living on 59th and 5th Avenue what traffic is doing to our city,' Lieber said Sunday. Other big cities around the world, including London and Stockholm, have similar congestion pricing schemes, but it is the first in the U.S. Proponents of the idea note the programs were largely unpopular when first implemented, gaining approval as the public felt benefits like faster bus speeds and less traffic. In New York City, even some transit riders voiced skepticism of a plan intended to raise much-needed funds for the subway system. 'With my experience of the MTA and where they’ve allocated their funds in the past, they’ve done a pretty poor job with that,' said Christakis Charalambides, a supervisor in the fashion industry, as he waited for a subway Sunday morning in Lower Manhattan. 'I don’t know if I necessarily believe it until I really see something.' The toll was supposed to go into effect last year with a $15 charge, but Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul abruptly paused the program before the 2024 election, when congressional races in suburban areas around the city — the epicenter of opposition to the program — were considered to be vital to her party’s effort to retake control of Congress. Not long after the election, Hochul rebooted the plan at the lower $9 toll. She denies politics were at play and said she thought the original $15 charge was too much, though she had been a vocal supporter of the program before halting it. Congestion pricing also survived several lawsuits seeking to block the program, including a last-ditch effort from the state of New Jersey to have a judge put up a temporary roadblock against it. New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, has vowed to continue fighting against the scheme. In response, Lieber described the New Jersey governor’s views as the 'definition of hypocrisy,' adding that he expected the state to adjust its strategy after 'losing again and again and again' in court.	https://www.voanews.com/a/driving-into-manhattan-it-ll-cost-you-new-congestion-toll-starts-sunday/7925179.html	2025-01-05T13:52:13-08:00

M23 rebels seize key town in eastern DRC	Kinshasa, DRC — Rwanda-backed M23 rebels have seized a strategic eastern town near the provincial capital Goma in the Democratic Republic of Congo, local politicians said Sunday. The Tutsi-led M23 group has been waging a renewed insurgency in eastern Congo since 2022. Congo and the United Nations accuse neighboring Rwanda of backing the group with its own troops and weapons. Rwanda says it has taken what it calls defensive measures. Fighting has flared in recent weeks, leading to territorial gains for M23, which is now in control of Masisi, a town and local administrative center about 80 km (50 miles) from Goma, provincial parliament member Alexis Bahunga told Reuters. 'The government will take measures to restore state authority over the entire territory,' he said. Another parliamentary deputy, Jean-Pierre Ayobangira Safari, said Masisi had been taken 'for now.' An army spokesperson declined immediate comment. Corneille Nangaa, leader of the anti-government Congo River Alliance (AFC), which includes M23, said rebel forces had reached the center of Masisi mid-afternoon on Saturday. The advance and continued fighting in defiance of a ceasefire agreement further undermined efforts to curb the conflict. A rare high-level meeting between the Congolese and Rwandan presidents was postponed in December, dashing hopes of a deal to curb the violence that has displaced more than 1.9 million people. The head of an international organization working in Masisi said staff members there were in shock and unable to continue operations as businesses were closed, making it hard to source supplies. 'They don't know how to leave the town since we fear that the ... [Congolese forces] will launch a counteroffensive,' the source said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rebels-seize-key-town-in-eastern-drc/7925173.html	2025-01-05T13:40:03-08:00	
Mufasa' and 'Sonic 3' rule first box office weekend of 2025	The Walt Disney Co.’s 'Mufasa' claimed the No. 1 spot on the North American box office charts over the first weekend of 2025. The photorealistic 'Lion King' prequel earned $23.8 million in its third weekend, according to studio estimates Sunday. Paramount’s 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' which has dominated the past two weekends, wasn’t far behind. 'Sonic 3' stayed close with a 3-day estimate of $21.2 million, bringing its total domestic earnings to $187.5 million and helping the overall franchise cross $1 billion worldwide. 'Mufasa’s' running total is slightly less, with $169.2 million. In third place, Focus Features’ 'Nosferatu' remake defied the fate of so many of its genre predecessors and fell only 39% in its second weekend. Horror films typically fall sharply after the first weekend and anything less than a 50% decline is notable. 'Nosferatu,' which added 140 screens, claimed $13.2 million in ticket sales, bringing its running total to $69.4 million since its Christmas debut. The film, directed by Robert Eggers, already surpassed its reported production budget of $50 million, though that figure does not account for marketing and promotion expenses. No new wide releases opened this weekend, leaving the box office top 10 once again to holdovers from previous weeks. Several have been in theaters since Thanksgiving. One of those, 'Moana 2,' claimed the No. 4 spot for Disney in its sixth weekend in theaters. The animated sequel earned another $12.4 million, bumping its global total to $960.5 million. The Bob Dylan biopic 'A Complete Unknown,' dipped only slightly in its second weekend, bringing in $8.1 million. With $41.7 million total, it's Searchlight's highest grossing film since Disney acquired the company in 2019. A24’s erotic drama 'Babygirl,' which added 49 locations, held steady at $4.5 million. Another Thanksgiving leftover, 'Wicked,' rounded out the top five. Universal’s movie musical was made available to purchase on VOD on Jan. 31, but still earned another $10.2 million from theaters. The movie is up for several awards at Sunday’s Golden Globes, including nominations for Cynthia Erivo, Ariana Grande, best motion picture musical or comedy and 'cinematic and box office achievement,' which last year went to 'Barbie.' Also in theaters this weekend was the IMAX re-release of David Fincher’s 4K restoration of 'Seven,' which earned just over $1 million from 200 locations. The 2025 box office year is already off to a better start than 2024, up around 20% from the same weekend last year. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' $23.8 million. 2. 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3,' $21.2 million. 3. 'Nosferatu,' $13.2 million. 4. 'Moana 2,' $12.4 million. 5. 'Wicked,' $10.2 million. 6. 'A Complete Unknown,' $8.1 million. 7. 'Babygirl,' $4.5 million. 8. 'Gladiator II,' $2.7 million. 9. 'Homestead,' $2.1 million. 10. 'The Fire Inside,' $1.2 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mufasa-and-sonic-3-rule-first-box-office-weekend-of-2025/7925135.html	2025-01-05T11:42:07-08:00	
Albanian Orthodox archbishop in critical condition	Athens, Greece — The head of the Albanian Orthodox Church, who was airlifted to a hospital in Athens due to complications from a virus, is in a critical condition, the Evangelismos hospital said Sunday. Archbishop Anastasios, 95, was taken to the Greek capital Friday evening, four days after being admitted to hospital in Tirana with what Church officials called a 'seasonal virus.' 'His Beatitude's condition is assessed as critical by the attending physicians,' the medical report from the hospital stated. On Saturday, his condition was assessed as 'stable despite his already complicated medical history.' Anastasios is credited with having revived the Orthodox Church in Muslim-majority Albania. He led the Church there for three decades. He was airlifted to Athens on a C-27 Greek air force plane following a request from Greek emergency services, the defense ministry said. Greek public television ERT reported that he was also suffering from gastric bleeding. In November 2020, he was hospitalized in Athens for 12 days with COVID-19. Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis visited Sunday afternoon the hospital where Archbishop Anastasios of Albania is being treated and was informed for the ailing archbishop's health condition.	https://www.voanews.com/a/albanian-orthodox-archbishop-in-critical-condition/7925131.html	2025-01-05T11:29:43-08:00	
Winter storm will not delay Trump election certification in Congress, House leader says	Washington — A massive winter storm moving across the United States will not keep the U.S. Congress from meeting on Monday to formally certify Republican Donald Trump's election as president, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said on Sunday. 'The Electoral Count Act requires this on January 6 at 1 p.m. - so, whether we’re in a blizzard or not we’re going to be in that chamber making sure this is done,' Johnson told Fox News' 'Sunday Morning Futures' in an interview. Johnson said he hoped there would be full attendance despite the storm and that he had encouraged lawmakers to stay in the city. Forecasts called for heavy snow and high winds from the Central Plains to the mid-Atlantic states, the National Weather Service said. Severe weather advisories were issued across the eastern half of the country, including blizzard warnings in parts of Kansas. In Washington, mixed snow and sleet accumulations were expected to be between 7 to 18 cm, promising a difficult commute and possible closings of schools, government and businesses. Bad winter weather can wreak havoc in the Washington metropolitan area, which has seen mild winters in recent decades and has at times been unprepared for accumulations of snow or ice. Members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives returned to Washington on Friday after the winter break and Republicans gathered on Saturday with Johnson to discuss legislative priorities. Republicans won control of both the chambers in November's election. Other leaders stressed they were not contemplating a weather delay. 'No change to the schedule,' said Lauren Fine, communications director for Republican House Majority Leader Steve Scalise. The certification process, usually a formality, was upended four years ago when supporters of Trump violently stormed the U.S. Capitol in a bid to halt the transfer of power to Democrat Joe Biden, who won the 2020 election. Trump has continued to falsely claim his 2020 defeat was the result of widespread fraud. Biden and the Democrats say they will honor the 2024 election results and proceed with certification.	https://www.voanews.com/a/winter-storm-will-not-delay-trump-election-certification-in-congress-house-leader-says/7925127.html	2025-01-05T11:15:04-08:00

Farmers' convoys head for Paris to restart protest movement	Paris — Convoys of farmers set off Sunday to try to block roads around Paris in protest of what they say is unfair competition from overseas and excessive regulation. Farmers from France, the European Union's biggest agricultural producer, led European-wide protests at the start of 2024, but demonstrations fizzled out as the year went on. However, a move last month by the EU and South American nations in the Mercosur bloc to announce an agreement in principle on a free trade deal has given new impetus to French farmers opposed to the Mercosur deal. French farmers also remain unhappy about regulation which they say is hitting their profits. Farming trade union officials are due to meet French Prime Minister Francois Bayrou on Jan. 13 to express their concerns. 'They don't understand the level of misery and distress that farmers are going through at the moment,' Amelie Rebiere, vice-president of the Coordination Rurale farming trade union, told BFM TV. Those who back the EU's Mercosur deal, such as Germany, say it offers a way to reduce reliance on trade with China, and insulates EU nations from the impact of trade tariffs being threatened by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. Nevertheless, many European farmers — often led by those from France — have repeatedly protested the EU-Mercosur deal, arguing it would lead to cheap imports of South American commodities, notably beef, that do not meet EU safety standards.	https://www.voanews.com/a/farmers-convoys-head-for-paris-to-restart-protest-movement/7925108.html	2025-01-05T10:36:54-08:00	
Bidens to visit New Orleans, relatives of victims of terrorist attack	Washington — U.S. President Joe Biden and first lady Jill Biden will visit New Orleans on Monday to grieve with relatives of the 14 people who were killed and 35 injured there when a man drove a rented pickup truck at high speed through a group of pedestrians in the early hours of New Year’s Day. The Bidens plan to meet with family members of the victims who were run over when the suspect, identified by authorities as Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a 42-year-old military veteran from Houston, sped down bustling Bourbon Street, a prime tourist restaurant and bar locale. Police fatally shot Jabbar after he opened fire on officers. Biden, with two weeks remaining in office before President-elect Donald Trump is inaugurated, is also meeting with investigators who say that Jabbar acted alone in the attack but was inspired by the Islamic State to carry out the terror attack. The Federal Bureau of Investigation said that Jabbar posted five videos on social media expressing support for the Islamic State terrorist group, IS, over the roughly hour and a half before the attack as New Orleans revelers celebrated the first hours of 2025. An IS flag was found in the back of the truck. On the day of the attack, Biden, speaking from the Camp David presidential retreat in Maryland, offered condolences to the victims' families in a national address. 'I want you to know I grieve with you,' he said. Biden said investigators told him the suspect had a remote detonator in his truck that was meant to set off two explosive devices placed inside ice coolers along Bourbon Street. Representative Mike Turner, chairman of the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, on Sunday reiterated to CBS’s 'Face the Nation' show a previously disclosed U.S. claim, that there are Islamic State members and other terrorist organizations that are inside the United States 'working in conjunction with ISIS with the intention of harming Americans.' 'We don’t know where they are,' Turner said. Outgoing Homeland Security chief Alejandro Mayorkas told ABC’s 'This Week' show that there has been a 'significant increase' over the last 10 years in 'homegrown violent extremism.' 'It is a very difficult threat landscape,' Mayorkas said. He pledged a smooth transition to Trump’s appointment as the incoming Homeland Security secretary, South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem. 'I have spoken with Governor Noem a number of times, including on New Year’s Day and immediately thereafter, with respect to the horrific terrorist attack,' Mayorkas said. 'We have spoken substantively about the measures that we take, and I am incredibly devoted to a smooth and successful transition to the success of Governor Noem, should she be confirmed as the secretary of Homeland Security,' Mayorkas said. Biden’s Monday visit to New Orleans is occurring with heightened security concerns in Washington as Congress meets to certify that Trump defeated Vice President Kamala Harris in the November election. It is four years to the day after Trump supporters rampaged through the U.S. Capitol, ransacking congressional officers and attacking law enforcement officers to block certification of Biden’s victory over Trump in the 2020 election. Trump has vowed, within hours of taking office on January 20, to pardon many of those arrested and imprisoned in the January 6, 2021, attack.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bidens-to-visit-new-orleans-relatives-of-victims-of-terrorist-attack-/7925091.html	2025-01-05T10:22:33-08:00	
Hezbollah leader Nasrallah killed last year in war operations room, aide says	BEIRUT — Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike last year while inside the militant group's war operations room, according to new details Sunday disclosed by a senior Hezbollah official. A series of Israeli airstrikes flattened several buildings in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Sept. 27, 2023, killing Nasrallah. The Lebanese Health Ministry said six people died. According to news reports, Nasrallah and other senior officials were meeting underground. The assassination of Nasrallah, who had led Hezbollah for 32 years, turned months of low-level strikes between Israel and the militants into all-out war that battered much of southern and eastern Lebanon for two months until a U.S.-brokered ceasefire took effect Nov. 27. 'His Eminence [Hassan Nasrallah] used to lead the battle and war from this location,' top Hezbollah security official Wafiq Safa told a news conference Sunday near the site where Nasrallah was killed. He said Nasrallah died in the war operations room. He did not offer other details. Lebanese media had reported that Safa was a target of Israeli airstrikes in central Beirut before the ceasefire but appeared unscathed. During the first phase of the ceasefire, Hezbollah is supposed to move its fighters, weapons and infrastructure away from southern Lebanon north of the Litani River, while Israeli troops that invaded southern Lebanon need to withdraw all within 60 days. Lebanese army soldiers are to deploy in large numbers and alongside United Nations peacekeepers to be the sole armed presence in southern Lebanon. Lebanon and Hezbollah have been critical of ongoing Israeli strikes and overflights across the country and for only withdrawing from two of dozens of Lebanese villages it controls. Israel says that the Lebanese military has not done its share in dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure. Hezbollah’s current leader Naim Kassem in a televised address Saturday warned that its fighters could strike Israel if its troops don’t leave the south by the end of the month. Safa said that Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, who negotiated the ceasefire deal with Washington, told Hezbollah that the government will meet with U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein soon. 'And in light of what happens, then there will be a position,' said Safa. Hochstein had led the shuttle diplomacy efforts to reach the fragile truce.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hezbollah-leader-nasrallah-killed-last-year-in-war-operations-room-aide-says-/7925076.html	2025-01-05T10:02:43-08:00	
Blinken wades into political crisis with stop in South Korea	Seoul — U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Monday opened a visit to crisis-riven South Korea where he will seek delicately to encourage continuity with the policies, but not tactics, of the impeached president. Blinken arrived in the snow-covered capital on what will likely be his final trip as the top U.S. diplomat before President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. He will meet his counterpart Cho Tae-yul on Monday, the same day a warrant expires to arrest suspended President Yoon Suk Yeol who unsuccessfully tried to impose martial law on December 3. Blinken is highlighting President Joe Biden's efforts to build alliances and will head afterwards to Tokyo, making it crucial in the eyes of his advisors not to snub South Korea, which has a fraught and often competitive relationship with Japan, also home to thousands of American troops. Yoon had once been a darling of the Biden administration with his bold moves to turn the page on friction with Japan and his eye on a greater role for South Korea on global issues. Yoon joined Biden for a landmark three-way summit with Japan's prime minister and -- months before declaring martial law -- was picked to lead a global democracy summit, a signature initiative for the outgoing U.S. administration. Yoon also memorably charmed his hosts on a state visit by belting out 'American Pie' at a White House dinner. Blinken may face some criticism from the South Korean left for the visit but should be able to navigate the political crisis, said Sydney Seiler, a former US intelligence officer focused on Korea now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Blinken has a high enough profile to be above the fray, and can keep the focus on challenges such as China and North Korea, he said. 'Blinken can dodge a lot of these domestic South Korean landmines relatively easily and contextualize it not as trying to help the ruling party or artificially create a sense of normalcy where it otherwise isn't,' Seiler said. In a statement, the State Department did not directly mention the political crisis but said Blinken would seek to preserve trilateral cooperation with Japan, which has included enhanced intelligence sharing on North Korea. Blinken's visit comes at a time of change for both countries, with Trump returning to the White House on January 20. Paradoxically, while Biden worked closely with the conservative Yoon, Trump in his first term enjoyed a warm relationship with then progressive president Moon Jae-in, who encouraged the U.S. president's groundbreaking personal diplomacy with North Korea. The Biden administration has stressed since the crisis that it is reaching out to South Korean politicians across the divide, amid the uncertainties on who will lead Asia's fourth-largest economy. Progressive opposition leader Lee Jae-myung -- who himself faces election disqualification in a court case -- supports diplomacy with North Korea. But the former labor activist has also taken stances that differ from those of both Biden and Trump. Lee has criticized deployment of U.S.-made THAAD missile defenses, which Washington says are meant to protect against North Korea but which China sees as a provocation. South Korea's left has long championed a harder stance on Japan over its brutal 1910-1945 occupation of the Korean peninsula. U.S. officials said they had no warning of Yoon's imposition of martial law, which brought masses of protesters to the streets. Blinken, addressing reporters last month, said the crisis showed the strength of South Korea's institutions built in the three decades since it embraced democracy. 'I think Korea is one of the most powerful stories in the world about the emergence of democracy and democratic resilience, and we'll continue to look to Korea to set that example,' Blinken said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-wades-into-political-crisis-with-stop-in-south-korea/7925034.html	2025-01-05T08:38:27-08:00	
Russia: Ukraine launches new Kursk region offensive	Russia said Sunday that Ukraine has launched a new counterattack in the western Kursk region aimed at repelling Russian and North Korean troops trying to retake territory that Kyiv’s forces captured last August. The Russian defense ministry said Kyiv deployed 'an assault group consisting of two tanks, a mine clearing vehicle, and twelve armored combat vehicles with paratroops towards Berdin village.' Moscow said its 'artillery and aviation of the North group of (Russian) forces defeated the assault group of the Ukrainian Armed Forces,' although news accounts said the outcome of the fighting was uncertain. 'Russia is getting what it deserves,' Ukrainian presidential chief of staff Andriy Yermak said commenting on the recent reports. The head of Ukraine's Center for Countering Disinformation, Andriy Kovalenko, said on Telegram that 'defense forces are working' in the area. 'In the Kursk region, the Russians are very worried because they were attacked from several directions, and it was a surprise for them,' he said. Ukrainian and Western accounts say that Russia has deployed about 11,000 North Korean troops in the Kursk region, although Moscow has neither confirmed nor denied their presence. Ukraine took the land August 6 and has held on since then even as Russia has gained territory in Ukraine’s eastern region and currently holds about a fifth of the country as the war nears the three-year mark next month. If Ukraine can hold on to the Kursk territory, it could give Kyiv a bargaining chip in any eventual peace talks with Russia. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has said he would resolve the Russia-Ukraine conflict before he is inaugurated on January 20, but he has not said how and there is no indication of any settlement in the coming days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Saturday that Russian and North Korean forces had suffered heavy losses in the Kursk fighting. 'In battles yesterday and today near just one village, Makhnovka, in Kursk region, the Russian army lost up to a battalion of North Korean infantry soldiers and Russian paratroops,' Zelenskyy said. 'This is significant.' Zelenskyy provided no specific details. A battalion can vary in size but is generally made up of several hundred troops. Russian President Vladimir Putin, in response to a question at his marathon annual phone-in last month, said that Russia would force Ukrainian forces out of Kursk but declined to set a date for when this would happen. On the battlefront Sunday, Ukraine's air force said it shot down 61 out of 103 drones launched by Russia in an overnight attack, the other 42 were reported lost — likely due to electronic jamming. Russia said it had destroyed five Ukrainian drones over Russian territory. Some material in this report came from Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-ukraine-launches-new-kursk-region-offensive/7924985.html	2025-01-05T07:41:11-08:00	
Syrian ministers urge lifting of US sanctions in first visit to Doha	Doha, Qatar — Ministers from Syria's transitional government urged the United States to lift its sanctions on Damascus during their first visit to Qatar since overthrowing president Bashar al-Assad. In a statement, Qatar's foreign ministry said the Gulf country's premier met with Syria's interim foreign minister, Asaad al-Shaibani, defense minister Murhaf Abu Qasra and the new head of intelligence, Anas Khattab. Qatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman bin Jassim Al-Thani 'reiterated the State of Qatar's position in support of Syria's unity, sovereignty and independence,' the statement said. Earlier, a Syrian diplomat and a Qatari official confirmed to AFP that Shaibani had arrived on Sunday morning for meetings in Qatar, the host of the U.S.'s largest military base in the region. Unlike other Arab countries, Qatar never restored diplomatic ties with Syria under Assad, who was toppled by an 11-day rebel advance that swept through major cities and then the capital Damascus in December. Following discussions with Qatar's Minister of State, Mohammed bin Abdulaziz Al-Khulaifi, Shaibani reiterated calls for the lifting of U.S. sanctions on Syria. The interim foreign minister called the measures a 'barrier and an obstacle to the rapid recovery' telling local media that his government 'renewed our demand for the United States of America to lift these sanctions.' At the end of December, Qatar also called for the quick removal of sanctions on Syria. The international community has not rushed to lift economic restrictions on Syria and is instead waiting to see how the new authorities exercise their power. Shaibani added that Syria would 'enjoy very good relations with the region' in contrast to those with the Assad government. Khulaifi said the new government had presented 'a clear roadmap for Syria in the near future and the steps that will be taken by the leadership and political administration in Syria.' The conflict in Syria erupted in 2011 after Assad brutally cracked down on peaceful democracy protests. It morphed into a multi-pronged war in which Doha was for years a key backer of the armed rebellion. In a statement on X, Shaibani on Friday said he would visit Qatar, the United Arab Emirates and Jordan over the coming days. 'We look forward to these visits contributing to supporting stability, security, economic recovery and building distinguished partnerships,' the foreign minister wrote. Qatar was the second country, after Turkey, to reopen its embassy in the Syrian capital following the overthrow of Assad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-ministers-urge-lifting-of-us-sanctions-in-first-visit-to-doha/7924928.html	2025-01-05T06:31:20-08:00	
Austrian People's Party nominates Christian Stocker as interim leader after Nehammer resigns	Vienna — Austrian People's Party on Sunday nominated its General Secretary Christian Stocker as interim leader after the expected resignation of Chancellor Karl Nehammer, Austrian news agency APA reported. Nehammer announced Saturday he would resign in the next few days after coalition talks with the Social Democrats collapsed. Stocker, a lawyer and member of the Austrian Parliament, has served as general secretary of the People's Party since 2022. He is seen as an experienced and calm crisis communicator who has frequently appeared in Austrian media to defend controversial decisions. It is not clear yet who will become acting chancellor until a new government is formed. Protected by special police forces, Nehammer walked across the square from the Chancellery toward the president's office in Vienna. 'What is important for me is that the way of stability and the center can be continued,' he said. Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen will make a public statement to announce the next steps once the meeting with Nehammer is over. The 52-year-old Nehammer became chancellor and conservative party leader in 2021, after his predecessor Sebastian Kurz was forced to stand down following allegations of corruption. In April 2022, Nehammer became the first European leader to visit Moscow and meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin since the invasion of Ukraine in February that year. Before going to Moscow, he also met Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in Kyiv. Austria was thrown into political turmoil on Friday after the liberal party NEOS pulled out of coalition talks with the center-left Social Democrats and the conservative People's Party. On Saturday the two remaining parties, who have a razor-thin majority in Parliament, made another attempt to negotiate and form a government — but this effort also ended in failure after a few hours, with negotiators saying they were unable to agree on how to repair the budget deficit.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austrian-people-s-party-nominates-christian-stocker-as-interim-leader-after-nehammer-resigns-/7924879.html	2025-01-05T05:36:48-08:00	
Nagasaki atomic bomb survivor, who devoted his life for peace, dies at 93	TOKYO — Shigemi Fukahori, a survivor of the 1945 Nagasaki atomic bombing, who devoted his life to advocating for peace has died. He was 93. Fukahori died at a hospital in Nagasaki, southwestern Japan, on January 3, the Urakami Catholic Church, where he prayed almost daily until last year, said on Sunday. Local media reported he died of old age. The church, located about 500 meters from ground zero and near the Nagasaki Peace Park, is widely seen as a symbol of hope and peace, as its bell tower and some statues and survived the nuclear bombing. Fukahori was only 14 when the U.S. dropped the bomb on Nagasaki on Aug. 9, 1945, killing tens of thousands of people, including his family. That came three days after the nuclear attack on Hiroshima, which killed 140,000 people. Japan surrendered days later, ending World War II and the country's nearly half-century of aggression across Asia. Fukahori, who worked at a shipyard about 3 kilometers from where the bomb dropped, couldn't talk about what happened for years, not only because of the painful memories but also how powerless he felt then. About 15 years ago, he became more outspoken after encountering, during a visit to Spain, a man who experienced the bombing of Guernica in 1937 during the Spanish Civil War when he was also 14 years old. The shared experience helped Fukahori open up. 'On the day the bomb dropped, I heard a voice asking for help. When I walked over and held out my hand, the person's skin melted. I still remember how that felt,' Fukahori told Japan's national broadcaster, NHK, in 2019. He often addressed students, hoping they take on what he called 'the baton of peace,' in reference to his advocacy. When Pope Francis visited Nagasaki in 2019, Fukahori was the one who handed him a wreath of white flowers. The following year, Fukahori represented the bomb victims at a ceremony, making his 'pledge for peace,' saying: 'I am determined to send our message to make Nagasaki the final place where an atomic bomb is ever dropped.' A wake is scheduled for Sunday, and funeral services on Monday at Urakami Church, where his daughter will represent the family.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nagasaki-atomic-bomb-survivor-who-devoted-his-life-for-peace-dies-at-93-/7924869.html	2025-01-05T05:16:43-08:00	
Costas Simitis, former Greek prime minister and socialist leader, dies at 88	ATHENS, GREECE — Costas Simitis, former prime minister of Greece and the architect of the country's joining the common European currency, the euro, has died at age 88, state TV ERT reported. Simitis was taken to a hospital in the city of Corinth early Sunday morning from his holiday home west of Athens, unconscious and without a pulse, the hospital's director was quoted as saying by Greek media. An autopsy will be performed to determine the cause of death. The government decreed a four-day period of official mourning. Simitis will receive a state funeral. Warm tributes appeared, and not just from political allies. 'I bid farewell to Costas Simitis with sadness and respect. A worthy and noble political opponent,' Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said in a Facebook post, also saluting the 'good professor and moderate parliamentarian.' Another conservative politician, former European Commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos, recalled how he, as mayor of Athens, had cooperated 'seamlessly and warmly' with Simitis in organizing the Olympic Games. 'He served the country with devotion and a sense of duty. ... He was steadfast in facing difficult challenges and promoted policies that changed the lives of [many] citizens,' Avramopoulos added. Simitis, a co-founder of the Socialist PASOK party in 1974, eventually became the successor to the party's founding leader, Andreas Papandreou, with whom he had an often-contentious relationship that shaped the party's nature. Simitis was a low-key pragmatist whereas Papandreou was a charismatic, fiery populist. He was also a committed pro-European, while Papandreou banked on strong opposition to Greece's joining what was then the European Economic Community in the 1970s, before changing tack once he became prime minister. When the profligate first four years of socialist rule, from 1981 to 1985, resulted in a rapidly deteriorating economy, Papandreou elevated Simitis to be finance minister and oversee a tight austerity program. Finances improved, inflation was partly tamed, but Simitis was pushed to resign in 1987 when Papandreou, eyeing an upcoming election, announced a generous wages policy, undermining the goals of the austerity program. The socialists returned to power with Papandreou still at the helm in 1993, but he was ailing and finally resigned the premiership in January 1996. A tight two rounds of voting among the socialist lawmakers unexpectedly elevated Simitis to the post of prime minister, a post he held until 2004. Simitis considered Greece's entry into the eurozone, in January 2001, as the signature achievement of his premiership. But he also helped secure the 2004 Olympic Games for Athens and presided over a vast program of infrastructure building, including a brand-new airport and two subway lines, to help host the games. He also helped Cyprus join the European Union in 2004. His critics on the right and left did their best to denigrate his legacy, highlighting a dubious debt swap concluded after the country had joined the eurozone as an attempt to massage the debt numbers. In the end, it was determined opposition from his own party, including trade union leaders, to pension reform in 2001 that fatally weakened Simitis' administration. He decided to resign his party post and not contest the 2004 election, five months before the Olympics, rather than face certain defeat to the conservatives. George Papandreou, son of the socialist party's founder, succeeded him as party leader, and in 2008 expelled Simitis from the PASOK parliamentary group after the two men clashed over policies, including Papandreou's proposal to hold a referendum on the Treaty of Lisbon. Simitis left parliament in 2009, but not before issuing a prescient warning that financial mismanagement would bring the country under the tutelage of the International Monetary Fund, which would impose harsh austerity. In the end, it was the IMF, jointly with the EU, that imposed a harsh regime on a bankrupt country in 2010. Costas Simitis was born on June 23, 1936, the younger son of two politically active parents. His lawyer father, Georgios, was a member of the left-leaning resistance 'government' during the German occupation and his mother, Fani, was an active feminist. Simitis studied law at the University of Marburg, in Germany, in the 1950s, and economics and politics at the London School of Economics in the early 1960s. He later taught law at the University of Athens. His elder brother, Spiros, who died in 2023, was a noted legal scholar in Germany, specializing in data protection. Simitis is survived by his wife of 60 years, Daphne, two daughters and a granddaughter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/costas-simitis-former-greek-prime-minister-and-socialist-leader-dies-at-88/7924838.html	2025-01-05T02:43:55-08:00	
New Orleans attack, Vegas explosion highlight extremist violence by active military and veterans	While much remains unknown about the man who carried out an attack in New Orleans on New Year's and another who died in an explosion in Las Vegas the same day, the violence highlights the increased role of people with military experience in ideologically driven attacks, especially those that seek mass casualties. In New Orleans, Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a veteran of the U.S. Army, was killed by police after a deadly rampage in a pickup truck that left 14 others dead and injured dozens more. It's being investigated as an act of terrorism inspired by the Islamic State group. In Las Vegas, officials say Matthew Livelsberger, an active duty member of the U.S. Army Special Forces, shot himself in the head in a Tesla Cybertruck packed with firework mortars and camp fuel canisters, shortly before it exploded outside the entrance of the Trump International Hotel, injuring seven people. On Friday, investigators said Livelsberger wrote that the explosion was meant to serve as a 'wakeup call' and that the country was 'terminally ill and headed toward collapse.' Service members and veterans who radicalize make up a tiny fraction of a percentage point of the millions who have honorably served their country. But an Associated Press investigation published last year found that radicalization among both veterans and active duty service members was on the rise and that hundreds of people with military backgrounds had been arrested for extremist crimes since 2017. The AP found that extremist plots they were involved in during that period had killed or injured nearly 100 people. The AP also found multiple issues with the Pentagon's efforts to address extremism in the ranks, including that there is still no force-wide system to track it, and that a cornerstone report on the issue contained old data, misleading analyses and ignored evidence of the problem. Since 2017, both veterans and active duty service members radicalized at a faster rate than people without military backgrounds, according to data from terrorism researchers at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism, or START, at the University of Maryland. Less than 1% of the adult population is currently serving in the U.S. military, but active duty military members make up a disproportionate 3.2% of the extremist cases START researchers found between 2017 and 2022. While the number of people with military backgrounds involved in violent extremist plots remains small, the participation of active military and veterans gave extremist plots more potential for mass injury or death, according to data collected and analyzed by the AP and START. More than 480 people with a military background were accused of ideologically driven extremist crimes from 2017 through 2023, including the more than 230 arrested in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection — 18% of those arrested for the attack as of late last year, according to START. The data tracked individuals with military backgrounds, most of whom were veterans, involved in plans to kill, injure or inflict damage for political, social, economic or religious goals. The AP's analysis found that plots involving people with military backgrounds were more likely to involve mass casualties, weapons training or firearms than plots that didn't include someone with a military background. This held true whether or not the plots were carried out. The jihadist ideology of the Islamic State group apparently connected to the New Orleans attack would make it an outlier in the motivations of previous attacks involving people with military backgrounds. Only around 9% of such extremists with military backgrounds subscribed to jihadist ideologies, START researchers found. More than 80% identified with far-right, anti-government or white supremacist ideologies, with the rest split among far-left or other motivations. Still, there have been a number of significant attacks motivated by the Islamic State and jihadist ideology in which the attackers had U.S. military backgrounds. In 2017, a U.S. Army National Guard veteran who'd served in Iraq killed five people in a mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale airport in Florida after radicalizing via jihadist message boards and vowing support for the Islamic State. In 2009, an Army psychiatrist and officer opened fire at Fort Hood, Texas, and killed 13 people, wounding dozens more. The shooter had been in contact with a known al-Qaida operative prior to the shooting. In the shadow of the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol — led in part by veterans — law enforcement officials said the threat from domestic violent extremists was one of the most persistent and pressing terror threats to the United States. The Pentagon has said it is 'committed to understanding the root causes of extremism and ensuring such behavior is promptly and appropriately addressed and reported to the proper authorities.' Kristofer Goldsmith, an Army veteran and CEO of Task Force Butler Institute, which trains veterans to research and counter extremism, said the problem of violent extremism in the military cuts across ideological lines. Still, he said, while the Biden administration tried to put in place efforts to address it, Republicans in Congress opposed them for political reasons. 'They threw, you know, every roadblock that they could in saying that all veterans are being called extremists by the Biden administration,' Goldsmith said. 'And now we're in a situation where we're four years behind where we could have been.' During their long military careers, both Jabbar and Livelsberger served time at the U.S. Army base formerly known as Fort Bragg in North Carolina, one of the nation's largest military bases. One of the officials who spoke to the AP said there is no overlap in their assignments at the base, now called Fort Liberty. Goldsmith said he is concerned that the incoming Trump administration will focus on the New Orleans attack and ISIS and ignore that most deadly attacks in the United States in recent history have come from the far right, particularly if Trump's nominee for defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, is confirmed. Hegseth has justified the medieval Crusades that pitted Christians against Muslims, criticized the Pentagon's efforts to address extremism in the ranks and ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration in the weeks after the Jan. 6 attack was himself flagged by a fellow National Guard member as a possible 'insider threat.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-attack-vegas-explosion-highlight-extremist-violence-by-active-military-and-veterans/7924110.html	2025-01-05T00:06:03-08:00	
In Gaza's crowded tent camps, women wrestle with a life stripped of privacy	DEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA CITY — For Gaza's women, the hardships of life in the territory's sprawling tent camps are compounded by the daily humiliation of never having privacy. Women struggle to dress modestly while crowded into tents with extended family members, including men, and with strangers only steps away in neighboring tents. Access to menstrual products is limited, so they cut up sheets or old clothes to use as pads. Makeshift toilets usually consist of only a hole in the sand surrounded by sheets dangling from a line, and these must be shared with dozens of other people. Alaa Hamami has dealt with the modesty issue by constantly wearing her prayer shawl, a black cloth that covers her head and upper body. 'Our whole lives have become prayer clothes, even to the market we wear it,' said the young mother of three. 'Dignity is gone.' Normally, she would wear the shawl only when performing her daily Muslim prayers. But with so many men around, she keeps it on all the time, even when sleeping — just in case an Israeli strike hits nearby in the night and she has to flee quickly, she said. Israel's 14-month-old campaign in Gaza has driven more than 90% of its 2.3 million Palestinians from their homes. Hundreds of thousands of them are now living in squalid camps of tents packed close together over large areas. Sewage runs into the streets, and food and water are hard to obtain. Winter is setting in. Families often wear the same clothes for weeks because they left clothing and many other belongings behind as they fled. Everyone in the camps searches daily for food, clean water and firewood. Women feel constantly exposed. Gaza has always been a conservative society. Most women wear the hijab, or head scarf, in the presence of men who are not immediate family. Matters of women's health — pregnancy, menstruation and contraception — tend not to be discussed publicly. 'Before we had a roof. Here it does not exist,' said Hamami, whose prayer shawl is torn and smudged with ash from cooking fires. 'Here our entire lives have become exposed to the public. There is no privacy for women.' Even simple needs are hard to meet Wafaa Nasrallah, a displaced mother of two, says life in the camps makes even the simplest needs difficult, like getting period pads, which she cannot afford. She tried using pieces of cloth and even diapers, which have also increased in price. For a bathroom, she has a hole in the ground, surrounded by blankets propped up by sticks. The U.N. says more than 690,000 women and girls in Gaza require menstrual hygiene products, as well as clean water and toilets. Aid workers have been unable to meet demand, with supplies piling up at crossings from Israel. Stocks of hygiene kits have run out, and prices are exorbitant. Many women have to choose between buying pads and buying food and water. Doaa Hellis, a mother of three living in a camp, said she has torn up her old clothes to use for menstrual pads. 'Wherever we find fabric, we tear it up and use it.' A packet of pads costs 45 shekels ($12), 'and there is not even five shekels in the whole tent,' she said. Anera, a rights group active in Gaza, says some women use birth control pills to halt their periods. Others have experienced disruptions in their cycles because of the stress and trauma of repeated displacement. The terrible conditions pose real risks to women's health, said Amal Seyam, the director of the Women's Affairs Center in Gaza, which provides supplies for women and surveys them about their experiences. She said some women have not changed clothes for 40 days. That and improvised cloth pads 'will certainly create' skin diseases, diseases related to reproductive health and psychological conditions, she said. 'Imagine what a woman in Gaza feels like, if she's unable to control conditions related to hygiene and menstrual cycles,' Seyam said. 'Everything is destroyed' Hellis remembered a time not so long ago, when being a woman felt more like a joy and less like a burden. 'Women are now deprived of everything, no clothes, no bathroom. Their psychology is completely destroyed,' she said. Seyam said the center has tracked cases where girls have been married younger, before the age of 18, to escape the suffocating environment of their family's tents. The war will 'continue to cause a humanitarian disaster in every sense of the word. And women always pay the biggest price,' she said. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed more than 45,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to the territory's Health Ministry. Its count does not differentiate between combatants and civilians. Israel launched its assault in retaliation for the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on southern Israel, in which militants killed some 1,200 people and abducted around 250 others. With large swaths of Gaza's cities and towns leveled, women wrestle with reduced lives in their tents. Hamami can walk the length of her small tent in a few strides. She shares it with 13 other people from her extended family. During the war, she gave birth to a son, Ahmed, who is now 8 months old. Between caring for him and her two other children, washing her family's laundry, cooking and waiting in line for water, she says there's no time to care for herself. She has a few objects that remind her of what her life once was, including a powder compact she brought with her when she fled her home in the Shati camp of Gaza City. The makeup is now caked and crumbling. She managed to keep hold of a small mirror through four different displacements over the past year. It's broken into two shards that she holds together every so often to catch a glimpse of her reflection. 'Previously, I had a wardrobe that contained everything I could wish for,' she said. 'We used to go out for a walk every day, go to wedding parties, go to parks, to malls, to buy everything we wanted.' Women 'lost their being and everything in this war,' she said. 'Women used to take care of themselves before the war. Now everything is destroyed.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-gaza-s-crowded-tent-camps-women-wrestle-with-a-life-stripped-of-privacy/7920671.html	2025-01-05T00:04:29-08:00	
Fraud allegations rock South Korean adoptees and families	Her greatest fear, dormant for decades, came rushing back in an instant: had she adopted and raised a kidnapped child? Peg Reif's daughter, adopted from South Korea in the 1980s, had sent her a link to a documentary detailing how the system that made their family was rife with fraud: documents falsified, babies switched, children snatched off the street and sent abroad. Reif wept. She was among more than 120 who contacted The Associated Press this fall, after a series of stories and a documentary made with Frontline exposed how Korea created a baby pipeline, designed to ship children abroad as quickly as possible to meet Western demand. The reporting shook adoption communities around the world with details about how agencies competed for babies — pressuring mothers, bribing hospitals, fabricating documents. Most who wrote were adoptees, but some were adoptive parents like Reif, horrified to learn they had supported this system. 'I can't stand the thought that somebody lost their child,' Reif said. 'I can't stop thinking about it. I don't know how to make it right. I don't know if I can.' Forty years ago, she was struggling with infertility. She and her husband pinned their dreams for a family on adopting a baby from Mexico, paid an agency thousands of dollars and waited for months. Then the agency's directors were arrested, and they learned that those Mexican babies had been taken from their families against their will. Reif was heartbroken but recalls even now looking at her husband and saying, 'Thank God we don't have a child who was stolen.' But now she isn't sure of that. Because then they adopted two Korean children, and brought them to their home in rural Wisconsin, first a son and then a daughter. The two were not biological siblings, but both arrived with strangely similar stories in their files: their young unmarried mothers worked in factories with fathers who disappeared after they got pregnant. Back then, Reif still believed the common narrative about foreign adoption: it saved children who might otherwise live the rest of their lives in an orphanage, die or be damned to poverty. 'I don't believe that anymore,' Reif said. 'I don't know what to believe.' Cameron Lee Small, a therapist in Minneapolis whose practice caters to adoptees and their families, said many are feeling an intense sense of betrayal. Individual adoptees had long shared stories of falsified identities. But the revelations this year pointed to systemwide practices that routinely changed babies' origin stories to process adoptions quickly, including listing them as 'abandoned' even when they had known parents. Small, who was also adopted from Korea in the 1980s, summarized what he's been hearing from adoptees: 'I'm kind of back to nothing. What do I believe now? Who can I believe?' Reif's daughter, Jenn Hamilton, spent her life thinking she was unwanted, often quipping, 'That's what happens when you're found in a dumpster as a baby.' It has taken a toll on her all her life: She's been happily married for nine years, she said, but she has this insatiable insecurity: 'I constantly find myself asking my husband, 'Are you mad at me? Did I do something wrong?' Do you want to leave me?'' She has no idea anymore if abandonment was ever really her story, with revelations of abuses so systemic that even the Korean government likened it to 'trafficking.' 'You can't make that many mistakes. It has to be intentional. It was this huge tree of deception,' she said. 'I feel disgusted.' Holt International, the U.S.-based agency that pioneered adoptions from Korea, did not respond to repeated requests for comment for this story. Reform is sweeping across Europe — countries have launched investigations, halted foreign adoptions and apologized to adoptees for failing to protect them. But the United States, which has taken in the most adopted children by far, has not done a review of its own history or culpability. The U.S. State Department told AP this summer that it would work with its historian to piece together its history, and detailed initial findings that some documents might have been falsified. But it said there was no evidence that U.S. officials were aware of it. The State Department has since said that it has 'been unable to identify any records that could provide insight into the U.S. government role in adoptions from South Korea in the 1970s and 1980s.' Korea's National Police Agency confirmed an increase in adoptees registering their DNA for family searches — both at domestic police stations and diplomatic offices across North America and Europe — in the weeks following the release of the AP stories and documentary in September. More than 120 adoptees registered their DNA in October and November, compared to an average of fewer than 30 a month from January to August. Korea's government has maintained that adoptions were a necessary tool to care for needy children, including babies of unwed mothers or other children deemed as abandoned. However, Korea's Ministry of Health and Welfare acknowledged to AP that the adoption boom in the 1970s and 80s was possibly fueled by a desire to reduce welfare costs. Korea's Truth and Reconciliation Commission has been investigating government accountability over foreign adoption problems since 2022, prompted by complaints filed by hundreds of adoptees, and is expected to release an interim report in February. The Commission has posted the AP stories on its website. A law passed in 2023 mandates that all adoption records be transferred from private agencies to a government department called the National Center for the Rights of the Child by July, to centralize the handling of family search requests. The center has confirmed that private agencies hold about 170,000 adoption files, but director Chung Ick-Joong doubts it will acquire a space to store and manage all these records in time, due to financial constraints and other challenges. The agency expects family search requests to increase dramatically – 'possibly by tenfold,' according to Chung — yet has funding to add only five staff members to its team of six searchers. Chung acknowledged that flaws in adoption laws had persisted for decades, and Korea only required adoptions to go through courts and birth records to be preserved after 2012. 'It's difficult to determine who was responsible for the inaccuracies in records before then,' he said. 'The adoption agency might have been at fault, the biological parents may have lied, or something might have gone wrong at the orphanage ... no one truly knows what the truth is.' Korean adoption agencies have mostly declined AP's requests for comment in recent months, often citing privacy concerns. Advocates insist that most adoptive families thrive, with both the parents and children happily living their lives without questioning the industry as Reif and Hamilton have. Hamilton grew up in a rural, almost exclusively white community in Wisconsin, and back then all she wanted was to be accepted. But having children of her own changed that. When her first child was born, she looked at him, and it took her breath away. 'It can't explain it, like this is the first person I know in my life that I'm biologically related to,' she said. She wanted to learn her own history, so her children could know theirs. She wrote a letter to her adoption agency, which within weeks connected her with a woman they said was her mother. It was emotional, shocking. But soon she felt like she had more questions than answers. The woman's name didn't match the one listed on paperwork, and the name she gave for the father was also different. Birthdates didn't match, the birthplace didn't either. They had not met in a factory, she said, they had been pen pals. Hamilton asked the woman to take a DNA test, but she said she didn't know how to access one. Hamilton came to believe this woman was not her birth mother. The AP's reporting found numerous cases where agencies connected adoptees with supposed birth families, only for them to later discover after emotional meetings that they weren't related at all. Hamilton has been trying to untangle the DNA results on her father's side, contacting people distantly related, cousins once removed, half great aunts. 'It becomes an obsession,' Hamilton said. 'It's like a puzzle that you start, and you have to find the missing pieces.' Lynelle Long, the founder of InterCountry Adoptee Voices, the largest organization of adoptees in the world, said governments at the very least need to legally mandate that agencies provide adoptees with their full and redacted documents, without the payment now often required. Long said parents like Reif have an important role, because in Western countries, laws always favored the desires of adoptive parents — designed to make adoptions quicker and easier. Many clung to the narrative that they saved needy orphans who should be grateful, she said, especially in the U.S., where the reckoning rocking Europe has not taken hold. 'We really need adoptive parents in the United States, if they have any inkling of guilt or shame or loss, to step up, take responsibility and demand that legislation be put in place to criminalize these practices and prevent it from ever happening again,' Long said. Hamilton is close to her parents; she just renovated the basement to accommodate their visits. She's sad for herself, she said, but she's sadder for her mother, who is desperate to learn if her children actually had parents somewhere, searching for them. 'And I'm like, 'Why, so you can send us back?' Hamilton said. 'I don't want to be a victim.' She said she's glad she was adopted, and does not long for that different, alternative life in Korea. Reif loves her children profoundly, she said. But she doesn't think she would adopt from abroad again, if she'd known then what she knows now. 'I'd rather be childless than think I have somebody else's child that didn't want to give them up,' she said. 'I think of somebody taking my child. Those poor families, I just can't imagine it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/fraud-allegations-rock-south-korean-adoptees-and-families/7920666.html	2025-01-05T00:03:50-08:00	
Our county ignored Africa,' Jimmy Carter said. He didn't	NAIROBI, KENYA — Jimmy Carter was the first U.S. president to make a state visit to sub-Saharan Africa. He once called helping with Zimbabwe's transition from white rule to independence 'our greatest single success.' And when he died at 100, his foundation's work in rural Africa had nearly fulfilled his quest to eliminate a disease that afflicted millions, for the first time since the eradication of smallpox. The African continent, a booming region with a population rivaling China's that is set to double by 2050, is where Carter's legacy remains most evident. Until his presidency, U.S. leaders had shown little interest in Africa, even as independence movements swept the region in the 1960s and '70s. 'I think the day of the so-called ugly American is over,' Carter said during his warm 1978 reception in Nigeria, Africa's most populous country. He said the official state visit swept aside 'past aloofness by the United States,' and he joked that he and Nigerian President Olesegun Obasanjo would go into peanut farming together. Cold War tensions drew Carter's attention to the continent as the U.S. and Soviet Union competed for influence. But Carter also drew on the missionary traditions of his Baptist faith and the racial injustice he witnessed in his homeland in the U.S. South. 'For too long our country ignored Africa,' Carter told the Democratic National Committee in his first year as president. African leaders soon received invitations to the White House, intrigued by the abrupt interest from the world's most powerful nation and what it could mean for them. 'There is an air of freshness which is invigorating,' visiting Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda said. Carter observed after his first Africa trip, 'There is a common theme that runs through the advice to me of leaders of African nations: 'We want to manage our own affairs. We want to be friends with both of the great superpowers and also with the nations of Europe. We don't want to choose up sides.'' The theme echoes today as China also jostles with Russia and the U.S. for influence, and access to Africa's raw materials. But neither superpower has had an emissary like Carter, who made human rights central to U.S. foreign policy and made 43 more trips to the continent after his presidency, promoting Carter Center projects that sought to empower Africans to determine their own futures. As president, Carter focused on civil and political rights. He later broadened his efforts to include social and economic rights as the key to public health. 'They are the rights of the human by virtue of their humanity. And Carter is the single person in the world that has done the most for advancing this idea,' said Abdullahi Ahmed An-Naim, a Sudanese legal scholar. Even as a candidate, Carter mused about what he might accomplish, telling Playboy magazine, 'it might be that now I should drop my campaign for president and start a crusade for black-majority rule in South Africa or Rhodesia [now Zimbabwe]. It might be that later on, we'll discover there were opportunities in our lives to do wonderful things and we didn't take advantage of them.' Carter welcomed Zimbabwe's independence just four years later, hosting new Prime Minister Robert Mugabe at the White House and quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr.: 'Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.' 'Carter told me that he spent more time on Rhodesia than he did on the entire Middle East. And when you go into the archives and look at the administration, there is indeed more on southern Africa than the Middle East,' historian and author Nancy Mitchell said. Relations with Mugabe's government soon soured amid deadly repression and by 1986 Carter led a walkout of diplomats in the capital. In 2008, Carter was barred from Zimbabwe, a first in his travels. He called the country 'a basket case, an embarrassment to the region.' 'Whatever the Zimbabwean leadership may think of him now, Zimbabweans, at least those who were around in the 1970s and '80s, will always regard him as an icon and a tenacious promoter of democracy,' said Eldred Masunungure, a Harare-based political analyst. Carter also criticized South Africa's government for its treatment of Black citizens under apartheid, at a time when South Africa was 'trying to ingratiate itself with influential economies around the world,' current President Cyril Ramaphosa said on X after Carter's death. The think tank Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter founded in 1982 played a key role in monitoring African elections and brokering cease-fires between warring forces, but fighting disease was the third pillar of The Carter Center's work. 'The first time I came here to Cape Town, I almost got in a fight with the president of South Africa, Thabo Mbeki, because he was refusing to let AIDS be treated,' Carter told a local newspaper. 'That's the closest I've come to getting into a fist fight with a head of state.' Carter often said he was determined to outlive the last guinea worm infecting the human race. Once affecting millions of people, the parasitic disease has nearly been eliminated, with just 14 cases documented in 2023 in a handful of African countries. Carter's quest included arranging a four-month 'guinea worm cease-fire' in Sudan in 1995 so that The Carter Center could reach almost 2,000 endemic villages. 'He taught us a lot about having faith,' said Makoy Samuel Yibi, who leads the guinea worm eradication program for South Sudan's health ministry and grew up with people who believed the disease was simply their fate. 'Even the poor people call these people poor, you see. To have the leader of the free world pay attention and try to uplift them is a touching virtue.' Such dedication impressed health officials in Africa over the years. 'President Carter worked for all humankind irrespective of race, religion, or status,' Ethiopia's former health minister, Lia Tadesse, said in a statement shared with the AP. Ethiopia, the continent's second most populous country with over 110 million people, had zero guinea worm cases in 2023.	https://www.voanews.com/a/our-county-ignored-africa-jimmy-carter-said-he-didn-t/7924799.html	2025-01-04T22:00:37-08:00	
South Korea protesters rally for, against Yoon arrest as deadline looms	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Thousands braved heavy snow in Seoul on Sunday to rally for and against arresting impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol, as South Korea's political crisis appeared headed toward another high-stakes confrontation. With an arrest warrant against Yoon for alleged insurrection expiring at midnight local time on Monday, multiple groups held demonstrations near his official residence, some urging his immediate arrest and others protesting against it. Yoon became the country's first sitting president to face arrest over his botched attempt to declare martial law on Dec. 3, which triggered political chaos engulfing Asia's fourth-largest economy and a key U.S. ally. The conservative president was impeached by parliament and is suspended from official duties while a court decides whether to reinstate or remove him. On Friday, criminal investigators were blocked from arresting him by Yoon's presidential security service and military troops in a six-hour standoff. Some of Sunday's protesters had gathered overnight in downtown Seoul, where temperatures fell below minus 5 degrees Celsius. More than 5 centimeters of snow piled up in parts of the capital, which was under a heavy snow warning. 'We have to reestablish the foundation of our society by punishing the president who has denied the constitution,' said Yang Kyung-soo, leader of the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, or KCTU, a major labor group that took part in the protests. 'We must bring down the criminal Yoon Suk Yeol and arrest and detain him as soon as possible.' Nearby, Yoon supporters held placards reading 'We will fight for President Yoon Suk Yeol' and 'Stop the Steal,' a phrase popularized by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's supporters after he lost the 2020 election. Similar rallies drew tens of thousands on Saturday, prompting police to try to disperse KCTU protesters occupying roads and disrupting traffic. Two were detained, accused of assaulting police officers, Yonhap news agency reported. On Saturday, the Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials, which leads Yoon's criminal investigation, again asked acting President Choi Sang-mok, the finance minister, to order the security service to comply with the arrest warrant. A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-protesters-rally-for-against-yoon-arrest-as-deadline-looms-/7924795.html	2025-01-04T21:45:37-08:00	
Italian Prime Minister Meloni meets with Trump at his Florida resort	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni flew to Florida to meet with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Saturday, as the key European leader sought to buttress ties with Trump before his inauguration on Jan. 20. Members of Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort welcomed Meloni with applause after an introduction by the president-elect, according to videos shared on social media by reporters and others. Her trip comes days before she is to meet U.S. President Joe Biden during a visit to Rome from Thursday to Jan. 12. Trump defeated Biden in the November election and is preparing his return to the White House. While no details of their meeting have been disclosed, Meloni had planned to talk with Trump about Russia's war in Ukraine, trade issues, the Middle East and the plight of an Italian journalist detained in Tehran, according to Italian media reports. Meloni's office declined to comment on the reports. She is seen as a potentially strong partner for Trump given her conservative credentials and the stability of the right-wing coalition she heads in Italy. She has also forged a close relationship with billionaire tech CEO Elon Musk, a close Trump ally who spent more than a quarter-billion dollars to help him win the election. 'This is very exciting. I'm here with a fantastic woman, the prime minister of Italy,' Trump told the Mar-a-Lago crowd, according to a media pool report. 'She’s really taken Europe by storm.' Trump and Meloni then sat down for a screening of a documentary questioning the criminal investigations and legal scrutiny faced by John Eastman, a former Trump lawyer who was central to Trump's unsuccessful efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss. One of the biggest challenges facing Meloni is the arrest of Italian journalist Cecilia Sala in Iran on Dec. 19. Sala was detained three days after Mohammad Abedini, an Iranian businessman, was arrested at Milan's Malpensa airport on a U.S. warrant for allegedly supplying drone parts that Washington says were used in a 2023 attack that killed three U.S. service members in Jordan. Iran has denied involvement in the attack. On Friday, Iran's foreign ministry summoned Italy's ambassador over Abedini's detention, Iranian state media reported. Meloni became the latest in the handful of foreign leaders who have visited Trump in Florida since the Nov. 5 election. He has met with Argentinian President Javier Milei, Prime Minister Viktor Orban of Hungary, and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.	https://www.voanews.com/a/italian-prime-minister-meloni-meets-with-trump-at-his-florida-resort/7924789.html	2025-01-04T21:03:00-08:00	
Jimmy Carter's state funeral has started. Here's what to know	ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Six days of funeral observances for former President Jimmy Carter began Saturday in Georgia, where he died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. The first events reflected Carter's climb up the political ladder, from the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as a humanitarian and advocate for democracy. Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens next: The start honors Carter's deep roots in rural south Georgia The proceedings began at 10:15 a.m. local time Saturday with the Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus. Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter served as pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exited the campus on its way to Plains. James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more than when he was born on Oct. 1, 1924. Some other modern presidents — Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton — also grew up in small-town settings but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in his birthplace for his long post-presidency. The motorcade moved through downtown Plains, which spans just a few blocks, passing near the girlhood home of former first lady Rosalynn Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also included the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by Carter's younger brother, Billy. The motorcade passed by the Methodist church where the Carters married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn. The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the Governor's Mansion and four more in the White House. A stop at Carter's boyhood home — a blend of privilege, hard work After going through Plains, the procession stopped in front of Carter's family farm and boyhood home in Archery, just outside the town, after passing the cemetery where the former president's parents, James Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried. The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park. The National Park Service rang the old farm bell 39 times to honor the 39th president. Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his father's land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse and she delivered Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for the family. It was Earl's death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon's nuclear program to take over the family's peanut business after his father's death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate. Lying in repose in Atlanta, where Carter was a politician and global figure From Archery, the motorcade headed north to Atlanta. The military-run motorcade stopped outside the Georgia Capitol, where Carter served as a state senator from 1963-67 and governor from 1971-75. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens led a moment of silence. While former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents — even if they served as governors — are memorialized with national rites run by the federal government. The motorcade then proceeded to the Carter Presidential Center, which includes Carter's presidential library and The Carter Center, established by the former president and first lady in 1982. Carter's son, James Earl 'Chip' Carter III, and his grandson, Jason Carter, spoke to an assembly that included many Carter Center employees whose work concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election monitoring, and fighting disease in the developing world continues to set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish. Jimmy Carter, who delivered the center's annual reports until 2019, won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential work. Carter was scheduled to lie in repose from 7 p.m. Saturday to 6 a.m. Tuesday, with the public able to pay respects around the clock. What's next: A return to Washington Carter's remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy. Biden also signed a bill to name a U.S. Postal Service facility in Plains after Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter. The Carter family then will return to bury its patriarch in Plains after a private hometown funeral at 3:45 p.m. at Maranatha Baptist Church, where Carter, a devout evangelical, taught Sunday School for decades. Carter will be buried afterward in a private graveside service, in a plot visible from the front porch of his home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-s-state-funeral-has-started-here-s-what-to-know/7924781.html	2025-01-04T19:55:43-08:00	
Fed's Kugler, Daly say job not done on inflation	Two Federal Reserve policymakers said Saturday they feel the U.S. central bank's job on taming inflation is not yet done, but also signaled they do not want to risk damaging the labor market as they try to finish that job. The remarks, from Governor Adriana Kugler and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, highlight the delicate balancing act facing U.S. central bankers this year as they look to slow their pace of rate cutting. The Fed lowered short-term rates by a full percentage point last year, to a current range of 4.25%-4.50%. Inflation by the Fed's preferred measure is well down from its mid-2022 peak of around 7%, registering 2.4% in November. Still, that's above the Fed's 2% goal, and in December policymakers projected slower progress toward that goal than they had earlier anticipated. 'We are fully aware that we are not there yet — no one is popping champagne anywhere,' Kugler said at the annual American Economic Association conference in San Francisco, California. 'And at the same time ... we want the unemployment rate to stay where it is' and not increase rapidly. In November, unemployment was 4.2%, consistent in both her and colleague Daly's view with maximum employment, the Fed's second goal alongside its price stability goal. 'At this point, I would not want to see further slowing in the labor market — maybe gradually moving around in bumps and chunks on a given month, but certainly not additional slowing in the labor market,' said Daly, who was speaking on the same panel. The policymakers were not asked, nor did they volunteer their views, about the potential impact of incoming President-elect Donald Trump's economic policies, including tariffs and tax cuts, which some have speculated could fuel growth and reignite inflation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/fed-s-kugler-daly-say-job-not-done-on-inflation-/7924763.html	2025-01-04T17:56:50-08:00	
Thousands line Suriname streets in homage to late dictator Bouterse	PARAMARIBO, SURINAME — Thousands of people lined the streets of Suriname's capital Saturday for the funeral procession of Desi Bouterse, who led the country both as a coup leader and elected president before dying as a fugitive from justice. The government of the former Dutch colony had ruled out a state funeral for Bouterse, who was sentenced in 2023 to 20 years in prison over the killing of opposition members in 1982. He went into hiding rather than report to prison and died late last month of liver failure at age 79. The hearse carrying the uniformed body of the former president led a solemn cortege through Paramaribo, joined informally by cars, buses and motorcycles as it headed first to his residence and then to the headquarters of his National Democratic Party for a memorial service. Bouterse's closest supporters, also in military uniform, followed on foot. His body was cremated later Saturday in a private ceremony. Even while on the run from the law, Bouterse remained popular among segments of the poor and working class for his policies introducing universal school meals, free health care and a minimum wage. Admirers gathered Friday evening at the NDP headquarters, many wearing the party's colors of purple and white, to sing, pray and remember the late president. 'Papa Bouta, I love you,' shouted Dennis Keyzer, a party supporter. 'We want Papa Bouta!' While the government of President Chan Santokhi had ruled out a state funeral, flags were flown at half-staff at government buildings including the presidential palace. Bouterse first came to power as a young army sergeant major after a coup in 1980, five years after Suriname, on the northeastern coast of South America, gained independence following three centuries of Dutch occupation and rule. International pressure forced him to step down after seven years, but he returned after a second coup in 1990. Bouterse left a year later, then was elected president in 2010 and governed for a decade. In December 2023, Bouterse lost an appeal against a 20-year prison sentence for the 1982 execution of political opponents. He was in hiding at an undisclosed location when he died, either on Dec. 23 or 24, an autopsy said. 'He started out as a military man, but he was a man who was able to rise and become one of the greatest political leaders,' said Jennifer Simons, president of Bouterse's party, in her speech at the funeral. Sandra, a funeral attendee who did not want to give her last name, waited for hours in her car with her family to have 'a good place' from which to watch the funeral procession. 'He was and will be my president forever,' said Harvy Lallbiharie, holding a photograph of Bouterse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-line-suriname-streets-in-homage-to-late-dictator-bouterse/7924764.html	2025-01-04T17:53:47-08:00	
Jill Biden gets priciest gift from foreign leader in 2023 — a $20,000 diamond	WASHINGTON — President Joe Biden and his family were given tens of thousands of dollars in gifts from foreign leaders in 2023, according to an annual accounting published by the State Department on Thursday, with first lady Jill Biden receiving the single most expensive present: a $20,000 diamond from India's leader. The 7.5-carat diamond from Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was easily the most costly gift presented to any member of the first family in 2023, although she also received a brooch valued at $14,063 from the Ukrainian ambassador to the United States and a bracelet, brooch and photograph album worth $4,510 from the president and first lady of Egypt. The U.S. president himself received a number of expensive presents, including a commemorative photo album valued at $7,100 from South Korea's recently impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol , a $3,495 statue of Mongolian warriors from the Mongolian prime minister, a $3,300 silver bowl from the sultan of Brunei, a $3,160 sterling silver tray from the president of Israel, and a collage worth $2,400 from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Federal law requires executive branch officials to declare gifts they receive from foreign leaders and counterparts that have an estimated value of more than $480. Many of the gifts that meet that threshold are relatively modest, and the more expensive ones are typically — but not always — transferred to the National Archives or put on official displays. The $20,000 diamond was retained for official use in the White House East Wing, according to a State Department document, while the other gifts to the president and first lady were sent to the archives. Vanessa Valdivia, a spokesperson for Jill Biden, said the diamond will be turned over to the archives after they leave office. She did not say what it was being used for. Ukraine's ambassador, Oksana Markarova, said Friday on Facebook that a Ukrainian designer fashioned the brooch from the remains of a Russian rocket and that the piece was made from inexpensive materials, so its 'true value … lies in its symbolism.' The embassy's spokesperson, Halyna Yusypiuk, said U.S. officials provided the assessed value. Recipients have the option to purchase the gift from the U.S. government at its market value, although that is rare, particularly with high-end items. According to the State Department's Office of Protocol, which compiles the list that will be published in Friday's edition of the Federal Register, several employees of the CIA reported receiving lavish gifts of watches, perfume and jewelry, nearly all of which were destroyed. Of the gifts destroyed, they were worth more than $132,000 combined. CIA Director William Burns received a $18,000 astrograph, which is a telescope and astrological camera, from a foreign source whose identity is classified. That is being transferred to the General Services Administration. But Burns reported receiving and destroying an $11,000 Omega watch, while numerous others did the same with luxury timepieces. Below the rank of director, the CIA employees who reported gifts are not identified, but one of them logged an Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra watch, a ladies Omega Constellation watch, a diamond necklace, earring bracelet set, and a ring that were valued together at $65,100. All of those were destroyed, according to the report, as was a $30,000 women's jewelry set from the Libyan jeweler Al Grew consisting of a necklace, bracelet, ring and earrings received by another CIA employee. Another CIA employee reported receiving a men's Yacht Master II Rolex Oyster Perpetual watch worth $18,700, another reported getting a lady's Rolex Oyster Datejust watch valued at $12,500, and one other got a $7,450 Rolex Air King watch. All three of the watches were destroyed, according to the list. Another employee reported receiving a collection of pricey Amouage Perfume worth $10,670, the destruction of which is pending, the report says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jill-biden-gets-priciest-gift-from-foreign-leader-in-2023-a-20-000-diamond/7924761.html	2025-01-04T17:40:24-08:00	
Moldova breakaway region faces extended blackouts after gas cutoff	KYIV, UKRAINE — The pro-Russian breakaway Moldovan region of Transdniestria, left without Russian gas supplies no longer transiting through neighboring Ukraine, faced longer periods of rolling power cuts on Saturday, local authorities said. Flows of Russian gas via Ukraine to central and eastern Europe stopped on New Year's Day after a transit deal expired between the warring countries and Kyiv refused to extend it. Transdniestria, a mainly Russian-speaking enclave which has lived side-by-side with Moldova since breaking away from it in the last days of Soviet rule, received gas from Russian giant Gazprom through the pipeline crossing Ukraine. The gas was used to operate a thermal plant that provided electricity locally and for much of Moldova under the control of the pro-European central government. The region's self-styled president, Vadim Krasnoselsky, writing on the Telegram messaging app, said rolling power cuts in various districts would be extended to four hours Sunday. Hour-long cuts were first imposed Friday evening after heating and hot water supplies were curtailed. The cuts were then extended to three hours on Saturday. 'Yesterday's introduction of rolling cuts was a test. And it confirmed that an hour-long break to keep the electrical supply system operating was insufficient,' Krasnoselsky wrote. 'The power generated is not covering sharply rising demand.' All industries except those producing food have been shut down. The official Telegram news channel of the region's separatist authorities announced the official closure on Saturday of a steel mill and bakery in the town of Rybnitsa. Regional officials announced new measures to help residents, especially the elderly, and warned that overnight temperatures would fall to -10 Celsius (+14 Fahrenheit). Residents were told not to put strain on the region's mobile phone network. Using firewood The news channel warned against using heaters in disrepair after two residents died of carbon monoxide poisoning from a stove. Online pictures showed servicemen loading up trucks with firewood for distribution. 'Don't put off gathering in firewood,' Krasnoselsky told residents. 'It is better to ensure your supply in advance, especially since the weather is favorable so far.' Moldova's government blames Russia for the crisis and has called on Gazprom to ship gas through the TurkStream pipeline and then through Bulgaria and Romania. Russia denies using gas as a weapon to coerce Moldova and blames Kyiv for refusing to renew the gas transit deal. The Transdniestria power cuts are a problem for Moldova particularly because the enclave is home to a power plant that provides most of the power for government-controlled areas of Moldova at a fixed and low price. Prime Minister Dorin Recean said Friday his country faced a security crisis after Transdniestria imposed the rolling blackouts, but he also said the Chisinau government had prepared alternative arrangements, with a mixture of domestic production and electricity imports from Romania. Even before the halt of supplies via Ukraine, Gazprom had said it would suspend exports to Moldova on January 1 because of what Russia says are unpaid Moldovan debts of $709 million. Moldova disputes that and put the figure at $8.6 million.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldova-breakaway-region-faces-extended-blackouts-after-gas-cutoff-/7924758.html	2025-01-04T17:32:28-08:00	
Central American troops arrive in Haiti, join mission to restore order	PORT-AU-PRINCE, HAITI — About 150 military police officers from Central America have arrived in Haiti to reinforce the embattled government's fight against violent gangs that have upended daily life for millions in the Caribbean country. The deployment of around 75 security officers, mostly from Guatemala, was greeted Saturday at Toussaint Louverture International Airport in Port-au-Prince by the Kenyan commander of the U.N.-backed mission that for months has been struggling to restore order. 'The gangs have only two choices: surrender, lay down their weapons, and face justice, or face us in the field,' the officer, Godfrey Otunge, said in remarks at a welcoming ceremony. 'With the addition of the Guatemalan and El Salvador forces, the gangs will have nowhere to hide. We will root them out of their enclave.' A similar sized contingent, which also included a small number of forces from El Salvador, traveled aboard a U.S. Air Force aircraft and was greeted Friday by top Haitian officials and U.S. Ambassador Dennis Hankins. Coordinated gang attacks on prisons, police stations and the main international airport have intensified in Haiti since the 2021 assassination of President Jovenel Moise. Gangs are estimated to control about 85% of the capital. In what is perhaps the most brazen attack yet, gunmen opened fire on a crowd that gathered on Christmas Eve for the much-anticipated reopening of Haiti's biggest public hospital, which was closed after being ransacked by gangs earlier this year. Two journalists covering the event and a police officer were killed. Before this week's deployment, the international mission seeking to quell the violence was led by around 400 security officers from Kenya. Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, Benin and Chad have also pledged personnel although it isn't clear when they would be sent.	https://www.voanews.com/a/central-american-troops-arrive-in-haiti-join-mission-to-restore-order/7924757.html	2025-01-04T17:24:41-08:00	
US finds more records found linking Credit Suisse, Nazi accounts	WASHINGTON — An investigation by a U.S. Senate panel has found that troubled investment bank Credit Suisse concealed information during previous inquiries into Nazi-controlled bank accounts during World War II. Tens of thousands of documents discovered during an ongoing examination have provided new proof of the existence of account holders linked to the Nazis, the Senate Budget Committee said in a statement released Saturday. The bank did not reveal the existence of these accounts during previous investigations, notably in the 1990s, the committee said. Credit Suisse, now a subsidiary of investment bank UBS, agreed in 1998 to take part in a $1.25 billion settlement of lawsuits brought by Holocaust survivors, but it has been accused of not being completely open about its past dealings with Nazis. The Senate committee said Saturday that one set of newly discovered files, including 3,600 physical documents and 40,000 microfilms, was found to have a 'high relevance rate' of Nazi connections. It said the revelations stem from an interim report by former prosecutor Neil Barofsky, who was fired as an 'independent ombudsperson' by the bank in 2022 after being pressed to limit his investigative work. Barofsky was reinstated in the role in 2023 'as a result of the committee's investigation,' and after UBS's takeover of Credit Suisse. In a letter to the panel released Saturday, Barofsky noted the 'extraordinary level of cooperation that Credit Suisse, under the leadership of UBS, has provided' since he rejoined the company. But he said Credit Suisse had yet to share all the information it held. The Barofsky team has discovered, among other things, accounts controlled by high-ranking SS officers, The Wall Street Journal reported. In his letter, Barofsky highlighted 'especially noteworthy' discoveries from a Credit Suisse research department. 'Numerous client files in the sample are marked with a stamp stating 'Amerikanische schwarze Liste' — meaning 'American Black List' — a list maintained by the Allies of individuals and companies that were directly financed by, or were known to regularly trade with, Axis powers,' he wrote. 'One file bearing this stamp relates to an entity that was involved in selling looted Jewish assets,' he added. Contacted by AFP, UBS said it was committed to providing a complete record of the former Nazi-linked accounts in Credit Suisse's predecessor banks. It said it would provide Barofsky with all necessary assistance in his work to shed light 'on this tragic period.' The Senate panel's investigation is continuing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-finds-more-records-found-linking-credit-suisse-nazi-accounts/7924755.html	2025-01-04T17:16:44-08:00	
Tesla data helped police after truck explosion; experts have privacy concerns	NEW YORK — Your car is spying on you. That is one takeaway from the fast, detailed data that Tesla collected on the driver of one of its Cybertrucks that exploded in Las Vegas, Nevada, earlier this week. Privacy data experts say the deep dive by Elon Musk's company was impressive but also shines a spotlight on a difficult question as vehicles become less like cars and more like computers on wheels. 'You might want law enforcement to have the data to crack down on criminals but can anyone have access to it?' said Jodi Daniels, CEO of privacy consulting firm Red Clover Advisors. Many of the latest cars not only know where you've been and where you are going, but also often have access to your contacts, your call logs, your texts and other sensitive information thanks to cell phone syncing. The data collected by Musk's electric car company after the Cybertruck packed with fireworks burst into flames in front of the Trump International Hotel Wednesday proved valuable to police in helping track the driver's movements. Within hours of the New Year's Day explosion that burned the driver beyond recognition and injured seven, Tesla was able to track Matthew Livelsberger's movements in detail from Denver to Las Vegas — and confirm that the problem was explosives in the truck, not the truck itself. Tesla used data collected from charging stations and from onboard software. 'I have to thank Elon Musk, specifically,' said Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department Sheriff Kevin McMahill to reporters. Some privacy experts were less enthusiastic. 'It reveals the kind of sweeping surveillance going on,' said David Choffnes, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Privacy Institute at Northeastern University in Boston. 'When something bad happens, it's helpful, but it's a double-edged sword. Companies that collect this data can abuse it.' General Motors, for instance, was sued in August by the Texas attorney general for allegedly selling data from 1.8 million drivers to insurance companies without their consent. Cars equipped with cameras to enable self-driving features have added a new security risk. Tesla itself came under fire after Reuters reported how employees from 2019 through 2022 shared drivers' sensitive videos and recordings with each other, including videos of road rage incidents and, in one case, nudity. Tesla did not respond to emailed questions about its privacy policy. On its website, Tesla says it follows strict rules for keeping names and information private. 'No one but you would have knowledge of your activities, location, or a history of where you've been,' according to a statement. 'Your information is kept private and secure.' Auto analyst Sam Abuelsamid at Telemetry Insight, said he doesn't think Tesla is 'especially worse' than other auto companies in handling customer data, but he is still concerned. 'This is one of the biggest ethical issues we have around modern vehicles. They're connected,' he said. 'Consumers need to have control over their data.' Tensions were high when the Cybertruck parked at the front doors of Trump's hotel began smoking, then burst into flames. Just hours earlier, a driver in another vehicle using the same peer-to-peer car rental service, Turo, had killed 15 people after slamming into a crowd in New Orleans, Louisiana, in what law enforcement is calling a terrorist attack. Shortly before 1 p.m., the Las Vegas police announced they were investigating a second incident. 'The whole Tesla senior team is investigating this matter right now,' Musk wrote on X. 'Will post more information as soon as we learn anything.' Over the next few hours, Tesla was able to piece together Livelsberger's journey over five days and four states by tracking, among other things, his recharging stops in various locations, including Monument, Colorado, Albuquerque, New Mexico, and Flagstaff, Arizona.	https://www.voanews.com/a/tesla-data-helped-police-after-truck-explosion-experts-have-privacy-concerns-/7924749.html	2025-01-04T17:09:32-08:00	
Drivers skid, crash as winter storm grips central US	MISSION, KANSAS — Road conditions were deteriorating Saturday in the central U.S. as a winter storm brought a mix of snow, ice and plunging temperatures, with forecasts calling for the dreaded combo to spread eastward in the coming days. 'Winter returned,' said Bob Oravec, lead forecaster at the National Weather Service in College Park, Maryland. The polar vortex of ultra-cold air usually stays penned up around the North Pole, spinning like a top. But sometimes it escapes or stretches down to the U.S., Europe or Asia — and that's when large numbers of people experience intense doses of cold. Studies show a fast-warming Arctic gets some of the blame for the increase in polar vortex stretching or wandering. Snow and ice in forecast By Saturday evening, widespread heavy snow was likely between central Kansas and Indiana, especially along and north of Interstate 70, where there was a high chance of at least 20 centimeters of snow. Part of the interstate was closed in central Kansas by the afternoon. The storm was forecast to move then into the Ohio Valley, with severe travel disruptions expected. It will reach the Mid-Atlantic states Sunday into Monday, with a hard freeze expected as far south as Florida. Severe thunderstorms, with the possibility of tornadoes and hail, were also possible ahead of the storm system's cold front as it crosses the Lower Mississippi Valley, the National Weather Service warned. Car wrecks A fire truck, several tractor-trailers and passenger vehicles overturned west of Salina, Kansas. Rigs also jackknifed and went into ditches, state Highway Patrol Trooper Ben Gardner said. He posted a video showing his boots sliding across the highway blacktop like an ice-skating rink. 'We are in it now,' Gardner said as he drove to the scene of an accident. Online, he begged for prayers and warned that some roadways were nearly impassable. Freezing rain in Wichita, Kansas, sent authorities to multiple crashes in the morning, and police urged drivers to stay home if possible and watch out for emergency vehicles. Governors in neighboring Missouri and nearby Arkansas declared states of emergency. Whiteout conditions threatened to make driving dangerous to impossible and heighten the risk of becoming stranded, forecasters warned. Getting ready Stores in Wichita were filled with shoppers stocking up on groceries in advance of the storm, and warming centers opened in churches and libraries. Several businesses closed across the Kansas City area, and the school district in suburban Independence, Missouri, said it might need to cancel classes for one or more days. 'Get where you're going now & stay put. If you must travel, consider packing a bag & staying where you're headed,' the Missouri Department of Transportation said in a message on the social platform X. The agency warned Friday that a shortage of workers could hamper the ability to clear roads. In Columbus, Ohio, crews treated major roadways with anti-icing liquids. 'It will be a major headache,' said Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather. 'The storm not only has the snow threat to it but the ice threat.' Power outages could be significant particularly south of the Kansas City area, Kines said. Temperatures dip Starting Monday, the eastern two-thirds of the country will experience dangerous, bone-chilling cold and wind chills, forecasters said. Temperatures could be 7 to 14 degrees Celsius below normal as the polar vortex stretches down from the high Arctic. In Chicago on Saturday, temperatures hovered near minus 7-10 Celsius and around minus 18 C in Minneapolis, while dropping to minus 25 C at International Falls, Minnesota, on the Canadian border. Disruptions extend southward Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin declared a state of emergency Friday evening ahead of the storm and noted it could impact people's ability to vote in the state's special elections Tuesday. In a statement on X, he encouraged residents to vote Saturday before the bad weather arrives. A similar declaration was issued in Maryland, where officials in the historic state capital near Chesapeake Bay asked residents to remove vehicles from emergency snow routes. Annapolis also announced plans to open several garages on Sunday for free parking. The National Weather Service predicted about 20 to 30 centimeters of snow for the Annapolis area, with temperatures remaining below freezing throughout the weekend. In Baltimore, an extreme weather alert was issued instructing agencies to provide shelter and assistance for those in need. City officials said wind chills were expected to dip to minus 10.56 degrees Celsius overnight Saturday and remain in the teens through Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drivers-skid-crash-as-winter-storm-grips-central-us/7924750.html	2025-01-04T17:07:29-08:00	
Blinken heads to South Korea, Japan, France	WASHINGTON — Secretary of State Antony Blinken will embark on what is expected to be his final overseas trip in office this weekend, traveling to South Korea, Japan and France. The State Department announced Friday that Blinken would visit Seoul, South Korean, Tokyo and Paris beginning Sunday. In South Korea, which is in the midst of political turmoil following the impeachment of President Yoon Suk Yeol, and Japan, Blinken intends to highlight the expansion of U.S. cooperation with both nations as part of the Biden administration's Indo-Pacific strategy. That strategy is primarily intended to blunt Chinese ambitions in the region but also to deter the nuclear threat from North Korea. Political developments in South Korea, however, after Yoon declared martial law and was later impeached, have raised questions about the stability of Washington-Seoul relations. The U.S. has taken a cautious approach to the uncertainty, insisting that the U.S.-South Korea alliance remains intact and iron-clad. Blinken will speak with South Korean officials about how 'to build on our critical cooperation on challenges around the world based on our shared values,' the State Department said in a statement. In Tokyo, Blinken will 'review the tremendous progress the U.S.-Japan alliance has made over the past few years,' the statement said. That includes a major arms sales approval announced on Friday under which the U.S. will deliver some $3.64 billion in medium-range missiles, related equipment and training to Japan. China has repeatedly complained about the potential sale, saying it will affect stability and security in the region, allegations that both Japan and the U.S. reject. Blinken will wrap up his trip in Paris in meetings with French officials to discuss developments in the Middle East and European security, particularly in Ukraine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-heads-to-south-korea-japan-france-/7924746.html	2025-01-04T16:47:22-08:00	
Exiled Venezuelan opposition leader to visit US, speak with Biden	BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — Venezuelan opposition politician Edmundo Gonzalez Urrutia, who fled the country after a tumultuous election and subsequent police crackdown, said Saturday he plans to speak with U.S. President Joe Biden. Speaking in Argentina, where he met with President Javier Milei, Gonzalez added that he was traveling to the United States on Sunday, though it was unclear when the conversation with Biden would take place. 'We are planning a conversation with President Biden, and we are waiting for definitions regarding the new authorities,' Gonzalez said in the Argentine capital, Buenos Aires, referring to incoming President-elect Donald Trump, who is set to take over on January 20. Gonzalez's meeting with Milei came at the start of a regional tour aimed at building international support for the man Venezuela's opposition considers the rightful president-elect. The 75-year-old appeared alongside Milei on a balcony of the Casa Rosada, the Argentine president's official workplace, as hundreds of Venezuelans gathered below on the Plaza de Mayo chanted 'Venezuela, you are not alone!' The appearance came just days before Gonzalez's rival, Nicolas Maduro, is set to be sworn in for a third presidential term in Caracas. The United States, the European Union and dozens of other countries say Venezuelan election officials manipulated the vote results, which they have yet to publish in detail, of the July 28 elections. Some countries instead have recognized Gonzalez as the winner. Gonzalez arrived in Buenos Aires quietly from Madrid, where he has lived in exile since fleeing Venezuela in September. Authorities in Caracas have offered a reward of $100,000 for information leading to his capture. Street protests erupted after the election and degenerated into clashes with police, with 28 people dead, 200 injured and more than 2,400 arrested. Gonzalez's schedule calls for him to visit Uruguay late Saturday, Panama on Wednesday and the Dominican Republic the day after. He has said he will be in Caracas on January 10 to be sworn in as president. It remains unclear how the Maduro government will respond. Gonzalez's visit to Argentina came amid heightened bilateral tensions following the arrest in Venezuela of an Argentine policeman on what Buenos Aires says are trumped up charges of terrorism. The relationship was already strained following an exchange of insults and, ultimately, Argentina's refusal to recognize Maduro's victory claim. The Argentine Embassy in Caracas has also been sheltering six opposition figures accused of 'terrorism,' a matter Gonzalez had said he would take up with Milei.	https://www.voanews.com/a/exiled-venezuelan-opposition-leader-to-visit-us-speak-with-biden-/7924744.html	2025-01-04T16:34:22-08:00	
Biden honors Clinton, Bono, Goodall, others for contributions	WASHINGTON — In the East Room of the White House on a particularly frigid Saturday afternoon, President Joe Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom to 19 of the most famous names in politics, sports, entertainment, civil rights, LGBTQ+ advocacy and science. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton aroused a standing ovation from the crowd as she received her medal. Clinton was accompanied to the event by her husband former President Bill Clinton, daughter Chelsea Clinton and grandchildren. Democratic philanthropist George Soros and actor-director Denzel Washington were also awarded the nation's highest civilian honor in a White House ceremony. 'For the final time as president I have the honor [of] bestowing the Medal of Freedom, our nation's highest civilian honor, on a group of extraordinary, truly extraordinary people, who gave their sacred effort, their sacred effort, to shape the culture and the cause of America,' Biden said in his opening remarks. 'Let me just say to each of you, thank you, thank you, thank you for all you've done to help this country,' Biden said Saturday. 4 medals awarded posthumously Four medals were awarded posthumously. They went to George W. Romney, who served as both a Michigan governor and secretary of housing and urban development; former Attorney General and Senator Robert F. Kennedy; Ash Carter, a former secretary of defense; and Fannie Lou Hamer, who founded the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party and laid the groundwork for the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Kennedy is father to Robert F. Kennedy Jr., President-elect Donald Trump's nominee for health and human services secretary. Biden said, 'Bobby is one of my true political heroes. I love and I miss him dearly.' Romney is the father of former Utah Republican Senator Mitt Romney, one of Trump's strongest conservative critics. Recipients made 'exemplary contributions' Biden has days left in the presidential office and has spent the last few days issuing awards and medals to valiant military veterans, courageous law enforcement officials and exceptional Americans. The White House said the Medal of Freedom recipients have made 'exemplary contributions to the prosperity, values, or security of the United States, world peace, or other significant societal, public or private endeavors.' Major philanthropists receiving the award include Spanish American chef Jose Andres, whose World Central Kitchen charity has become one of the world's most recognized food relief organizations, and Bono, the front man for rock band U2 and a social justice activist. Soros' son Alex Soros accepted the medal on his father's behalf. In an emailed statement, Soros said: 'As an immigrant who found freedom and prosperity in America, I am deeply moved by this honor.' Sports and entertainment stars recognized include professional soccer player Lionel Messi, who did not attend the event; retired Los Angeles Lakers basketball legend and businessman Earvin 'Magic' Johnson; actor Michael J. Fox, who is an outspoken advocate for Parkinson's disease research and development; and William Sanford Nye, known to generations of students as 'Bill Nye the Science Guy.' Other awardees include conservationist Jane Goodall; longtime Vogue magazine editor-in-chief Anna Wintour; American fashion designer Ralph Lauren; American Film Institute founder George Stevens Jr.; entrepreneur and LGBTQ+ activist Tim Gill; and David Rubenstein, co-founder of The Carlyle Group global investment firm. Lauren is the first fashion designer to receive the honor. Last year, Biden bestowed the Presidential Medal of Freedom on 19 people, including the late Medgar Evers, House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Representative James Clyburn of South Carolina and actor Michelle Yeoh. The Presidential Medal of Freedom was awarded 654 times between 1963 and 2024, according to the Congressional Research Service. Notable Medal of Freedom recipients from the past include Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., Maya Angelou and Mother Teresa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-honors-clinton-bono-goodall-others-for-contributions/7924573.html	2025-01-04T15:14:35-08:00	
Austrian Chancellor Nehammer to resign after 'new government' talks fail	VIENNA — Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer said Saturday he will resign in the coming days after talks on forming a new government failed a second time. The announcement came after the People's Party and the Social Democrats continued coalition talks a day after the liberal Neos party's surprise withdrawal from discussions. 'Unfortunately, I have to tell you today that the negotiations have ended and will not be continued by the People's Party,' Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer from the conservative People's Party said in a statement on social media. He said that 'destructive forces' in the Social Democratic Party have 'gained the upper hand' and that the People's Party will not sign on to a program that is against economic competitiveness. Social democratic leader Andreas Babler said he regretted the decision by the People's Party to end the negotiations. 'This is not a good decision for our country,' he said. Babler said that one of the main stumbling blocks had to do with how to repair the 'record deficit' left by the previous government. 'I have offered to Karl Nehammer and the People's Party to continue negotiating and called on them not to get up,' he told reporters Saturday evening. The next government in Austria faces the challenge of having to save between 18 to 24 billion euros, according to the EU Commission. In addition, Austria, which has been in a recession for the past two years, is experiencing rising unemployment and its budget deficit is currently at 3.7% of Gross Domestic Product — above the EU's limit of 3%. The talks had dragged on since Austria's president tasked the conservative chancellor in October with putting together a new government. The request came after all other parties refused to work with the leader of the far-right Freedom Party, which in September won a national election for the first time with 29.2% of the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/austrian-chancellor-nehammer-to-resign-after-new-government-talks-fail-/7924534.html	2025-01-04T13:09:19-08:00	
Deadly bomb targets convoy carrying Pakistan security forces	ISLAMABAD — Police in southwestern Pakistan said Saturday that at least four people were killed and dozens more were injured when a bomb explosion targeted both civilian and security forces vehicles. The deadly attack occurred in the city of Turbat in the sparsely populated Balochistan province, which is well-known for its abundant natural resources. Most of the victims were reportedly members of the Frontier Corps paramilitary force. The FC protects Pakistan's borders and handles counterinsurgency operations. Rabia Tariq, a spokesperson for the provincial police, confirmed the casualty toll to the English-language DAWN newspaper. Witness accounts and footage from the scene showed a convoy of vehicles traversing the city when an explosion erupted, engulfing one vehicle in flames. An area police officer, Roshan Baloch, told VOA by phone that an explosive device was concealed within a car parked on the roadside and detonated remotely. He said that several of the wounded people were transferred to a local hospital in critical condition. The Baloch Liberation Army, a separatist organization, swiftly claimed responsibility for the attack, asserting that one of its suicide bombers was the perpetrator. The veracity of the claim could not be ascertained immediately. Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif condemned the bombing and expressed his condolences to the families of those 'martyred in the bomb explosion,' his office said in a statement in Islamabad, the national capital. Balochistan, the largest province in Pakistan, has regularly experienced attacks claimed by or blamed on the BLA and several smaller ethnic Baloch separatist groups. The insurgents justify their violent campaign, saying they are fighting for the independence of the province from Pakistan. Separately, authorities in northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province reported a gun attack on a government convoy en route to the besieged Kurram district on the Afghan border. The district deputy commissioner was among at least four individuals injured in the attack. The victims were on their way to oversee the distribution of essential supplies, including food, fuel, and medicine, to hundreds of thousands of residents of Kurram, which has been the scene of months of violent clashes between its heavily armed Shiite and Sunni Muslim tribes in connection with a land dispute. The violence has left hundreds of people dead and injured in recent months. The latest clashes between the rival groups prompted the provincial government to close all roads leading in and out of Kurram for weeks. A peace deal brokered between the warring sides earlier in the week had raised hopes of sending essential supplies into the district, but Saturday's gun attack forced authorities to halt the aid convoy. There were no claims of responsibility for the shooting incident. Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, both bordering Afghanistan, have experienced a dramatic surge in militant attacks over the past year, killing more than 1,600 Pakistani civilians and security forces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-bomb-targets-convoy-carrying-pakistan-security-forces/7924528.html	2025-01-04T12:45:12-08:00	
Russia-appointed officials in Crimea declare emergency; oil spill reaches Sevastopol	Russia-appointed officials in Moscow-occupied Crimea announced a regional emergency Saturday, as oil was detected on the shores of Sevastopol, the peninsula's largest city. Fuel oil spilled out of two storm-stricken tankers nearly three weeks ago in the Kerch Strait, close to eastern Crimea — about 250 kilometers from Sevastopol, which lies on the southwest of the peninsula. 'Today a regional emergency regime has been declared in Sevastopol,' regional Governor Mikhail Razvozhaev wrote on Telegram. Oil was found on four beaches in the region and was 'promptly eliminated' by local authorities working together with volunteers, Razvozhaev said. 'Let me emphasize: there is no mass pollution of the coastline in Sevastopol,' he wrote. Razvozhaev's announcement came after authorities in Russia's southern Krasnodar region announced a region-wide emergency last week, as the fuel oil continued washing up on the coastline 10 days after one tanker ran aground and the other was left damaged and adrift on December 15. Krasnodar regional Governor Veniamin Kondratyev said that almost 7,000 people were still working Saturday to clean up the spill. More than 96,000 tons of contaminated sand and soil have been removed along the region's shoreline since the original spill, he wrote on Telegram. On December 23, the ministry estimated that up to 200,000 tons in total may have been contaminated with mazut, a heavy, low-quality oil product. Russian President Vladimir Putin has called the oil spill an 'ecological disaster.' The Kerch Strait, which separates the Russia-occupied Crimean Peninsula from the Krasnodar region, is an important global shipping route, providing passage from the inland Sea of Azov to the Black Sea. It has also been a key point of conflict between Russia and Ukraine after Moscow annexed the peninsula in 2014. In 2016, Ukraine took Moscow to the Permanent Court of Arbitration, where it accused Russia of trying to seize control of the area illegally. In 2021, Russia closed the strait for several months. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to the head of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's office, described the oil spill last month as a 'large-scale environmental disaster' and called for additional sanctions on Russian tankers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-appointed-officials-in-crimea-declare-emergency-oil-spill-reaches-sevastopol/7924513.html	2025-01-04T12:15:25-08:00	
Taiwan: China ups efforts to undermine democracy with disinformation	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan’s government says China is redoubling efforts to undermine confidence in the self-governing island’s democracy and close ties with the United States through the spread of disinformation, especially online. The National Security Bureau said the number of pieces of false or biased information distributed by China increased 60% last year, to 2.16 million from 1.33 million in 2023. The brief report issued Friday tallied 'pieces of controversial information,' but did not further define the term. Facebook and X, formerly known as Twitter, were the main conduits for disinformation, along with platforms that explicitly target young people such as TikTok, the report said. China created 'inauthentic accounts' to distribute its propaganda on YouTube, used technology such as AI to create fake videos and flooded comments sections with pro-China statements, the report said. China has for years used global social media platforms to spread official messages and misinformation even while banning them inside the country. Beijing already has considerable influence with Taiwanese newspapers and other traditional media through their owners' business interests in mainland China. China claims Taiwan as its own territory to be brought under its control by force, if necessary, with Chinese leader Xi Jinping renewing a declaration in his New Year's address that unification with Taiwan was inevitable and could not be blocked by outside forces, a likely reference to the U.S., Taiwan’s most important ally. China regularly sends warplanes, ships and balloons into areas controlled by Taiwan and holds military drills to simulate a blockade or invasion of the island. Beijing has also been building up its navy and missile forces to hit key targets and fend off American military support. Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te said in his own New Year's address that the island would continue to strengthen its defenses in the face of escalating Chinese threats. Taiwan, he said, was a crucial part of the global 'line of defense of democracy' against authoritarian states such as China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-china-ups-efforts-to-undermine-democracy-with-disinformation/7924490.html	2025-01-04T11:00:59-08:00	
Malaysia turns away 2 boats with nearly 300 Rohingya refugees	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — Malaysian authorities said Saturday that they have turned away two boats carrying nearly 300 people believed to be Muslim Rohingya refugees who were found to have entered the country illegally. The Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency said that it had information that two more boats were attempting to enter the country after a boatload of 196 Rohingya landed early Friday on a beach on the northeastern resort island of Langkawi. They were all detained by authorities. The agency said authorities had detected the other two boats later Friday off Langkawi. It said the people on the two boats, also believed to be Rohingya, were reported to be exhausted and lacked sufficient food and water supplies. Maritime Enforcement Agency chief Mohamad Rosli Abdullah said in a statement that assistance has been provided to the two boats, including food supplies and drinking water, before they were escorted out of the country to continue their journey. It didn't say where the boats were heading, and no further details were given. There were also no details about where they came from, but many Rohingya living in refugee camps in Bangladesh have been lured by traffickers to leave to seek a better life elsewhere. Bangladesh hosts more than 1 million Rohingya refugees who fled ethnic and religious violence in Myanmar. Malaysia is a popular destination because of its dominant Malay Muslim population. Many Rohingya fled a brutal counterinsurgency campaign in 2017 by Myanmar’s security forces, who were accused of committing mass rapes and killings. While Malaysia has accepted Rohingya in the past on humanitarian grounds, the country has tried to limit numbers because of fears of a mass influx of people arriving on boats. As of the end of November, there were around 111,410 Rohingya refugees and asylum-seekers registered with the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in Malaysia. This makes up about 58% of the total refugee population in Malaysia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-turns-away-2-boats-with-nearly-300-rohingya-refugees/7924485.html	2025-01-04T10:48:34-08:00	
Four people shot in new attack to Indigenous land in Brazil	SAO PAULO — Four Indigenous people, including a child, were shot during an attack in southern Brazil late on Friday, federal police and an Indigenous rights organization said on Saturday, as violence escalates in the region. Attackers opened fire against the Indigenous community near the city of Guaira, in the southern Parana state, injuring four people, who were later hospitalized, the police said. The attack was aimed at the Ava Guarani people, who have been the target of previous assaults since Dec. 29, said the Missionary Council for Indigenous Peoples, or CIMI, an organization linked to the Catholic Bishops Conference of Brazil. A 4-year-old child shot in the leg was sent to a nearby hospital in the city of Toledo, alongside two other people, one hit in the leg and the other in the back, said CIMI. The group said a fourth person, shot in the jaw, was sent to a hospital in Cascavel, one of the largest cities in the state. The police said they have started investigations to track down the attackers, adding that federal, state and municipal security forces were deployed to avoid new violence in the region, which has historically faced land conflicts. Two members of the Ava Guarani people were injured in the last days of 2024, said CIMI, with one having been shot in the arm. The Ministry of Indigenous Affairs condemned the acts of violence against the Ava Guarani people, saying it is in talks with the Ministry of Justice and Public Security for the immediate investigation of armed groups acting in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/four-people-shot-in-new-attack-to-indigenous-land-in-brazil/7924480.html	2025-01-04T10:40:32-08:00	
Pope Francis: Bullying at school prepares students for war, not peace	VATICAN CITY — Pope Francis warned that bullying in schools prepares students for war rather than peace, in a speech to Catholic educators gathered at the Vatican on Saturday. Speaking to about 2,000 Italian educators and parents, Francis stressed his message against bullying, asking the audience to pledge to fight against it both at school and at home. The pontiff praised educational efforts at schools to promote peace, noting that 'imagining peace' lays the foundations for 'a more just and fraternal world' through 'every subject taught and through the creativity of children and young people.' 'But if, at school, you wage war among yourselves or engage in bullying, you are preparing for war, not for peace,' he said The pope also called for more dialogue within families, emphasizing that 'it is dialogue that makes us grow.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/pope-francis-bullying-at-school-prepares-students-for-war-not-peace/7924473.html	2025-01-04T10:33:26-08:00	
Prince William saddened by death of former nanny's stepson in New Orleans attack	LONDON — Prince William expressed his shock and sadness Saturday at the news of the death of his former nanny’s stepson in the New Year's truck attack in New Orleans that killed 14 people. London’s Metropolitan Police confirmed Saturday that they are supporting the family of 31-year-old Edward Pettifer, including helping them through the process of returning his body to the United Kingdom. Pettifer, who is from west London, is the final victim to be identified. In a statement on social media, the Prince of Wales said he and his wife, Catherine, were 'shocked and saddened by the tragic death of Ed Pettifer. Our thoughts and prayers remain with the Pettifer family and all those innocent people who have been tragically impacted by this horrific attack.' Pettifer was the stepson of Tiggy Legge-Bourke, who was the nanny for William and his brother, Prince Harry, between 1993 and 1999, which included the time after the death of their mother, Princess Diana, in 1997. Legge-Bourke, who is also known as Alexandra Pettifer, was regularly photographed with Diana. British media also reported that King Charles III is said to be deeply saddened by the news and that he has sent his condolences to Pettifer's family. In a statement, Pettifer’s family said they were 'devastated at the tragic news of Ed’s death' and described him as 'a wonderful son, brother, grandson, nephew and a friend to so many.' 'We will all miss him terribly. Our thoughts are with the other families who have lost their family members due to this terrible attack,' the family added. Authorities say 14 people were killed and about 30 were injured in the attack early Wednesday by Shamsud-Din Jabbar, a former U.S. Army soldier who posted several videos on his Facebook account hours before the attack previewing the violence he would unleash and proclaiming his support for the Islamic State militant group. The coroner’s office listed the cause of death for all 14 victims as 'blunt force injuries.' Jabbar, 42, was fatally shot in a firefight with police at the scene of the deadly crash on Bourbon Street, famous worldwide for its festive vibes in New Orleans’ historic French Quarter.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7924469.html	2025-01-04T10:26:24-08:00	
Ethiopia evacuates 80,000 after earthquakes, fears of volcanic eruption	Ethiopia’s government said it is evacuating approximately 80,000 people following a series of small-scale earthquakes in the Afar, Oromia and Amhara regions. At least 10 earthquakes were reported in Ethiopia since Friday, and there are signs of possible volcanic activity. The latest earthquakes shook the Awash Fentale district, which stretches between the Afar and Oromia regions, at 3:52 a.m. Saturday. The United States Geological Survey recorded an earthquake measuring a magnitude of 5.8 about 56 kilometers (35 miles) southeast of Ambosa, in the Oromia region, in the early hours of Saturday. Atalay Ayele, head of the Seismology Department and a professor of seismic science at Addis Ababa University, says the epicenter was in the middle of Dofen Mountain, Awash Fentale district, in the Afar region. Just hours later a second tremor, measured at 4.7, was reported about 10 kilometers (6 miles) east of Awash in the Afar region. 'The events are increasing in size and frequency from time to time. In particular, this week, data shows that an earthquake measuring up to 5.8 on the Richter scale,' according to a statement issued by the federal government Saturday. The earthquake was felt in the capital, Addis Ababa, and cities such as Adama and Metehara. Residents living in condos and high-rise buildings felt it, too, reports say. As many as two dozen quakes and aftershocks were reported in Awash Fentale district since September, according to residents and officials. In the Afar region, frequent quakes created a natural hot spring water crater that is reportedly widening. No casualties were reported, but the quakes damaged dozens of homes in Afar. Fears of volcanic eruptions Friday’s tremor in Afar resulted in fears of volcanic eruptions after smoke came from vents in the Dofen volcano, signaling potential volcanic activity. 'The government is closely monitoring the events with experts in the field. In addition, it has identified the epicenter of the earthquake and deployed emergency workers from various fields in 12 kebeles [districts] to assess the extent of the damage,' the statement from Ethiopia’s government said. 'It is making great efforts to identify the most vulnerable among the 80,000 citizens living in those kebeles and to evacuate them from the area. It is also monitoring the possible impact of the earthquake on social service institutions, economic institutions, and infrastructure.' The Ethiopian Disaster Risk Management Commission announced in a statement issued on Saturday that over 51,000 residents in the Afar and Oromia regions are at risk due to recurring earthquakes in the past two months. To mitigate the risk, more than 13,000 people have already been relocated to safer areas, the commission said. In the Fentale district of the Oromia region, over 16,000 residents face similar risks, with more than 7,000 of them relocated to secure locations, the statement added. Some residents in the affected towns said they left their homes after the quake. Zumara Mamo is a resident of Abomsa, where the quake was felt. She says the earthquake happened while she was asleep. 'I was sleeping on the floor with my child. Suddenly I felt the Earth beneath me shaking. The shock displaced the glass on my door,' she told VOA’s Horn of Africa Service. According to Zumara, the shock lasted nearly a minute and was greater than the previous shock reported in the area in October. Fentale district in the Oromia region lies less than 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the epicenter of the Saturday morning earthquake near Abomsa town. Abayneh Urgo, who lives in Fentale district, said a strong earthquake shock was felt in his town and now residents are sleeping outside. Efrem Wakjira, who lives near German Square in Addis Ababa, said earthquakes have been frequent this week. 'The shock of the earthquake has been common during the past five days, but Saturday morning was quite strong. It happened at around 4 a.m. local time, and I was awakened from sleeping by the shock.' The government said the earthquake has not yet had a significant impact on major towns and has urged citizens to 'follow and strictly implement the precautionary messages issued by experts.' Ethiopian cities are vulnerable to quakes Ethiopian experts have warned that many buildings in the country, particularly in Addis Ababa, are highly vulnerable to earthquakes. Esayas Gebreyohannes, an associate professor of civil and environmental engineering at Addis Ababa University’s Institute of Technology, said Ethiopia introduced building code standards in 1983 that need updating every 10 to 20 years, with the next update scheduled this year. 'Despite these updates, significant gaps persist in adherence to the standards during building design and construction,' he said. 'Many buildings evaluated at Addis Ababa University reveal design faults due to noncompliance with the standards. Additionally, construction materials and workmanship often fall short of required quality levels. Most buildings in Addis Ababa exhibit these deficiencies, compromising their safety and quality,' Esayas said. 'The recent frequent earthquake[s] is a sign that we are living in an active volcanic area,' professor Ayele told VOA by phone. 'The state should be careful while building infrastructures at those places. The relief agencies should stand by, and the public must also get awareness regarding the shocks,' he said. Government engineers say plans are underway to reinforce major public buildings to withstand high-magnitude earthquakes. Engineer Mesfin Negewo, director general of the Ethiopian Construction Authority, acknowledged growing concerns over the increasing frequency of earthquakes. 'We have observed frequent seismic activity over the past two months, and we are actively assessing the situation,' he said by phone to VOA. He said to address the emerging risks — the government has established task forces to study the situation and monitor incidents closely. 'These teams will present a comprehensive report to authorities,' he said. VOA’s Kennedy Abate and Mesfin Aragie contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ethiopia-evacuates-80-000-after-earthquakes-fears-of-volcanic-eruption/7924462.html	2025-01-04T10:15:59-08:00	
Market fire in northern China kills at least 8, injures 15	BEIJING — A fire at a food market Saturday in northern China killed at least eight people and injured 15 others, state media said. The fire at the Liguang market in the city of Zhangjiakou, northwest of Beijing, broke out midday Saturday and was mostly extinguished by 2 p.m., Xinhua News Agency reported, citing a government official in the Qiaoxi District, where the market is located. 'The injured have been sent to hospital for treatment and are currently not in life-threatening danger,' the government official said. The cause of the fire is under investigation. Such traditional markets are often tightly packed with shoppers seeking prices lower than at supermarket chains. Fire sources can range from gas bottles to charcoal used to roast meat and discarded cigarettes while aging infrastructure, such as underground gas lines, has also been blamed for fires and explosions. Footage shared online and geolocated by Agence France-Presse showed people outside the market fleeing the blaze while thick smoke billowed skyward. Other videos showed firefighters battling the flames and carrying victims away from the scene. Deadly fires are relatively common in China due to lax building codes and an often-slipshod approach to workplace safety. A blaze in the major city of Chengdu in October left 24 people hospitalized with breathing difficulties, state media reported. In July, a fire at a shopping center in the southwestern city of Zigong killed 16 people. Zhangjiakou, located in Hebei province bordering Beijing, hosted events during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games. Some information in this report is from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/market-fire-in-northern-china-kills-at-least-8-injures-15/7924445.html	2025-01-04T09:48:32-08:00	
Biden notifies Congress of planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel	WASHINGTON — The U.S. State Department has informed Congress of a planned $8 billion weapons sale to Israel, U.S. officials say, as the American ally presses forward with its war against Hamas in Gaza. Some of the arms in the package could be sent from current U.S. stocks, but the majority would take a year or several years to deliver, according to two U.S. officials Saturday who spoke on condition of anonymity because the notification to Congress hasn't been formally sent. The sale includes medium-range air-to-air missiles to help Israel defend against airborne threats, 155 mm projectile artillery shells for long-range targeting, Hellfire AGM-114 missiles, 500-pound bombs and more. The weapons package would add to a record of at least $17.9 billion in military aid that the U.S. has provided Israel since the Hamas terror attack on Oct. 7, 2023, launched the war. The United States, Britain and other Western nations designate Hamas as a terror group. The Biden administration has faced criticism over the mounting number of deaths of Palestinian civilians. There have been demonstrations on college campuses and unsuccessful efforts in Congress by Senator Bernie Sanders and some Democrats to block sales of offensive weapons to Israel. The United States paused a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel in May over concerns about civilian casualties if the bombs were to be used during an assault on the southern Gaza city of Rafah. The Biden administration has demanded that Israel increase humanitarian aid into the enclave. But in November, citing some limited progress, it declined to limit arms transfers as it threatened to do if the situation did not improve. In recent days, Israel has been conducting airstrikes in Gaza that have killed dozens of people, adding to the tens of thousands of deaths since the war began more than a year ago. The Israeli army said Friday that it had struck dozens of Hamas gathering points and command centers throughout Gaza. Israel’s military says it targets only militants and blames Hamas for civilian deaths because its fighters operate in dense residential areas. The war has caused widespread destruction and displaced about 90% of Gaza’s population of 2.3 million, many of them multiple times. Winter has now arrived, and hundreds of thousands are sheltering in tents near the sea. The informal notice to Congress isn’t the final notification before a sale. Now the leaders of the House Foreign Affairs Committee or the Senate Foreign Relations Committee can review the package. News of the weapons sale was first reported by Axios.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-notifies-congress-of-planned-8-billion-weapons-sale-to-israel/7924437.html	2025-01-04T09:40:58-08:00	
New Orleans attacker had suspected bomb materials at home, officials say	NEW ORLEANS, LOUISIANA — The man who rammed a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year's revelers in New Orleans had suspected bomb-making materials at his home and reserved the vehicle used in the deadly attack more than six weeks earlier, law enforcement officials told The Associated Press on Friday. Federal authorities searching the home of Shamsud-Din Jabbar in Houston found a workbench in the garage and hazardous materials believed to have been used to make explosive devices, according to law enforcement officials familiar with the search. The officials were not authorized to speak about the ongoing inquiry and spoke to the AP on the condition of anonymity. The FBI investigation also revealed that Jabbar purchased a cooler in Vidor, Texas, hours before the attack and gun oil from a store in Sulphur, Louisiana, the officials said. Authorities also determined Jabbar booked his rental of the pickup truck on Nov. 14, suggesting he may have been plotting the attack for more than six weeks. Authorities say 14 people were killed and some 30 were injured in the attack early Wednesday by Jabbar, a former Army soldier who posted several videos on his Facebook hours before the attack previewing the violence he would unleash and proclaiming his support for the Islamic State militant group. The coroner’s office listed the cause of death for all 14 victims as 'blunt force injuries.' Jabbar, 42, was fatally shot in a firefight with police at the scene of the deadly crash on Bourbon Street, famous worldwide for its festive vibes in New Orleans' historic French Quarter. Authorities found crude bombs that had been planted in the neighborhood in an apparent attempt to cause more carnage. Two improvised explosive devices left in coolers several blocks apart were rendered safe at the scene, officials said. Other devices were determined to be nonfunctional. Investigators recovered from Jabbar's rental truck a transmitter intended to trigger the two bombs, the FBI said in a statement Friday. It also said authorities found bomb-making materials at the New Orleans home Jabbar rented prior to the attack. Jabbar tried to burn the house down by setting a small fire in a hallway and placing accelerants to help spread it, the FBI said. The flames burned out before firefighters arrived. Authorities on Friday were still investigating Jabbar's motives and how he carried out the attack. They say he exited the crashed truck wearing a ballistic vest and helmet and fired at police, wounding at least two officers before he was fatally shot by officers returning fire. New Orleans police declined to say Friday how many shots were fired by Jabbar and police or whether any bystanders may have been hit, citing the active investigation. Stella Cziment, who heads the city's civilian-run Office of the Independent Police Monitor, said investigators are working to account for 'every single bullet that was fired' and whether any of them struck bystanders. Bourbon Street was solemn Friday. A day after the crime scene reopened to the public, locals and tourists stopped to pay respects to victims of the attack as the sound of bucket drums echoed. People shed tears while gathering at a growing memorial. Some left flowers and candles while others dropped to their knees to say a quick prayer. 'New Orleans is about having a good time, you know, just trying to live your best life,' said Tony Lightfoot, who works in Baton Rouge and was visiting New Orleans with his son. He said the attacker 'just decided to disrupt all of that.' Thirteen people remained hospitalized. Eight people were in intensive care at University Medical Center New Orleans, spokesperson Carolina Giepert said. The White House said President Joe Biden would travel to New Orleans on Monday to 'grieve with the families and community members impacted by the tragic attack.' Police used multiple vehicles and barricades on Friday to block traffic at Bourbon and Canal streets as crowds of pedestrians swelled. Other law enforcement agencies helped city officers provide extra security, said Reese Harper, a spokesperson for the New Orleans Police Department. The first parade of the Carnival season leading up to Mardi Gras was scheduled to take place Monday. New Orleans will also host the Super Bowl on Feb. 9. 'This enhanced safety effort will continue daily, not just during large events,' Harper said in a statement. In a previous effort to protect the French Quarter, the city had installed steel columns known as bollards to restrict vehicle access to Bourbon Street. The posts retracted to allow for deliveries to bars and restaurants, until — gummed up by Mardi Gras beads, beer and other detritus — they stopped working reliably. So, when New Year’s Eve arrived, the bollards were gone. They were being replaced ahead of the Super Bowl. Meanwhile, New Orleans City Council President Helena Moreno took steps toward launching an investigation of the attack. In a memo to another council member obtained by AP, Moreno said she was initiating the creation of a local and state legislative committee 'dedicated to reviewing the incident and its implications.' 'This committee will play a crucial role in assessing our current policies, enhancing security measures, and ensuring that we are adequately prepared to respond to any future threats,' Moreno wrote. The FBI concluded Jabbar was not aided by anyone else in the attack, which killed an 18-year-old aspiring nurse, a single mother, a father of two and a former Princeton University football star, among others. Thirteen of the 14 victims have been identified by the New Orleans coroner’s office, with the youngest listed as 18 and the oldest 63. Most of the victims were in their 20s. One victim was a British citizen. It was the deadliest IS-inspired assault on U.S. soil in years, laying bare what federal officials have warned is a resurgent international terrorism threat.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-orleans-attacker-had-suspected-bomb-materials-at-home-officials-say/7924423.html	2025-01-04T09:27:12-08:00	
World's oldest person, a Japanese woman, dies at 116	TOKYO — Tomiko Itooka, a Japanese woman who was the world’s oldest person according to Guinness World Records, has died, an Ashiya city official said Saturday. She was 116. Yoshitsugu Nagata, an official in charge of elderly policies, said Itooka died on Dec. 29 at a care home in Ashiya, Hyogo Prefecture, central Japan. Itooka, who loved bananas and a yogurt-flavored Japanese drink called Calpis, was born on May 23, 1908. She became the oldest person last year following the death of 117-year-old Maria Branyas, according to the Gerontology Research Group. When she was told she was at the top of the World Supercentenarian Rankings List, she simply replied, 'Thank you.' When Itooka celebrated her birthday last year, she received flowers, a cake and a card from the mayor. Born in Osaka, Itooka was a volleyball player in high school, and long had a reputation for a sprightly spirit, Nagata said. She climbed the 3,067-meter (10,062-foot) Mount Ontake twice. She married at 20, and had two daughters and two sons, according to Guinness. Itooka managed the office of her husband’s textile factory during World War II. She lived alone in Nara after her husband died in 1979. She is survived by one son, one daughter and five grandchildren. A funeral service was held with family and friends, according to Nagata. According to the Gerontology Research Group, the world's oldest person is now 116-year-old Brazilian nun Inah Canabarro Lucas, who was born 16 days after Itooka.	https://www.voanews.com/a/world-s-oldest-person-a-japanese-woman-dies-at-116/7924390.html	2025-01-04T08:42:23-08:00	
German leader worried by Musk's support of far-right AfD	BERLIN — German Chancellor Olaf Scholz says he's staying 'cool' against critical personal comments made by Elon Musk but finds it worrying that the U.S. billionaire makes the effort to get involved in a general election by endorsing the far-right Alternative for Germany party, or AfD. Scholz was reacting after Musk, a close ally to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, called the chancellor a 'fool' after his coalition government collapsed in November and later backed the AfD in an opinion article he wrote for a major newspaper in Germany. Scholz, head of the Social Democratic Party of Germany, or SPD, said in comments published Saturday by the German magazine Stern that there is 'nothing new' in criticism by 'rich media entrepreneurs who do not appreciate social democratic politics and do not hold back with their opinions.' 'You have to stay cool,' Scholz told Stern. 'I find it much more worrying than such insults that Musk is supporting a party like the AfD, which is in parts right-wing extremist, which preaches rapprochement with [President Vladmir] Putin’s Russia and wants to weaken transatlantic relations,' Scholz said. The AfD is monitored by Germany’s domestic intelligence service on suspicion of being right-wing extremist and has already been recognized as such in some individual German states. Germany will hold an early parliamentary election on Feb. 23 after Scholz’s thee-party coalition collapsed in November in a dispute over how to revitalize the country’s stagnant economy. Musk recently caused uproar after backing the AfD in an opinion article for the Welt am Sonntag, leading to the resignation of the paper’s opinion editor, Eva Marie Kogel, in protest. 'The Alternative for Germany (AfD) is the last spark of hope for this country,' Musk wrote in his translated commentary. The Tesla Motors CEO also wrote that his investment in Germany gave him the right to comment on the country’s condition. The AfD is polling strongly, but its candidate for the top job, Alice Weidel, has no realistic chance of becoming chancellor because other parties refuse to work with the far-right party.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-leader-worried-by-musk-s-support-of-far-right-afd/7924363.html	2025-01-04T08:13:40-08:00	
Cameroon says Nigerian militant attack killed government troops	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Villagers in southern Cameroon say armed men crossed the border from Nigeria and killed at least seven government troops and displaced civilians from about 15 villages. Civilians say they believe the attackers are members of a militant group. Villagers in the Akwaya district on Cameroon’s border with Nigeria’s Taraba state say several hundred armed men crossed the Moon River two times this week and launched deadly attacks on their villages. The Moon River lies to the south on Cameroon's border with Nigeria. Villagers say the water level has dropped significantly this dry season, making it easy to cross by foot. The villagers say the first attack was on Thursday, when armed men suspected to be ethnic Fulani from Nigeria entered their villages and started shooting indiscriminately in the air, torching houses and threatening to kill civilians. Cameroon's military says that it fought back and that the attackers retreated after several fighters were killed. Agwa Linus Tarnonge, traditional ruler of Bakinjaw village in Akwaya district, said villagers were surprised that the men returned on Friday, more heavily armed than they were on Thursday. 'In the cause of gun fire exchanges, some of those armed Fulani suffered casualties, and then the remaining ones retreated and came back with an overwhelming population [number of fighters], and with more sophisticated rifles,' Tarnonge told VOA by phone from Akwaya. 'They attacked our [Cameroon] military contingent that is lodged at the chief's palace in Bakinjaw, and killed five military and two gendarmes.' The Cameroon military said it lost five troops during the confrontation. Villagers say two government troops sustained injuries and died while being rushed to a hospital for treatment. Many civilians were injured, and it is too early to determine if some villagers died because of the difficult access to Akwaya, the Cameroon military says. Aka Martin Tyoga, a lawmaker and member of Cameroon's National Assembly from Akwaya, said this week's attacks are the latest in a series of what he called attempts by Nigerian militant groups to seize that area of Cameroon. 'We have asked the people to move away from the border area to the center, where we have the military that has been there since,' Tyoga said. 'We are pleading that the government should send more forces [military] because these people [armed men] come en masse; they came in 300. Their mode of operating is like Boko Haram. They enter the community and just start killing people, burning down houses.' No group has claimed responsibility, but Cameroonian government officials and Akwaya residents believe a Nigerian militant group wants to occupy the area. Cameroonian officials said troops have been deployed to the border with Nigeria around Akwaya for a search-and-rescue operation, but they have not said how many have been deployed. The Cameroonian government says it is working in collaboration with Nigerian authorities to stop the border attacks but gave no details. VOA could not independently verify if Cameroon has contacted Nigerian authorities to either investigate the origin of the armed group or collaborate with forces of the neighboring state to fight the suspected militants. Nigeria has been attempting to stop the proliferation of militant groups in its territory since 2009, when fighting between Nigerian government troops and Boko Haram militants degenerated into an armed conflict and spread to Cameroon, Niger and Chad. Several bombings and deadly attacks have taken place in Nigeria’s Taraba state since 2022 that were claimed by Islamic State West Africa Province or ISWAP. In 2021, Cameroon, Nigeria, Chad and Niger said ISWAP was emerging as the terrorist group taking over from Boko Haram, which was weakened by the death of its leader, Aboubakar Shekau, in May of that year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cameroon-says-nigerian-militant-attack-killed-government-troops/7924358.html	2025-01-04T07:59:49-08:00	
How Congress will certify Trump's electoral college victory	WASHINGTON — The U.S. congressional joint session to count electoral votes on Monday is expected to be much less eventful than the certification four years ago that was interrupted by a violent mob of supporters of then-President Donald Trump who tried to stop the count and overturn the results of an election he lost to Democrat Joe Biden. This time, Trump is returning to office after winning the 2024 election that began with Biden as his party's nominee and ended with Vice President Kamala Harris atop the ticket. She will preside over the certification of her own loss, fulfilling the constitutional role in the same way that Trump's vice president, Mike Pence, did after the violence subsided on Jan. 6, 2021. Usually a routine affair, the congressional joint session on Jan. 6 every four years is the final step in reaffirming a presidential election after the Electoral College officially elects the winner in December. The meeting is required by the Constitution and includes several distinct steps. What happens when Congress meets? Under federal law, Congress must meet on Jan. 6 to open sealed certificates from each state that contain a record of their electoral votes. The votes are brought into the chamber in special mahogany boxes that are used for the occasion. Bipartisan representatives of both chambers read the results out loud and do an official count. The vice president, as president of the Senate, presides over the session and declares the winner. The Constitution requires Congress to meet and count the electoral votes. If there is a tie, then the House decides the presidency, with each congressional delegation having one vote. That hasn’t happened since the 1800s and won't happen this time because Trump’s electoral win over Harris was decisive, 312-226. How has it changed since the last time? Congress tightened the rules for the certification after the violence of 2021 and Trump’s attempts to usurp the process. In particular, the revised Electoral Count Act passed in 2022 more explicitly defines the role of the vice president after Trump aggressively pushed Pence to object to the Republican's defeat — an action that would have gone far beyond Pence's ceremonial role. Pence rebuffed Trump and ultimately gaveled down his own defeat. Harris will do the same. The updated law clarifies that the vice president does not have the power to determine the results on Jan. 6. Harris and Pence were not the first vice presidents to be put in the uncomfortable position of presiding over their own defeats. In 2001, Vice President Al Gore presided over the counting of the 2000 presidential election that he narrowly lost to Republican George W. Bush. Gore had to gavel several Democrats’ objections out of order. In 2017, Biden as vice president presided over the count that declared Trump the winner. Biden also shot down objections from House Democrats that did not have any Senate support. How does the session unfold? The presiding officer opens and presents the certificates of the electoral votes in alphabetical order of the states. The appointed 'tellers' from the House and Senate, members of both parties, then read each certificate out loud and record and count the votes. At the end, the presiding officer announces who has won the most votes for president and vice president. What if there's an objection? After a teller reads the certificate from any state, a lawmaker can stand up and object to that state’s vote on any grounds. But the presiding officer will not hear the objection unless it is in writing and signed by one-fifth of each chamber. That threshold is significantly higher than what came before. Previously, a successful objection only required support from one member of the Senate and one member of the House. Lawmakers raised the threshold in the 2022 law to make objections more difficult. If any objection reaches the threshold — something not expected this time — the joint session suspends, and the House and Senate go into separate sessions to consider it. For the objection to be sustained, both chambers must uphold it by a simple majority vote. If they do not agree, the original electoral votes are counted with no changes. In 2021, both the House and Senate rejected challenges to the electoral votes in Arizona and Pennsylvania. Before 2021, the last time that such an objection was considered was 2005, when Representative Stephanie Tubbs Jones of Ohio and Senator Barbara Boxer of California, both Democrats, objected to Ohio’s electoral votes, claiming there were voting irregularities. The House and Senate debated the objection and easily rejected it. It was only the second time such a vote had occurred. What happens next? After Congress certifies the vote, the president is inaugurated on the west front of the Capitol on Jan. 20. The joint session is the last official chance for objections, beyond any challenges in court. Harris has conceded and never disputed Trump’s win.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-congress-will-certify-trump-s-electoral-college-victory/7924343.html	2025-01-04T07:37:34-08:00

Jimmy Carter's state funeral starts Saturday. Here is what to know	ATLANTA, GEORGIA — Six days of funeral observances for former President Jimmy Carter begin Saturday in Georgia, where he died on Dec. 29 at the age of 100. The first events reflect Carter’s climb up the political ladder, from the tiny town of Plains, Georgia, to decades on the global stage as a humanitarian and advocate for democracy. Here is what to know about the initial ceremonies and what happens next: Start honors Carter's roots in rural Georgia The proceedings are scheduled to begin at 10:15 a.m. Saturday with the Carter family arriving at Phoebe Sumter Medical Center in Americus. Former Secret Service agents who protected Carter will serve as pallbearers, walking alongside the hearse as it exits the campus on its way to Plains. James Earl Carter Jr. lived more than 80 of his 100 years in and around the town, which still has fewer than 700 people, not much more than when he was born on October 1, 1924. Presidents Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton also grew up in rural settings, but Carter stands out for returning and remaining in his birthplace for his long post-presidency. The motorcade will move through downtown Plains, which spans just a few blocks, passing near the girlhood home of first lady Rosalynn Smith Carter, who died in November 2023 at the age of 96, and near where the couple operated the family peanut warehouses. The route also includes the old train depot that served as Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign headquarters and the gas station once run by Carter's younger brother Billy. The motorcade will then pass by the Methodist church where the Carters married in 1946, and the home where they lived and died. The former president will be buried there alongside Rosalynn. The Carters built the one-story house, now surrounded by Secret Service fencing, before his first state Senate campaign in 1962 and lived out their lives there with the exception of four years in the Governor's Mansion and four more in the White House. A stop at Carter's boyhood home The military-run schedule calls for a 10:50 a.m. stop in front of Carter's family farm and boyhood home in Archery, outside Plains, after passing the cemetery where the former president's parents, James Earl Carter Sr. and Lillian Carter, are buried. The farm now is part of the Jimmy Carter National Historical Park. The National Park Service will ring the old farm bell 39 times to honor the 39th president. Carter was the first president born in a hospital. But the home had no electricity or running water when he was born, and he worked his father's land during the Great Depression. Still, the Carters had relative privilege and status. Earl employed Black tenant farming families. The elder Carter also owned a store in Plains and was a local civic and political leader. Lillian was a nurse, and she delivered Rosalynn. The property still includes a tennis court Earl had built for the family. It was Earl's death in 1953 that set Jimmy on course toward the Oval Office. The younger Carters had left Plains after he graduated from the U.S. Naval Academy. But Jimmy abandoned a promising career as a submarine officer and early participant in the Pentagon's nuclear program to take over the family's peanut business after his father's death. Within a decade, he was elected to the Georgia state Senate. Lying in repose in Atlanta From Archery, the motorcade will head north to Atlanta and will stop at 3 p.m. outside at the Georgia Capitol, where he served as a state senator from 1963 to 1967 and governor from 1971 to 1975. Georgia Governor Brian Kemp and Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens will lead a moment of silence. While former governors are honored with state-run funerals, presidents — even if they served as governors — are memorialized with national rites run by the federal government. The motorcade then is scheduled to arrive at the Carter Presidential Center at 3:45 p.m., with a private service at 4 p.m. The campus includes Carter’s presidential library and The Carter Center, established by the former president and first lady in 1982. From 7 p.m. Saturday through 6 a.m. Monday, Carter will lie in repose for the public to pay respects around the clock. The ceremony is expected to include some of The Carter Center's global staff of 3,000, whose work concentrating on international diplomacy and mediation, election monitoring and fighting disease in the developing world continues to set a standard for what former presidents can accomplish. Jimmy Carter, who delivered its annual reports until 2019, won the 2002 Nobel Peace Prize in part for this post-presidential work. His grandson Jason Carter now chairs the board. A return to Washington Carter's remains will travel next to Washington, where he will lie in state in the Capitol Rotunda until his funeral at 10 a.m. Thursday at the Washington National Cathedral. All the living presidents have been invited, and Joe Biden, a Carter ally, will deliver a eulogy. The Carter family then will return to bury its patriarch in Plains after a private hometown funeral at 3:45 p.m. at Maranatha Baptist Church, where Carter, a devout evangelical, taught Sunday School for decades. Carter will be buried afterward in a private graveside service, in a plot visible from the front porch of his home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jimmy-carter-s-state-funeral-starts-saturday-here-is-what-to-know/7924279.html	2025-01-04T05:59:40-08:00	
Cybertruck soldier told ex-girlfriend of pain, exhaustion after Afghanistan	WASHINGTON — The highly decorated Special Forces soldier who died by suicide in a Cybertruck explosion on New Year's Day confided to a former girlfriend who had served as an Army nurse that he faced significant pain and exhaustion that she says were key symptoms of traumatic brain injury. Green Beret Matthew Livelsberger, 37, was a five-time recipient of the Bronze Star, including one with a V device for valor under fire. He had an exemplary military record that spanned the globe and a baby born last year. But he struggled with the mental and physical toll of his service, which required him to kill and caused him to witness the deaths of fellow soldiers. Livelsberger mostly bore that burden in private but recently sought treatment for depression from the Army, according to a U.S. official who spoke on condition of anonymity to provide details that have not been made public. He also found a confidant in the former nurse, who he began dating in 2018. Alicia Arritt, 39, and Livelsberger met through a dating app while both were in Colorado Springs. Arritt had served at Landstul Regional Medical Center in Germany, the largest U.S. military medical facility in Europe, where many of the worst combat injuries from Iraq and Afghanistan were initially treated before being flown to the United States. There she saw and treated traumatic brain injuries, or TBIs, which troops suffered from incoming fire and roadside bombs. Serious but hard to diagnose, such injuries can have lingering effects that might take years to surface. 'I saw a lot of bad injuries. But the personality changes can happen later,' Arritt said. In texts and images he shared with Arritt, Livelsberger raised the curtain a bit on what he was facing. 'Just some concussions,' he said in a text about a deployment to Helmand Province in Afghanistan. He sent her a photo of a graphic tattoo he got on his arm of two skulls pierced by bullets to mark lives he took in Afghanistan. He talked about exhaustion and pain, not being able to sleep and reliving the violence of his deployment. 'My life has been a personal hell for the last year,' he told Arritt during the early days of their dating, according to text messages she provided to The Associated Press. 'It’s refreshing to have such a nice person come along.' On Friday, Las Vegas law enforcement officers released excerpts of messages Livelsberger left behind showing the way Livelsberger killed himself was intentional, meant both as a 'wakeup call' but also to 'cleanse the demons' he was facing from losing fellow soldiers and taking lives. Livelsberger’s death in front of the Trump Hotel using a truck produced by Elon Musk’s Tesla company has raised questions as to whether this was an act of political violence. Officials said Friday that Livelsberger apparently harbored no ill will toward President-elect Donald Trump, and Arritt said she and Livelsberger were Tesla fans. 'I had a Tesla, too, that I rescued from a junkyard in 2019, and we used to work on it together, bond over it,' Arritt said. The pair stopped talking regularly after they broke up in 2021, and she had not heard from him in more than two years when he texted out of the blue on Dec. 28, and again on Dec. 31. The upbeat messages included a video of him driving the Cybertruck and another one of its dancing headlights; the vehicle can sync up its lighting and music. But she also said Livelsberger felt things 'very deeply, and I could see him using symbolism' of both the truck and the hotel. 'He wasn’t impulsive,' Arritt said. 'I don’t see him doing this impulsively, so my suspicion would be that he was probably thinking it out.' Arritt served on active duty from 2003 to 2007 and then was in the Army Reserve until 2011. With Livelsberger, she saw symptoms of TBI as early as 2018. 'He would go through periods of withdrawal, and he struggled with depression and memory loss,' Arritt said. 'I don’t know what drove him to do this, but I think the military didn’t get him help when he needed it.' But Livelsberger was also sweet and kind, she recalled: 'He had a really deep well of inner strength and character, and he just had a lot of integrity.' Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday that it has turned over all Livelsberger's medical records to local law enforcement and encouraged troops facing mental health challenges to seek care through one of the military's support networks. 'If you need help, if you feel that you need to seek any type of mental health treatment, or just to talk to someone — to seek the services that are available, either on base or off,' Singh said. When Livelsberger struggled during the time they were dating, Arritt prodded him to get help. But he would not, saying it could cost him his ability to deploy if he was found medically unfit. 'There was a lot of stigma in his unit; they were, you know, big, strong, Special Forces guys there. There was no weakness allowed, and mental health is weakness is what they saw,' she said. Livelsberger seeking treatment for depression was first reported by CNN.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cybertruck-soldier-told-ex-girlfriend-of-pain-exhaustion-after-afghanistan/7924262.html	2025-01-04T05:40:04-08:00

South Korea says fatal crash cockpit transcript nearly complete	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean investigators said Saturday they were close to finalizing the transcript of the cockpit voice recorder from a fatal plane crash that left 179 people dead last week. The recording may hold clues to the final moments of Jeju Air flight 2216, which was carrying 181 passengers and crew from Thailand to South Korea on Sunday when it belly-landed before slamming into a concrete barrier at the end of an airport runway. South Korean and U.S. investigators, including from the aircraft's manufacturer Boeing, have been combing the crash site in southwestern Muan since the disaster to establish a cause. 'The transcript of the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) is expected to be completed today, and the flight data recorder (FDR) is in the process of being prepared for transport to the United States' for analysis, South Korea's land ministry said in a statement. Investigators also recovered the aircraft engine from the crash site this week, the ministry added. The exact cause of the Boeing 737-800 crash is still unknown, but investigators have pointed to a bird strike, faulty landing gear and the runway barrier as possible issues. Authorities this week carried out search and seizure operations at Muan airport where the flight crashed, a regional aviation office in the southwestern city, and Jeju Air's office in the capital of Seoul, police said. Jeju Air's chief executive Kim E-bae has been banned from leaving the country as the investigation continues, police also said. The pilot warned of a bird strike before pulling out of a first landing and then crashing on a second attempt when the landing gear did not emerge. Dramatic video showed the plane colliding with the concrete barrier at the end of the runway before bursting into flames. Authorities have started lifting the wreckage of the jet, and returning some of the identified victims' bodies and personal belongings recovered from the crash site to grieving families. The plane was largely carrying South Korean holidaymakers back from year-end trips to Bangkok, except for two Thai passengers. Images from local media showed authorities handing over items including smartphones, and dried mango and coconut sourced from Thailand.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-says-fatal-crash-cockpit-transcript-nearly-complete/7924194.html	2025-01-04T01:41:17-08:00	
South Korea investigators ask acting president to clear way for Yoon's arrest	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean investigators again asked the country's acting president on Saturday to order the presidential security service to comply with an arrest warrant for impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol. The security service, along with military troops, on Friday prevented prosecutors from arresting Yoon Suk Yeol in a six-hour standoff inside Yoon's compound. The investigators secured the warrant to arrest Yoon over his brief declaration of martial law last month. The Corruption Investigation Office for High-Ranking Officials said on Saturday it had again asked acting President Choi Sang-mok, the nation's finance minister, to order the presidential security service to cooperate with the warrant. A finance ministry spokesperson declined to comment. Yoon's Dec. 3 martial declaration stunned South Korea and led to the first arrest warrant to be issued for a sitting president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-investigators-ask-acting-president-to-clear-way-for-yoon-s-arrest/7924192.html	2025-01-04T01:31:27-08:00	
Palestinian health ministry says 1 dead in Israel West Bank raid	RAMALLAH, WEST BANK — The health ministry in the occupied West Bank said one person was killed and nine injured in an Israeli raid on a refugee camp, with the Israeli military saying Saturday it had opened fire at 'terrorists.' An 18-year-old man, Muhammad Medhat Amin Amer, 'was killed by bullets from the (Israeli) occupation in the Balata camp' in the territory's north, the Palestinian health ministry said in a late-night statement, adding that nine people were injured, 'four of whom are in critical condition.' According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, the raid began on Friday night and triggered violent clashes. The official Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that Israeli troops entered the camp from the Awarta checkpoint and 'deployed snipers on the rooftops of surrounding buildings.' In a statement on Saturday, the Israeli military said that during the 'counterterrorism' operation, 'terrorists placed explosives in the area in order to harm (military) soldiers, hurled explosives, Molotov cocktails, and rocks and shot fireworks at the forces.' 'The forces fired toward the terrorists in order to remove the threat. Hits were identified,' the statement said. Violence in the West Bank has intensified since war broke out in the Gaza Strip after Hamas's Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, United Kingdom, European Union and others. Since then, at least 815 Palestinians have been killed in the territory by Israeli troops or settlers, according to the Palestinian health ministry in Ramallah. In the same period, Palestinian attacks in the West Bank have killed at least 25 Israelis, according to official Israeli figures. Israel has occupied the West Bank since conquering it in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinian-health-ministry-says-1-dead-in-israel-west-bank-raid/7924180.html	2025-01-04T00:53:37-08:00	
US state of Tennessee refuses to release its new execution manual	NASHVILLE, TENNESSEE — Just days after Tennessee announced it had a new manual for executing death row inmates, the state's top prison officials said they aren't going to release the document to the public. The Tennessee Department of Correction had told The Associated Press to file a public records request to obtain a copy of the latest execution manual, known as a protocol. However, the agency this week denied the AP's request, saying it needs to keep the entire document secret to protect the identities of the executioner and other people involved. The decision to maintain secrecy differs from how the state has handled similar requests in the past, but mirrors efforts across the U.S. to suppress public access surrounding executions, especially after anti-death penalty activists used records to expose problems. Here's what to know: What is an execution protocol? The protocol is typically a detailed set of procedures describing how the state executes death row inmates. Tennessee had been operating under a 2018 protocol that included directions on selecting execution team staff and the training they should undergo. It explained how lethal injection drugs should be procured, stored and administered. It gave instructions on the inmate's housing, diet and visitation in the days leading up to execution. It provided directions on how to choose media witnesses. For lethal injection, the 2018 protocol required a series of three drugs administered in sequence. The new version unveiled last week requires only a single dose of pentobarbital. But that is all that is known about the revised protocol. What reason does Tennessee give for not releasing the new protocol? In an email sent Monday, Tennessee correction spokesperson Kayla Hackney told the AP the 'protocol is not a public record' and cited a Tennessee statute that makes the identities of the people carrying out executions confidential. However, that same statute says the existence of confidential information in a record is not a reason to deny access to it, noting that the confidential information should be redacted. What has Tennessee done in the past? In 2018, Tennessee's correction agency provided a redacted copy of the protocol to an AP reporter over email. In 2007, a previous version of the protocol was treated as a public record and provided to the AP after former Gov. Phil Bredesen, a Democrat, announced a surprise halt to executions. A reporter's review of that 100-page 'Manual of Execution' found a jumble of conflicting instructions that mixed new lethal-injection instructions with those for electrocution. Why did Tennessee update its protocol? Executions have been on hold in Tennessee since 2022, when the state admitted it had not been following the 2018 protocol. Among other things, the Correction Department was not consistently testing the execution drugs for potency and purity. An independent review of the state's lethal injection practice later found that none of the drugs prepared for the seven inmates executed since 2018 had been fully tested. Later, the state Attorney General's Office conceded in court that two of the people most responsible for overseeing Tennessee's lethal injection drugs 'incorrectly testified' under oath that officials were testing the chemicals as required. So what's with all the secrecy? Executions in the U.S. have remained at historic lows for years, but the small group of states still carrying out the death penalty have only increased the secrecy surrounding the procedures, particularly over how and where the state secures the drugs used for lethal injections. Many states argue that secrecy is critical to protect the safety of those involved in the execution process. Yet in a 2018 report, the Washington-D.C.-based nonprofit Death Penalty Information Center found that this argument often led to these states refusing to provide information about the qualifications of their execution teams and some courts have criticized such arguments for lack of evidence that more public disclosure would result in threats against prison officials. Kelley Henry, chief of the federal public defender's habeas unit that represents many of Tennessee's death row inmates, described the state's refusal to release the new protocol, given that background, as 'mystifying.' 'The secrecy, which cloaked the former execution protocol, created a culture of incompetence and lack of accountability,' she said in an email.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-state-of-tennessee-refuses-to-release-its-new-execution-manual/7922881.html	2025-01-03T23:49:36-08:00

Deadly accident has Hawaii officials pleading for end to amateur fireworks shows	honolulu — In recent years, occasions large and small — parties, Super Bowls, mixed martial arts fights, even Thanksgiving — have provided a reason for residents across Hawaii to set off illegal fireworks. The increasingly sophisticated displays, loved by some and loathed by others, are so prevalent that some people consider them part of the state's culture. They have rattled neighborhoods of tightly packed houses, started fires, terrorized pets and knocked a light fixture off the ceiling of an Associated Press reporter's home, where it narrowly missed a child and shattered on the floor. Each New Year's Day, Honolulu officials publish a list of fireworks casualties from the night before, typically a litany of burns, shrapnel wounds or amputations. Sometimes there are deaths. But none of the damage has matched Tuesday night's tragedy, when a lit bundle of mortar-style aerials tipped over and shot into crates of unlit fireworks, causing a rapid-fire series of blasts that killed three women and injured more than 20 people, including children. On Friday, the Honolulu medical examiner's department identified two of the women as Nelie Ibarra, 58, and Jennifer Van, 23. The cause and manner of death for both were listed as pending. The identity of the third was not yet confirmed, the department said in a news release. Another person was killed in an unrelated fireworks explosion on Oahu. Authorities and residents alike are now wondering whether the toll will dissuade people from putting on such shows in the future, or whether it will prompt more effective efforts by police to crack down. 'This incident is a painful reminder of the danger posed by illegal fireworks,' Honolulu Mayor Rick Blangiardi told a news conference. 'They put lives at risk, they drain our first responders and they disrupt our neighborhoods.' Efforts to crack down on contraband fireworks have had limited effect. In 2023, lawmakers created an illegal fireworks task force. Based on the ease with which it seized fireworks, including three shipping containers in its first few months in operation, the state Department of Law Enforcement concluded illegal fireworks are likely smuggled into Hawaii on a daily basis. The task force has seized 227,000 pounds (about 103,000 kilograms) of fireworks in all, according to Governor Josh Green. And yet, the Honolulu Fire Department reported Thursday that there were 30 fireworks-related blazes between Tuesday and Wednesday, a 30% increase from last New Year's celebrations. Representative Gregg Takayama, who sponsored legislation passed last year to tighten fireworks controls, said he remembers setting them off when he was younger and agrees it's a tradition for many. But the ones he played with, including Roman candles, pale in comparison to those on the black market today. 'The kind of aerial fireworks that are being used now are really explosive bombs,' he said. 'And so the danger is magnified.' Charmaine Doran, the vice chair of the neighborhood board in Pearl City, northwest of Honolulu, called the notion that fireworks are part of Hawaii culture a misconception: 'They have been outlawed for all of my life ... and I'm pretty old.' In her neighborhood, the fireworks ramp up after Halloween, exploding in the middle of the night until New Year's. Doran said she can tell if there is a big mixed martial arts fight on TV because the booms begin earlier in the day. Enforcement is complicated because people are reluctant to report their neighbors on a small island where 'we're related to everybody, everybody knows everybody,' Doran said. People fear retribution, she added: 'If I dial 911, they're going to egg my house.' That was the theme of some testimony to the Legislature last January. Beverly Takushi, a Pearl City resident, described once being threatened by a neighbor when she told his brother to stop launching illegal fireworks in a show that lasted from 5:30 p.m. on New Year's Eve until after midnight. 'It was the first time I was threatened not only by the danger of the aerial fireworks to my family and property, but also for my safety from this neighbor who accused me of not respecting his culture,' Takushi said. 'He has since apologized, but this is the reason why no one wants to get involved and report their neighbors setting off bombs and aerials.' Many historians believe fireworks were invented in China more than 2,000 years ago and their use came to signify joy and prosperity, as well as warding off evil. In Hawaii they are celebrated not just by residents of Chinese descent but all across the state's diverse communities. Takushi echoed Takayama's point about the big difference between today's large, professional-grade fireworks and the smaller ones of yesteryear. 'A string of firecrackers at midnight to ward off bad spirits is cultural, not loud explosives that sound like you are in the middle of a war,' Takushi said. Richard Oshiro, secretary of the neighborhood board for Waipahu, known as one of Oahu's hot spots for aerial displays, said he hopes this week's deaths will spur a change of mentality about playing with explosives. He said he tries to report them whenever he can, even though he knows there is not much police can do if 'they can't catch people in the act.' Possession of over 50 pounds (about 23 kilograms) of aerial or other illegal fireworks in Hawaii is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison and a $10,000 fine. Takayama noted the law now allows photographs and videos of fireworks to be submitted as evidence in court, but said prosecutions still face hurdles. 'We already have laws on the books. We need to find better ways to enforce them,' he said. 'I mean, we constantly hear about people who report on their neighbors using illegal aerials, but nothing is done about it.' The best way to control fireworks is to stop them at Hawaii's ports, Takayama said. Law enforcement has intelligence about which shipments contain illegal fireworks, and U.S. authorities have the power to open suspicious cargo. The task force has made seizures but needs to do more, he said. 'We need to find ways to restrict the amount of fireworks that are coming in, because once they arrive and once they're in the community, it's very difficult to track them down,' Takayama said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-accident-has-hawaii-officials-pleading-for-end-to-amateur-fireworks-shows/7924118.html	2025-01-03T23:47:28-08:00	
Ghana’s citizenship offer attracts some Black Americans	ACCRA, GHANA — Flipping through a family album, Keachia Bowers paused on a photo of her as a baby on her father's lap as he held the 1978 album 'Africa Stand Alone' by the Jamaican reggae band Culture. 'When I was 10 years old, I was supposed to come to Ghana with him,' she said. A day earlier, she had marked 10 years since her father's death. Though he was a Pan-Africanist who dreamed of visiting Ghana, he never made it here. Bowers and her husband, Damon Smith, however, are among the 524 diaspora members, mostly Black Americans, who were granted Ghanaian citizenship in a ceremony in November. Bowers and Smith moved to Ghana from Florida in 2023 after visiting the region several times between them since the '90s. They now run a tour business that caters to Black people who want to visit Ghana or elsewhere in West Africa, or like them have come to consider a permanent move. The November group was the largest one granted citizenship since Ghana launched the 'Year of the Return' program, aimed at attracting the Black diaspora, in 2019. It marked 400 years since the first African slaves arrived in Virginia in 1619. Ghana's Tourism Authority and the Office of Diaspora Affairs have extended the program into 'Beyond the Return,' which fosters the relationship with diasporans. Hundreds have been granted citizenship, including people from Canada, the U.K. and Jamaica. Bowers said moving to Ghana gave her family a certain feeling of ease they didn't have in the U.S. 'When we see Trayvon Martin, Sandra Bland, all these stories of people being murdered just in their home, living in their home and being murdered at the hands of police brutality, hearing about it creates trauma,' she said. She also worried about her son Tsadik, 14. Tsadik towers over loved ones in the way that lanky teenage boys often do. He is shy but opens up around his younger sister Tselah, 11, and the family's dog, Apollo. 'In America, being a Black male with locs who's very tall for his age, he is treated like a threat,' Bowers said. Americans face few obstacles to living in Ghana, with most people paying an annual residency fee. But Bowers said getting citizenship signified more than simply living in Ghana. 'I didn't need (citizenship) to tell me that I'm African. Anywhere that I go in the world and someone looks at me, I'm melanated,' she said. 'But my ancestors who wanted to return and come back home, those ancestors who never made it back,' she said, 'that passport, for me, is for them.' Between 10 to 15 million people were forcibly taken from Africa to the Americas during the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the majority from West and Central Africa. Ghana, then a British colony known as the Gold Coast, was a main point of departure. As memorials to the slave trade become tourist destinations across West Africa, painful reminders of its brutality are easily accessible. From Ghana to Senegal to Benin, one can visit variations of the 'Door of No Return,' haunting doorways that open to the Atlantic Ocean where slaves left Africa, and their families, for the last time. The joy that people feel in finding connections that were broken long ago is palpable. Videos of the recent citizenship ceremony show men and women of all ages waving Ghanaian flags and cheering. Deijha Gordon, 33, was one of them. 'I first visited Ghana in 2015. From then on, I knew this is a place that I wanted to be and a place where I wanted to show other diasporans, African-Americans, that we have a place where we belong,' she said. She moved from Brooklyn to Ghana in 2019 and opened a food truck, Deijha Vu's Jerk Hut, selling Jamaican food. Between bagging to-go orders and speaking to a Black American tourist couple, she explained how she built the business from scratch. Gordon was giddy while recalling the moment she got citizenship. 'It just feels good to have a connection to an African country as an African-American, as a Black American. Because back in America we don't have anything to trace our roots to but Africa. To have that connection here, I feel like I've done something right,' she said. Like Bowers, Gordon has had a stream of people reaching out and asking about the citizenship process. The path is not clearly defined. Citizenship must come from a concession from Ghana's presidency, a process made legal under the 2000 Citizenship Act. It's granted to those residing in Ghana who have told the Office of Diaspora Affairs that they are interested in citizenship. Ghana's government in part describes the program as a benefit to the economy and focuses on investment opportunities for those wishing to relocate. Festus Owooson with the local nonprofit Migration Advocacy Center said that though the government emphasizes the economic angle, the real benefits of citizenship are intangible. 'I don't think (recipients) were crying because they have landed a gold mine, or they've found oil or some kind of business opportunity. But it's something so relieving, which you cannot put value or a price on,' he said. President Nana Akufo-Addo's administration, which launched the 'Year of the Return,' is on its way out. Ghana's main opposition party won the presidential election on Dec. 7. But Owooson said Black Americans and other diaspora citizens are likely to continue receiving citizenship by presidential concession. Citizenship also can pass to the next generation. The children of Bowers and Smith received it automatically after their parents' ceremony. Bowers' father, like her husband and children, was a follower of the Rastafari faith. 'Part of the Rastafarian tradition is to repatriate. We see repatriation as the ultimate experience that you can have on this earth,' she said. She believes that her father is proud of her. 'I really feel like he's smiling, where he is. He wanted to experience this for himself, so he's experiencing it through me.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-s-citizenship-offer-attracts-some-black-americans/7924102.html	2025-01-03T23:46:54-08:00	
Danish-Swedish farmdog joins American Kennel Club's lineup	NEW YORK — Say hello to the latest dog in the American Kennel Club's lineup of recognized breeds. Or you might say 'hej.' The Danish-Swedish farmdog — yep, that's the official name — joined the pack Thursday. The designation makes the breed eligible to compete for many best in show trophies, and it likely augurs more widespread interest in the small, sprightly dogs. The prospect both gladdens and concerns their biggest fans. 'We're excited about it. We're looking forward to it,' said Carey Segebart, one of the people who worked to get Danish-Swedish farmdogs recognized by the AKC. She proudly plans to debut one of her own at a dog show this month near her Iowa home. Still, she thinks increased exposure is 'a double-edged sword' for the fleet, versatile pups. 'We don't want the breed to just explode too quickly,' she said. Called the farmdog or DSF for short, the breed goes back centuries in parts of what are now Denmark, southern Sweden and some other European countries, according to the Danish-Swedish Farmdog Club of America. 'They're interesting, fun little dogs,' said Segebart, who has owned them since 2011 and is the club's incoming president. 'They're essentially up for anything. They succeed at most everything.' In their original homelands, the dogs' main job was rodent patrol, but they also would herd a bit, act as watchdogs and play with farmers' children. Some even performed in circuses, according to the club. After Denmark and Sweden became more urban and suburban in the 20th century, farmdog fanciers set out to secure the breed's place in both nations (where 'hej' translates to the English 'hello'). Kennel clubs there began registering farmdogs in 1987. In the U.S., many of the just about 350 farmdogs nationwide compete in agility, obedience or other canine sports that are open to all dogs, including mixed breeds. But until now, farmdogs couldn't enter the traditional breed-by-breed judging that leads to best in show prizes at events including the prominent Westminster Kennel Club dog show in New York. The entry deadline has passed for February's Westminster show, so farmdogs will have to wait for 2026 there, but they may well appear later this year at two other major, televised shows, the National Dog Show and AKC National Championship. The Danish-Swedish farmdog is the AKC's 202nd breed and 'a wonderful addition to a family that is able to provide it with the exercise and mental stimulation that it needs,' said the club's Gina DiNardo. Too popular for its own good? The AKC is the United States' oldest purebred dog registry and essentially a league for many dog competitions. Registration is voluntary, and requirements for breed recognition include at least 300 pedigreed dogs spread through at least 20 states. Some breeds are in other kennel clubs or none at all. Danish-Swedish farmdog fanciers deliberated for several years before pursuing AKC recognition and the attention that's likely to come with it, Segebart said. The number of farmdog puppy-seekers has grown substantially over the last decade; each of the few breeders receives multiple inquiries a week, and the typical wait for a puppy is a year or more, she said. Farmdog folk fear that their appealing, relatively easy-care breed could quickly become too popular for its own good. They're not the first to worry: Much fur has flown in dogdom over the rise of the French bulldog, which the AKC now ranks as the most popular breed in the country. Some animal rights activists echo those concerns to argue against dog breeding in general. They say purebred popularity trends divert people from adopting shelter animals, fuel puppy mills and prize dogs' appearance over their health. The AKC says it promotes responsibly 'breeding for type and function' to produce dogs with at least somewhat predictable traits, whether as basic as size or as specialized as bomb-sniffing skills. The club says it has given over $35 million since 1995 to its canine health research charity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/danish-swedish-farmdog-joins-american-kennel-club-s-lineup-/7922875.html	2025-01-03T23:46:17-08:00	
Scientists hail impact of Ethiopia's Lucy fossil on understanding humans	washington — On a sunny Sunday morning along the Awash River in the small Ethiopian town of Hadar, a newly minted Ph.D. from the University of Chicago uncovered a fossil-rich site that would redefine human history. Fossil hunting in the area was no accident — elephant, pig, rhino and antelope remains were abundant. Driven by optimism, he says he hoped to uncover something extraordinary: a human ancestor fossil. 'I looked over my right shoulder, I saw a little fragment of bone, and I recognized it as coming from one of the bones in the arm, the bone that allows us to flex and extend our arm,' scientist Donald Johanson recalled. 'I looked at it. I thought at first maybe it was a baboon,' he said. 'It was very tiny. As I examined it more closely, I could see the anatomy was the anatomy of a human ancestor … and as I looked around, I found fragments of a skull, fragments of a jaw, and it was part of a skeleton.' Johanson, along with graduate student Tom Gray, had made one of the most important findings in paleontology, discovering a 3.2 million-year-old human ancestor fossil, about 40% complete. That was 50 years ago. The discovery of Lucy, or 'Dinknesh' as the remains are locally known, changed not just Johanson’s career but it also shed new light on how humans evolved and changed over time, according to Johanson, who became a founding director of the Institute of Human Origins at Arizona State University. 'She and many of the fossils we found tell us that all humans on the planet came from Africa, that Africa is the homeland for humanity, and that we have a common past, no matter the color of our skin, the shape of our eyes, the texture of our hair. We carry the genes of Africa in all of us,' Johanson told VOA Horn of Africa, reflecting on the 50th anniversary of the discovery of iconic Lucy on Nov. 24, 1974. 'We should be thinking about a common future for the species Homo sapiens that we have become today,' he said. The discovery attracted scientists from around the world to the region, spurring extensive research and inspiring Ethiopian scientists to make significant findings of their own. Among them is Zeresenay Alemseged, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Chicago, who said Lucy is the earliest and most complete human ancestor fossil ever uncovered. The discovery 'literally transformed our knowledge of human evolution,' he said. 'At that point, the earliest humans, meaning apart walking creatures, were considered to have lived 2 million years ago, but with the discovery of Lucy, that number changed by a whopping 1 million years,' Zeresenay said. 'Lucy continues to serve us as a benchmark, as a reference point for discoveries. So, her influence and impact was huge,' he said. While completing his studies in Addis Ababa, Zeresenay was assigned to the National Museum of Ethiopia, home to Lucy's fossil. This opportunity allowed him to study a wealth of discoveries made by scientists from around the globe, including Johanson. In 2000, Zeresenay made his own discovery, a fossil that was over 60% complete, which lived 150,000 years before Lucy. The fossilized remains, called Selam, were from a child who died at the age of 2-1/2 or 3, which Zeresenay said is a very rare occurrence. 'In terms of discovery, most of the fossils that we find come from adult individuals, so in many ways, she represents the earliest and most complete child ever discovered in the history of paleoanthropology,' he told VOA. 'Her contribution to the scientific community is that she fills in a major gap that continues to puzzle us because we don't normally discover juvenile individuals, young individuals, infants, much less a complete skeleton of an infant.' Zeresenay explained that the discoveries of Lucy and Selam have been instrumental in public outreach efforts for Ethiopia. Selam was uncovered in 2000 in Dikika, in the Afar region of the country. 'Even the new motto of the Tourism Commission in Ethiopia — 'The land of Origins' — was coined by me,' he said. 'I, of course, leaned on both Selam and Lucy, but many other discoveries, to show that the country is the land of origins — the cradle of mankind — and also the origin of many things, including the Nile, coffee, et cetera.' The discovery of Selam was made in a dangerous area contested by rival clans of Afar and Issa ethnic groups where land disputes lead to deadly violence among neighboring communities. Zeresenay named his fossil Selam — or 'Peace,' in Amharic, Tigrigna and Arabic — which was proposed by museum visitors who viewed the fossil. He said he hoped there would be peace in the area of the discovery as Ethiopian Afar and Issa communities continue to clash over land disputes. 'If we see so much misery and problems in Africa and other parts of the world, it's really for lack of having a good understanding, a scientific understanding, a technological understanding of what is around us,' Zeresenay said. 'So I would urge our young population to be keen about science and technology.'

Myanmar junta to free 5,864 prisoners under amnesty	Myanmar's military government will release 5,864 prisoners, including 180 foreigners, under an amnesty marking the Southeast Asian nation's independence day, state media said Saturday. Myanmar has been in turmoil since early 2021, when the military overthrew an elected civilian government and violently suppressed pro-democracy protests, sparking a nationwide armed rebellion. The junta has said it will hold elections this year, but the plan has been widely condemned by opposition groups as a sham. Among those still imprisoned by the junta is the country's former leader, Nobel laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. The 79-year-old is serving a 27-year sentence tied to 14 criminal charges ranging from incitement and election fraud to corruption. She denies all the charges, according to her lawyers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-junta-to-free-5-864-prisoners-under-amnesty/7924153.html	2025-01-03T21:25:03-08:00
