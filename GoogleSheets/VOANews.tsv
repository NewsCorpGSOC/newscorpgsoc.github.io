French lawmakers oust PM in first successful no-confidence vote since 1962	PARIS — France's far-right and left-wing lawmakers joined together Wednesday to pass a no-confidence motion prompted by budget disputes that forces Prime Minister Michel Barnier to resign. The National Assembly approved the motion by 331 votes. A minimum of 288 were needed. President Emmanuel Macron has insisted he will serve the rest of his term, which ends in 2027. However, he will need to appoint a prime minister for the second time after July's legislative elections led to a deeply divided parliament. Macron, on his way back from a presidential visit to Saudi Arabia, said discussions about him potentially resigning were 'make-believe politics,' according to French media reports. 'I'm here because I've been elected twice by the French people,' Macron said. He was also reported as saying, 'We must not scare people with such things. We have a strong economy.' The no-confidence motion rose from fierce opposition to Barnier's proposed budget. The National Assembly, France's lower house of parliament, is deeply fractured, with no single party holding a majority. It comprises three major blocs: Macron's centrist allies, the left-wing coalition New Popular Front, and the far-right National Rally. Both opposition blocs, typically at odds, united against Barnier, accusing him of imposing austerity measures and failing to address citizens' needs. Barnier, a conservative appointed in September, could become the country's shortest-serving prime minister in France's modern Republic. In last-minute efforts to try to save his government, he called on lawmakers to act with 'responsibility' and think of 'the country's best interest.' 'The situation is very difficult economically, socially, fiscally and financially,' he said, speaking Tuesday evening on national television TF1 and France 2. 'If the no-confidence motion passes, everything will be more difficult and everything will be more serious.' Speaking at the National Assembly ahead of the vote, National Rally leader Marine Le Pen, whose party's goodwill was crucial to keeping Barnier in power, said, 'We've reached the moment of truth, a parliamentary moment unseen since 1962, which will likely seal the end of a short-lived government.' 'Stop pretending the lights will go out,' hard-left lawmaker Eric Coquerel said, noting the possibility of an emergency law to levy taxes from January 1, based on this year's rules. 'The special law will prevent a shutdown. It will allow us to get through the end of the year by delaying the budget by a few weeks.' While France is not at risk of a U.S.-style government shutdown, political instability could spook financial markets. France is under pressure from the European Union to reduce its colossal debt. The country's deficit is estimated to reach 6% of gross domestic product this year and analysts say it could rise to 7% next year without drastic adjustments. The political instability could push up French interest rates, digging the debt even further.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-lawmakers-oust-pm-in-first-successful-no-confidence-vote-since-1962/7887488.html	2024-12-04T12:51:28-08:00	
Global outcry grows over new Taliban decree targeting Afghan women	ISLAMABAD — The United Nations called on Afghanistan’s radical Taliban leaders Wednesday to refrain from implementing a recently reported decree that prohibits women from pursuing medical education in the crisis-ridden country. The U.N. call comes amid a growing chorus of voices condemning and demanding that the Taliban reverse the directive, which critics said effectively removed the last remaining opportunity for Afghan women and girls to seek higher education. 'If implemented, the reported directive poses further restrictions on women and girls’ rights to education and access to healthcare,' the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA) cautioned in a statement. It added that UNAMA is 'extremely concerned' about the reported ban and is verifying it through official Taliban channels, but formal confirmation has not yet been received. The directive issued by reclusive Taliban leader Hibatullah Akhundzada took effect Tuesday, a day after it was communicated to heads from all medical schools at a meeting in Kabul, health officials and participants told VOA. They spoke anonymously because they were told not to discuss the matter publicly. Taliban officials at the Public Health Ministry have not yet commented on the reported decree or the meeting that took place in the Afghan capital on Monday. The U.N. cautioned the decree would have a 'detrimental impact' on the Afghan health care system and the development of the impoverished South Asian country. 'UNAMA urges the de facto authorities to reconsider implementing the reported directive in view of its negative implications on the lives of Afghan women and girls and all people across the country,' the organization said in the statement. Local media reported that more than 30,000 women and girls were enrolled in Afghan medical institutions nationwide, and many were scheduled to take their exams starting Tuesday when the ban abruptly took effect. Women training as midwives and nurses were ordered not to return to classes. Human rights activists have warned the ban will deprive millions of women of essential health care services, including midwives and female nurses, in the male-dominated Afghan society where the Taliban have prohibited male doctors in several provinces from treating women. 'This week, the Taliban in Afghanistan closed one of the last remaining loopholes in their ban on education for older girls and women by forbidding them from attending institutions offering medical education,' Human Rights Watch said in a statement. The global watchdog warned that stopping the training of new female health care workers under the controversial decree 'will result in unnecessary pain, misery, sickness, and death for the women forced to go without health care, as there won’t be female healthcare workers to treat them.' The Associated Press quoted a senior Afghan health official as warning that the country would face significant challenges beyond the control of the Taliban government if the suspension became permanent. 'If women are not trained as staff, the mortality rate of mothers and children will increase in remote areas,' the official stated on condition of anonymity because he was not permitted to discuss the matter with the media. 'There will not be enough staff to provide services to female patients. Those NGOs that provide services in distant provinces and districts are still facing a shortage of doctors, midwives, nurses and other female staff,' the health official said. The European Union expressed 'strong concerns' over the reported directive and its potential to deepen the humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan and worsen the suffering of its people. 'This decision represents yet again another appalling violation of fundamental human rights and an unjustifiable attack on women’s access to education in Afghanistan,' the EU said in a statement Wednesday. 'We urge the Taliban to reverse this discriminatory policy and uphold their commitments under international law, including ensuring equal access to education and to basic healthcare for all Afghans,' the EU said in the statement. Rashid Khan, captain of the Afghan national cricket team, also urged the Taliban leadership to reconsider the decision. 'It is with deep sadness and disappointment that I reflect on the recent closures of educational and medical institutions for the sisters and mothers of Afghanistan,' Khan said on the X social media platform. 'The country desperately needs professionals in every field, especially the medical sector. The acute shortage of female doctors and nurses is particularly concerning, as it directly impacts the healthcare and dignity of women,' Khan wrote. Since sweeping back to power in Afghanistan in August 2021, the Taliban have banned girls from attending school beyond the sixth grade and suspended female university and other higher education. Afghan women also are prohibited from working in all sectors except for a few, including health care, immigration and law enforcement. U.N. officials and aid groups say dozens of decrees issued by Hibatullah have severely limited women’s access to work and education in a country that is facing one of the most severe humanitarian crises attributed to years of war and climate change-induced weather disasters. The de facto government in Kabul, which is not officially recognized by any country, justifies its policies as being consistent with the Taliban’s interpretation of Islamic law, known as Shariah. It dismisses criticism of its governance as interference in Afghanistan's internal affairs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/global-outcry-grows-over-new-taliban-decree-targeting-afghan-women/7887435.html	2024-12-04T12:44:15-08:00	
China's new drone draws debate over its potential uses	Taipei, Taiwan — China's recent unveiling of its prototype of a 6-ton tiltrotor unmanned aerial vehicle is stirring up debate over its potential use in combat. The drone, the Lanying R6000, is purportedly intended for nonmilitary uses, but concept drawings that displayed Chinese military logos on the wings and body of the aircraft sparked worries that it may be used for military transportation, surveillance, reconnaissance or attacks. Tiltrotor aircraft such as the Lanying R6000 combine the flying speed of airplanes with the takeoff and landing maneuverability of helicopters, providing them with the advantages of both systems. The new drone, displayed at the Zhuhai air show in November, has a cruising speed of 550 kilometers per hour, a range of up to 4,000 kilometers, a maximum take-off weight of 6,100 kilograms and a maximum payload of 2,000 kilograms according to the website of United Aircraft, a Shenzhen-based company. The business was born in 2014 after the Chinese government began efforts to integrate civil companies into defense technology development. In 2023, United Aircraft received funding from state-backed investment firms totaling nearly $276 million. The company website describes the R6000 drone as a 'car in the sky,' that can seat up to 12 people with additional applications that include 'urban air traffic, logistics transportation, emergency rescue' and others. But some observers say printed designs of the drone with military markings suggest that the company is looking toward military applications of the Lanying system. The drone could serve to increase the efficiency of military logistics and transportation in the event of conflict in the Taiwan Strait, with its long range and rapid deployment capabilities, military analysts tell VOA. The drone does not need a runway 'making it particularly suitable for special terrains such as mountainous areas and islands,' stated the United Aircraft website's product description. Hong Kong-based Asia Times reported in October, 'China's UR6000 may perform rapid resupply missions to support airfield seizure operations during a potential invasion of Taiwan.' Yao Cheng, a former lieutenant colonel staff officer of the Chinese Navy Command who is now based in Los Angeles, told VOA that the Lanying R6000's advantages lie in its fast speed, unmanned operation and strong emergency response capabilities. These advantages, he confirmed, would be useful if a conflict were to break out over Taiwan. 'If there is fighting in the Taiwan Strait, because its speed is 550 [kilometers per hour], it can deliver the materials to the battlefield in about half an hour,' Yao said. Taiwan is located 180 kilometers from China. With a range of 4,000 kilometers, the Lanying R6000 could make more than 10 round trips from China to Taiwan before refueling. Yao said the drone's wide range covers the Western Pacific, giving it the ability to reach locations throughout the South China Sea and U.S. military bases in Japan and South Korea. Given the trend of warfare toward unmanned and intelligent warfare, Yao expects the Lanying R6000 to become an important force in military transportation. However, Su Tzu-yun director of the Institute of National Defense Strategy and Resources at the Taipei-based National Defense Security Research Institute, told VOA that the Lanying R6000 has more value in commercial transportation than in the military. The drone has low stealth capabilities given that helicopters and other similar aircraft that make use of tiltrotors tend to be noisy and produce radar signatures, Su said, making the drone an easy target for air defense missiles. The size of the Chinese army's helicopter force, coupled with the limitations of Lanying system's stealth capabilities, makes it unrealistic for the drone to be considered as an ideal option in high-risk military operations, Su said. He added that China possesses close to 1,000 helicopters, including the Z-20, China's version of the American Black Hawk helicopter. This number still trails behind that of the U.S., which has around 5,500 helicopter units. Su said the drone could still play a limited role in the Chinese Navy. With its compact size and high speed, it is suitable for carrier-based tasks, such as rapid anti-submarine patrols or replenishment missions. The Luying R6000 model could also develop into technology that is more appropriate and valuable for military use in the future, Su added.

China, Pakistan agree to trade buffalo milk, stirring concerns	Peshawar/Karachi, Pakistan — Milk from buffalo is creating controversy in Pakistan as the country finalizes an agreement with China to export the product. Much of Pakistan’s milk production comes from buffalo. And recently, Pakistani milk producer Fauji Foods Limited, which is owned by the military, agreed to an export deal with China’s Royal Group. The deal comes at time of rising inflation in Pakistan, sparking concerns about the impact the deal could have on supply and prices. It is also rekindling a longstanding debate over the military’s role in the country’s economy. The first shipments of buffalo milk from Pakistan are expected to occur in early 2025. It is unclear how much milk Fauji Foods has agreed to export to China. When compared to cow’s milk, buffalo milk is higher in protein, calcium and fat but lower in cholesterol. The cost of buffalo milk products tends to be higher, Islamabad-based dairy expert Abdul Sattar told VOA. Pakistan typically suffers from seasonal milk shortages from April to October, due to low productivity and demand from a growing population, said Sattar. The price of buffalo milk is exacerbated by inflation and an 18% tax on packaged milk that went into effect in July of this year. About 80% of the milk in Pakistan comes from small-scale farmers rather than large companies like Fauji Foods. This leads to concerns that the military may have sidelined these types of producers in the deal with China’s Royal Group. The Pakistani military has not responded to VOA’s request for comment at time of publication. Muhammad Asif Khan, president of the Livestock Farmers Welfare Association in Peshawar, expressed concern regarding Fauji Foods’ ability to meet Chinese demand, suggesting that the company might need to use milk from small-scale farms for export. 'It will be difficult for a sole company to meet the growing milk demand of the Chinese market. Alternatively, they would default on supply or procure milk from the small-scale dairy farms, which always have enough stock readily available,' Khan told VOA. Khan argues that, despite being good for businesses involved in the export deal, this would dramatically increase the price of milk in the country. Chinese interest in Fauji Foods In addition to the buffalo milk deal, China’s Royal Group has also imported some 10,000 buffalo embryos from Pakistan’s Fauji Foods since June, and the two sides have plans to increase the sale to at least 300,000 embryos over the next 10 years. In 2017, Chinese state-owned dairy giant, Inner Mongolia Yili Industrial Group, attempted to acquire a 51% stake in Fauji Foods. However, the Chinese company pulled away from the deal in 2019 without providing a reason. Fauji Foods stated the two sides were unable to complete negotiations before the established deadline. Pakistani military’s economic dominance The latest milk deal between the military-run Fauji Foods and China’s Royal Group has reignited concerns over Pakistani military’s control and influence over the economy. Critics claim the military’s ability to leverage state resources, political influence and commercial infrastructure allows it to dominate local and international business. 'The military’s institutional strengths and advantages are well known. Backed by these strengths, the military's commercial wings consistently employ unfair tactics to compete with other competitors, acquire commercial enterprises and secure contracts in a nontransparent manner,' Farhatullah Babar, a former senator affiliated with the Pakistan People’s Party, told VOA. The military’s privilege in the market extends from military-directed subsidies to an ease of contract approval that circumvents established governmental processes. Dr. Ayesha Siddiqa, a Pakistani military scientist and author of the book 'Military Inc.,' told VOA that the military has had previous involvement in China’s agriculture industry, supplying meat to Chinese producers. The Pakistani military has also been on the receiving end of Chinese products with more than 60% of Chinese defense exports going to the Pakistani military, according to a Mercator Institute for China Studies report.

Despite US benefactor, funds dwindling for HIV/AIDS fight in Zimbabwe	RUSAPE, ZIMBABWE — The U.S. has provided over $1 billion in the past 5 years to Zimbabwe's fight against HIV/AIDS, but experts say reduced funding may hamper the African country’s target of ending the epidemic by 2030. Pamela Tremont, the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe, was among the delegates to this year’s World AIDS Day in Rusape, about 200 kilometers east of Harare. She said the U.S. would continue supporting HIV/AIDS programs in the southern African nation. 'Zimbabweans are living longer, healthier lives. We have been combating HIV in Zimbabwe through our PEPFAR [the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief] program for over 21 years,' she said. 'In the past five years, the United States government has invested over $1 billion to fight HIV and AIDS, and $200 million in the last year alone.' Zimbabwe is one of the countries hit hardest by HIV/AIDS. In 1999, Zimbabwe introduced an AIDS levy, a 3% tax on income and business profits which is managed by the National AIDS Council. That money, combined with international funds, has been used to run programs aimed at ending the HIV/AIDS epidemic by 2030 in Zimbabwe. But at this year’s World Aids Day commemorations, Dr. Bernard Madzima, the executive officer of the Zimbabwe National AIDS Council, painted a grim picture of dwindling funds. He spoke of the U.N.’s target to identify, treat and suppress the virus in 95% of patients. 'For us not to go backwards in terms of the 95-95-95 targets and epidemic control, we have to have discussion(s) around the issue of sustainability to ensure that we don’t reduce the gains which we have recorded and slide backwards,' he said. 'The AIDS levy is there, but it’s just a small piece in terms of providing funding, which is domestic. If we are going to respond to health issues, we have to guard against donor fatigue.' Dr. Douglas Mombeshora, Zimbabwe’s health minister, said the country continues to see lower rates of new infections. 'These are pleasing results, but we are not yet on an irreversible path towards ending AIDS by 2030,' he said. 'These results have indicated that the pace of reversing HIV infections is slower, and we may miss the target of ending AIDS if we continue doing the same things, the same way we have [been] doing them. While our HIV prevention interventions have been robust and led to identification of 95% of HIV positive people, we have to be more strategic in identifying the remaining 5% to ensure optimal use of resources.' While officials are worried about funding for HIV programs, some people are happy with the way Zimbabwe is fighting the epidemic. Among them is schoolteacher Simon Chere, who is living with HIV. When the infection started, Chere visited traditional healers and prophets, fearing he had been bewitched. He later visited a hospital and tested HIV positive. He said he thought his world had collapsed, but then got counseling and met other men who were HIV positive. Chere said is much improved after starting medication, together with his wife. Chere expressed hope that other people living with HIV will learn to live positively and take medication.	https://www.voanews.com/a/despite-us-benefactor-funds-dwindling-for-hiv-aids-fight-in-zimbabwe/7887346.html	2024-12-04T11:19:15-08:00	
Native American students found to miss school at higher rates	SAN CARLOS, ARIZONA — After missing 40 days of school last year, Tommy Betom, 10, is on track this year for much better attendance. The importance of showing up has been stressed repeatedly at school — and at home. When he went to school last year, he often came home saying the teacher was picking on him and other kids were making fun of his clothes. But Tommy's grandmother Ethel Marie Betom, who became one of his caregivers after his parents split, said she told him to choose his friends carefully and to behave in class. He needs to go to school for the sake of his future, she told him. 'I didn't have everything,' said Betom, an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Tommy attends school on the tribe's reservation in southeastern Arizona. 'You have everything. You have running water in the house, bathrooms and a running car.' A teacher and a truancy officer also reached out to Tommy's family to address his attendance. He was one of many. Across the San Carlos Unified School District, 76% of students were chronically absent during the 2022-2023 school year, meaning they missed 10% or more of the school year. Years after COVID-19 disrupted American schools, nearly every state is still struggling with attendance. But attendance has been worse for Native American students — a disparity that existed before the pandemic and has since grown, according to data collected by The Associated Press. Out of 34 states with data available for the 2022-2023 school year, half had absenteeism rates for Native American and Alaska Native students that were at least 9 percentage points higher than the state average. Many schools serving Native students have been working to strengthen connections with families, who often struggle with higher rates of illness and poverty. Schools also must navigate distrust dating back to the U.S. government's campaign to break up Native American culture, language and identity by forcing children into abusive boarding schools. History 'may cause them to not see the investment in a public school education as a good use of their time,' said Dallas Pettigrew, director of Oklahoma University's Center for Tribal Social Work and a member of the Cherokee Nation. On-site health, trauma care The San Carlos school system recently introduced care centers that partner with hospitals, dentists and food banks to provide services to students at multiple schools. The work is guided by cultural success coaches — school employees who help families address challenges that keep students from coming to school. Nearly 100% of students in the district are Native and more than half of families have incomes below the federal poverty level. Many students come from homes that deal with alcoholism and drug abuse, Superintendent Deborah Dennison said. Students miss school for reasons ranging from anxiety to unstable living conditions, said Jason Jones, a cultural success coach at San Carlos High School and an enrolled member of the San Carlos Apache tribe. Acknowledging their fears, grief and trauma helps him connect with students, he said. 'You feel better, you do better,' Jones said. 'That's our job here in the care center is to help the students feel better.' In the 2023-2024 school year, the chronic absenteeism rate in the district fell from 76% to 59% — an improvement Dennison attributes partly to efforts to address their communities' needs. 'All these connections with the community and the tribe are what's making a difference for us and making the school a system that fits them rather than something that has been forced upon them, like it has been for over a century of education in Indian Country,' said Dennison, a member of the Navajo Nation. In three states — Alaska, Nebraska and South Dakota — the majority of Native American and Alaska Native students were chronically absent. In some states, it has continued to worsen, even while improving slightly for other students, as in Arizona, where chronic absenteeism for Native students rose from 22% in 2018-2019 to 45% in 2022-2023. AP's analysis does not include data on schools managed by the U.S. Bureau of Indian Education, which are not run by traditional districts. Less than 10% of Native American students attend BIE schools. Schools close on days of Native ceremonial gatherings At Algodones Elementary School, which serves a handful of Native American pueblos along New Mexico's Upper Rio Grande, about two-thirds of students are chronically absent. The communities were hit hard by COVID-19, with devastating impacts on elders. Since schools reopened, students have been slow to return. Excused absences for sick days are still piling up — in some cases, Principal Rosangela Montoya suspects, students are stressed about falling behind academically. Staff and tribal liaisons have been analyzing every absence and emphasizing connections with parents. By 10 a.m., telephone calls go out to the homes of absent students. Next steps include in-person meetings with those students' parents. 'There's illness. There's trauma,' Montoya said. 'A lot of our grandparents are the ones raising the children so that the parents can be working.' About 95% of Algodones' students are Native American, and the school strives to affirm their identity. It doesn't open on four days set aside for Native American ceremonial gatherings, and students are excused for absences on other cultural days as designated by the nearby pueblos. For Jennifer Tenorio, it makes a difference that the school offers classes in the family's native language of Keres. She speaks Keres at home but says that's not always enough to instill fluency. Tenorio said her two oldest children, now in their 20s, were discouraged from speaking Keres when enrolled in the federal Head Start educational program — a system that now promotes native language preservation — and they struggled academically. 'It was sad to see with my own eyes,' said Tenorio, a single parent and administrative assistant who has used the school's food bank. 'In Algodones, I saw a big difference to where the teachers were really there for the students, and for all the kids, to help them learn.' Over a lunch of strawberry milk and enchiladas on a recent school day, her 8-year-old son Cameron Tenorio said he likes math and wants to be a policeman. 'He's inspired,' Tenorio said. 'He tells me every day what he learns.' Home visits In Arizona, Rice Intermediate School Principal Nicholas Ferro said better communication with families, including Tommy Betom's, has helped improve attendance. Since many parents are without working phones, he said, that often means home visits. Lillian Curtis said she has been impressed by Rice Intermediate's student activities on family night. Her granddaughter, Brylee Lupe, 10, missed 10 days of school by mid-October last year but had missed just two days by the same time this year. 'The kids always want to go — they are anxious to go to school now. And Brylee is much more excited,' said Curtis, who takes care of her grandchildren. Curtis said she tells Brylee that skipping school is not an option. The district has made gains because it is changing the perception of school and what it can offer, said Dennison, the superintendent. Its efforts have helped not just with attendance but also morale, especially at the high school, she said. 'Education was a weapon for the U.S. government back in the past,' she said. 'We work to decolonize our school system.' This story is part of a collaboration on chronic absenteeism among Native American students between The Associated Press and ICT, a news outlet that covers Indigenous issues.	https://www.voanews.com/a/native-american-students-found-to-miss-school-at-higher-rates/7887225.html	2024-12-04T10:56:57-08:00	
Canadians push back on Trump's tariff threat	Vancouver, British Columbia — President-elect Donald Trump’s threat to introduce 25% tariffs on all imports from Mexico and Canada is getting reaction, not surprisingly, in both countries. The threat of tariffs on everything coming across the world’s largest undefended border from Canada to the United States got attention but has not been met with overwhelming surprise. University of British Columbia political scientist Stewart Prest said it is a return to Trump World, where the world is responding to his social media posts. He said Canadian authorities should know from the previous Trump administration to take the threat seriously but not literally. 'But the other piece of it is then to find ways to respond to, address what Mr. Trump is saying, but to do so without simply giving in and waving the white flag,' Prest said. 'That the need to push back in creative ways is, I think, an important lesson, as well.' Trump says he will impose this tariff if Canada and Mexico do not get control of illegal migrants and fentanyl distribution. According to data from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, just under 20 kilograms of fentanyl was seized along the Canada-U.S. border in the last fiscal year. During the same time, 9,500 kilograms were seized along the U.S.-Mexican border. Canada is the largest trading partner of the United States, with goods valued at an average $2.7 billion crossing the almost 9,000-kilometer-long border every day in 2023. Canada is the United States of America’s largest source of foreign oil. Prest said the proposed tariffs on that would increase costs on everything, and this needs to be effectively communicated. '[Make] it clear that there are interests that unite the two countries and that they're far greater than whatever divides us,' Prest said. 'Those messages need to be put forward in a variety of formats.' Andreas Schotter, a professor of global strategy at the Ivey Business School at Western University in Ontario, said the proposed tariffs will hurt both countries. But, he added, they can be avoided if Canada makes serious commitments with tangible results. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau’s government is suggesting it could deploy more law enforcement resources to the border, including personnel, helicopters and unmanned drones. Schotter’s concern is that the most recent demand from Trump may go beyond fentanyl and migration and lead to the cancellation of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement that Trump negotiated in his first term to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement. 'I think he will not wait for 2026 to reopen USMCA,' Schotter said. 'I think he will say, ‘Well, you can talk to me now, or I will not talk to you in 2026, and I just cancel it, right?’ So I think he will not respect even the agreed upon timelines, necessarily. And this is worrying me.' This past weekend, Trudeau, his chief of staff Katie Telford and Minster of Public Safety Dominic LeBlanc flew from Ottawa to Trump’s home in Florida for direct talks. LeBlanc has told multiple media outlets the dinner meeting went well, with Trump emphasizing the prevalence of fentanyl as a main concern. Also discussed was the large trade deficit between United States and Canada. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, this amounted to $53.5 billion in 2022. The Canadian Chamber of Commerce predicts that if the threatened tariffs are put in place, they would shrink Canada’s Gross Domestic Product by 2.6%, and the GDP of the United States by 1.6%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canadians-push-back-on-trump-s-tariff-threat/7887209.html	2024-12-04T10:55:15-08:00	
Africa's women-led startups struggle to find investors	NAIROBI, Kenya — Businesses started by women have received less than 5% of venture capital funding in Africa over the past decade, according to a new report. The report says investment in female-started businesses decreased further last year, frustrating businesswomen and those who want investors to give them greater consideration. Female-founded businesses are the driving force behind innovation and inclusive growth in Africa, but those businesses face many challenges when seeking investment, according to the report by business research platform Briter Bridges and non-profit organization V54 Open Impact. Akosua Lefty, a Ghanaian businesswoman who specializes in developing products for natural hair, said she has struggled to attract interest from potential investors over her two years in business. An investor will express interest then never reach out again, she said, or will want to make money immediately, which may not be possible. Briter Bridges and V54 Open Impact say that of all the capital venture funding across Africa in the past 10 years, less than 5% went to women founders. Elizabeth Mwangi, founder of Gwiji, which connects women cleaners to clients, got her first funding in 2020, which helped her develop an app that could help support and empower women to make a living. She said the next funding she got was in 2023, when she was nearly giving up on Gwiji. She earned the Aurora Tech Award, a global honor that focuses on women. Following that, she was able to get $30,000 in funding that enabled the company to get an office and launch secondary programs that help women. Mwangi said she is partnering with more organizations, like the U.K. government-backed Transform, to widen her reach beyond Nairobi. The aim, she said, is to empower more women from informal settlements, because every day she gets calls from women across Kenya who want to join Gwiji and earn a decent income. Partnering with Transform, she said, allows Gwiji to diversify its services and employ more women. African women face more challenges beyond funding, including gender bias, lack of access to support networks, culture and policy changes. Lefty said she is ready to be patient and build a business that can withstand the challenges of being a woman.

Notre Dame reopens amid French political turmoil	PARIS — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and U.S. first lady Jill Biden are among global dignitaries expected in Paris Saturday as the city’s iconic Notre Dame Cathedral reopens five years after a massive fire. Trump’s visit to Paris is expected to be his first foreign trip since winning the election last month. U.S. President Joe Biden is not expected to attend. It has taken five years, 2,000 artisans and workers, and hundreds of millions of dollars to restore the medieval Gothic masterpiece. It was nearly destroyed during a fire in April 2019. French President Emmanuel Macron visited the restored cathedral Friday and said the reconstruction workers had participated in an unprecedented project. Macron will join the archbishop of Paris, along with Catholic and other dignitaries, for official opening ceremonies Saturday. The cathedral will open its doors to the public on Sunday as part of weeklong reopening events. Even covered with scaffolding and closed to visitors, Notre Dame has attracted hordes of tourists during the years of reconstruction. Manuele Monica, a visitor from Italy, said, 'I can understand why people in the past created buildings such as this one, because it’s so huge. It’s really tall — like it’s going up in the sky.' The event offers a short reprieve for France, which is facing pre-Christmas strikes, soaring debt and an uncertain political future.	https://www.voanews.com/a/notre-dame-reopens-amid-french-political-turmoil/7887104.html	2024-12-04T08:58:29-08:00	
Report: Africa's civic space remains mostly repressive	NAIROBI — Forty-three out of 50 countries and territories in sub-Saharan Africa have 'restricted' or 'shut down' civic spaces, according to a report released Wednesday by a global alliance of civil society organizations. The annual report, titled 'People Power Under Attack 2024,' says civic space has improved over the past year in Botswana and Liberia, but gotten worse in Burkina Faso, Eswatini, Ethiopia and Kenya. Conditions for civil society have deteriorated over the past year in nine countries, four of which are in Africa, and general civic space conditions in the African continent remain 'repressive,' according toCIVICUS, which tracks the state of civic freedoms of 198 countries. Sylvia Mbataru, a human rights lawyer and CIVICUS researcher, said almost 900 million people in sub-Saharan Africa live in politically repressed societies. 'Almost 70 percent of the population in Africa south of the Sahara is now living within a repressed civic space,' Mbataru said. 'That means a big majority of the continent are not able to access their rights, are not able to speak out anymore, are not even able to engage in meaningful democracy efforts and governance efforts. So this is a really concerning figure to have.' Many governments in Africa have curtailed people's rights, the report says, and their security forces have committed violations against protesters, human rights defenders, and journalists. Authorities are accused of disrupting peaceful protests by force, detaining demonstrators, and prosecuting human rights defenders, protesters and journalists. Kenya’s ranking was downgraded from 'obstructed' to 'repressed' due to the government crackdown on nationwide protests in June and July, which were sparked by a proposed finance bill that sought to raise taxes. According to rights groups, more than 60 people were killed during the protests in Kenya and dozens more are missing. They blame the killings on Kenyan security agencies, a claim denied by the government. Thirty-eight-year-old Edith Kamau lost her son during anti-tax protests in Kenya. She agrees with the report that her country's human rights record and civic space are not good, saying that no one — rich or poor — is safe and secure. Even well-to-do people are being abducted, she said, and the current president is not good for his people. Kamau said her son's body was recovered from a government building, per a police report, but she and her family have yet to get justice. The post-mortem report showed her son was shot at close range during the protests, and officers told her the weapons used were carried exclusively by special forces, but she said she has been kept in the dark about what really happened. The CIVICUS report downgraded Burkina Faso’s status from 'obstructed' to 'repressed.' Eswatini and Ethiopia were downgraded from 'repressed' to 'closed,' meaning authorities there tolerate almost no public dissent or demonstrations. Despite many African countries restricting civic space, some are making progress in allowing political expression and defense of human rights. According to the researchers, civic space and freedom are 'open' in seven African countries, including Botswana and Liberia, which have improved their conditions in the past year. Liberia witnessed a peaceful power transfer late last year, and CIVICUS says it noted fewer violations in press freedom and peaceful assembly areas. In Botswana, the ruling party, which had governed the country since 1966, was voted out in the October presidential elections. Even before then, says CIVICUS, civil society groups were allowed to push back against proposed constitutional changes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/report-africa-s-civic-space-remains-mostly-repressive/7887040.html	2024-12-04T08:16:38-08:00	
Russia-related sanctions target illicit digital finance network, US says	WASHINGTON — The Biden administration issued a fresh round of Russia-related sanctions on Wednesday, taking aim at what it called an illicit finance network that allowed Russian elites to leverage digital assets to avoid sanctions. In a statement, the U.S. Department of Treasury said it was targeting five people and four entities tied to 'a sprawling international network of businesses and employees that have facilitated significant sanctions circumvention' known as the TGR Group. The targets also include an entity based in Wyoming that is owned in part by a sanctioned individual, the department said. 'Through the TGR Group, Russian elites sought to exploit digital assets — in particular U.S. dollar-backed stablecoins — to evade U.S. and international sanctions, further enriching themselves and the Kremlin,' Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley Smith said in a statement. The international network actions include 'the laundering of funds associated with sanctioned entities; providing an unregistered service to exchange cash and cryptocurrency; the receipt of cash and making the value available to clients in the form of cryptocurrency; providing a prepaid credit card service; and obfuscating the source of funds to allow high-net-worth Russian nationals to purchase property in the United Kingdom,' according to the department's statement. Such sanctions generally prohibit any U.S. persons or entities from conducting any transactions with sanctioned targets and freeze any U.S.-held assets belonging to the sanctioned people or entities. Among those targeted in Wednesday's action are George Rossi, a Russian-born Ukrainian national born in Russia that the Treasury Department said is believed to control the TGR Group, and Rossi's direct subordinate, Russian national Elena Chirkinyan, among others.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-related-sanctions-target-illicit-digital-finance-network-us-says/7887042.html	2024-12-04T08:09:39-08:00	
Reports: UnitedHealthcare CEO shot dead outside New York hotel	NEW YORK — Brian Thompson, the CEO of UnitedHealthcare, was fatally shot outside a hotel in midtown Manhattan where he was scheduled to speak at an investor meeting Wednesday morning, according to a person briefed on the investigation. The person spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak on the investigation. Police did not release the victim's name but said a 50-year-old was shot around 6:45 a.m. outside a Hilton before the shooter fled. The victim was taken to a nearby hospital but could not be saved. UnitedHealthcare is the insurance arm of the health care giant UnitedHealth Group Inc. The Minnetonka, Minnesota-based company was scheduled to have its annual meeting with investors in New York City to update Wall Street on the company's direction and expectations for the coming year, according to a company media advisory. An announcement was made to attendees Wednesday morning that the conference was ending early. The Hilton is in a bustling part of Manhattan, a short walk from tourist sites such as the Museum of Modern Art and Rockefeller Center, and often dense with tourists and office workers on weekday mornings. The popular Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree lighting is set to take place Wednesday evening. Part of the block where the shooting took place was cordoned off with police tape, with a large contingent of police officers at the scene. Many security cameras are nearby. Thompson had served as CEO for more than three years and had been with the company since 2004. Minnesota Governor Tim Walz tweeted that the state is 'sending our prayers to Brian's family and the UnitedHealthcare team.' 'This is horrifying news and a terrible loss for the business and health care community in Minnesota,' he wrote. UnitedHealthcare is the largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans in the U.S. and manages health insurance coverage for employers and state- and federally funded Medicaid programs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/reports-unitedhealthcare-ceo-shot-dead-outside-new-york-hotel/7887014.html	2024-12-04T07:59:58-08:00	
Police in Georgia arrest opposition leader as mass protests continue	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Georgian police on Wednesday raided the offices of an opposition party and arrested its leader in an apparent attempt to squelch a wave of mass protests triggered by the governing party's decision to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union. During the past six nights, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to disperse the demonstrators, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital's central boulevard. More than 300 protesters have been detained since Thursday, and over 100 people have been treated for injuries. On Wednesday, the Coalition for Change opposition party said that police raided its offices and detained its leader, Nika Gvaramia. It shared a video showing several officers dragging Gvaramia into a car. Georgian media reported that police also raided the offices of several other opposition groups and nongovernment organizations. The ruling Georgian Dream party retained control of parliament in the disputed October 26 election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia's EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia's help and boycotted parliament sessions. Mass opposition protests sparked by the vote gained new momentum after the governing party's decision on Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili refused to recognize the official election results and contested them in the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal on Tuesday. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to lead the opposition demand for a new parliamentary election. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc's recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. It requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The Georgian government's announcement of the EU accession talks' suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October's election as neither free nor fair. On Monday, the EU reiterated its 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of Georgian Dream declared Tuesday that the government is willing to open EU accession talks if the bloc ends its 'blackmail.' 'I want to remind European bureaucrats and politicians, including those who are artificially hindering our country's European integration, to bring negotiations to the table, and we will sign immediately, on the same day, at that very moment,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-in-georgia-arrest-opposition-leader-as-mass-protests-continue/7886990.html	2024-12-04T07:50:01-08:00	
Transgender rights case lands at Supreme Court	WASHINGTON — The Supreme Court is hearing arguments Wednesday in just its second major transgender rights case, which is a challenge to a Tennessee law that bans gender-affirming health care for minors. The justices' decision, not expected for several months, could affect similar laws enacted by 25 other states and a range of efforts to regulate the lives of transgender people, including which sports competitions they can join and which bathrooms they can use. The case is coming before a conservative-dominated court after a presidential election in which Donald Trump and his allies promised to roll back protections for transgender people. There were dueling rallies outside the court in the hours before the arguments. Speeches and music filled the air on the sidewalk below the court's marble steps. Advocates of the ban bore signs like 'Champion God's Design' and 'Kids Health Matters,' while the other side proclaimed 'Fight like a Mother for Trans Rights' and 'Freedom to be Ourselves.' Four years ago, the court ruled in favor of Aimee Stephens, who was fired by a Michigan funeral home after she informed its owner that she was a transgender woman. The court held that transgender people, as well as gay and lesbian people, are protected by a landmark federal civil rights law that prohibits sex discrimination in the workplace. The Biden administration and the families and health care providers who challenged the Tennessee law are urging the justices to apply the same sort of analysis that the majority, made up of liberal and conservative justices, embraced in the case four years ago when it found that 'sex plays an unmistakable role' in employers' decisions to punish transgender people for traits and behavior they otherwise tolerate. The issue in the Tennessee case is whether the law violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment, which requires the government to treat similarly situated people the same. Tennessee's law bans puberty blockers and hormone treatments for transgender minors, but not 'across the board,' lawyers for the families wrote in their Supreme Court brief. The lead lawyer, Chase Strangio of the American Civil Liberties Union, is the first openly transgender person to argue in front of the justices. The administration argues there is no way to determine whether 'treatments must be withheld from any particular minor' without considering the minor's sex. 'That is sex discrimination,' Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar wrote in her main court filing. The state acknowledges that the same treatments that are banned for transgender minors can be prescribed for other reasons. But it rejects the claim that it is discriminating on the basis of sex. Instead, it says lawmakers acted to protect minors from the risks of 'life-altering gender-transition procedures.' The law 'draws a line between minors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes. And boys and girls fall on both sides of that line,' Tennessee Attorney General Jonathan Skrmetti wrote in the state's Supreme Court brief. While the challengers invoke the 2020 ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County for support, Tennessee relies on the court's precedent-shattering Dobbs decision in 2022 that ended nationwide protections for abortion and returned the issue to the states. The two sides battled in their legal filings over the appropriate level of scrutiny the court should apply. It's more than an academic exercise. The lowest level is known as rational basis review and almost every law looked at that way is ultimately upheld. Indeed, the federal appeals court in Cincinnati that allowed the Tennessee law to be enforced held that lawmakers acted rationally to regulate medical procedures, well within their authority. The appeals court reversed a trial court that employed a higher level of review, heightened scrutiny, that applies in cases of sex discrimination. Under this more searching examination, the state must identify an important objective and show that the law helps accomplish it. If the justices opt for heightened scrutiny, they could return the case to the appeals court to apply it. Gender-affirming care for youth is supported by every major medical organization, including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychiatric Association. But Tennessee is pointing to health authorities in Sweden, Finland, Norway and the United Kingdom that found the medical treatments 'pose significant risks with unproven benefits.' None of those countries has adopted a ban like the one in Tennessee, and individuals can still obtain treatment, Prelogar wrote in response. The Williams family of Nashville, Tennessee, are among those challenging the state law. Brian Williams said that because of puberty blockers and hormone treatments, his transgender daughter, L.W., is a '16-year-old planning for her future, making her own music and looking at colleges.' But because of Tennessee's ban, she has to travel to another state to receive the health care that 'we and her doctors know is right for her.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/transgender-rights-case-lands-at-supreme-court/7886938.html	2024-12-04T07:23:19-08:00

Syrian forces battle insurgents north of strategic city of Hama	BEIRUT — Syria said Wednesday its counteroffensive has pushed back insurgents attempting to advance to the strategic central city of Hama, while the insurgency says it captured more Syrian troops and Iran-backed militants in fierce battles. The latest flareup in Syria's long civil war comes after forces opposed to Syrian President Bashar Assad over the past few days captured large parts of the northern city of Aleppo, the country's largest, as well as towns and villages in southern parts of the northwestern Idlib province. The offensive is being led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, a jihadi group, as well as an umbrella group of Turkish-backed Syrian militias called the Syrian National Army. For years, both have entrenched themselves in northwest Idlib province and parts of northern Aleppo, as the battered country reeled from years of political and military stalemates. The war between Assad and his foreign backers and the array of armed opposition forces seeking his overthrow has killed an estimated half-million people over the past 13 years. Syrian state media SANA on Wednesday said insurgents retreated some 20 kilometers (12 miles) from government-held Hama, Syria's fourth-largest city, as government troops backed by Russian airpower entrenched themselves in the outskirts. Fierce fighting has raged for days as Damascus fears that the insurgents will make their way into the city like they did over the weekend into Aleppo. A Syrian photographer working for the German news agency dpa was killed in an airstrike near the city of Hama, the agency said Wednesday. Anas Alkharboutli, 32, has long documented Syria's civil war, which started after a brutal crackdown on a popular uprising against Assad in 2011. He had worked for dpa since 2017. The insurgency, through its Military Operations Department channel on the Telegram app, said it captured five Iran-backed militants, of whom two were from Afghanistan, as well as three Syrian troops from its 25th Special Mission Forces Division in eastern Hama. The claims could not be independently confirmed. If the insurgents seize Hama city and control the province, it could leave the coastal cities of Tartous and Lattakia isolated from the rest of the country. Lattakia is a key political stronghold for Assad and Syria's Alawite community and a strategic Russian naval base. Tens of thousands have been displaced by the fighting, which started last week, Geir Pedersen, the U.N. special envoy for Syria, said Tuesday. 'If we do not see de-escalation and a rapid move to a serious political process, involving the Syrian parties and the key international players, then I fear we will see a deepening of the crisis,' Pedersen said in an address the U.N. Security Council. 'Syria will be in grave danger of further division, deterioration and destruction.' Turkey, which backs Syria's opposition, has called on Assad to reconcile with opposition forces and include them in any political solution to end the conflict. Ankara has been seeking to normalize ties with Syria to address security threats from groups affiliated with Kurdish militants along its southern border and to help ensure the safe return of more than 3 million Syrian refugees. Assad has insisted that Turkey's withdrawal of its military forces from northern Syria be a condition for any normalization between the two countries. Damascus views the insurgents as terrorists, and Assad has vowed to respond to the insurgency with an iron fist. Turkish and Iranian officials met earlier this week in a bid to reach a solution to de-escalate the flareup. Arab countries bordering Syria that once backed groups trying to overthrow Assad have expressed their concern of the conflict's regional impact and have backed the president.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-forces-battle-insurgents-north-of-strategic-city-of-hama/7886860.html	2024-12-04T06:29:37-08:00	
China grows global influence through partnership with Russia in 2024	Taipei, Taiwan — In the past year an economic downturn, persistent youth unemployment and a property crisis have plagued China at home. Abroad, Beijing has expanded its cooperation with Russia despite warnings from Western leaders that a closer alliance between the two countries is a source of growing concern. In 2024, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin held three bilateral meetings. The two militaries also conducted several joint exercises in different parts of the world this year. From Ukraine and BRICS to bilateral economic ties and the multilateral system, the 'no limits' relationship that Beijing and Moscow announced just before Russia invaded Ukraine continued to live up to its name said analysts. Their 'frequent engagement shows that both countries are focused on their relationship and despite many barriers and issues that they had to deal with,' said Philipp Ivanov, a non-resident senior fellow at Asia Society told VOA on November 28. During their meetings, Xi and Putin repeatedly highlighted the importance of their bilateral cooperation. 'With the concerted efforts of the two sides, China-Russia relations have been moving forward steadily, with enhanced comprehensive strategic coordination and further cooperation on economy and trade, investment, energy, people-to-people exchanges, at the subnational level and in other fields,' Xi said during his meeting with Putin in Beijing on May 16. Ivanov said the relationship between the two neighboring countries has been mutually beneficial. 'Russia has become quite dependent on China in terms of the supplies of electronics and manufacturing equipment,' he told VOA in a video interview last Thursday. 'Beijing has been benefiting from the discounted energy prices that Russia provides.' Promoting a multipolar world order China and Russia have also been seeking to promote an alternative 'multipolar' world order that challenges the global system led by the United States in 2024. Part of that effort to promote the multipolar world order has come through the expansion of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, also called SCO, and BRICS, an informal group of states that originally included Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa. BRICS has since expanded to include other countries from Africa and the Middle East. In 2024, Belarus became the latest country to join SCO and in July, Minsk held joint military exercises with China near the border of Poland and Ukraine. Meanwhile, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia formally applied to join BRICS this year. Experts say the push has been appealing to some middle-power countries, such as Saudi Arabia, Indonesia and Brazil. These countries 'feel they can increase their own power through multilateral institutions like BRICS and SCO because they can play bigger roles in these organizations,' Sari Arho Havren, an associate fellow at the Royal United Services Institute, told VOA on November 28. As the idea of a multipolar world order appeals to more Global South countries, Arho Havren said it strengthens China’s efforts to portray itself as the leader of the Global South. 'During the G20 Summit in Brazil, Xi Jinping portrayed China’s governance model as a model for developing countries, and I think that reflects China’s growing confidence in presenting itself as a leader of the Global South,' she told VOA by phone. The Global South generally refers to countries listed as 'developing' by the United Nations but also includes China and several wealthy Gulf states. China and Russia have stepped up their use of the grouping to highlight efforts to support the developing world and grow the political, military and economic influence. While more countries express interest in joining multilateral institutions like BRICS, some analysts say their motivation may not be the same as Beijing and Moscow’s anti-West agenda. China and Russia 'are trying to shift BRICS into some sort of anti-Western grouping, but not many countries in the Global South are on board with the idea,' said Manoj Kewalramani, chairperson of the Indo-Pacific Studies Program at the Takshashila Institution in India. 'A lot of countries enter BRICS because they see it as [a platform that gives them] a collective voice to share their grievances with regard to lack of representation in global governance and the ability to shape global rules,' he told VOA in a Zoom interview on November 29. Deterring the US and its allies China and Russia also increased joint military exercises in 2024, holding military drills and patrols in the South China Sea, the Arctic, the Mediterranean and the Sea of Japan. Ivanov at the Asia Society said China and Russia are trying to use the joint military drills to 'demonstrate that they have sufficient military capabilities to deter the U.S.' He added, 'The exercises are also opportunities for China and Russia to test the limits of their military cooperation.' 'As they exercise together more and do it in different places, it creates a certain connection between the two militaries, which is the most important ingredient that’s currently missing in the China-Russia relations,' Ivanov said. Despite increased military cooperation with Russia in different parts of the world, Ivanov said China is still largely focused on modernizing its military and preparing for contingency scenarios in Taiwan and the South China Sea. 'The exercises with Russia are essentially experiments for the Chinese military to operate far away from its borders and it’s too early to assess how ambitious China’s global military strategy may be,' he said. As countries around the world prepare for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January, Arho Havren said China will seek to grow its influence in different parts of the world where Washington might reduce its presence. 'Wherever the U.S. takes a less-strong position, China will be ready to fill the vacuum,' she told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-grows-global-influence-through-partnership-with-russia-in-2024/7886776.html	2024-12-04T06:06:34-08:00	
Jailed Iranian Nobel Peace laureate gets 3-week medical release	Iranian Nobel Peace laureate Narges Mohammadi has been temporarily released from prison on medical grounds, her lawyer said Wednesday. Mostafa Nili said on the social media platform X the release would last three weeks and was connected to an operation Mohammadi had last month to remove a benign tumor. Mohammadi has been imprisoned since November 2021 in relation to her work against the wearing of mandatory hijab by women. Rights groups appealed last month for Iranian authorities to grant her a medical furlough, expressing concerns that she was quickly returned to prison following the surgery. Mohammadi has been sentenced to more than 13 years in prison on charges of colluding against the state and engaging in propaganda against the government. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7886763.html	2024-12-04T04:36:08-08:00	
Deadly Israeli strikes hit central Gaza	Palestinian medics said Israeli airstrikes killed at least five people Wednesday in the central Gaza Strip. The Israeli military also said Wednesday it made a number of arrests after Israeli settlers attacked several towns in the occupied West Bank. The Israel Defense Forces said the violence included settler attacks on the village of Beit Furik where settlers hurled stones and wounded two border police. Settler violence has surged in the West Bank since Hamas launched its October 2023 attack on Israel, and Israeli forces have carried out numerous raids on West Bank villages as part of a campaign the military says is aimed at disrupting militant activities. Israel forces carried out fresh airstrikes Wednesday in southern Lebanon, a week after Israel and the militant group Hezbollah began a ceasefire. The halt in fighting after a year of cross-border clashes and months of intensified fighting that included Israeli troops going into southern Lebanon has been threatened by continued Israeli airstrikes and Hezbollah rocket fire. The two sides are supposed to pull back from the border area under the ceasefire agreement, with Lebanese troops and U.N. peacekeepers maintaining a buffer zone. Lebanese Health Minister Firass Abiad said Wednesday that the Israel-Hezbollah war has killed at least 4,047 and wounded more than 16,600 others. Abiad said most of the casualties took place since September 15, and that the actual number of dead is believed to be higher. U.S. and other officials expressed hope in recent days that the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah could help to push along efforts to secure a ceasefire in Gaza. Months of talks brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza have yet to yield an agreement between Israel and Hamas. The war in Gaza began with Hamas killing about 1,200 people and taking another 250 hostage in its 2023 attack. There are still about 100 hostages held in Gaza, with about one-third believed to be dead. In its counteroffensive in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 44,500 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza health ministry. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/deadly-israeli-strikes-hit-central-gaza/7886732.html	2024-12-04T04:00:39-08:00	
Namibia elects Nandi-Ndaitwah as first female president	WINDHOEK, Namibia — Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah of Namibia's ruling SWAPO party has been elected president and will be the country's first female leader, results released by the country's electoral commission showed on Tuesday. Nandi-Ndaitwah, 72, is the current vice president. Her victory will extend SWAPO's 34 years in power since it led Namibia to independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990. She received roughly 57% of valid votes in the presidential race, according to a breakdown given by the Electoral Commission of Namibia. Nandi-Ndaitwah needed to secure more than 50% of the votes to secure a win. 'The Namibian nation has voted for peace and stability,' Nandi-Ndaitwah said after being declared president-elect. She joined SWAPO in the 1960s when it was fighting for independence and has served in numerous senior roles including foreign minister in the democratic era. Her main challenger in this election was Panduleni Itula from the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC) party, who came second with roughly 26% of votes. Namibians voted separately for the National Assembly. SWAPO won a majority there, securing 51 of the 96 elected seats. The IPC won 20 seats and will be the official opposition. The IPC has said it will challenge the results in court, calling the electoral process 'deeply flawed.' The Nov. 27 vote was marred by technical difficulties and ballot paper shortages, leading to a delay in results as voting was extended in some places. Political analysts had said a SWAPO victory was uncertain due to growing frustration with high levels of unemployment and inequality, but that the party retained strong roots in rural areas and loyalty among older voters due to the national liberation struggle. Analyst Rakkel Andreas said Nandi-Ndaitwah had managed to unite different factions within SWAPO and that her reputation had not been tarnished by corruption allegations, unlike other party members. 'She is a stateswoman. She has been in some form of leadership since we gained independence,' Andreas said. 'She understands the system.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-elects-nandi-ndaitwah-as-first-female-president/7886692.html	2024-12-04T03:14:59-08:00	
Death toll rises to 29 in southern Thailand floods	BANGKOK — More than 30,000 people have been forced to flee their homes due to severe flooding in southern Thailand, where the death toll climbed to 29, officials said Wednesday. Days more heavy rain are forecast in the area, which has already been battered by torrential floodwaters, with more than 155,000 households currently affected, according to the Thai government's public relations department. Five southern provinces have been hit -- -- Pattani, Narathiwat, Songkhla, Nakhon Si Thammarat and Phatthalung -- forcing more than 33,000 people to leave their homes, the spokesperson for Thailand's ministry of public health said in a statement. The death toll now stands at 29, up from 25 reported on Tuesday. The spokesperson for Ministry of Public Health said mental health teams have been deployed to provide support and care for those affected. A woman from Tak Bai district, Narathiwat province, told state broadcaster Thai PBS that she had not returned home for three days, choosing to stay in a temporary shelter at a local temple after her house was inundated by floodwaters. The Thai Meteorological Department warned Wednesday morning that low pressure moving from the South China Sea across Malaysia and the Andaman Sea was expected to bring heavy rainfall and further flooding to southern Thailand. The Department of Mineral Resources also warned of potential landslides and flash floods until December 5. Disaster response teams were working to drain floodwater and evacuate flood victims to dry areas, the country's disaster agency said on its Facebook page Wednesday morning. The government has deployed rescue teams to assist affected residents and designated $1.5 million in flood relief for each province. On Tuesday the Thai cabinet approved a $260 payment per family to support those affected. The floods have also affected neighboring Malaysia, where tens of thousands of people have been forced from their homes. While Thailand experiences annual monsoon rains, scientists say climate change is causing more intense weather patterns that can make destructive floods more likely. Widespread flooding across the country in 2011 killed more than 500 people and damaged millions of homes.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-rises-to-29-in-southern-thailand-floods/7886658.html	2024-12-04T02:17:57-08:00	
Second major Myanmar rebel group calls for talks with junta	BANGKOK — A second major Myanmar ethnic rebel group has said it is ready for Beijing-mediated talks with the junta to end more than a year of renewed fighting that has ravaged areas along the Chinese border. The Myanmar National Democratic Alliance Army (MNDAA), with about 8,000 available fighters, has fought the Myanmar military for more than a decade for autonomy for the Kokang ethnic minority in northern Shan state. Last year, it and two other allied rebel groups launched an offensive against the military and seized swathes of Shan state, including ruby mines and a lucrative trade highway to China. Last week, MNDAA ally the Ta'ang National Liberation Army (TNLA) said it was ready for talks with the military. 'From today onwards we will cease fire immediately, and will not actively attack the Myanmar army,' the MNDAA said in a statement released late Tuesday. 'Under the mediation of China, we are willing to engage in peace talks with the Myanmar army on issues such as Lashio,' it said, referring to the city its fighters captured in August in a huge blow to the junta. The MNDAA was 'willing to send a high-level delegation to engage in dialogue and consult with the Myanmar military and resolve conflicts and differences through political means,' it said. A junta spokesman did not respond when contacted for comment on the MNDAA statement. AFP has contacted China's embassy in Myanmar for comment. The junta has not publicly responded to the TNLA offer, and local media outlets have reported continued air strikes on TNLA-held territory. The Arakan Army (AA), the third group in the rebel alliance, is still fighting the military in coastal Rakhine state in Myanmar's west, home to China and India-backed port projects. AFP has contacted an AA spokesman for comment. China is a major ally and arms supplier of the junta but also maintains ties with ethnic rebel groups that hold territory near its border. It has repeatedly called for fighting to stop in Shan state, a key link in its trillion-dollar Belt and Road initiative. Earlier this month, Beijing said the head of the MNDAA had come to China for 'medical care' after news reports in Myanmar said he had been arrested on China's orders. Myanmar is home to about a dozen ethnic rebel groups that have battled the military for decades for autonomy and control of lucrative resources including jade, timber and opium. Some, including the TNLA, have given shelter and training to newer 'People's Defense Forces' that sprang up to battle the military after it seized power in a 2021 coup.	https://www.voanews.com/a/second-major-myanmar-rebel-group-calls-for-talks-with-junta/7886657.html	2024-12-04T02:12:26-08:00	
German firms' China market sentiment falls to record low, survey shows	Beijing — Business sentiment among German companies in China is at an all-time low, a German business lobby group said on Wednesday, as they face rising Chinese competition and a slowing economy. Over half of German companies said conditions in their industry had worsened this year, the German Chamber of Commerce in China said citing a survey, while only 32% forecast an improvement in 2025 - the lowest since records began in 2007. 'This year has been difficult for the majority of German companies, prompting a downward adjustment of their business outlook,' said Clas Neumann, chair of the German Chamber of Commerce's east China chapter, while adding that 92% of German companies planned to maintain their operations in the $19 trillion economy. Germany is China's biggest European partner, and prominent German firms with large investments in China include automakers Volkswagen as well as BMW and auto parts supplier Bosch. The German survey comes just a day after a British sentiment survey of companies operating in China painted a downbeat picture. While foreign direct investment, seen as a signal of confidence in China, represents only 3% of the country’s total investment, it has been falling for two straight years. The chamber said investing to keep up with local competitors was the primary motivation for 87% of the 51% of German companies planning to step up their investment in China over the next two years, an annual eight percentage point increase. The chamber also said that companies were, for the first time, reporting that they were contending with a 'Buy China' trend, with Chinese President Xi Jinping's self-sufficiency drive 'Made in China 2025' resulting in local customers opting to buy from local producers. An official factory activity survey released on Saturday showed that new import orders for parts and components used in finished goods fell for an eighth consecutive month in October, while new orders expanded for the first time in seven months. The chamber called on Berlin to place more emphasis on Beijing as a partner and revise its China strategy to better align with German industry's desire to invest more in localization in China, over boosting exports to the market. Berlin opposed the European Commission's tariffs of up to 45.3% on Chinese-built electric vehicles in an October vote. German automakers have heavily criticized the EU measures, aware that possible higher Chinese import duties on large-engined gasoline vehicles would hit them hardest. Volkswagen signaled last week that it was doubling down on its China investment by extending its partnership with Chinese partner SAIC by a decade, though it sold its operations in Xinjiang after years of mounting pressure.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-firms-china-market-sentiment-falls-to-record-low-survey-shows/7886649.html	2024-12-04T01:58:04-08:00	
Australia urges greater internet user choice amid Google dominance, genAI	Australia's competition watchdog said there was a need to revisit efforts to ensure greater choice for internet users, citing Google's dominant search engine market share and its competitors' failure to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. A report by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission said that while the integration of generative AI tools into search engines is still nascent, Big Tech's deep pockets and dominant presence give it an upper hand. The commission said it was concerned Google and Microsoft could integrate generative AI into their search offerings, including through commercial deals, which raises concerns about the accuracy and reliability of search queries. 'While some consumers may find the generative AI search experience more useful and efficient, others may be concerned about the accuracy and reliability of AI-generated responses to search queries,' Commissioner Peter Crone said. Google and Microsoft did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment. Australia has intensified the spotlight on the tech giants, which are mostly domiciled in the U.S. It was the first country to make social media platforms pay media outlets royalties for sharing their content. Last month, it passed a law that banned social media for children aged under 16, and proposed a law earlier this week that could impose fines of up to $32.28 million on tech giants if they suppress competition and prevent consumers from switching between services. The Australian watchdog on Wednesday urged the use of service-specific codes that help prevent anti-competitive behavior, address data advantages and allow consumers to switch between services freely. These proposed measures have been agreed to in principle by the government, ACCC said, and it will close its enquiry by next March.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-urges-greater-internet-user-choice-amid-google-dominance-genai/7886627.html	2024-12-04T01:15:01-08:00	
NATO chief says Russia weaponizing winter in its war in Ukraine	NATO chief Mark Rutte said Tuesday he is confident that whatever military aid allies can supply to Ukraine in the coming months will be provided, as he warned that Russia is again using the onset of winter as a weapon in its war in Ukraine. Rutte told reporters in Brussels ahead of talks with NATO foreign ministers that there is a priority on protecting Ukrainian energy infrastructure and ensuring Ukrainian forces have the air defenses necessary to defend against Russian attacks. In addition to the war in Ukraine, the foreign ministers are also discussing what Rutte said was an 'escalating campaign' of Russian hostile actions toward NATO countries, including acts of sabotage and cybercrimes. Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it shot down 29 of 50 drones that Russia launched in its latest round of overnight attacks. The intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Donetsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy and Ternopil regions, the Ukrainian air force said. Officials in Kharkiv reported damage to a business from a downed drone, while officials in Sumy said Russian shelling damaged several buildings. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it shot down 24 Ukrainian drones overnight, and another 11 drones early Tuesday. Officials in Russia’s Ryazan region said a drone damaged four houses, but caused no casualties. Ukrainian drones were also shot down over the Rostov, Bryansk, Belgorod, Krasnodar, Kursk and Kaluga regions, the ministry said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nato-chief-says-russia-weaponizing-winter-in-its-war-in-ukraine/7886632.html	2024-12-04T01:12:27-08:00	
Biden to visit US-financed Angolan rail hub	Luanda/Lobito, Angola — U.S. President Joe Biden on Wednesday headed to a U.S.-financed African development project that weaves together his personal love of railroads with his desire to leave a legacy on the continent that will outlive his administration. The Lobito Corridor is a 1,300-kilometer rail line stretching from copper-rich Zambia to the port of Lobito in the southwest nation of Angola. The network will form a 'strategic economic corridor' under the Biden administration’s Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment – an initiative meant to counter China’s well-established, sprawling Belt and Road initiative. So far, the Biden administration says it has committed nearly $4 billion towards the project. Biden, in Angola’s capital on Tuesday, cast the project through his love of passenger rail. As a U.S. senator, he commuted to Washington from Wilmington, Delaware – logging, he said, nearly 340 kilometers on every trip. 'I must tell you up front, with American press here, I’m probably the most pro-rail guy in America,' Biden said Tuesday in Angola’s capital, to laughter from the audience gathered to hear him speak at the nation’s slavery museum. Same, or different? Senior administration officials said this rail line will, by the end of the decade, be extended to its full length, stretching from Africa’s Indian Ocean coast to the Atlantic port. Initially, it will transport critical minerals like cobalt and copper from the continent’s deep interior to the coast. When the corridor is completed, a journey that now takes more than 40 days by road can zip across the continent in 40 hours. 'The premise behind the corridor is to be able to take American support and financial capabilities that are limited, and to focus them more deeply in one area, versus spreading that financial support and effort across many countries,' said a senior Biden administration official, who was not identified as is common practice when briefing reporters. VOA asked the official whether this repeats the age-old colonial narrative of exploiting the continent’s rich, raw resources while not adding value and providing steady work for local populations. A burgeoning youth population on the continent has created an urgent need for jobs, putting strain on many African governments. 'I disagree with the premise that this is for raw products,' the official replied. 'Right now, only raw product is coming out. But I think what this rail does – in order to get to higher value products, you need a few things. One of them is affordable and reliable and abundant energy. So the build out of the energy system allows you to then build the value added.' And others questioned whether this U.S. effort, coming more than a decade after China launched its ambitious Belt and Road initiative, can compete. 'Upon closer inspection, it appears to be a mimic of China’s playbook, one that tacitly acknowledges that Washington lags behind Beijing in terms of its investments in Africa but does little to fill the void that exists in China’s footprint,' said Chris O. Ògúnmọ́dẹdé, an editor, consultant, and analyst of African politics, security, and international relations. Wang Peng, a researcher at Renmin University of China, published on a Chinese state thinktank, International Cooperation Center, that Western international projects like the Lobito Corridor don’t pose a challenge to China’s initiative because the United States 'can’t provide sufficient funds and material conditions to truly implement its ambitious global infrastructure plan.' Wang Peng also noted the U.S. could undermine it by exerting diplomatic pressure on host countries to force them to tear up cooperation agreements with China; exaggerate the negative impact of the 'Belt and Road' project on the local ecological environment and water resources…. and hype up the so-called 'debt trap' issue.' Mounting Chinese debt among African nations is something Biden also mentioned indirectly in his remarks Tuesday, in seeking to cast the U.S. as a reliable partner. 'We’ve also pushed to ensure that developing nations do not have to choose between paying down unsustainable debt and being able to invest in their own people,' he said. But, as Biden also said, his time is running short as he prepares to leave office, for president-elect Donald Trump. Analysts say this project may be well received by Trump, as it suits his more transactional approach to the continent, and appeals to one of Trump’s biggest backers, billionaire Elon Musk. 'The money has been earmarked already after all,' said James Murphy of Clark University in Massachusetts. 'Continuing the Lobito project is a smart idea – Trump does not have to own it except in the sense that it gives him a talking point about our strategic/resource-driven interests in Africa, particularly as a strategy to acquire minerals essential for Elon’s Teslas, as it were.'

UN seeks $47 billion in aid as donor appetite shrinks while crises multiply	GENEVA — The United Nations on Wednesday sought $47 billion in aid for 2025 to help around 190 million people fleeing conflict and battling starvation, at a time when this year's appeal is not even half-funded and officials fear cuts from Western states including the top donor, the U.S. Facing what the new U.N. aid chief Tom Fletcher describes as 'an unprecedented level of suffering,' the U.N. hopes to reach people in 32 countries next year, including those in war-torn Sudan, Syria, Gaza and Ukraine. 'The world is on fire, and this is how we put it out,' Fletcher told reporters in Geneva. 'We need to reset our relationship with those in greatest need on the planet,' said Fletcher, a former British diplomat who started as head of the Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) last month. The appeal is the fourth largest in OCHA's history, but Fletcher said it leaves out some 115 million people whose needs the agency cannot realistically hope to fund: 'We've got to be absolutely focused on reaching those in the most dire need, and really ruthless.' The U.N. cut its 2024 appeal to $46 billion from $56 billion the previous year as donor appetite faded, but it is still only 43% funded, one of the worst rates in history. Washington has given over $10 billion, about half the funds received. Aid workers have had to make tough choices, cutting food assistance by 80% in Syria and water services in cholera-prone Yemen, OCHA said. Aid is just one part of total spending by the U.N., which has for years failed to meet its core budget due to countries' unpaid dues. While incoming president Donald Trump halted some U.N. spending during his first term, he left U.N. aid budgets intact. This time, aid officials and diplomats see cuts as a possibility. 'The U.S. is a tremendous question mark,' said Jan Egeland, head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, who held Fletcher's post from 2003-2006. 'I fear that we may be bitterly disappointed because the global mood and the national political developments are not in our favor.' Project 2025, a set of conservative proposals whose authors include some Trump advisers, takes aim at 'wasteful budget increases' by the main U.S. relief agency, USAID. The incoming Trump administration did not respond to a request for comment. Fletcher cited 'the disintegration of our systems for international solidarity' and called for a broadening of the donor base. Asked about Trump's impact, he said: 'I don't believe that there isn't compassion in these governments which are getting elected.' One of the challenges is that crises are now lasting longer - an average of 10 years, according to OCHA. Mike Ryan, World Health Organization emergencies chief, said some states were entering a 'permanent state of crisis.' The European Commission - the European Union executive body - and Germany are the number two and three donors to U.N. aid budgets this year. Charlotte Slente, Secretary General of the Danish Refugee Council, said Europe's contributions were also in doubt as funds are shifted to defense: 'It's a more fragile, unpredictable world [than in Trump's first term], with more crises and, should the U.S. administration cut its humanitarian funding, it could be more complex to fill the gap of growing needs.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-seeks-47-billion-in-aid-as-donor-appetite-shrinks-while-crises-multiply/7886595.html	2024-12-03T22:35:43-08:00	
Backlash grows against South Korea’s Yoon after martial law decree	Seoul, South Korea — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol’s brief declaration of martial law appeared to backfire Wednesday, as lawmakers prepared to begin impeachment proceedings and one of the country’s largest labor unions launched an indefinite general strike demanding his resignation. In a late-night televised address, Yoon announced martial law, claiming it was necessary to 'eradicate anti-state forces' and 'protect constitutional order.' The declaration marked the first use of martial law since South Korea transitioned to democracy in the 1980s. Hours later, the edict was overturned after lawmakers pushed past military and police forces that had surrounded parliament and rescinded the decree by a vote of 190-0. Facing overwhelming resistance, Yoon announced that martial law would be lifted. The dramatic overnight events left many Seoul residents stunned and analysts scrambling to understand Yoon’s strategy, as well as the extent of the political fallout he now faces. Early Wednesday, South Korea’s main opposition Democratic Party announced it would begin impeachment proceedings if Yoon did not resign immediately. South Korea's largest umbrella labor group, the Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, vowed to organize major anti-Yoon rallies and announced an indefinite strike until Yoon steps down. Conservative backlash In a particularly ominous sign for Yoon, many members of his conservative camp fiercely criticized the martial law declaration, with 18 members of his own People Power Party joining the parliamentary effort to overturn the decree. In an editorial, the conservative Chosun Ilbo, the country’s largest newspaper, called the situation 'absurd and unprecedented,' noting that 'hardly anyone' agrees with Yoon’s rationale that the country was facing a national emergency. 'This martial law controversy has cast doubt on President Yoon's ability to remain in office,' said an editorial in the Joongang Ilbo, another conservative paper. 'The previously unthinkable discussion of the president's impeachment has now become inevitable.' Yoon has not publicly responded to calls for his resignation. But Yoon’s senior aides, including his chief of staff and national security adviser, offered to resign on Wednesday, after the country’s ruling party chief called for them to step down. Yoon weakened Since taking office in May 2022, Yoon, a former chief prosecutor known for his blunt rhetoric, has faced fierce political battles with the opposition and suffered from persistently low approval ratings. His critics have seized on corruption allegations involving his wife, Kim Keon-hee, and accused him of mistreating the media. In turn, Yoon has frequently portrayed his critics as North Korea sympathizers and 'anti-state' forces who are trying to disrupt the normal operation of the government. In April, Yoon's conservative party suffered a major defeat in legislative by-elections, further weakening his political standing. As a result, only eight conservative lawmakers would need to abandon Yoon in order for an impeachment motion against him to succeed. The developments suggested to many analysts that Yoon may not be able to serve out the remainder of his single, five-year presidential term. 'This is the end of Yoon's presidency. Full stop,' said Karl Friedhoff, who focuses on Korea for the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. 'The only question is how his presidency will end and how much violence it will entail.' Impeaching a South Korean president requires the support of two-thirds of the National Assembly, after which the Constitutional Court determines whether to uphold the decision. Choi Jong-kun, a professor at Seoul's Yonsei University who served as first vice foreign minister under former South Korean President Moon-Jae-in, said that Yoon's impeachment is 'definitely' inevitable. 'South Korea's democracy is solid and unshakeable,' he added. 'It's a republic backed by the organized power of aware and active citizens who are ready to stand up for its values.' Dramatic scenes The decree — which sought to ban political activities and place media under military control — triggered a frantic late night response at South Korea's National Assembly, the unicameral legislature controlled by Yoon's opponents. Shortly after his address, South Korean military forces descended on the legislative compound, with some arriving by helicopter, according to a VOA reporter on the scene. Security forces attempted to bar entry to lawmakers and others. Despite minor scuffles at the main gate, opposition lawmakers eventually forced their way inside, with some livestreaming on social media as they climbed over gates and through windows to reach the legislative chambers. In an emergency session less than three hours after Yoon's declaration, lawmakers voted to lift the decree. Under South Korea's constitution, the president is required to comply when a majority of lawmakers vote to overturn martial law. Kim Joon-hyung, a member of the opposition Rebuilding Korea Party, described wrestling through security forces to enter the National Assembly. 'I'm sore all over,' he said in a text message to VOA, noting that the military seemed 'confused' and ultimately refrained from aggressive actions to block lawmakers. Videos of civilian resistance against the military circulated widely in South Korean media. In one clip, dozens of people surrounded an armored vehicle outside parliament, preventing further access. In another, aides and civilians sprayed fire extinguishers at military personnel attempting to breach an entrance, forcing them to retreat under the glare of journalists’ cameras. As South Korean martial law troops left South Korea's National Assembly early Wednesday, one of the soldiers repeatedly bowed his head and said, 'I'm sorry,' according to a video posted on YouTube by a local journalist. The dramatic scenes evoked memories of South Korea's authoritarian past, underscoring public resistance to any return to military rule and adding further pressure to Yoon’s already embattled presidency. 'I’m stunned by the news. I feel like I’ve been surrealistically teleported back to the Korea I first experienced as a U.S. diplomat in 1984,' said Rob Rapson, a former U.S. diplomat who served in numerous senior positions at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul. 'I can’t fathom what possessed Yoon to announce martial law and think that he could get away with it in the dark of night. His stated reasons about eradicating ‘anti-state’ forces have little credibility [and] are indefensible,' he added. The developments create an awkward dilemma for the outgoing Biden administration, which had closely aligned with Yoon on a shared vision of 'values-based diplomacy.' Together, they often stood in concert against authoritarian adversaries like China and Russia, emphasizing democracy, human rights, and the rule of law as central to their foreign policies. On Tuesday, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell expressed 'grave concern' over the situation and said he was actively engaging with South Korean counterparts. In a statement, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken welcomed Yoon’s decision to rescind martial law but stopped short of criticizing the South Korean leader. South Korea, home to about 28,000 U.S. troops, remains one of Washington’s most critical allies in the region.	https://www.voanews.com/a/backlash-grows-against-south-korea-s-yoon-after-martial-law-decree/7886594.html	2024-12-03T22:28:19-08:00	
New militias sow future danger for war-weary Sudan	Cairo, Egypt — Mohamed Idris, 27, has despaired of ever finding a job in war-torn Sudan. Instead, he's now set his sights on a training camp on the Eritrean border, hoping to join a militia. 'I got my university degree but there aren't any job opportunities, if I get into a training camp I can at least defend my country and my people,' he told AFP from Kassala in Sudan, the nearest city to the border. Analysts say the growing role such militias and armed groups are playing in the war will only prolong the country's suffering. Sudan's war between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) began in April 2023, sparking what the United Nations calls the world's worst displacement crisis. More than 8 million people have been uprooted internally and more than 3 million have fled abroad. The northeast African country is on the brink of famine, according to aid agencies, and a UN investigation found both sides committed rights abuses with the RSF particularly implicated in sexual violence. In Sudan's east, Kassala and Gedaref have so far been spared the chaos of war, but host more than a million people who have fled fighting elsewhere. In both cities, AFP correspondents have seen convoys of four-wheel drives mounted with anti-aircraft weapons speed through the streets. Each vehicle, blasting its horn as it went, was manned by a handful of young men waving assault rifles -- though the nearest battles are hundreds of kilometers away. The men, like Idris, are part of a generation who have lost their futures to the flames of Sudan's war. Now, they represent recruiting potential for new armed groups being formed, particularly along ethnic and tribal lines in the country's army-controlled east. 'The forces I want to join are from my tribe and my family,' said Idris. According to Sudanese analyst and former culture and information minister Faisal Mohammed Saleh, 'these groups haven't yet joined the fray in the current war.' 'But the fear is that they could be preparing for future rounds,' he told AFP. Sudan, which has only known brief interludes of civilian rule since independence from Britain in 1956, is rife with armed groups, some with the capacity of small armies. For decades, many were locked in wars with the central government, claiming to champion the rights of marginalized ethnic minorities or regions. In 2020, most signed a peace agreement with the government in Khartoum, and several rebel leaders subsequently became senior officials in the government of army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan. 'In the first months of the war, many of these groups were neutral, but have since declared allegiance to the army,' Sudanese policy researcher Qusay Hamrour told AFP. They established the so-called joint forces to fight on the army's side, while other groups 'wavered, before throwing their weight behind the RSF,' Hamrour said. According to former information minister Saleh, 'what's new now is the eastern Sudanese groups, most of which are training inside Eritrea.' Eyewitnesses told AFP earlier this year that they saw Sudanese fighters being trained in at least five locations in neighboring Eritrea, which has not commented on the allegations. The witnesses said the camps were linked to Burhan's army or to figures from the former Islamist-backed regime of ousted dictator Omar al-Bashir. Historically, though ethnic or tribal armed groups 'may ally themselves with the regular army, they remain essentially independent,' according to Ameer Babiker, author of the book 'Sudan's Peace: A Quagmire of Militias and Irregular Armies.' Khartoum has long relied on armed groups to fight its wars in other parts of Sudan. In response to an uprising in Darfur in 2003, Bashir unleashed the Janjaweed militia, leading to war crimes charges against him and others. The RSF, formalized by Bashir in 2013, are descended from the Janjaweed. In 2021, army chief Burhan led a coup that derailed a fragile civilian transition that followed Bashir's own ouster. By April 2023, a long-running power struggle between Burhan and his deputy, RSF commander Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, erupted into all-out war. Now, what Babiker calls 'the weakness of the Sudanese state' has compelled it to again to depend on militias to secure territory. He said this strategy would 'only lead to these groups growing stronger, making them impossible to bypass in the future.' Already, there have emerged 'multiple centres of decision-making within the army,' he told AFP. According to a May report from the International Crisis Group think tank, 'both main belligerents are struggling with command and control.' Burhan, increasingly reliant on powers from the Bashir regime 'as well as communal militias and other armed groups ... risks losing his hold on the various factions.' Meanwhile the RSF is 'an ever more motley assortment of tribal militias and warlords,' according to Crisis Group, which says that both wartime coalitions have become more unwieldy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-militias-sow-future-danger-for-war-weary-sudan/7886564.html	2024-12-03T20:08:18-08:00	
To save a dying swamp, Louisiana aims to restore the Mississippi River's natural flow	GARYVILLE, La. — Louisiana has long relied on a vast levee system to rein in the Mississippi River and protect surrounding communities from flooding. But cutting off the natural flow of the river with man-made barriers has been slowly killing one of the nation's largest forested wetlands. The 456 square kilometers of Maurepas Swamp just to the west of New Orleans holds Louisiana's second-largest contiguous forest, a state wildlife refuge filled with water tupelo and bald cypress trees, their branches adorned by wisps of Spanish moss. A beloved recreation site, the swamp also houses bald eagles, ospreys, black bears and alligators and serves as a waystation for hundreds of different migratory birds. Deprived of nutrients from the stanched Mississippi River, the swamp's iconic trees are dying in stagnant water. Yet they're now set to receive a life-saving boost. State and federal authorities on Tuesday celebrated breaking ground on an ambitious conservation project intended to replenish the ailing trees by diverting water from the Mississippi back into the swamp. 'This is about reconnecting a natural system, actually fixing it to what it used to be,' said Brad Miller, who has shepherded the project for the state's Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority since 2006. Miller likened the $330 million river diversion to watering a garden: 'The swamp needs river water to be a good swamp.' The River Reintroduction into Maurepas Swamp will allow for a maximum of 57 cubic meters per second to flow out of a gated opening to be built in the levee system and routed along a 9 9-kilometer diversion channel. The project expects to revitalize around 182 square kilometers of swamp in an area where less than a third of the forest is considered healthy according to the U.S. Geological Survey. Besides injecting much-needed nutrients and oxygen into the swamp, river water will leave thin layers of sediment deposits that mitigate the effect of subsidence — a natural phenomenon on Louisiana's fragile coast exacerbated by fossil fuel extraction — and climate change-induced sea level rise, said Nick Stevens, a researcher at Southeastern Louisiana University's wetlands ecology and restoration lab. Healthier forests bolster the swamp with decomposing matter from branches and leaves, he added. 'All of that is completely hindered by not having the Mississippi River attached to it anymore,' Stevens said. 'You've got all this land sinking as a result of just not getting nutrients.' The swamp's diminishing health has had ripple effects on biodiversity, says Erik Johnson, director of conservation science at Audubon Delta, an organization focused on bird ecology in the Mississippi River delta. Some migratory birds like the yellow-throated warbler, prothonotary warbler and the northern parula have had their populations plummet by nearly 50% in the past two decades, Johnson said. These birds rely on caterpillars who are dependent on water tupelo and bald cypress foliage. When there are fewer healthy leaves for the caterpillars to gorge on, there's less food for the birds. 'That's driving a really rapid decline in these bird populations that depend on this one forest,' Johnson said. 'The whole system has shifted.' Scientists say they expect to start seeing an increase in canopy cover and new tree growth within a few years of the project's anticipated completion in 2028. Unlike the state's controversial $3 billion river diversion project intended to combat coastal land loss, the Maurepas project has received widespread support from elected officials and local communities. The Maurepas project is primarily funded by the Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council, a multi-state and federal program managing settlement funds from the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill that devastated the Gulf Coast. The Maurepas project benefits from an innovative partnership with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which is building an adjacent 30-kilometer levee system to protect several southeast Louisiana parishes. The Corps will count 36 square kilometers of Maurepas Swamp restoration towards offsetting environmental damage caused by the new levee construction, meaning it can direct additional federal funds toward the diversion program. 'For every dollar the state can save here, they have more to invest' in other coastal restoration projects, said John Ettinger, director of policy and environmental compliance with Gulf Coast Ecosystem Restoration Council. And conservationists say the Maurepas reintroduction project highlights the importance of coastal protection and wetlands restoration going hand in hand in a hurricane-prone region. 'You're going to have a healthier ecosystem on the outside of that levee, which means you're going to have a better buffer for storm surge and it's going to allow the levees to be more effective,' said Amanda Moore, National Wildlife Federation's Gulf Program senior director. 'This is how we need to be thinking at large about what's possible and how we can how we can do more effective conservation by working with nature.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/to-save-a-dying-swamp-louisiana-aims-to-restore-the-mississippi-river-s-natural-flow/7886560.html	2024-12-03T19:53:25-08:00	
Demonstrators converge on Georgia's parliament, protest EU bid delay	TBILISI, Georgia — Thousands of demonstrators in the Georgian capital converged on parliament again on Tuesday, venting outrage against the governing party's decision to suspend negotiations on joining the European Union. Like on five previous nights, riot police used water cannons and tear gas to push back the protesters, who threw fireworks at police officers and built barricades on the Georgian capital's central boulevard. Nearly 300 protesters have been detained, and 26 people, including three police officers, have been hospitalized with injuries. 'The more force they use, the angrier people become, because everyone they arrest has relatives, and everyone understands that this is injustice,' said Tamar Kordzaia, a member of Unity National Movement opposition group. Kordzaia voiced confidence that the protesters will achieve their goal of calling new elections and joining the EU, noting that police on Monday 'looked very tired. I am sure we need to withstand a little longer.' The ruling Georgian Dream party retained control of parliament in the disputed Oct. 26 parliamentary election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia's EU aspirations. The opposition and the pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with neighboring Russia's help and boycotted parliament sessions. Mass opposition protests sparked by the vote gained new momentum after the governing party's decision on Thursday to put the EU accession talks on hold. 'We are fighting for our democracy, to protect human rights, human dignity,' said Rusudan Chanturia, who attended Tuesday's protest. Another demonstrator, David Jandieri, said the daily protests must continue until the demonstrators achieve their goal. 'In fact, we do not have another choice,' he said. Georgia's Interior Ministry said Tuesday that 293 protesters were detained on administrative charges and five arrested on criminal charges. Georgian President Salome Zourabichvili has refused to recognize the official election results and contested them in the Constitutional Court, which rejected her appeal on Tuesday. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to lead the opposition demand for a new parliamentary election. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc's recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support in June after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law that was widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. It requires organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government. The Georgian government's announcement of the EU accession talks' suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October's election as neither free nor fair. On Monday, the EU reiterated its 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of Georgian Dream declared Tuesday that the government is willing to open EU accession talks if the bloc ends its 'blackmail.' 'I want to remind European bureaucrats and politicians, including those who are artificially hindering our country's European integration, to bring negotiations to the table, and we will sign immediately, on the same day, at that very moment,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/demonstrators-converge-on-georgia-s-parliament-protest-eu-bid-delay/7886557.html	2024-12-03T19:46:50-08:00	
Taiwan says China's threats over president's US visit are counterproductive	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan's top China policymaker on Wednesday said Chinese military threats would only drive the two sides further apart, as state media in the island's giant neighbor warned of a strong response to a U.S. visit by Taiwan's president. China, which claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory, has expressed anger at President Lai Ching-te's weekend trip to Hawaii on his way to three countries in the Pacific that maintain formal diplomatic ties with Taipei. Lai, who is also due to spend one night in the U.S. territory of Guam on Wednesday, is making what are formally only stopovers. However, he spent two days in Hawaii where he met the governor, gave speeches and visited a World War II memorial. Security sources have told Reuters that China could stage new war games around Taiwan as early as this weekend in response to the trip. Speaking to reporters in Taipei, Mainland Affairs Council minister Chiu Chui-cheng said Lai's trip to consolidate friendship with other countries was supported by the Taiwanese public. 'But the Chinese communists threaten Taiwan with military hegemony, which I think is something our citizens do not agree with,' he said. 'This will only cause cross-strait relations to drift further and further away, and which will not be helpful to ties in the future.' The international community should take China's military drills and threats seriously, he added. Lai and his government reject Beijing's sovereignty claims and say they have a right to engage with the rest of the world. China calls Lai a 'separatist' and has staged two rounds of war games around Taiwan since he took office in May. China's military also operates around Taiwan on a daily basis. In a commentary on its website on Wednesday, Chinese state television said the real purpose of Lai's transits was to 'rely on the United States to seek independence' which shows he is the real destroyer of peace in the Taiwan Strait. 'Lai is well aware that his 'transit' in the United States is bound to meet with resolute opposition and strong countermeasures from the mainland side, which will only aggravate the tense situation in the Taiwan Strait,' it said. Taiwan presidents customarily make transit stops in the United States on the way to and from far flung allies in the Pacific, Latin America and the Caribbean in what the United States says is a routine practice done for safety and convenience reasons. Chinese state television said that was merely an excuse for Taiwan to 'legitimize' the trip. 'It is pushing Taiwan step by step into an even more dangerous situation,' it added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-china-s-threats-over-president-s-us-visit-are-counterproductive/7886556.html	2024-12-03T19:40:33-08:00	
Philippine Coast Guard says Chinese actions ‘aggressive’ near Scarborough Shoal	MANILA, Philippines — The Philippine coast guard said Chinese navy and coast guard vessels had taken 'aggressive actions' against a routine patrol by it and the fisheries bureau near the contested Scarborough Shoal in the South China Sea on Wednesday. A Chinese coast guard fired a water cannon at a PCG vessel 'aiming directly at the vessel's navigational antennas,' Jay Tarriela, PCG spokesperson for the South China Sea, said in a statement. Philippine vessels also faced 'blocking, shadowing, and dangerous maneuvers' from Chinese navy and coast guard ships, he added. Tensions between China and the Philippines over the South China Sea have escalated throughout the year, particularly over the Scarborough Shoal, a prime fishing patch. China claims nearly the entire South China Sea, a vital waterway for more than $3 trillion of annual ship-borne commerce, parts of which are also claimed by Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, and Vietnam.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-coast-guard-says-chinese-actions-aggressive-near-scarborough-shoal/7886555.html	2024-12-03T19:37:11-08:00	
Yoon’s martial law declaration sparks chaos in South Korea	South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol briefly imposed martial law Tuesday, an unanticipated move that rattled the nation and underscored political turmoil in the U.S. ally.

Survey: 4 months after uprising, most Bangladeshis want new elections	WASHINGTON — Four months after a student uprising deposed Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, most Bangladeshis want new elections within a year, despite strong support for the interim government's reform agenda, according to a new survey. The survey, sponsored by Voice of America and conducted by a Bangladeshi research firm in late October, found that while 65.9% of respondents back ongoing government reforms, more than 61.1% want new polls held within 12 months. The findings suggest that many Bangladeshis desire reforms and elections equally — elections to restore democracy after 15 years of Hasina's increasingly authoritarian rule and reforms to strengthen institutions weakened under her watch. 'I think that people definitely want elections, and at the same time, people definitely want reforms,' said Zillur Rahman, a journalist and political commentator based in the capital, Dhaka. 'This government would do well to focus only on the reforms related to elections.' The poll, based on a random sample of 1,000 respondents, is one of the largest measures of public opinion in Bangladesh since Hasina was removed from power in August. Conducted by Org-Quest Research Limited, it has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. The survey was conducted when the interim government began rolling out an ambitious set of reforms that officials say could take years to implement. These reforms aim to overhaul key state institutions, including the elections commission, police and judiciary, and the constitution itself, to prevent a return to what proponents call Hasina's authoritarianism. The poll found strong support for institutional reform. An overwhelming majority of respondents (59.9%) said they wanted the government to complete 'all necessary reforms' before holding elections, while 31.9% said it should focus only on election-related reforms. Among those supporting comprehensive reforms before elections, support for reforming the election commission and several other key sectors ran upward of 90%. But even as they supported reforms, Bangladeshis appeared increasingly impatient for new elections. Support for early elections spanned all demographics, with 60.4% of city dwellers and 61.4% of rural residents saying they wanted elections within one year. There were 18.7% of respondents willing to wait between two and three years for new elections to allow time for reforms, while another 8.6% were open to waiting longer than a year but not more than 18 months. In a country where results of three recent elections — in 2014, 2018 and 2024 — were questioned, the strong desire for fresh elections is not surprising, said Nusrat Chowdhury, an anthropology professor at Amherst College. 'When people think about democracy, one of the first things they think about is elections,' Chowdhury, a native of Bangladesh, said in an interview with VOA. 'So, I think it's kind of almost a gut response to say, 'Yes, we want elections within the next year because people want stability.'' For the interim government, balancing calls for early elections and the need for long-term reforms is a delicate act. Since the interim government's installation in August, various political parties, including the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), the main opposition to Hasina's Awami League party, have demanded a road map for parliamentary elections within a 'reasonable time.' The government, however, has not committed to a timeline. In a September interview, army chief General Waker-uz-Zaman voiced support for holding elections within 18 months. Yet, interim government officials, including leader Muhammad Yunus, have indicated elections would occur only after at least some reforms are implemented. In a recent interview with Al Jazeera, Yunus said his government has a mandate to carry out reforms before holding elections. 'The highlight of the whole government was reform, because the whole student movement was to create a New Bangladesh,' he said. 'New Bangladesh is not going to come through just [by] holding a new election. Holding an election is a repetition of the old ways of doing things.' Reform advocates appear willing to give him the benefit of the doubt. Student leaders have warned that holding elections before completing the reform program will bring back 'fascism,' a reference to Hasina's rule. Four months in, the interim government remains popular. Some 58.4% of respondents said it was governing Bangladesh better than Hasina's administration, while 20.4% said it was doing worse. Some 63.2% said the government was doing a better job maintaining law and order, and 64.1% believed it was doing a better job providing security for ethnic and religious minority groups, according to the survey. But with inflation stubbornly high, 44.7% said the government was doing a worse job reining in the cost of essential goods, with 23.8% saying it was doing a better job. And 30.8% said it was performing the same as the previous government. As revealing as the survey might be, Chowdhury noted that Bangladesh is a deeply divided country, with most people supporting either the BNP or Hasina's Awami League. With Awami League supporters keeping a low profile, those divisions may not be captured in public opinion surveys, she said. 'There are people who are [Awami League] loyalists. There are people who are critical of the interim government only because it came at the cost of the fall of the regime. I think when we see survey data, we also need to keep that in mind,' Chowdhury said.

Biden pardon renews debate over presidential clemency	U.S. President Joe Biden pardoned his son Hunter Biden this week, ending a political saga that had divided American lawmakers for years.

Taiwan's President Lai visits Pacific ally Tuvalu	Taiwan President Lai Ching-te arrived in Tuvalu on Wednesday, a Tuvalu official said, reinforcing ties with the remote Pacific Island nation on the front line of climate change. 'Taiwan's president and his delegation arrived this morning in Tuvalu,' a Tuvalu government official told Reuters. Lai flew in on a private jet from the Marshall Islands and will stay in Tuvalu for the day before leaving for Guam, as part of a Pacific tour of allies. Tuvalu Prime Minister Feleti Teo reaffirmed ties with Taiwan after he was elected in February and traveled to Taipei to meet with Lai for Taiwan's National Day celebrations in October. With a population of 11,000 scattered across nine low-lying atolls, and predictions that half of its main town will be submerged by rising tides by 2050, Tuvalu is reliant on donor partners including Taiwan to fortify its coast. It will be connected to international telecommunications by a subsea cable for the first time in a joint project backed by Taiwan, Australia, the United States and Japan. Tuvalu's national election was closely watched by China, amid a tussle for influence in the Pacific region, and afterward a leadership candidate said Taiwan ties would be reviewed. China, which views Taiwan as its own territory and opposes any foreign interactions or visits by the island's leaders, has been stepping up military pressure against Taiwan, including two rounds of war games this year. Lai will stop over in Guam for one night and then go to Palau.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-president-lai-visits-pacific-ally-tuvalu/7886519.html	2024-12-03T17:48:45-08:00	
UN: Tens of thousands of Syrians displaced in latest fighting	United Nations — The United Nations said Tuesday that tens of thousands of Syrians have been displaced in the recent fighting between rebels and the government in northwest Syria as the rebels rapidly make territorial gains. 'While thousands have arrived in the central and southern regions of the country, many are trapped at front lines, unable to seek safety in other areas in the country,' Adam Abdelmoula, U.N. resident and humanitarian coordinator in Syria, told reporters in a briefing call from Damascus. He said intense fighting, shelling and airstrikes have displaced residents from the cities of Idlib, Aleppo and Hama. There have been reports of civilian casualties, but Abdelmoula said the extent is still unclear. North of Aleppo in Tel Rifaat, an estimated 125,000 people are in the process of moving east, and as many as a third of that number have arrived. 'The latest information received yesterday night, more than 5,000 families, amounting to anywhere between 30,000 to 40,000 individuals, have moved and have entered the northeastern region,' Ramanathan Balakrishnan, U.N. regional humanitarian coordinator for the Syria crisis, told reporters from Amman, Jordan, on the same briefing call. On November 27, multiple rebel groups aligned under the leadership of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, launched their biggest challenge in years to the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. They swept into Aleppo, which the government had held since 2016, stunning the Syrian army and capturing the airport, a military academy and much of the city. They also took towns and villages in Idlib governorate, and on Tuesday were approaching the city of Hama. HTS, which was formerly affiliated with al-Qaida, is a U.N. Security Council-designated terrorist group. It is also listed by the United States, Britain and the European Union as a terrorist group. 'This is the most significant escalation of hostilities witnessed in Syria since 2019,' Abdelmoula said. UN urges de-escalation 'Now in the space of a week, we have seen the de-escalation lines agreed in 2020 and earlier entirely unravel,' said U.N. Syria envoy Geir Pedersen. 'Further shifts in the northeast threaten to unravel other ceasefire arrangements, too, in place since 2019.' Pedersen told an emergency meeting Tuesday of the U.N. Security Council that the Syrian parties and key international stakeholders need to be 'seriously engaged in meaningful and substantive negotiations' to stop the fighting. 'If we do not see de-escalation and a rapid move to a serious political process involving the Syrian parties and the key international players, then I fear we will see a deepening of the crisis,' Pedersen said by video from Geneva. 'Syria will be in grave danger of further division, deterioration and destruction.' Russia entered the war on the side of the Assad regime in 2015 and has been carrying out airstrikes against rebel positions in recent days in support of the Syrian army. 'From the beginning of the operation, approximately 400 terrorists have been liquidated; more than 600 were wounded,' Russia’s U.N. Ambassador Vassily Nebenzia said of their strikes. Syria’s ambassador demanded that the council condemn what he said is a terrorist attack against his country. Both the Russian and Syrian envoys accused the United States of supporting terrorist groups in Syria. 'The representative from the Russian Federation is in no position to lecture us on this issue, particularly when it props up regimes that sponsor terrorism around the world,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood shot back in response to the allegations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7886492.html	2024-12-03T16:59:58-08:00	
US conducts 'self-defense' strike in Syria	PENTAGON — The Pentagon says the U.S. military carried out a strike in 'self-defense' in eastern Syria on Tuesday, destroying several weapons systems. Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder told reporters that the military struck three truck-mounted multiple rocket launchers, a T-64 tank and mortars that presented a 'clear and imminent threat to U.S. and coalition forces' in the vicinity of Military Support Site Euphrates. 'The self-defense strike occurred after the mobile multiple rocket launchers fired rockets in the vicinity of MSS Euphrates and mortars were fired toward U.S. forces,' he said, adding that the strike was 'not linked to any broader activities in northwest Syria by other groups.' Ryder said the U.S. was 'still assessing' who was operating the weapons that were struck on Tuesday. The U.S. was aware of Syrian military forces that operate in the area and Iranian-backed militia groups in the area that have conducted attacks on MSS Euphrates in the past, according to Ryder, but could not confirm who was responsible for Tuesday's attack. U.S. forces are in Syria to help Syrian Democratic Forces prevent the Islamic State group from resurging. Last week, U.S. Central Command forces used A-10 fighter aircraft to hit a target threatening U.S. and coalition forces at MSS Euphrates. 'Individuals were observed preparing a rocket rail,' Ryder told reporters. David Adesnik, vice president of research at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, said the U.S. should not consider pulling out its forces from Syria in response to increased fighting across the country, especially if it wants to keep the pressure on Islamic State. He said the terror group has already been 'substantially more effective' in areas under the control of Syrian President Bashar Assad. 'We are the ones sort of keeping the cork in the bottle. ISIS would have a lot more room for maneuver. ... It doesn't get much coverage, but they are inflicting pain on Assad's troops,' Adesnik said. ISIS is another name for the Islamic State group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-conducts-self-defense-strike-in-syria/7886481.html	2024-12-03T16:58:55-08:00	
Trump's lawyers urge judge to toss hush money criminal conviction	New York — President-elect Donald Trump's lawyers formally asked a judge Monday to throw out his hush money criminal conviction, arguing that continuing the case would present unconstitutional 'disruptions to the institution of the Presidency.' In a filing made public Tuesday, Trump's lawyers told Manhattan Judge Juan M. Merchan that anything short of immediate dismissal would undermine the transition of power, as well as the 'overwhelming national mandate' granted to Trump by voters last month. They also cited President Joe Biden's recent pardon of his son, Hunter Biden, who had been convicted of tax and gun charges. 'President Biden asserted that his son was 'selectively, and unfairly, prosecuted,' and 'treated differently,'' Trump's legal team wrote. Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, they claimed, had engaged in the type of political theater 'that President Biden condemned.' Prosecutors will have until Dec. 9 to respond. They have said they will fight any efforts to dismiss the case but have indicated a willingness to delay the sentencing until after Trump's second term ends in 2029. In their filing Monday, Trump's attorneys dismissed the idea of holding off sentencing until Trump is out of office as a 'ridiculous suggestion.' Following Trump's election victory last month, Merchan halted proceedings and indefinitely postponed his sentencing, previously scheduled for late November, to allow the defense and prosecution to weigh in on the future of the case. He also delayed a decision on Trump's prior bid to dismiss the case on immunity grounds. Trump has been fighting for months to reverse his conviction on 34 counts of falsifying business records to conceal a $130,000 payment to porn actor Stormy Daniels to suppress her claim that they had sex a decade earlier. He says they did not and denies any wrongdoing. The defense filing was signed by Trump lawyers Todd Blanche and Emil Bove, who represented Trump during the trial and have since been selected by the president-elect to fill senior roles at the Justice Department. Taking a swipe at Bragg and New York City, as Trump often did throughout the trial, the filing argues that dismissal would also benefit the public by giving him and 'the numerous prosecutors assigned to this case a renewed opportunity to put an end to deteriorating conditions in the City and to protect its residents from violent crime.' Clearing Trump, the lawyers added, would also allow him to 'to devote all of his energy to protecting the Nation.' Merchan hasn't yet set a timetable for a decision. He could decide to uphold the verdict and proceed to sentencing, delay the case until Trump leaves office, wait until a federal appeals court rules on Trump's parallel effort to get the case moved out of state court or choose some other option. An outright dismissal of the New York case would further lift a legal cloud that at one point carried the prospect of derailing Trump's political future. Last week, special counsel Jack Smith told courts that he was withdrawing both federal cases against Trump — one charging him with hoarding classified documents at his Florida estate, the other with scheming to overturn the 2020 presidential election he lost — citing longstanding Justice Department policy that shields a president from indictment while in office. The hush money case was the only one of Trump's four criminal indictments to go to trial, resulting in a historic verdict that made him the first former president to be convicted of a crime. If the verdict stands and the case proceeds to sentencing, Trump's punishments would range from a fine to probation to up to four years in prison — but it's unlikely he'd spend any time behind bars for a first-time conviction involving charges in the lowest tier of felonies. Because it is a state case, Trump would not be able to pardon himself once he returns to office.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7886485.html	2024-12-03T16:46:23-08:00	
French no-confidence vote could topple prime minister's government	The government of France faces a no-confidence vote Wednesday, a move that could topple the government of Prime Minister Michel Barnier. Analysts predict French lawmakers will likely vote in favor of a no-confidence motion. Barnier warned the politicians that voting his government down 'would make everything more difficult for France.' The no-confidence vote follows a seldom-used constitutional move the prime minister invoked Monday when he pushed through the 2025 budget without parliamentary approval, something Barnier said he did to maintain 'stability' amid France's deep political divisions. Barnier, who has been prime minister for just three months, is seeking to bring France's gigantic budget deficit under control. The government can pass legislation without parliamentary approval under Article 49.3 of France's constitution. That move, however, opens up the option of no-confidence motions. The prime minister's action prompted Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally and the leftist New Popular Front to both respond with filings for no-confidence motions. The left and the far-right together hold enough votes to overturn the prime minister's government, according to Reuters, which reports that Le Pen has confirmed that her party would support a left-wing alliance's no-confidence motion. A far-right motion would not receive enough votes from lawmakers. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau said the lawmakers voting in favor of the no-confidence vote were playing Russian roulette with France's future. French President Emmanuel Macron said he could 'not believe' the lawmakers had teamed up for the no confidence motion against the government and accused Le Pen of 'unbearable cynicism.' 'We must not scare people with these things. We have a strong economy,' the president said. Macron said he is holding on to the hope that the politicians will not censure the French government. 'It doesn't make sense,' he told reporters during a trip to Saudi Arabia. He compared the situation to 'political fiction.' There have also been calls for Macron's resignation, but the president said he has no intention of resigning before his term ends in 2027. 'It so happens that if I am before you, it is because I was elected twice by the French people,' he said. 'I am extremely proud of this, and I will honor this trust with all the energy that is mine until the last second to be useful to the country.' Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-no-confidence-vote-could-topple-prime-minister-s-government/7886458.html	2024-12-03T16:33:05-08:00	
Chinese hackers still lurk in US telecommunications systems	WASHINGTON — Chinese hackers blamed for compromising U.S. telecommunications infrastructure and spying on American presidential campaigns and American officials are still entrenched in those systems, according to senior U.S. officials who warn it could be years before the hackers are kicked out. The U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and the FBI on Tuesday urged U.S. telecommunication companies and their customers to take additional precautions, saying the breach might go deeper than first thought. 'We cannot say with certainty that the adversary has been evicted because we still don't know the scope of what they're doing,' Jeff Greene, CISA's executive assistant director for cybersecurity, said during a briefing with reporters. 'We cannot with confidence say that we know everything, nor would our partners,' Greene said. 'We're still trying to understand.' A senior FBI official who also spoke with reporters was equally cautious. 'Understanding the scope of the adversary activity through our investigations, in a situation of this magnitude, is measured in years,' the official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss details of the breach investigation. The Chinese-linked hackers have been coy, adjusting their behavior as more information about their activities becomes public. 'As more comes to light they change their TTPs [tactics, techniques and procedures] and their approach,' the official warned. 'They may go dormant for a while to lower their profile.' Word of the breach emerged in October, when the Chinese-linked cyber gang known as Salt Typhoon was linked to efforts to intercept communications for the presidential campaigns of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and his Democratic challenger, Vice President Kamala Harris. Less than a month later, CISA and the FBI warned that the Chinese efforts to spy on the Trump and Harris campaigns were just the start of 'a broad and significant cyber espionage campaign' that penetrated multiple U.S. telecommunication companies. China has repeatedly denied the U.S. allegations, accusing Washington of a smear campaign aimed at undermining Beijing. 'For quite some time, the US side has patched up all sorts of disinformation about threats of 'Chinese hackers' to serve its own geopolitical purposes,' Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA in an email Tuesday regarding the latest allegations. 'China firmly opposes and combats all kinds of cyber attacks,' Liu said. 'The US needs to stop its own cyberattacks against other countries and refrain from using cyber security to smear and slander China.' But U.S. officials have repeatedly pushed back against Chinese denials, and now say the Chinese breach goes even further than initially thought, impacting telecommunication companies around the world, and that it appears to be part of a larger Chinese government effort to gather information about adversaries worldwide. 'Certainly, the way they went about it was very, very specific,' the senior FBI official said, noting the focus on telecommunications infrastructure and internet service providers. 'But it fits into the cyber espionage bucket to really inform global goals for the Chinese.' Neither CISA nor the FBI would say how many telecommunication companies or how many countries have been impacted. But the agencies said the Chinese efforts in the U.S. fall into three categories: individual communications, customer call records and U.S. law enforcement requests pursuant to court orders. The focus on individual communications appears to be on intercepting audio of phone calls and the content of text messages for a select number of high-profile U.S. government officials, such as individuals with the Trump and Harris campaigns. The mass collection of customer call records appears to be more random. 'Essentially, they stole data about where, when and whom individuals were communicating with,' said the senior FBI official. 'We don't believe that those were specifically targeted,' the official added. 'We essentially think that they were essentially swept up by the adversary.' The officials said the third category of intercepted information, related to law enforcement requests and court orders, also appears to have been targeted somewhat by chance. Forensic analysis in two of the instances in which the Chinese hackers accessed law enforcement information 'has indicated that the actors were on other parts of their network conducting reconnaissance before pivoting to the [law enforcement portal] and surrounding devices,' the FBI official said. Just how far the Chinese hackers got, though, is not clear. Officials said the hacked portal does include some court orders that relate to foreign intelligence collected under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act but declined to say whether any of that information was taken by the China-linked hackers. 'We're not prepared to answer that question today,' the senior FBI official said. For now, the FBI and CISA are urging telecommunications companies to harden their defenses, issuing an advisory with cyber agencies in Canada, Australia and New Zealand on steps they can take to reduce the threat. They also urged companies that think they may have been victimized to come forward. 'The companies that have worked closest with us are the furthest along and kicking the actors off their networks,' the senior FBI official said. The FBI and CISA are likewise urging consumers to be more vigilant about security, whether that means keeping mobile phones and other devices current with security updates, or by using encrypted platforms for messaging and other communications. 'We are not seeing any novel techniques,' said CISA's Greene, adding that the Chinese-linked hackers seem to have simply exploited known vulnerabilities in the telecommunications infrastructure environment. 'Encryption is your friend, whether it is on text messaging or if you have the capacity to use encrypted voice communications,' Greene said. 'Even if the adversary is able to intercept the data, if it is encrypted, it will make it impossible, if not really hard for them, to detect it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-hackers-still-lurk-in-us-telecommunications-systems/7886221.html	2024-12-03T16:31:17-08:00	
Trump's choice to run DEA withdraws from consideration	NEW YORK — Chad Chronister, President-elect Donald Trump's choice to run the Drug Enforcement Administration, said Tuesday he was withdrawing his name from consideration. Chronister is the second person selected by the president-elect to bow out quickly after being nominated for a position. Chronister, the top law enforcement officer in Hillsborough County, Florida, said in a post on X that he was backing away from the opportunity, which he called 'the honor of a lifetime.' 'Over the past several days, as the gravity of this very important responsibility set in, I've concluded that I must respectfully withdraw from consideration,' Chronister wrote. He did not elaborate, and Trump's transition team did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment. Trump's pick of Chronister for the post drew backlash from conservatives, including for past comments he made that his sheriff's office was not focused on enforcing federal immigration laws. Chronister follows former Republican congressman Matt Gaetz, Trump's first choice to serve as attorney general, in withdrawing his name for a post in the administration. Gaetz withdrew following scrutiny over a federal sex trafficking investigation that cast doubt on his ability to be confirmed as the nation's chief federal law enforcement officer. The DEA post requires Senate confirmation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-choice-to-run-dea-withdraws-from-consideration-/7886224.html	2024-12-03T15:57:43-08:00	
Risk of North Korea's miscalculation rises after South's martial law declaration	WASHINGTON — U.S. analysts are warning against a possible provocation by Pyongyang after a short-lived declaration of martial law on Tuesday threw South Korea into political turmoil. 'There's potential for miscalculation on North Korea's part,' said Sydney Seiler, who until last year was the national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, in a phone interview with VOA Korean. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol imposed emergency martial law on his unsuspecting country in a televised address Tuesday evening, saying it was aimed at 'eradicating pro-North Korean forces and to protect the constitutional order of freedom.' Surprising move Under the decree, all political activities, including rallies and demonstrations, were prohibited, while all media became subject to the control of the martial law command. Soon after Yoon's declaration, a majority of South Korean lawmakers voted to demand the lifting of martial law. Yoon, who was legally obligated to comply with the vote, did so less than six hours after his original declaration. Seiler said that could leave Yoon looking weak to the North Koreans, who might decide this is 'a great time to take advantage of this weakness to deal another blow to him through some type of provocation.' Seiler added that one of Kim Jong Un's primary goals is to undermine the U.S.-South Korea relationship and that Kim 'may see President [Yoon]'s actions as straining that relationship.' David Maxwell, vice president of the Center for Asia Pacific Strategy, agreed that North Korean leader Kim Jong Un may try to exploit the situation. 'If Yoon is correct and there are North Korean sympathizers in South Korea, we can expect them to incite violence,' Maxwell told VOA Korean via email. Maxwell worried that this could lead South Korean law enforcement agencies to 'inappropriately use force that could cause escalation.' Risk of miscalculation Robert Rapson, who served as charge d'affaires and deputy chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy in Seoul from 2018 to 2021, told VOA Korean via email Tuesday that the U.S. should deliver a 'stern warning' to adversaries such as North Korea against trying to take advantage of the situation. Pyongyang should be reminded that 'our ironclad alliance and commitment to defend remains fully in effect,' he said. The United States reaffirmed it will continue to stand by South Korea, a major ally in the Indo-Pacific region, a few hours after Yoon's declaration. A National Security Council spokesperson told VOA that the Biden administration is 'in contact with the [South Korean] government and is monitoring the situation closely as we work to learn more.' The spokesperson added that the U.S. was not notified in advance of Yoon's plans. 'We are seriously concerned by the developments we are seeing on the ground in the ROK,' the spokesperson said. ROK is an abbreviation for Republic of Korea, the official name of South Korea. Kurt Campbell, deputy secretary of state, told reporters at a Washington event previewing Japan's 2025 Osaka Expo: 'I do want to underscore that our alliance with the ROK is ironclad, and we stand by Korea in their time of uncertainty.' 'We're watching the recent developments in the ROK with grave concern,' Campbell said. 'We're seeking to engage our ROK counterparts at every level both here and in Seoul.' Campbell stressed that the U.S. has 'every hope and expectation that any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.' Yoon has long been suffering from low approval ratings. Last week, his approval slid to 25% after rising for three consecutive weeks, according to a survey. Meanwhile, the ruling party and the opposition party have been in deadlock for weeks over the government budget bill for 2025. As of 4:22 a.m. Tuesday, South Korea's Joint Chiefs of Staff said, 'so far, there was no abnormal move detected from North Korea,' stressing that Seoul's military readiness against North Korea is intact.

UNESCO says education about climate change is essential in southern Africa	PRETORIA, SOUTH AFRICA — The United Nations environmental agency UNESCO is calling for more studies and closer working relations between journalists and scientists to ensure the effects of climate change are understood and can be mitigated, especially in poorer African countries, which more acutely feel the pinch of extreme weather events. On Tuesday, scientists gathered in Pretoria, South Africa, to discuss climate change with journalists from the Southern Africa Development Community region. Meeting under the theme 'Building Science Communication Capacity in the SADC Region,' the journalists were asked to report more often on climate change to ensure people are prepared before disasters such as floods and droughts. In an interview with VOA, Martiale Zebaze-Kana, head of the science unit of UNESCO in southern Africa, said more awareness of climate change and studies into how communities can adapt to it are crucial. 'I think we should focus essentially on really building in the capacity around the whole climate-related issues,' said Zebaze-Kana. 'And for us, in terms of mitigation also.' Zebaze-Kana also said it is important to look at what's happening in a region, to build resilience and to watch for early warning signs across the SADC region. After being hit by El Nino-induced drought, Southern Africa is experiencing its worst food insecurity in years. Millions of people across several countries are dependent on food handouts from aid organizations. Sosten Chiotha, the director of a nongovernmental organization called Leadership for Environment and Development Southern and Eastern Africa, said he wants developing countries to do more climate adaptation studies because developing countries experience the worst effects of global warming. 'Climate change amplifies existing vulnerabilities,' said Chiotha. 'So, you have poor that are poor, it means their infrastructure is not going to stand storms of speeds. In Malawi, winds of 70 to 80 kilometers were strong enough to blow off houses. But in places where they receive tornadoes frequently — they have been receiving them for a long time — the buildings will withstand that kind of [speed]. So, it’s a question of changing the way we do things, constructing our roads, make sure we have [proper] drainage. Also, people where they are staying — should not stay in flood-prone areas. So, all these things are what need to be done.' Charles Chikunda, UNESCO’s officer for climate education, said it’s also important that children learn how to deal with a changing environment. 'In fact, we should start to teach everything that we went from an early age,' said Chikunda. 'Let's not wait for children to go to university. We want them to start thinking about their issues at an early age, how to solve them.' Chikunda added that some countries in the SADC region, such as Lesotho and Zimbabwe, have already started infusing climate change into their curriculum.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unesco-says-education-about-climate-change-is-essential-in-southern-africa/7886128.html	2024-12-03T15:30:37-08:00

Trump's tariffs: Mapping the economic ripple effects	President-elect Donald Trump's proposed tariffs are poised to significantly impact countries with substantial trade volumes with the United States. The primary nations affected include China, Mexico and Canada, which are among the largest U.S. trading partners. Trump has said that tariffs can help his administration pay for proposed tax cuts. But these tariffs are expected to disrupt trade flows, potentially leading to increased consumer prices in the U.S. and prompting retaliatory measures from the affected countries. Industries such as automotive, agriculture and technology may experience significant impacts due to their reliance on imports and exports with these nations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-tariffs-mapping-the-economic-ripple-effects/7886154.html	2024-12-03T14:31:32-08:00	
China tells World Court that UN treaties should cover states' climate obligations	THE HAGUE — China told the top U.N. court on Tuesday that existing U.N. treaties should provide the basis for its advisory opinion on states' legal obligations to fight global warming and address the consequences of their historic contributions to it. The U.N. General Assembly, after a campaign spearheaded by small island states, asked the International Court of Justice (ICJ) to issue an opinion on countries' legal responsibility for the negative impact of climate change. One of those states, Vanuatu on Monday asked the court to recognize the harm climate change had caused and order reparations for its consequences. China, one of the world's top two emitters of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming together with the U.S., said it understood the 'enormous difficulties' faced by developing countries such as the small island states, which are vulnerable especially to rising sea levels and increasingly violent storms. But Ma Xinmin, a legal adviser in China's Foreign Ministry, told the court that the existing treaties produced by U.N.-backed climate change negotiations, which include many nonbinding provisions, should be the benchmark for determining states' obligations. 'China hopes that the court will uphold the U.N. climate change negotiations mechanism as the primary channel for global climate governance,' Ma said. While advisory opinions from the ICJ, often called the World Court, are not binding, they are legally and politically significant. Experts say its eventual opinion on climate change will probably be cited in climate change-driven lawsuits in courts from Europe to Latin America and beyond. More than 100 states and organizations will give their views in the coming weeks. The United States is due to address the court on Wednesday. The court's opinion is expected to be delivered in 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-tells-world-court-that-un-treaties-should-cover-states-climate-obligations/7886106.html	2024-12-03T13:18:53-08:00

Syrian rebels advance toward Hama city, pressuring Assad, his allies	Syrian rebels advancing against government forces pushed close on Tuesday to the major city of Hama, rebels and a war monitor said, after their sudden capture of Aleppo last week rocked President Bashar al-Assad. Rebels and the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said insurgents had captured villages including Maar Shahur a few miles north of the city. Syrian state media said reinforcements were arriving in the area. An attack on Hama would ramp up pressure on Assad, whose Russian and Iranian allies have scrambled to support him against a reviving rebellion. The city has remained in government hands since civil war erupted in 2011. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araqchi said in an Arabic-language interview that Tehran would consider sending troops to Syria if Damascus asked, and Russian President Vladimir Putin urged an end to 'terrorist aggression' in Syria, RIA reported. Iraq Prime Minister Shia al-Sudani said Baghdad would not be 'a mere spectator' in Syria and blamed Israeli military strikes on the Syrian government for the rebel advance, his office said. Compounding Assad's problems, fighters from a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition battled government forces in the northeast, both sides said, opening a new front along a vital supply route. Last week's rebel seizure of Aleppo marked the biggest offensive for years. The front lines of the conflict have been frozen since 2020 after Assad clawed back most of the country from rebels, thanks to help from Russian air power and military help from Iran and its network of regional Shiite militia groups. Now, however, Russia has been concentrating on the war in Ukraine, while Israeli strikes over the past three months have decimated the leadership of Hezbollah, the strongest Iran-backed force fighting in Syria. On Monday, hundreds of Iran-backed Iraqi militia fighters entered Syria to back up Syrian government forces, Iraqi and Syrian sources said, but Hezbollah does not plan to send forces now. A rebel source said Iran-backed militia fighters were among the forces they were battling outside Hama. In recent days, Russian and Syrian government warplanes have intensified airstrikes against rebels, both sides have said. Rescue workers have reported deadly strikes on hospitals in Aleppo and Idlib. Any sustained escalation in Syria risks further destabilizing a region alight from wars in Gaza and Lebanon, where a truce between Israel and the Hezbollah militant group took effect last week. Groups fight for control The retreat by Assad's forces over the past several days has led to jockeying for control among other groups that control pockets in the northwest, north and east. The Syrian Democratic Forces, an umbrella group that controls territory in Syria's east with U.S. support, said early on Tuesday that its Deir al-Zor Military Council had 'become responsible for protecting' seven villages previously held by the Syrian army. The Deir al-Zor Military Council comprises local Arab fighters under the SDF, an alliance mainly led by a Kurdish militia, the YPG. Syrian state media reported that the army and allied forces were repelling an SDF assault on the villages, the only Syrian government presence along the east bank of the Euphrates River, an area otherwise mostly held by the SDF. A Syrian military officer said the SDF push was aimed at exploiting government forces' weakness after the rebel advance, and said the army and allied Iran-backed militia groups were sending reinforcements. Airstrikes also targeted Iran-backed militia groups supporting Syrian government forces in the strategically vital region, a security source in eastern Syria and a Syrian army source said. The U.S. military, which has a small number of troops based at a gas field in the area, carried out at least one strike in self-defense overnight, a U.S. official said, adding it was not related to the ongoing rebel advances. Many fighters on front The battlefield is crowded in northern Syria, with the U.S., Russia, Iran and Turkey all involved in the renewed fighting, underscoring the messy global politics at play. The SDF was the main Western-backed ground force in eastern Syria fighting Islamic State, which ran a mini-state there from 2014-17. Turkey says the SDF's main fighting force, the YPG, are Kurdish separatists it regards as terrorists, and sent troops across the frontier in 2017 to push them back. Rebel advances in recent days have dislodged the YPG from areas in and near Aleppo, including Aleppo's Sheikh Maqsoud district and a corridor around Tel Refaat to the north. The SDF presence in northeast Syria along much of the border with Iraq also complicates supply lines for Iran-backed regional militia groups supporting Assad. Israel has regularly struck Iran-backed forces in Syria. Hezbollah said an Israeli strike near Damascus on Tuesday killed one of its senior officers liaising with the Syrian military. Israel's military said it does not comment on reports in foreign media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syrian-rebels-advance-close-to-hama-city-piling-pressure-on-assad-and-his-allies-/7885998.html	2024-12-03T12:32:51-08:00	
Health officials investigate mystery disease in southwest Congo after up to 143 deaths	KINSHASA, CONGO — A flu-like disease that has killed dozens of people over two weeks is being investigated in southwestern Congo, local authorities said. The deaths were recorded between November 10 and November 25 in the Panzi health zone of Kwango province. Symptoms include fever, headache, cough and anemia, provincial health minister Apollinaire Yumba told reporters over the weekend. The deputy provincial governor, Remy Saki, told The Associated Press on Tuesday that between 67 and 143 people had died. 'A team of epidemiological experts is expected in the region to take samples and identify the problem,' he added. Yumba advised the population to exercise caution and refrain from contact with the bodies of the dead to avoid contamination. He called on national and international partners to send medical supplies to deal with the health crisis. Congo is already plagued by the mpox epidemic, with more than 47,000 suspected cases and more than 1,000 suspected deaths from the disease in the Central African country, according to the World Health Organization. WHO is aware of the unidentified disease and has a team on the ground working with local health services to collect samples, according to an organization employee who spoke on condition of anonymity because he wasn't authorized to talk to the media.	https://www.voanews.com/a/health-officials-investigate-mystery-disease-in-southwest-congo-after-up-to-143-deaths/7885983.html	2024-12-03T11:54:20-08:00

Hefty debt to China stokes soaring inflation in Laos	BANGKOK — Laos is straining under soaring inflation rates made worse by the stress of massive loans owed mostly to China for a series of megaprojects that have yet to pay off. The tiny landlocked nation of nearly 8 million has already deferred some payments. But economists and analysts say Beijing may start asking for a stake in Laotian land, resources and infrastructure as compensation, which could expand China’s influence in the neighboring country. Rising prices Laos’ inflation rate jumped from the low single digits to 23% in 2022 and another 31% last year, the highest in all of Asia, according to the Asian Development Bank, or ADB. The regional development bank expects inflation to stay above 20% through 2025. Food prices have climbed even higher, nearly hitting 40% in 2023. The ADB says the prolonged climb has slammed most families in Laos, forcing many to eat less or even forage to make up for what they can no longer afford to buy in a country that already had the highest rates of hunger in mainland Southeast Asia. 'The price of everything [is] just increasing, increasing, increasing, more and more,' said a resident of Luang Prabang, Laos’ ancient royal capital, who spoke to VOA on condition of anonymity for fear of reprisal from the communist country’s authoritarian government. He said the price of beef has more than doubled in the past year and that an average meal or a grilled fish from a street stall now costs up to four times what it used to. 'People are suffering,' he said. 'Some people buy less than before because of things [being] more expensive. That is why many people now, we try to grow things by ourselves.' The Luang Prabang resident who works as a language instructor says he started a fruit and vegetable garden a year ago to help feed his own family and earn a little extra at the local market. Shaky kip Analysts and economists ascribe the rampant inflation to several factors, including a rise in global oil prices and a sharp drop in the value of the local currency, the kip, as central banks in other countries have raised their interest rates, driving their own currencies up. Souknilanh Keola, a senior economist at Indonesia’s Economic Research Institute for ASEAN and East Asia, mostly blames Laos’ failure to build up a healthy supply of foreign currency reserves over the years. He says that has forced the government to now spend big on foreign currencies to pay its bills with other countries, driving the kip down and the price of imports up. But he and others agree that the burden of servicing Laos’ mammoth public debt has made the problem worse. At $13.8 billion, or 108% of the country’s gross domestic product, the World Bank recently called Laos’ debt 'unsustainable.' Of the $10.5 billion Laos owes to other countries, half is due to China. Much of that debt has gone to financing Laos’ share of the bill for a few megaprojects, some backed by China, including hydropower dams on the Mekong River and a $6 billion high-speed rail line connecting China and Thailand through Laos. 'Because of the Chinese debt, yes, that put pressure on the foreign exchange,' Keola said. 'They had to do everything to try to buy foreign currencies in the market, and that put pressure for [the] Lao kip to be weaker, thus making inflation going up.' The kip lost half its value against the U.S. dollar in 2022 and another fifth during the first three quarters of this year, according to the World Bank. Wen Chong Cheah, a research analyst for the Economist Intelligence Unit, says having to pay back so much debt has also been driving the kip down by making it less attractive for investors to buy, trade or hold. 'This plays into investor sentiment. If you expect a country to … default, if you expect the kip to worsen, you would less likely want to hold kip. This makes the allure of holding kip less,' he said. Laos watchers see little to no chance of China standing by to let the country default. Useful advocate Cheah says Laos has been a useful advocate of China’s interests this year as chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, or ASEAN, playing down talk of a code of conduct for the South China Sea. ASEAN has been in talks with Beijing for years over a binding code for the sea, where China has overlapping claims with several members. Landlocked Laos does not have any claims in the South China Sea. Analysts say China is widely seen to be dragging its feet, preferring instead to deal with the competing countries one on one to make the most of its overwhelming size. 'Laos provides China a voice in Southeast Asia,' said Cheah. 'It is in China’s best interests to not let Laos default because if Laos defaults it is likely to seek aid from Western countries or multilateral organizations, and this would diminish China’s influence.' Debt swaps He said China was likely to keep deferring some of the debt, but added that more so-called debt-for-equity swaps, where China trades a part of the debt for a stake in some equity such as land or mineral rights, were another distinct possibility. In 2021, Laos gave China a majority stake in a joint venture between a Chinese state-owned power company and its own, heavily leveraged Electricite du Laos. The deal effectively handed Beijing control over the country’s power grid, including electricity exports to neighbors. 'I think these forms of restructuring — they are not a straightforward 'debt-for-equity swap' — are likely to grow, but it depends what crown jewels China wants for its wider strategic aims,' said Pon Souvannaseng, assistant professor of global studies at Bentley University in the United States. 'I don't think it'll be hard for them to get their way.' Although the terms of China’s loans to Laos are opaque, they do include some land and natural resources as collateral, according to AidData, a research unit based at the William & Mary, a university in the U.S. state of Virginia. Keola said Laos’ mineral mines would be a likely option for any future swaps or restructuring of the sort arranged for Electricite du Laos. Souvannaseng said that raises serious questions about how much China might add to its already considerable leverage over the country if its stake in key assets keeps growing. 'Outside countries like the U.S. should wonder to what extent the de facto suzerainty will influence Lao economic and political relations with other countries and to what extent it will start harmonizing its foreign policy with China on key issues that China wants backing on,' she said. 'The risk is there,' Cheah agreed. 'The electricity company is a very clear example that that has happened.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/hefty-debt-to-china-stokes-soaring-inflation-in-laos-/7885926.html	2024-12-03T11:22:18-08:00	
Regional analysts suggest caution as Nigeria signs new deals with France	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Political analysts in Nigeria say the country needs to be careful after signing a series of agreements with France during President Bola Tinubu’s three-day visit to the European country last week. Tinubu’s three-day visit to France was the first official state visit to Paris by a Nigerian leader in more than two decades. During the visit, Nigeria and France signed two major deals, including a $300 million pact to develop critical infrastructure, renewable energy, transportation, agriculture and health care in Nigeria. Both nations also signed an agreement to increase food security and develop Nigeria's solid minerals sector. Tinubu has been trying to attract investments to boost Nigeria's ailing economy. While many praise his latest deals with France, some critics are urging caution. The deals come as France looks for friends in West Africa following a series of military coups in countries where it formerly had strong ties — Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger. Ahmed Buhari, a political affairs analyst, criticized the partnership. 'Everybody is trying to look for a new development partner that would seemingly be working in their own interest, but obviously we don't seem to be on the same page,' Buhari said. 'We're partnering with France, who [has] been responsible for countries like Chad, Niger, Mali, Burkina Faso and the likes, and we haven't seen significant developments in those places in the last 100 years.' Abuja-based political analyst Chris Kwaja said France's strained relationships with the Sahelian states do not affect Nigeria. 'That the countries of the Sahel have a fractured relationship with France does not in any way define the future of the Nigeria-France relationship,' Kwaja said. 'No country wants to operate as an island. Every country is looking at strategic partnerships and relationships.' France has a long history of involvement in the Sahel region, including military intervention, economic cooperation and development aid. Critics say the countries associated with France have been grappling with poverty and insecurity. Eze Onyekpere, economist and founder of the Center for Social Justice, said Nigeria must be wary of any deal before signing. 'It is a little bit disappointing considering the reputation of France in the way they've been exploiting minerals across the Sahel,’ Onyekpere said. 'They've been undertaking exploitation in a way and manner that's not in the best interest of those countries. I hope we have good enough checks to make sure that the agreements signed will generally be in the interest of both countries and not a one-sided agreement.'

Kenyan banks urged to employ more people with disabilities to boost inclusion, service delivery	NAIROBI — As the world Tuesday marks the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, Kenyan banks and financial institutions are being urged to employ more people living with disabilities and invest in programs that cater to their financial needs and services. Kenyan banks have improved their accessibility to people living with disabilities by redesigning their entrances for easy access and creating special desks to serve them better, according to the Kenya Bankers Association. Despite the progress made, still more is needed to create financial inclusion for such people in employment. The association's report says only 1% of disabled people is employed in the banking sector. The acting head of the Kenya Bankers Association, Raymond Molenje, called for improved employment opportunities for them in the coming years. 'It's a challenge that we need to intentionally work on this and be able to see within the next year, two years we can move that to two, three percent,' Molenje said. 'For the government, there is a target for the government workforce; every institution ought to be at five percent, so that is government law, but as a private sector, we need to be even far ahead of the government.' Almost 1 million Kenyans live with some form of disability, according to the country’s 2019 census. Seven banks in Kenya participated in a four-month-long project to understand the challenges faced by people with disabilities in accessing financial services in the country. Equity Bank is one of the companies participating in the project. The bank's adviser on diversity, equity, and inclusion, Iram Bahawal, said some digital services do not tend to the needs of disabled people. 'Some of these apps are not friendly to those with dyslexia; they are not friendly with those with epilepsy. They are not friendly to those with low vision,' Bahawal said. 'Looking at all this, some of these things are quick skills – we need to tweak some of these backend codes, and it becomes accessible.' Julius Mbura, advocacy officer from inAble, an organization that empowers people with disabilities, said such employment can improve the service delivery of banks to disabled people. 'Now that they are embracing disability inclusion and bringing people with disabilities on board as their workforce, they should endeavor to make sure that their internal assets for platforms, communications and their service delivery should be fluid and accommodative of persons with disabilities; because once you employ a person with disabilities, reasonable accommodation is one of the areas we should look at and to ensure that there is [a] conducive working environment for persons with disabilities,' Mbura said. The banking association and other stakeholders in the financial sector, moving forward, said they want to focus on mobile applications, online banking, bank statements, ATMs, social media, and employment software applications. The banking association will review the recommendations received from the four-month projects in the coming months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenyan-banks-urged-to-employ-more-people-with-disabilities-to-boost-inclusion-service-delivery/7885821.html	2024-12-03T10:43:20-08:00	
US watches situation in South Korea 'with grave concern'	WASHINGTON — The United States says it is closely monitoring the rapidly evolving situation in South Korea, where President Yoon Suk Yeol declared emergency martial law, citing the need to protect the nation from North Korea's communist forces and to eliminate anti-state elements. Taken by surprise, U.S. officials are actively engaging with the South Korean government to address the situation. U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said on Tuesday that the U.S. is watching developments in South Korea 'with grave concern' and expressed every hope and expectation that 'any political disputes will be resolved peacefully and in accordance with the rule of law.' President Joe Biden, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have been briefed on the developments and are being kept updated as the situation unfolds, according to Campbell. He added that U.S. officials are actively engaging with their South Korean counterparts at all levels, in Washington and Seoul. Late Tuesday, Yoon declared martial law during an unannounced late-night address, vowing to eliminate what he described as 'anti-state' forces amid a power struggle with the opposition-controlled parliament, which he accuses of sympathizing with communist North Korea. Within hours, the National Assembly voted to overturn the declaration. Speaker Woo Won Shik announced that lawmakers 'will protect democracy with the people' and called for the immediate withdrawal of police and military forces from the Assembly grounds. Some information in this report came from Reuters and The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-watches-situation-in-south-korea-with-grave-concern/7885823.html	2024-12-03T10:37:55-08:00

Spain to offer visas to 900,000 undocumented migrants amid surge	LONDON/LAS PALMAS, SPAIN — Record numbers of migrants arrived on Spain’s Canary Islands from West Africa this year, according to newly released government figures. Some 41,425 migrants arrived on the islands between January 1 and November 30, according to the figures released Monday. The number surpassed the 39,910 migrants recorded in 2023, which also broke previous records. Most of the migrants are from Mali, Morocco and Senegal. The islands lie in the Atlantic Ocean more than 100 kilometers west of Morocco and have long attracted migrants seeking a new life in Europe. The latest figures were published as Spain outlines plans to offer visas to up to 900,000 undocumented migrants already in the country, while simultaneously clamping down on new arrivals. Madrid announced plans to offer visas to 300,000 undocumented migrants every year for the next three years, allowing them to remain in the country to study and find work. Spain needs young workers’ taxes to fund the pensions and health care of its aging population, according to the minister for migration, Elma Saiz. 'Spain has to choose between being an open and prosperous country or being a closed and poor country. And we have chosen the former. That is why there are already 2.9 million foreigners paying monthly Social Security contributions [taxes],' Saiz announced at a press conference in Madrid on November 19. Saiz said that the government plans to 'cut red tape' to make it easier for migrants to enter the labor market. 'We want to make it easier for foreigners to get a job suited to their professional profile and, at the same time, for companies to find the professionals they need,' she said. The visas will be offered only to migrants already in Spain. Simultaneously, Madrid says it is clamping down on new arrivals by striking deals with African states to curb migrant departures and increase offshore patrols. Spain has also called for the European Union’s border agency, Frontex, to resume patrols in the region. Authorities have struggled to cope with the surge in migrant arrivals on the Canary Islands. Adult migrants are held in camps as they await transfer to the Spanish mainland, where their visa applications are processed. Children younger than 18 stay at shelters on the islands and are offered places in local schools. Bocar Gueye, 36, who arrived on the island of Gran Canaria from Mauritania, told VOA that he was happy to have survived the journey. 'They will give the tickets [for travel to the mainland] to everyone, but it is not easy. Everyone will wait their turn. With all the difficulties we had at sea, I think that the rest, we can be patient,' Gueye said. Tensions on the islands are growing, however. Residents of Las Palmas staged demonstrations in October against the increase in migrant arrivals. Many fear that the government’s plan to regularize the status of migrants already in Spain will encourage more people to attempt the journey. 'Right now, we don't need immigrants to work,' said Rudy Ruyman, who helped to organize the protests on October 27. 'What we need is to give work to the Canary Islanders and to the Spanish in general. We must take care of our land, of our people, of our children, and encourage Canarians and Spaniards to have children. Because if not, what will be left of Spain and the Canary Islands? We will lose our identity,' he told VOA. The migration debate is shadowed by tragedy. The journey from Africa’s Atlantic coast to the Canary Islands remains one of the deadliest routes to Europe. Aid agencies estimate around 1,000 people die every month attempting the crossing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/spain-to-offer-visas-to-900-000-undocumented-migrants-amid-surge/7885556.html	2024-12-03T10:04:53-08:00

Hunter Biden gun case dismissed after President Joe Biden's sweeping pardon	WASHINGTON — A federal judge dismissed the gun case against Hunter Biden on Tuesday after President Joe Biden issued a sweeping pardon for his son. U.S. District Judge Maryellen Noreika closed the case the week before Hunter Biden was to be sentenced. He could have faced up to 25 years in prison, though as a first-time offender he likely would have gotten far less time or avoided prison entirely. Prosecutors opposed dismissing the case, arguing in court documents that a pardon shouldn't wipe away the case 'as if it never occurred.' Hunter Biden was convicted on three felonies after he lied on a federal form to purchase a gun in Delaware by saying he wasn't a drug user in 2018, a period when he has acknowledged being addicted. The Justice Department special counsel is also opposed to dismissing a case filed in California after he failed to pay $1.4 million in taxes. A federal judge in Los Angeles hasn't yet ruled in that case. The president's Sunday decision to go back on previous pledges and issue his son a blanket federal pardon for actions over the past 11 years has sparked a political uproar in Washington, drawing criticism from many Democrats as well as Republicans and threatening to cloud Biden's legacy as he prepares to leave office on Jan. 20. Hunter Biden was originally supposed to strike a plea deal with prosecutors last year that would have spared him prison time, but the agreement fell apart after Noreika questioned unusual aspects of it.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hunter-biden-gun-case-dismissed-after-president-joe-biden-sweeping-pardon/7885750.html	2024-12-03T09:41:31-08:00	
Vietnam court upholds death sentence for tycoon in $12 billion fraud case	HANOI, Vietnam — A court in Vietnam on Tuesday upheld a death sentence for real estate tycoon Truong My Lan after rejecting her appeal against a conviction for embezzlement and bribery in a high-profile $12 billion fraud case, state media reported. Lan, the chairwoman of real estate developer Van Thinh Phat Holdings Group, was sentenced to death in April for her role in what was Vietnam's biggest financial fraud case on record. The High People's Court in southern Ho Chi Minh City determined there was no basis to reduce Lan's death sentence, reported online newspaper VnExpress. If Lan is able to return three-quarters of the money embezzled while on death row, it is possible the sentence could be commuted to life imprisonment, the report said. She is one of the most famous business executives and state officials jailed in the communist country's lengthy anti-graft campaign known as 'Blazing Furnace.' 'The consequences Lan caused are unprecedented in the history of litigation and the amount of money embezzled is unprecedentedly large and unrecoverable,' the prosecution was quoted as saying at the appeal hearing by state-run online newspaper VietnamNet. 'The defendant's actions have affected many aspects of society, the financial market, the economy,' it said. State media cited Lan's lawyer as saying she had many mitigating circumstances, including 'having admitted guilt, showing remorse and paying back part of the amount of money embezzled,' but prosecutors said that was insufficient. Reuters could not immediately reach Lan's lawyers for comment. Lan still has the right to request a review under Vietnam's cassation or retrial procedures. Lan's arrest in 2022 sparked a run on one of the country's largest private banks by deposits, Saigon Joint Stock Commercial Bank (SCB), which was at the center of the fraud and largely owned by Lan through her proxies. Documents reviewed by Reuters showed Vietnam's central bank had as of April pumped $24 billion in 'special loans' into SCB in an 'unprecedented' rescue. Apart from the death sentence, Lan was handed a life sentence at a separate trial in October after being found guilty of obtaining property by fraud, money laundering and illegal cross-border money transfers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vietnam-court-upholds-death-sentence-for-tycoon-in-12-billion-fraud-case/7885548.html	2024-12-03T07:34:31-08:00	
Afghan women banned from pursuing medical education	ISLAMABAD — Taliban authorities in Afghanistan are reported to have banned medical schools from admitting female students, removing the last remaining opportunity for women to pursue higher education. The decree issued by the reclusive Taliban leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada, took effect Tuesday, a day after it was communicated at a meeting in Kabul of heads from all medical institutions, officials and participants told VOA. They spoke anonymously because they were told not to discuss the matter publicly. Taliban officials have not yet commented on the alleged ban or the meeting that took place Monday in the Afghan capital. Human rights advocates and foreign diplomats have condemned the directive they say will deprive millions of women of essential health care services, including midwives, female nurses, and health workers, in the male-dominated Afghan society where the Taliban have prohibited male doctors from treating women. 'I am deeply concerned about new reports that the Taliban will deny medical education to women in Afghanistan,' Robert Dickson, the charge d’affaires of Britain’s diplomatic mission to Kabul, wrote on the X social media platform, formerly known as Twitter. 'This is another affront to women’s right to education and will further restrict access to health care for Afghan women and children,' said the British diplomat. Since regaining control of Afghanistan in 2021, the radical Taliban have banned female university education, and girls are not allowed to attend schools beyond the sixth grade. Afghan women also are prohibited from working in all sectors except for a few, including health care, immigration, and police. The de facto Afghan government defends its policies, saying they are aligned with the Taliban’s interpretation of Islamic law, known as Sharia. Social media videos posted Tuesday showed Afghan girls lamenting the ban on their enrollment in health institutes. In one of the videos recorded after being denied entry to their medical school, a group of female students could be heard telling Taliban officials that 'women should be provided with poison to ensure their peaceful demise.' VOA could not independently confirm the authenticity of the video. 'This decision denies countless young women the opportunity to pursue careers in medicine, a field where they have historically played a vital role, particularly in providing healthcare to women and children,' a statement from Afghanistan Women and Children Strengthen Welfare Organization, which advocates human rights, said Tuesday on X. 'The ban further cripples Afghanistan’s already fragile healthcare system, which relies heavily on female medical professionals to address the needs of its population. With maternal mortality rates among the highest in the world, the absence of female healthcare workers will have catastrophic consequences for women’s health,' it added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/afghan-women-banned-from-pursuing-medical-education/7885522.html	2024-12-03T07:30:41-08:00	
Rare ceremony in Thailand marks king's auspicious 72nd birthday	BANGKOK — Thailand's King Maha Vajiralongkorn on Tuesday presided over a parade that saw the queen lead hundreds of military personnel in honor of his 72nd birthday. It was the first such ceremony in Bangkok's vast Royal Plaza in 16 years. Birthdays celebrated in 12-year cycles are considered especially auspicious in Thai culture, with the sixth cycle — celebrating 72 years — holding special significance. Vajiralongkorn's birthday is July 28, but the previous ceremonies had been held around Dec. 5, which was his father's birthday. Vajiralongkorn's father, Bhumibol, had enjoyed near-universal respect, steering Thailand safely through the challenges of war in neighbors Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, which all saw Communist takeovers in 1975. Vajiralongkorn has faced different challenges, as political polarization has jeopardized the formerly untouchable status of the Thai monarchy. There was no dissent evident as the public gathered to watch military units in the plaza, where the king and family members watched from an ornate pavilion. Queen Suthida Bajrasudhabimalalakshana led the parade in her capacity as Commander of the Combined Guards Unit. Princess Sirivannavari Nariratana, the king's youngest daughter, led the Royal Horse Guards Regiment. As the sun set, commanders of the military services led units in taking an oath of allegiance to the king.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rare-ceremony-in-thailand-marks-king-s-auspicious-72nd-birthday/7885492.html	2024-12-03T07:28:29-08:00	
Biden visits Angola on first trip to Africa as president	LUANDA, ANGOLA — U.S. President Joe Biden received a warm welcome at Angola’s pink-hued Presidential Palace Tuesday as he made his first and almost certainly final visit to the African continent as president. After a red-carpet promenade, renditions of national anthems by a military band, an inspection of troops and a 21-gun salute, he and Angolan President Joao Lourenco, both flanked by diplomats, got down to work. 'I'm very proud to be the first American president to visit Angola, and I'm deeply proud of everything we have done together to transform our partnership thus far,' Biden told Lourenco. 'There is so much ahead of us, so much we can do.' His administration’s top Africa adviser told VOA that Biden sees Angola as 'exhibit A' of a collaborative relationship with Washington. 'We, the United States, are working with Angola on a few really important things,' said Frances Brown, senior director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, speaking exclusively to VOA. 'One is bolstering peace and security in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Another is growing economic opportunities in the region. A third is technological and scientific cooperation.' Unmentioned by Biden — publicly at least — was Angola’s poor human rights record. Rights group Amnesty International attempted to summarize the situation. 'Amnesty has repeatedly documented excessive and lethal force to disrupt peaceful demonstrations,' Kate Hixon, advocacy director for Africa at Amnesty International USA, told VOA via Zoom. 'Not only is lethal force used in these demonstrations, but the victims’ families do not have recourse to access to justice. We've also seen several repressive laws passed since 2020. Since 2020 it's been illegal to criticize the president. More recently, this year, we've seen two laws approved that further threaten the rights to freedom of expression, freedom of assembly and the media.' Angolan opposition groups told local media that Biden missed a 'great opportunity' to listen to civil society groups about their concerns. 'The Lobito rail corridor ... is the only concern of Biden’s visit to Angola,' said Ernesto Mulato of the opposition UNITA party. Biden is set Wednesday to visit the port city of Lobito, where a new, U.S.-financed rail line brings raw materials from Africa’s interior to this bustling port. Brown told VOA that the president always raises concerns about human rights, privately. 'He never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts,' she told VOA. 'And I think that's pretty consistent with the way he's been throughout his long, long career in public service.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-visits-angola-on-first-trip-to-africa-as-president/7885486.html	2024-12-03T07:13:40-08:00

South Korean president declares emergency martial law	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol declared an 'emergency martial law' on Tuesday, accusing the country's opposition of controlling the parliament, sympathizing with North Korea and paralyzing the government with anti-state activities. Yoon made the announcement during a televised briefing, vowing to 'eradicate pro-North Korean forces and protect the constitutional democratic order.' It wasn't immediately clear how the steps would affect the country's governance and democracy. Yoon — whose approval rating has dipped in recent months — has struggled to push his agenda against an opposition-controlled parliament since taking office in 2022. Yoon's conservative People Power Party had been locked in an impasse with the liberal opposition Democratic Party over next year's budget bill. He has also been dismissing calls for independent investigations into scandals involving his wife and top officials, drawing quick, strong rebukes from his political rivals. The Democratic Party reportedly called an emergency meeting of its lawmakers following Yoon's announcement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-president-declares-emergency-martial-law/7885429.html	2024-12-03T06:21:57-08:00	
China bans exports to US of gallium, germanium, antimony in response to chip sanctions	Bangkok — China announced Tuesday it is banning exports to the United States of gallium, germanium, antimony and other key high-tech materials with potential military applications, as a general principle, lashing back at U.S. limits on semiconductor-related exports. The Chinese Commerce Ministry announced the move after Washington expanded its list of Chinese companies subject to export controls on computer chip-making equipment, software and high-bandwidth memory chips. Such chips are needed for advanced applications. The ratcheting up of trade restrictions comes as President-elect Donald Trump has been threatening to sharply raise tariffs on imports from China and other countries, potentially intensifying simmering tensions over trade and technology. China's Foreign Ministry also issued a vehement reproof. 'China has lodged stern protests with the U.S. for its update of the semiconductor export control measures, sanctions against Chinese companies, and malicious suppression of China's technological progress,' Lin Jian, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson, said in a routine briefing Tuesday. 'I want to reiterate that China firmly opposes the U.S. overstretching the concept of national security, abuse of export control measures, and illegal unilateral sanctions and long-arm jurisdiction against Chinese companies,' Lin said. Minerals sourced in China used in computer chips, cars China said in July 2023 it would require exporters to apply for licenses to send to the U.S. the strategically important materials such as gallium and germanium. In August, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said it would restrict exports of antimony, which is used in a wide range of products from batteries to weapons, and impose tighter controls on exports of graphite. Such minerals are considered critical for national security. China is a major producer of antimony, which is used in flame retardants, batteries, night-vision goggles and nuclear weapon production, according to a 2021 U.S. International Trade Commission report. The limits announced by Beijing on Tuesday also include exports of super-hard materials, such as diamonds and other synthetic materials that are not compressible and extremely dense. They are used in many industrial areas such as cutting tools, disc brakes and protective coatings. The licensing requirements that China announced in August also covered smelting and separation technology and machinery and other items related to such super-hard materials. China is the biggest global source of gallium and germanium, which are produced in small amounts but are needed to make computer chips for mobile phones, cars and other products, as well as solar panels and military technology. China says it's protecting itself from US trade restrictions After the U.S. side announced it was adding 140 companies to a so-called 'entity list' subject to strict export controls, China's Commerce Ministry protested and said it would act to protect China's 'rights and interests.' Nearly all of the companies affected by Washington's latest trade restrictions are based in China, though some are Chinese-owned businesses in Japan, South Korea and Singapore. Both governments say their respective export controls are needed for national security. China's government has been frustrated by U.S. curbs on access to advanced processor chips and other technology on security grounds but had been cautious in retaliating, possibly to avoid disrupting China's fledgling developers of chips, artificial intelligence and other technology. Various Chinese industry associations issued statements protesting the U.S. move to limit access to advanced chip-making technology. The China Association of Automobile Manufacturers said it opposed using national security as a grounds for export controls, 'abuse of export control measures, and the malicious blockade and suppression of China.' 'Such behavior seriously violates the laws of the market economy and the principle of fair competition, undermines the international economic and trade order, disrupts the stability of the global industrial chain, and ultimately harms the interests of all countries,' it said in a statement. The China Semiconductor Industry Association issued a similar statement, adding that such restrictions were disrupting supply chains and inflating costs for American companies. 'U.S. chip products are no longer safe and reliable. China's related industries will have to be cautious in purchasing U.S. chips,' it said. The U.S. gets about half its supply of both gallium and germanium metals directly from China, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. China exported about 23 metric tons (25 tons) of gallium in 2022 and produces about 600 metric tons (660 tons) of germanium per year. The U.S. has deposits of such minerals but has not been mining them, though some projects underway are exploring ways to tap those resources. The export restrictions have had a mixed impact on prices for those critical minerals, with the price of antimony more than doubling this year to over $25,000 per ton. Prices for gallium, germanium and graphite also have mostly risen.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-bans-exports-to-us-of-gallium-germanium-antimony-in-response-to-chip-sanctions/7885380.html	2024-12-03T05:52:04-08:00

Trump says will 'block' Nippon Steel from taking over US Steel	Washington — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Monday said he would 'block' a planned takeover of US Steel by Japanese company Nippon Steel, a deal worth $14.9 billion including debts. 'I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'Through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST! As President, I will block this deal from happening.' Embattled US Steel has argued that it needs the Nippon deal to ensure sufficient investment in its Mon Valley plants in Pennsylvania, which it says it may have to shutter if the sale is blocked. Nippon Steel said after Trump's comments that it was 'determined to protect and grow US Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry, domestic supply chain resiliency, and US national security.' 'We will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at US Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers,' the Japanese firm said in a statement. Days after the US election last month, Nippon Steel said it expected to close its takeover of the company before the end of the year, while U.S. President Joe Biden was still in office. Biden, too, has opposed the deal, saying it was 'vital' for US Steel 'to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.' The deal is being reviewed by a body helmed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that audits foreign takeovers of US firms, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. In September, Biden's administration extended their review, pushing a conclusion on the politically sensitive deal until after the November 5 presidential election. A Nippon Steel earnings presentation on November 7 maintained that 'the transaction is expected to close in... calendar year 2024' pending a U.S. national security review. 'Unless the situation changes dramatically, I believe the conclusion will come by the end of the year,' during Biden's time in office, vice chairman Takahiro Mori told reporters. Trump will be inaugurated on January 20. Protectionist policies On the campaign trail, he vowed to install protectionist economic policies to help support US businesses, including threats to restart a trade war with the world's second largest economy, China. While running for the White House, he specifically promised to block Nippon's takeover of US Steel, which is based in the key political battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump's vice presidential pick JD Vance also led congressional opposition to the takeover in the U.S. Senate, where the deal has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats. Analysts had suggested Trump's position could soften after the election was over, but Monday's statement indicated that was not the case. Major Japanese and American business groups have urged Yellen not to succumb to political pressure when reviewing the proposed acquisition. The steelworkers union has fought the deal, and criticized a September arbitrators' ruling that Nippon had proven it could assume US Steel's labor contract obligations. In September, however, some US Steel workers rallied in support of the deal, arguing it would help keep plants open.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-will-block-nippon-steel-from-taking-over-us-steel-/7885307.html	2024-12-03T04:49:34-08:00	
Romanian hard-right says it wants to be part of new government	BUCHAREST — Romania's hard-right Alliance for Uniting Romanians (AUR) party wants to be part of a coalition government, its leader said on Tuesday, as the nation eyes a presidential runoff vote that will decide who appoints the prime minister. Hard-right and ultranationalist parties, including AUR, saw a sharp surge in support in a parliamentary election on Sunday, and while they lack a majority they garnered more than 30% of seats in the legislature. A Constitutional Court ruling on Monday cleared the way for a presidential runoff next Sunday that will pit far-right candidate Calin Georgescu against centrist Elena Lasconi, raising the possibility that the new head of state, who appoints the government, will share AUR's views. A Georgescu win in the presidential runoff would upend Romania's pro-Western orientation and erode its backing for neighboring Ukraine in its fight against Russia's invasion. Romania is a member of NATO and the European Union. The court had ordered a recount of the first round of the election amid concerns over interference in the electoral process, but finally validated the result. 'As Romania's second-largest party we ... have the responsibility to come up with a credible vision,' AUR leader George Simion told foreign press. 'I would like to have a governmental coalition. If the next president of Romania nominates me as prime minister or asks our party to propose a name for prime minister [then we will]. 'We will stay and talk with every political force in the Romanian parliament,' he said, speaking in English. However Simion ruled out cooperating with the leftist Social Democrats (PSD), who came first in Sunday's ballot. Unity The leader of the far-right SOS grouping, Diana Sosoaca, appealed for unity among nationalist parties on Monday, saying they should try to form a government even if it was a minority one. AUR and Sosoaca have previously clashed over policy and the latter's pro-Russian statements. A survey conducted by pollster CURS on Dec. 1 at polling stations showed Georgescu would win 57.8% in a run-off to Lasconi's 42.2% among people who say they will vote. The survey polled 24,629 people after they cast their vote and had a margin of error of plus/minus 0.6%. An admirer of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump and a critic of the European Union, Simion has said he would stop military aid to Ukraine. He has opposed Holocaust education and gay marriage, and wants to recover territories that Romania lost during World War Two. AUR has gone from being a fringe anti-vaccination group during the COVID-19 pandemic into Romania's leading opposition force, appealing to the working class diaspora and young voters and building on popular discontent with mainstream politicians. He says he is not pro-Russian, calling President Vladimir Putin a war criminal, and supports Romania's NATO and European Union member status, though he condemns what he calls a 'greedy, corrupt bubble' in Brussels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-hard-right-says-it-wants-to-be-part-of-new-government-/7885270.html	2024-12-03T03:53:23-08:00	
Palestinians say Fatah, Hamas close to post-war Gaza administration plan	Palestinian officials said Tuesday that Fatah and the militant group Hamas were close to an agreement on a plan for administering post-war Gaza. The plan would see Fatah, which governs part of the Israeli-occupied West Bank, and Hamas, which has controlled Gaza since 2007, jointly appointing a committee of up to 15 politically independent technocrats to administer the Gaza Strip. The officials said the plan would follow a ceasefire agreement with Israel. Months of talks brokered by the United States, Egypt and Qatar aimed at halting the fighting in Gaza have yet to yield an agreement between Israel and Hamas. U.S. and other officials expressed hope in recent days that a ceasefire deal between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group could help to push along the Gaza ceasefire efforts. Renewed rocket launches from Hezbollah militants in Lebanon and a wave of retaliatory strikes by Israel are intensifying pressure on the ceasefire agreement. Israel Defense Forces (IDF) late Monday carried out a series of strikes across Lebanon, accusing the Iranian-backed Hezbollah of defying the deal by targeting Israel with rockets. 'Hezbollah’s launches tonight constitute a violation of the ceasefire agreement between Israel and Lebanon,' the IDF said in a statement on its Telegram channel. 'The State of Israel demands that the relevant parties in Lebanon fulfill their responsibilities and prevent Hezbollah's hostile activity from within Lebanese territory.' Israel said its targets included dozens of Hezbollah rocket launchers, terrorist fighters and other Hezbollah infrastructure. Lebanon’s Health Ministry late Monday said Israeli strikes in the towns of Haris and Talousa killed nine people and injured three others. The ministry said earlier that Israeli strikes in southern Lebanon killed two more. The flurry of strikes followed a Hezbollah rocket attack on an Israeli military position in the disputed Shebaa Farms area, which Hezbollah described as a 'defensive warning strike.' But despite the revived hostilities and tough talk from both Israeli and Hezbollah officials, U.S. officials expressed hope Monday that a temporary peace will prevail. 'Broadly speaking, it's our assessment that despite some of these incidents that we're seeing, the ceasefire is holding' Pentagon press secretary Major General Pat Ryder said Monday during a briefing with reporters. 'We will continue to work with partners in the region to ensure that the ceasefire has the best potential for succeeding,' he added. U.S. State Department officials Monday, likewise, said they have not seen indications that the ceasefire is in danger of collapsing, despite accusations by both side of violations. 'This is work that's ongoing,' said State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller. 'We take all of them very seriously, and we work through the [ceasefire] mechanism that we set up to adjudicate them.' Negotiators from the United States and France have touted the ceasefire deal as a chance to forge a more permanent cessation of hostilities between Israel and Lebanon, and end fighting that erupted following the October 7, 2023, attack by Hezbollah ally Hamas on Israel. During its attack, Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. There are still about 100 hostages held in Gaza, with about one-third believed to be dead. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump warned Monday on his social media platform 'there will be ALL HELL TO PAY in the Middle East' if the hostages are not released by the time he takes office on January 20. 'Those responsible will be hit harder than anybody has been hit in the long and storied History of the United States of America,' he added. 'RELEASE THE HOSTAGES NOW!' In its counteroffensive in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 44,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not distinguish in its death toll between civilians and combatants. Israel, without providing evidence, says it has killed more than 17,000 militants. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries.

Turkish court jails protesters over Erdogan speech disruption	A Turkish court has jailed pending trial nine protesters who disrupted President Tayyip Erdogan's speech in Istanbul last week, accusing his government of continuing oil exports to Israel despite a publicized embargo. The incident occurred during Erdogan's televised address at a forum on Friday, where the protesters said the government was failing to uphold its pro-Palestinian rhetoric. They chanted slogans such as 'Ships are carrying bombs to Gaza' and 'Stop fueling genocide.' Erdogan responded sharply. 'My child, don't become the mouthpiece of Zionists here. No matter how much you try to provoke by acting as their voice, mouth, and eyes, you will not succeed,' he said. 'Zionists around the world know very well where Tayyip Erdogan stands. But it seems you still haven't understood.' Police removed the demonstrators from the event, and prosecutors charged them with insulting the president and participating in an illegal demonstration. The Istanbul Chief Public Prosecutor's Office said the group had coordinated their actions inside and outside the venue and sought their detention pending trial. The arrests have drawn strong criticism from opposition politicians and rights advocates. Main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) leader Ozgur Ozel denounced the detentions as a blow to democracy. 'The decision to arrest nine young people who protested Tayyip Erdogan proves the grave situation our country's democracy has fallen into,' Ozel said. 'These young people were exercising their right to free expression and should be released immediately.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkish-court-jails-protesters-over-erdogan-speech-disruption/7885220.html	2024-12-03T02:13:26-08:00	
Airlines not switching quickly enough to green jet fuel, study says	Most of the world's airlines are not doing enough to switch to sustainable jet fuel, according to a study by Brussels-based advocacy group Transport and Environment, which also found too little investment by oil producers in the transition. The airline sector is calling for more production of the fuel, which can be made from materials such as wood chips and used cooking oil. 'Unfortunately, airlines at the moment are not on the trajectory to have meaningful emissions reduction because they're not buying enough sustainable aviation fuel,' Transport and Environment aviation policy manager Francesco Catte said. As it stands, SAF makes up about 1% of aviation fuel use on the global market, which needs to increase for airlines to meet carbon emission reduction targets. The fuel can cost between two to five times more than regular jet fuel. A lack of investment by major oil players, who have the capital to build SAF processing facilities, is hampering the market's growth, the study says. In its ranking, Transport and Environment pointed to Air France-KLM, United Airlines and Norwegian as some of the airlines that have taken tangible steps to buy sustainable jet fuel, particularly its synthetic, cleaner burning version. But 87% are failing to make meaningful efforts, the ranking shows, and even those who are trying could miss their own targets without more investment. Airlines such as Italy's ITA Airways, the successor airline to bankrupt Alitalia, and Portugal's TAP have done very little to secure SAF in the coming years, the ranking shows. A TAP spokesperson said the airline was the first to fly in Portugal with SAF in July 2022, 'and is committed to flying with 10% SAF in 2030.' 'While we would have liked to increase our investment in SAF, the low availability...and high costs...have limited our ability to do so, considering also our start up condition,' an ITA spokesperson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/airlines-not-switching-quickly-enough-to-green-jet-fuel-study-says/7885219.html	2024-12-03T02:07:20-08:00	
Indian police to query Starlink on device used in huge haul of smuggled drugs	BENGALURU, INDIA — Indian police will seek details from Elon Musk's Starlink, they said on Tuesday, in a bid to hunt down drug smugglers who used its satellite internet device to navigate deep seas and bring meth worth $4.25 billion into Indian waters for the first time. In their biggest such seizure, police in the remote outpost of the Andaman and Nicobar islands uncovered more than 6,000 kg of meth last week in a Myanmar boat carrying sacks of suspected contraband, and detained six Myanmar nationals. But the incident has set off alarm bells as it is the first time Starlink's device has been used to navigate and reach Indian waters, Hargobinder S. Dhaliwal, a top police officer in the Andaman islands who is handling the case, told Reuters. Starlink, which says it provides coverage in international waters, has plans to launch in India, but says its coverage in territorial waters is contingent on government approval. 'This (case) is different because it is bypassing all the legal channels,' Dhaliwal added. 'They directly operated (phones) with satellite, creating a Wi-Fi hotspot.' He said he planned to seek from Starlink details such as who bought the device and when, as well as its usage history. 'They (smugglers) were using Starlink since their journey started from Myanmar,' he said. Starlink did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Andaman and Nicobar police estimated the seized meth had a retail market value of 360 billion rupees, or $4.25 billion. Their inquiry comes as Starlink inches closer to a launch in India after lobbying for months to secure satellite spectrum, following a face-off with Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani who repeatedly opposed the move and urged spectrum auctions. Dhaliwal said the smugglers used the Starlink Mini device, described on its website as 'a compact, portable kit that can easily fit in a backpack.' Police in the Andaman and Nicobar islands have said they are checking the involvement of any local or foreign syndicates in the whole network as they tackle the latest seizure case from various angles. In 2023, seizures of methamphetamine, or meth, as it is known, reached a record high of 190 tons in east and southeast Asia, as meth trafficking on maritime routes has increased in recent years, the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime says. India is a growing transit and destination market for methamphetamine from Myanmar, the UNODC said in its report this year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indian-police-to-query-starlink-on-device-used-in-huge-haul-of-smuggled-drugs-/7885214.html	2024-12-03T01:55:25-08:00	
Taiwan launches hotlines for China travel 'safety risks'	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan has launched hotlines for travelers seeking information about their 'safety risks' while in China, which recently published tough criminal sentencing guidelines for supporters of the island's independence. The enhanced 'emergency assistance services' aim to help address 'personal safety risks associated with travelling' to China, Hong Kong and Macau, Taiwan's top China policy body, the Mainland Affairs Council (MAC), announced on Monday. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory and has not ruled out using force to bring the island under its control. MAC raised its travel warning for China to the second-highest 'orange' level earlier this year after Beijing published judicial punishments for supporters of Taiwan's independence. The guidelines announced in June include the death penalty for 'particularly serious' cases involving 'diehard' advocates. China has 'continued to enact and amend national security laws, leading to numerous incidents involving the illegal detention, arrest, and interrogation of Taiwanese nationals in mainland China, Hong Kong, and Macau,' MAC said. While Taiwanese people do not have to register their travel to China, the number who have done so this year has soared, according to figures released by MAC. From January to October, the number of people registering for travel to China's mainland rose 'approximately 14 times' compared to last year, MAC said. Meanwhile, registrations for Hong Kong and Macau 'exceeded five times the total for the same period last year.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-launches-hotlines-for-china-travel-safety-risks-/7885192.html	2024-12-03T00:56:58-08:00	
Trump says will 'block' Nippon Steel from taking over US Steel	WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump on Monday said he would 'block' a planned takeover of US Steel by Japanese company Nippon Steel, a deal worth $14.9 billion including debts. 'I am totally against the once great and powerful U.S. Steel being bought by a foreign company, in this case Nippon Steel of Japan,' Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. 'Through a series of Tax Incentives and Tariffs, we will make U.S. Steel Strong and Great Again, and it will happen FAST! As President, I will block this deal from happening.' Embattled US Steel has argued that it needs the Nippon deal to ensure sufficient investment in its Mon Valley plants in Pennsylvania, which it says it may have to shutter if the sale is blocked. Nippon Steel said after Trump's comments that it was 'determined to protect and grow US Steel in a manner that reinforces American industry, domestic supply chain resiliency, and US national security.' 'We will invest no less than $2.7 billion into its unionized facilities, introduce our world-class technological innovation, and secure union jobs so that American steelworkers at US Steel can manufacture the most advanced steel products for American customers,' the Japanese firm said in a statement. Days after the US election last month, Nippon Steel said it expected to close its takeover of the company before the end of the year, while U.S. President Joe Biden was still in office. Biden, too, has opposed the deal, saying it was 'vital' for US Steel 'to remain an American steel company that is domestically owned and operated.' The deal is being reviewed by a body helmed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen that audits foreign takeovers of US firms, called the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. In September, Biden's administration extended their review, pushing a conclusion on the politically sensitive deal until after the November 5 presidential election. A Nippon Steel earnings presentation on November 7 maintained that 'the transaction is expected to close in... calendar year 2024' pending a U.S. national security review. 'Unless the situation changes dramatically, I believe the conclusion will come by the end of the year,' during Biden's time in office, vice chairman Takahiro Mori told reporters. Trump will be inaugurated on January 20. Protectionist policies On the campaign trail, he vowed to install protectionist economic policies to help support US businesses, including threats to restart a trade war with the world's second largest economy, China. While running for the White House, he specifically promised to block Nippon's takeover of US Steel, which is based in the key political battleground state of Pennsylvania. Trump's vice presidential pick JD Vance also led congressional opposition to the takeover in the U.S. Senate, where the deal has been criticized by both Republicans and Democrats. Analysts had suggested Trump's position could soften after the election was over, but Monday's statement indicated that was not the case. Major Japanese and American business groups have urged Yellen not to succumb to political pressure when reviewing the proposed acquisition. The steelworkers union has fought the deal, and criticized a September arbitrators' ruling that Nippon had proven it could assume US Steel's labor contract obligations. In September, however, some US Steel workers rallied in support of the deal, arguing it would help keep plants open.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-says-will-block-nippon-steel-from-taking-over-us-steel/7885190.html	2024-12-03T00:50:18-08:00	
Indonesia to increase local component requirement for smartphones	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesia plans to increase requirements on local components for smartphones made and sold in the country, its deputy industry minister said on Tuesday, a move aimed at boosting the domestic manufacturing sector. The plan follows Indonesia's banning last month of sales of Apple's iPhone 16 after it failed to meet a requirement that smartphones sold domestically must comprise at least 40% locally made parts. Apple has since made a $100 million investment proposal to build an accessory and component plant to reverse the ban, but the government has rejected that on the grounds it did not meet the principal of fairness. Apple has not responded to Reuters requests for comment on the issue. Deputy Minister Faisol Reza said the government was still discussing the details and gave no timeframe for the introduction of the plan, or by how much the ratio of local components would increase. 'What important is that the goal is to strengthen our domestic industry,' he told reporters. The government was looking at whether investment into research and development was relevant and could be counted as a component in fulfilling the local content rule. Apple has no manufacturing facilities in Indonesia but has since 2018 set up application developer academies, which Jakarta considers the company's strategy to meet local content requirement for the sale of older iPhone models. Minister Faisol said Apple's representatives will meet with the government soon to discuss a solution.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-to-increase-local-component-requirement-for-smartphones/7885175.html	2024-12-02T23:54:12-08:00	
As sabotage allegations swirl, NATO struggles to secure the Baltic Sea	TURKU, Finland — On Nov. 18, hours after two communication cables were severed in the Baltic Sea, 30 NATO vessels and 4,000 military staff took to the same body of water for one of northern Europe's largest naval exercises. The 12-day 'Freezing Winds' drill was part of a push to step up the transatlantic defense alliance's protection of infrastructure in waters that carry 15% of global shipping traffic and are seen as increasingly vulnerable to attack. The Baltic Sea is bordered by eight NATO countries and Russia. There have been at least three incidents of possible sabotage to the 40-odd telecommunication cables and critical gas pipelines that run along its relatively shallow seabed since 2022, when Russia invaded Ukraine. 'NATO is stepping up patrols, ... allies are investing in innovative technologies that can help better secure these assets,' said Commander Arlo Abrahamson, a spokesperson for NATO's Allied Maritime Command. Yet the ease with which a ship's anchor can slice through a cable, coupled with the often-treacherous sea conditions, makes actual prevention of such attacks almost impossible. On day three of the exercise, German Navy commander Beata Król tried to launch an underwater drone from her de-mining vessel, the Weilheim, to inspect the seabed as a winter storm raged. After a 30-minute delay in launching it, the drone had frozen and could not operate. 'The batteries got cold,' she said, shrugging, as she waited for the equipment to warm up. Having spent years detonating World War II-era mines on the Baltic seabed, NATO is repurposing its six-vessel mine hunting fleet to also monitor suspicious underwater activity, with its hull-mounted sonar scanning the seabed, drones able to take pictures and video under the water, and specialist divers on hand. But its powers are still limited. 'We are a defensive alliance, so by conducting training and exercising, also in areas which are crucial with underwater infrastructure, we show presence and prevent rather than actively engage,' Król said. Security sources say the Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3, which left the Russian port of Ust-Luga on Nov. 15, was responsible for severing the two undersea cables in Swedish economic waters between Nov. 17 and 18 by dragging its anchor on the seabed. As of Monday, it was stationary in Danish economic waters, being watched by NATO members' naval ships, having been urged by Sweden to return to be investigated. Some politicians had accused it of sabotage, but no authority had shown evidence that its actions were deliberate. China has said it is ready to assist in the investigation, while its ally Russia has denied involvement in any of the Baltic infrastructure incidents. The case is similar to an incident last year when the Chinese ship NewNew Polar Bear damaged two cables linking Estonia to Finland and Sweden as well as an Estonia-Finland gas pipeline. China made similar promises to assist, but the ship was not stopped and, a year on, Finnish and Estonian investigators have yet to present conclusions. Damage to cables is not new. Globally, around 150 are damaged each year, according to the UK-based International Cable Protection Committee. The telecoms cables, power lines and gas pipes in the shallow Baltic are particularly vulnerable due to its very intense ship traffic, the U.S.-based telecom research firm TeleGeography said. If any of the recent incidents are proven to be sabotage by another country, it would mark a return of a type of warfare not seen for decades. 'You should go back to World War One or the American-Spanish war to find a state-sponsored sabotage of a submarine cable,' said Paul Brodsky, a senior researcher at TeleGeography. To counter this potential threat, NATO in May opened its Maritime Centre for Security of Critical Undersea Infrastructure (CUI) in London, which wants to map all critical infrastructure in NATO-controlled waters and identify weak spots. In Rostock, on Germany's Baltic coast, a multinational naval headquarters opened in October to protect NATO members' interests in the sea. 'What I think we can achieve is to place the responsibility after an incident,' CUI's Branch Head, Commander Pal Bratbak, said onboard the Weilheim, stressing the growing power of technology. NATO's Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation in Italy is launching software that will combine private and military data and imagery from hydrophones, radars, satellites, vessels' Automatic Identification System (AIS) and fibers with Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS), which private telecom companies use to localize cuts in their cables. 'If we have a good picture of what's going on, then we can deploy units to verify what the system tells us,' Bratbak said. German Lieutenant-General Hans-Werner Wiermann, who led an undersea infrastructure coordination cell at NATO Headquarters until March, said no pipeline or cable can be guarded all the time. 'The right response to such hybrid attacks is resilience,' he said, adding that companies were already laying cables to add 'redundancies' - spare routings that will allow critical pieces of infrastructure to keep working if one cable is cut. On board the Weilheim, Król's second drone is finally able to brave the storm to continue the inspection drill underwater.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-sabotage-allegations-swirl-nato-struggles-to-secure-the-baltic-sea/7885171.html	2024-12-02T23:40:54-08:00	
Ukraine support in focus as NATO foreign ministers meet	NATO foreign ministers open two days of talks Tuesday in Brussels with support for Ukraine high on the agenda as the country fights to defend itself from a Russian invasion that began nearly three years ago. Allies have already pledged hundreds of millions of dollars in new military aid ahead of the meetings, including new rounds of assistance from the United States and Germany. In addition to the NATO ministerial talks, the agenda also includes the latest round of meetings for the NATO-Ukraine council as Ukrainian officials push for membership in the alliance. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said Sunday that an invitation to join NATO 'would fundamentally strengthen Ukraine before any negotiations to end the war.' NATO leaders have repeatedly said Ukraine’s future is in NATO, but that the country would not be able to join while the Russian war is ongoing. U.S. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller told reporters Monday that the United States is focused on 'helping Ukraine to be in the strongest position possible on the battlefield and to ensure they are able to defend itself now and over the long term.' On the battlefront, Ukrainian officials said Tuesday that Russian aerial attacks overnight damaged energy infrastructure in the western regions of Rivne and Ternopil. In the Dnipropetrovsk region, Governor Serhiy Lysak said on Telegram that Russian shelling and a drone hit the city of Nikopol, damaging multiple homes, a gym, and gas and power lines. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it shot down a Ukrainian drone over the Belgorod region and another drone over Bryansk.

White House: Biden expected to issue more pardons before end of term	A day after U.S. President Joe Biden announced the pardon of his son Hunter, the White House said the president is expected to issue more pardons and clemencies before he leaves office next month. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters Monday that Biden is 'thinking through that process very thoroughly.' 'I don't have a timeline for you,' Jean-Pierre said. 'As you know, this usually happens towards the end. And so, the president is going through that process, thinking through that process. I'm not going to get ahead of him. But you can expect more announcements to come.' Hunter Biden was facing sentencing this month for gun and tax offenses and could have been imprisoned for years. Biden had for months pledged not to pardon his 54-year-old son, a lawyer who for years was caught up in cocaine addiction as his life spiraled out of control. But the president said in a statement late Sunday that Hunter Biden’s prosecution was selective and politically motivated, aimed at undercutting his reelection campaign before he dropped out of the race in July for another four-year term. 'The charges in his cases came about only after several of my political opponents in Congress instigated them to attack me and oppose my election,' Biden said. Hunter Biden was convicted of three felonies in June for a 2018 gun purchase. Prosecutors said he falsely claimed on a federal form to not be illegally using or addicted to drugs. He also pleaded guilty to nine federal tax charges in a case where he was accused of failing to pay at least $1.4 million in taxes. He faced up to 17 years in federal prison in the tax case during a scheduled sentencing hearing in Los Angeles on December 16, although sentencing experts said that most likely as a first-time offender, he would have served no more than 36 months behind bars. Hunter Biden was facing a stiffer maximum sentence, 25 years, in the gun case but was more likely, based on precedent in similar cases, to be handed a much shorter sentence, perhaps up to 16 months during a hearing scheduled in Delaware for December 13. The president’s action Sunday pardoned Hunter Biden in both cases, as well as any offense he 'has committed or may have committed or taken part' from January 1, 2014, to January 1, 2024. Hunter Biden said in a statement, 'I have admitted and taken responsibility for my mistakes during the darkest days of my addiction – mistakes that have been exploited to publicly humiliate and shame me and my family for political sport.' The president said in his statement that he hopes 'Americans will understand why a father and a president would come to this decision.' 'For my entire career I have followed a simple principle: just tell the American people the truth. They’ll be fair-minded. Here’s the truth: I believe in the justice system, but as I have wrestled with this, I also believe raw politics has infected this process and it led to a miscarriage of justice – and once I made this decision this weekend, there was no sense in delaying it further,' Biden said. President-elect Donald Trump criticized the move, calling it 'such an abuse and miscarriage of justice' compared to hundreds of Trump supporters who have been imprisoned after being convicted for an array of offenses stemming from the rioting at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, while they tried to block Congress from certifying that Biden had defeated Trump’s reelection bid in the 2020 campaign. Trump has said he will consider pardoning many of the rioters when he takes power again on January 20 after winning the November presidential election. Some of the rioters have already served their sentences, but many are still in prison for years to come, while other trials have yet to occur. Trump, in the late stages of his first term in office, pardoned Charles Kushner, the father of his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who was convicted on tax offenses and other charges. On Saturday, Trump said he intends to nominate the elder Kushner to be the U.S. ambassador to France. Trump also pardoned one of his former national security advisers, Michael Flynn, former campaign manager Paul Manafort, former chief strategist Steve Bannon and campaign aide George Papadopoulos, among others. Reactions to President Biden pardoning his son varied across the U.S. political landscape and not always predictably along political party lines as is usually the case when contentious decisions are announced. Jared Polis, the Democratic governor of Colorado, said that while he understood the 'natural desire' of Biden wanting to help his son, he said, 'I am disappointed that he put his family ahead of the country. This is a bad precedent that could be abused by later presidents and will sadly tarnish his reputation.' Greg Stanton, a Democratic congressman from Arizona, said, 'I respect President Biden, but I think he got this one wrong. This wasn’t a politically motivated prosecution. Hunter committed felonies and was convicted by a jury of his peers.' Chuck Grassley, a Republican senator from Iowa, posted on X that he was 'shocked' by the pardon because the elder Biden 'said many, many times he wouldn’t & I believed him. Shame on me.' But Eric Holder, a Democrat who was the U.S. attorney general under former President Barack Obama, said the president’s son was only prosecuted because his last name was Biden. He said no U.S. attorney 'would have charged this case given the underlying facts.'

Trump names billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens as his envoy to Britain	WASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump has named billionaire investment banker Warren Stephens as his envoy to Britain, a prestigious posting for the Republican donor whose contributions this year included $2 million to a Trump-backing super PAC. Trump, in a post on his Truth Social site Monday evening, announced he was selecting Stephens to be the U.S. ambassador to the Court of Saint James. The Senate is required to confirm the choice. 'Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time. I am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top Diplomat, representing the U.S.A. to one of America's most cherished and beloved Allies,' Trump said in in his post. Stephens is the chairman, president and CEO of Little Rock, Arkansas-based financial services firm Stephens Inc., having taken over the firm from his father. Trump has already named many of his nominees for his Cabinet and high-profile diplomatic posts, assembling a roster of staunch loyalists. Over the weekend, Trump announced he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner, father of Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France. During his first term, Trump selected Robert 'Woody' Johnson, a contributor to his campaign and the owner of the New York Jets football team, as his representative to the United Kingdom.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-names-billionaire-investment-banker-warren-stephens-as-his-envoy-to-britain/7885131.html	2024-12-02T20:34:15-08:00	
Police in Georgia move again to disperse protests over the suspension of EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia — Police in Georgia's capital again moved to disperse thousands of demonstrators on Monday after over 200 people were detained during four previous nights of protests against the government's decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union. Police used water cannons and tear gas to drive protesters away from the parliament building where they have gathered each night since Thursday when the ruling Georgian Dream party declared its decision to put EU accession talks on hold. Georgian Dream's disputed victory in the country's Oct. 26 parliamentary election, widely seen as a referendum on Georgia's aspirations to join the EU, has sparked mass demonstrations and the opposition boycott of the parliament. The opposition and the country's pro-Western president have accused the governing party of rigging the vote with Moscow's help. Georgia's Interior Ministry said Monday that 224 protesters were detained on administrative charges and three arrested on criminal charges. So far, 113 police officers needed medical treatment while three others were hospitalized after clashes with protesters, who hurled fireworks at police. Georgia's President Salome Zourabichvili said many of the arrested protesters had injuries to their heads and faces, including broken bones and eye sockets. Writing on X and citing lawyers who represent the detained, she said some people were subject to systematic beatings between arrest and transportation to detention facilities. Zourabichvili, who plays a largely ceremonial role, has rejected official election results and refused to recognize the parliament's legitimacy. She has declared that she would stay on the job even after her six-year term ends later this month to spearhead the demands for a new parliamentary election. The president of the European Council, Antonio Costa, and foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas spoke to Zourabichvili on Sunday to condemn the violence against protesters and to note that 'the actions of the government run counter to the will of the people,' Costa wrote on X. Kallas and EU enlargement commissioner Marta Kos also released a joint statement that reiterated the EU's 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country' and urged Georgian authorities to 'respect the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, and refrain from using force against peaceful protesters, politicians and media representatives.' Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of Georgian Dream has warned the opposition that 'any violation of the law will be met with the full rigor of the law.' 'Neither will those politicians who hide in their offices and sacrifice members of their violent groups to severe punishment escape responsibility,' he said. Kobakhidze argued that the government remains committed to the goal of European integration, claiming that 'the only thing we have rejected is the shameful and offensive blackmail.' The government's announcement of the EU accession talks' suspension came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing October's election in Georgia as neither free nor fair. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc's recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. Georgian Dream has increasingly adopted repressive laws mirroring those in Russia which crack down on freedom of speech and curtail LGBTQ+ rights. A law banning same-sex marriages, adoptions by same-sex couples and public endorsement and depictions of LGBTQ+ relations and people in the media came into force Monday. Speaking to The Associated Press on Saturday, Zourabichvili said that her country was becoming a 'quasi-Russian' state and that Georgian Dream controlled the major institutions. 'We are not demanding a revolution. We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again,' Zourabichvili said. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov alleged parallels between protests in Georgia and massive demonstrations in Ukraine that led to the ouster of a Moscow friendly leader in 2014. Speaking to reporters on Monday, he accused outside forces of trying to 'destabilize the situation' and insisted that Russia is not interfering in Georgia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-in-georgia-move-again-to-disperse-protests-over-the-suspension-of-eu-talks/7885129.html	2024-12-02T20:22:57-08:00	
Trump to attend Notre Dame Cathedral reopening in Paris	NEW YORK — President-elect Donald Trump will attend the reopening celebration for Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris this weekend, his first foreign trip since the election. The cathedral is set to reopen Saturday after more than five years of reconstruction following a devastating fire in 2019. The invite-only ceremonies Saturday and Sunday will be high-security affairs, with about 50 heads of state and government expected to attend. Trump announced his trip in a post on his Truth Social site Monday evening. 'It is an honor to announce that I will be traveling to Paris, France, on Saturday to attend the re-opening of the Magnificent and Historic Notre Dame Cathedral, which has been fully restored after a devastating fire five years ago,' he wrote. 'President Emmanuel Macron has done a wonderful job ensuring that Notre Dame has been restored to its full level of glory, and even more so. It will be a very special day for all!' Trump and Macron have had a complicated relationship. Macron was the guest of honor at Trump's first state dinner and Trump traveled to France several times. But the relationship soured as Trump's term progressed and Macron criticized him for questioning the need for NATO and raising doubts about America's commitment to the mutual-defense pact. As he ran for a second term this year, Trump often mocked Macron on the campaign trail, imitating his accent and threatening to impose steep tariffs on wine and champagne bottles shipped to the U.S. if France tried to tax American companies. After Trump won another term last month, Macron rushed to win favor with the president-elect. He was among the first global leaders to congratulate Trump — even before The Associated Press called the race in his favor — and beat UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer to the punch in delivering a congratulatory phone call. 'Congratulations, President @realDonaldTrump,' Macron posted on X early on Nov 6. 'Ready to work together as we did for four years. With your convictions and mine. With respect and ambition. For more peace and prosperity.' The reopening of Notre Dame will be an elaborate, multiday celebration, beginning Saturday. Paris Archbishop Laurent Ulrich will preside at a reopening service that afternoon, banging on Notre Dame's shuttered doors with his staff to reopen them, according to the cathedral's website. The archbishop will also symbolically reawaken Notre Dame's thunderous grand organ. The fire that melted the cathedral's lead roofing coated the huge instrument in toxic dust. Its 8,000 pipes have been painstakingly disassembled, cleaned and returned. Macron will attend and address the VIP guests. After the service, opera singers Pretty Yende, from South Africa, and Julie Fuchs, from France; Chinese pianist Lang Lang; Paris-born cellist Yo-Yo Ma; Benin-born singer Angelique Kidjo; Lebanese singer Hiba Tawaji and others will perform at a concert Saturday evening, according to the show's broadcaster, France Télévisions. On Sunday morning, the Paris archbishop will lead an inaugural Mass and consecration of the new altar. Nearly 170 bishops from France and other countries will join the celebration, along with priests from all 106 parishes in the Paris diocese. The Mass will be followed by a 'fraternal buffet' for the needy. Ile de la Cité, where the cathedral sits in the middle of the River Seine, will be blocked off to tourists for the events. A public viewing area with room for 40,000 spectators will be set up along the Seine's southern bank.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-to-attend-notre-dame-cathedral-reopening-in-paris/7885127.html	2024-12-02T20:16:01-08:00	
Congress returns, facing spending, disaster relief issues ahead of change in administrations	WASHINGTON — The Democratic-led U.S. Senate returned on Monday for a showdown with the Republican-controlled House of Representatives over government spending, disaster relief and defense policy before President-elect Donald Trump ushers in a new era of single-party rule next month. The main challenge for lawmakers over the next three weeks is to avert a pre-Christmas partial government shutdown by striking a bipartisan deal to fund federal agencies beyond Dec. 20, when a current stopgap spending measure is due to expire. The debate will include a nearly $100 billion emergency disaster relief request from President Joe Biden for areas of the U.S. Southeast hit by hurricanes Helene and Milton, and other communities struck by natural disasters. Congress also faces a Jan. 1 deadline for raising the federal government's debt ceiling, though lawmakers and aides say that extraordinary measures employed by the Treasury Department are likely to postpone the expected 'X' date for default well into 2025. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer indicated on Monday that lawmakers are negotiating a short-term stopgap funding bill known as a continuing resolution, or CR, rather than a package of annual spending bills that would fund the government through fiscal year 2025, which ends on Sept. 30. Schumer did not disclose details about a potential CR, which House Speaker Mike Johnson has said would run into early next year. Trump's allies are pushing for a three-month stopgap that supporters say would allow their party's incoming political trifecta to dismantle current Democratic spending initiatives and policy priorities early in the new administration. Legislative action on government funding is not expected to begin in the House until the last of the session's three weeks, timing that could raise risks for Johnson's slim 220-213 Republican majority if they opt for a partisan measure first. House Republicans failed to pass their own partisan stop-gap measure in September and had to rely on mainly Democratic votes to narrowly avert a shutdown weeks before the Nov. 5 election. Trump's transition team did not respond to a request for comment. Top lawmakers have yet to say how they intend to handle a Biden request for emergency disaster relief. The head of the Small Business Administration recently testified to Congress that the agency's disaster loan program for homeowners, renters, and businesses ran out of money in October, leaving more than 60,000 loan applicants waiting for assistance. Congressional aides said a disaster relief package would likely be attached to a CR. But the first objective for Congress this month is likely to be passage of the National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, annual legislation that sets policy for the Defense Department, according to congressional aides. Floor votes could come as early as next week, according to aides.	https://www.voanews.com/a/congress-returns-facing-spending-disaster-relief-issues-ahead-of-change-in-administrations/7885122.html	2024-12-02T20:00:26-08:00	
Analysts skeptical about potential of ‘Asian NATO’	Taipei, Taiwan — Japanese Prime Minister Ishiba Shigeru has been actively advocating for the establishment of a collective security alliance in Asia similar to that of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Europe and North America. Japan’s ruling Liberal Democratic Party set up a new committee in November specifically to discuss this 'Asian NATO' concept. However, such an ambitious plan is unlikely to take place under the second term of U.S.-elect President Donald Trump, according to experts. Ishiba has reportedly advocated for bolstering regional deterrence by integrating existing security frameworks such as the ANZUS Security Treaty between the United States, Australia and New Zealand; the U.S.-Japan Alliance; and the U.S.-South Korea Alliance. He outlined his vision in a paper to the Washington-based Hudson Institute in September, arguing that such an alliance would deter China from using military force in Asia. 'The absence of a collective self-defense system like NATO in Asia means that wars are likely to break out because there is no obligation for mutual defense,' he wrote. However, the proposal has encountered significant resistance, including opposition from China, concerns from ASEAN nations and even U.S. skepticism. Feasibility doubtful Koichi Nakano, a visiting scholar on U.S.-Japan relations at Harvard University’s Weatherhead Center for International Affairs, was skeptical that the U.S. would support an 'Asian NATO' proposal. 'Ishiba’s personal advocacy is based on his view that [a] U.S.-Japan alliance should be placed on a more equal footing. And it is also connected to his parallel argument that there should be nuclear sharing with Japan. In other words, it is with an aim at constraining U.S. unilateralism,' Nakano said. 'All of this is exactly what President-elect [Donald] Trump does not want. He doesn't even like NATO in the first place, and there is zero reason to think that he would want to have an Asian version of it,' he said. Trump has pledged that 'NATO’s purpose and NATO’s mission' will be fundamentally changed in his new administration. During his first term as president, he reduced defense spending to the alliance, saying America spent more than other countries in the organization. Officials in the Biden administration have also been skeptical of the Asian NATO proposal. Stephen Nagy, a professor of politics and international studies at Tokyo’s International Christian University, also said a 'Asian NATO' is neither realistic nor achievable. 'An Asian NATO may not necessarily be a negative initiative,' Nagy said. 'On the contrary, it may help stakeholders align their strategic thinking on security concerns on the region and find ways to cooperate with each other to deal with traditional and non-traditional security challenges.' However, Nagy said that minilateral cooperation, which involves a small group of countries working together on specific issues, is more feasible than the 'Asian NATO' concept. 'Establishing and maintaining various forms of minilateral cooperation such as the Quad [Australia, India, Japan and the United States]; the Squad [United States, Japan, Australia and the Philippines]; the Manila-Tokyo-Washington minilateral; the Camp David-based cooperation between Seoul, Tokyo and Washington, will be more realistic and accrue security and diplomatic results compared to an Asian NATO multilateral project,' he said. John Chuan Tiong Lim, a research fellow on East Asian and international relations at the University of Tokyo, said that the idea of an 'Asian NATO' faces significant obstacles, including Japan's constitutional restrictions under Article 9, which prohibits the country from engaging in collective warfare. This would make it impossible for Japan to replicate NATO's European model directly, he said. Voter support? In addition to major powers in the Indo-Pacific, Ishiba needs public support. 'There is little interest in foreign and security policy among the Japanese voters, and if anything, the increasing cost attached to the recent drive for remilitarization is likely to lead to a loss of votes for the ruling party,' Harvard’s Nakano said. Lim also noted that Ishiba did not bring up such a concept during his meeting in Peru with U.S. President Joe Biden in November. Still, Lim emphasized that the proposal remains alive within the LDP. The fact that it continues to be discussed within the party indicates that Ishiba has not abandoned his push for the idea. Nagy observed that Japan's growing security concerns, particularly following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and China's actions in Hong Kong, have intensified the public’s focus on national security. 'If Ishiba survives in office after the Upper House election in the summer of 2025, I don't see the LDP or the public fundamentally shifting their position on an Asian NATO,' Nagy said. Future security cooperation In addition to the U.S., Ishiba is trying to establish closer cooperation with other regional powers in the Indo-Pacific such as South Korea. He once served as Japan's defense minister and is very familiar with defense affairs. He also met with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol in October and plans to visit South Korea in January, which will be his first visit since he became prime minister. 'South Korea’s Yoon Suk Yeol might share Ishiba’s interest in trying to anchor the U.S. under Trump to a trilateral framework, but he is also deeply unpopular among the voters,' Nakano said. 'They share the common fear that Trump would bypass them and directly get into a negotiation and even a ‘deal’ of some sort with China or North Korea,' he added. Nakano believes the best option for Japan now is to seek closer relations with Beijing. 'If Japan wants to secure and defend its national interest, the only logical thing to do now is to increase dialogue and cooperation with China and hedge against the risks that the U.S. has now turned into,' he said. Lim said that all parties are currently waiting to see the U.S. foreign policy direction after Trump's inauguration. In the meantime, existing mechanisms are being institutionalized. 'What can be done now is being done first, with the hope of aligning with the new era under Trump’s leadership,' he said. Some information for this report came from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-skeptical-about-potential-of-asian-nato-/7885116.html	2024-12-02T19:23:39-08:00	
Namibia's female VP leads in presidential election marred by problems	WINDHOEK, Namibia — The candidate for Namibia's ruling party led Monday in early results of a presidential election characterized by technical problems which caused voting to be extended for three days. The opposition has rejected the results and claimed the extension was illegal, undermining the vote in a southern African country that has a largely smooth history of elections and is praised as one of the region's more stable democracies. Final results are expected this week, with opposition parties saying they will challenge the validity of the election in court. The problems in last Wednesday's election, which included a shortage of ballot papers and other issues, led election authorities to allow some polling stations to stay open until Saturday. The issues threaten to overshadow any result, with Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah of the ruling SWAPO party a strong contender to become Namibia's first female leader. The 72-year-old Nandi-Ndaitwah, a former member of Namibia's underground independence movement, had around 56% of the vote in the partial results published Monday. Only 220,000 of the approximately 1.4 million votes cast have been counted. Panduleni Itula of the Independent Patriots for Change opposition party is second with 27% of the vote. Namibians voted for president and for the makeup of Parliament in a large but sparsely populated country on the southwest coast of Africa that has swathes of desert running through it. Namibia has been governed by SWAPO since independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990. While Nandi-Ndaitwah offers a chance at history, SWAPO has faced frustration from Namibians struggling with a high unemployment rate and other economic hardships, especially among young people. Government corruption scandals have tarnished its reputation as the country's liberator. The Independent Patriots for Change said it expected to file a legal challenge against the election this week. Other opposition parties said they will join the case. 'It is about our country, it’s about our democratic credentials, it’s about the country that must work for everybody, the poor and the rich. It cannot only work for those who want to remain in power by hook or (by) crook,' said McHenry Venaani, the leader of the opposition Popular Democratic Movement and a candidate in the presidential election. The Electoral Commission of Namibia which organized the election said there will not be a rerun despite opposition demands. Other ruling parties in southern Africa have faced a mood of discontent this year. In neighboring South Africa, the African National Congress, the party of Nelson Mandela, lost its 30-year majority and had to form a coalition to stay in government and keep hold of the presidency. The Botswana Democratic Party was stunningly swept from power in that country after governing for 58 years since independence from Britain. In Mauritius, the incumbent party also lost in a landslide, while Mozambique's Frelimo party was accused of rigging an October election, sparking large and ongoing protests of its long rule.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-s-female-vp-leads-in-presidential-election-marred-by-problems/7885079.html	2024-12-02T17:50:07-08:00	
Biden seeking additional $24B to support Ukraine, replenish US weapons stockpiles	PENTAGON — President Joe Biden has asked Congress for an additional $24 billion to support Ukraine and replenish U.S. weapons stockpiles, two U.S. officials tell VOA, as the administration continued Monday to push out new aid packages from the last congressionally approved funds for Kyiv before Biden leaves office on January 20. Officials who have seen the administration’s request, on condition of anonymity to discuss its details, told VOA, that the new support would include $16 billion to restock U.S. weapons under the Pentagon’s presidential drawdown authority (PDA), along with $8 billion to manufacture weapons under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which focuses on supplying Kyiv’s long-term defense needs. 'This funding not only supports Ukraine’s fight for its sovereignty and degrades Russian military capabilities but also strengthens U.S. military readiness by modernizing our weapons systems and making direct investments in our defense industrial base,' a U.S. defense official told VOA on Monday. The Biden administration submitted aid for Ukraine in an anomaly funding bill that also includes spending on other matters rather than in a separate supplemental funding request. 'We defer to Congress to determine the most appropriate vehicle for addressing this urgent need,' one official said. News of the latest request was first reported by Politico. Some Republicans are already opposing the request. 'Any Biden funding demands should be DOA (dead on arrival),' Senator Mike Lee posted on X. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson, who will determine whether the bill is brought to a vote in the form proposed by the White House, wrote on X that funding decisions 'are for the incoming administration, not the outgoing lame duck President.' 'The American people resoundingly elected President [Donald] Trump because he promised to bring an end to wars, not prolong them indefinitely,' Johnson added. The aid request follows vows from Biden administration officials to seek additional aid approval from Congress for 2025. Last week, the Biden administration also informed Congress of its intention to forgive $4.65 billion worth of Ukrainian debt. The U.S. announced Monday it was sending another military aid package to Ukraine valued at up to $725 million, its 71st tranche of equipment from Department of Defense inventories for Kyiv since August 2021. Monday’s PDA included air defense capabilities, munitions for rocket systems and artillery, and anti-tank weapons. The package is the latest round of aid stemming from a $61 billion assistance bill for Kyiv that was approved by Congress in April after several months of delays. The Biden administration still has more than $8 billion in funding from previous aid packages to give to Ukraine. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin spoke with Ukrainian Minister of Defense Rustem Umerov on Monday to discuss battlefield dynamics and U.S. security assistance to Ukraine, according to the Pentagon. During his call with Umerov, Austin condemned Russia’s recent barrage of missiles and drones targeting Ukraine’s civilian infrastructure, along with its use of an Intermediate Range Ballistic Missile in Ukraine, which the Pentagon called 'another escalation in Russia’s war against Ukraine.' Jeff Seldin contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-seeking-additional-24b-to-support-ukraine-replenish-us-weapons-stockpiles/7885060.html	2024-12-02T17:23:33-08:00	
Transgender attorney to argue before Supreme Court, challenging health care ban for minors	WASHINGTON — When the Supreme Court this week wades into the contentious issue of transgender rights, the justices will hear from an attorney with knowledge that runs deep. Chase Strangio will be the first openly transgender attorney to argue before the nation's highest court, representing families who say Tennessee’s ban on health care for transgender minors leaves their children terrified about the future. Arguments in the case come amid heightened pushback to transgender rights, including a presidential campaign where Republican Donald Trumpput his fierce opposition front and center. Strangio will bring months of intense legal preparation to the case as well as hard-won lessons from his own experience. 'I am able to do my job because I have had this health care that transformed and, frankly, saved my life,' he said. 'I am a testament to the fact that we live among everyone.' Strangio grew up outside of Boston and came out as trans when he was in law school. Now 42, he's an American Civil Liberties Union attorney whose legal career has included representing former Army intelligence analyst Chelsea Manning, challenging a ban on transgender people serving in the military and helping win an LGBTQ+ worker-discrimination case at the Supreme Court. He's also the father of a 12-year-old, the son of a father who supports Trump, and has a close relationship with his Army-veteran brother. He's also an advocate, speaking out as a series of U.S. states banned gender-affirming health care for transgender minors. The laws are part of a wave of restrictions on school sports participation and bathroom usage around the country. After the first openly transgender person was elected to Congress, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson declared support for restricting bathroom use to sex assigned at birth. Tennessee, meanwhile, will argue before the Supreme Court that treatments like puberty blockers and hormones carry risks for young people and that its law protects them from making treatment decisions prematurely. 'Tennessee, like many other states, acted to ensure that minors do not receive these treatments until they can fully understand the lifelong consequences or until the science is developed to the point that Tennessee might take a different view of their efficacy,' state attorneys wrote in court filings. Arguing for Tennessee is state Solicitor General Matt Rice. He served in 2019 as a clerk for Justice Clarence Thomas, who dissented from the transgender worker-discrimination case Strangio worked on that term. The state attorney general's office did not make Rice available for an interview ahead of arguments, but his background also includes a couple of years as a minor league baseball player for the Tampa Bay Rays before he earned his law degree from the University of California, Berkeley. The Biden administration is supporting the challenge to Tennessee's law, but the federal government’s position is expected to change after Trump takes office in January. Strangio said he'll nevertheless keep advocating for transgender youth to access health care that wasn't available when he was young. 'Many of us think about our childhood and young adulthood as lost years, when we were just simply disembodied from our core,' he said. Major medical groups, including the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Pediatrics, oppose the bans and have endorsed such care, saying it’s safe when administered properly. Strangio also pointed out that many medical interventions for young people, like gastric bypass surgeries for weight loss, carry some risk and it makes sense to inform families and let them decide. 'There is harm that is compounded when we are forcing young people to be denied care that their doctors and their parents and they themselves all agree they need,' he said. The Supreme Court is expected to decide the case by the summer.	https://www.voanews.com/a/transgender-attorney-to-argue-before-supreme-court-challenging-health-care-ban-for-minors-/7885052.html	2024-12-02T17:10:55-08:00	
Trump's tariff threats create division between Canada and Mexico over security at borders	Mexico City — Threats by U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to impose tariffs have created a split between Canada and Mexico, after Canadian officials said problems with the two countries’ borders shouldn’t be compared. On Monday, Mexico’s president rejected those comments, which were made following a meeting between Trump and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. 'Mexico must be respected, especially by its trading partners,' President Claudia Sheinbaum said, after Canada’s ambassador to the U.S., Kirsten Hillman, told The Associated Press on Sunday that 'the message that our border is so vastly different than the Mexican border was really understood.' Sheinbaum said Canada had its own problems with fentanyl consumption and 'could only wish they had the cultural riches Mexico has.' Trump has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on goods from Canada and Mexico unless they stem the flow of migrants and drugs. Flows of migrants and seizures of drugs at the two countries' border are vastly different. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border during the last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. Mexico's efforts to seize fentanyl before it reaches the U.S. have been lackluster. Most of the fentanyl reaching the U.S. — where it causes about 70,000 overdose deaths annually — is made by Mexican drug cartels using precursor chemicals smuggled from Asia. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone, while there were only 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024. During the same period, U.S. Customs and Border Protection reported 1.53 million encounters with migrants at the southwest border with Mexico. Mexico feels especially hurt by the Canadian comments, because Mexican officials claim their government went to bat for Canada in the past. They claim that Trump, during his first term, initially wanted to leave Canada out of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada free trade agreement in 2018, and Mexico demanded it be included. It is unclear if that was actually the case. Trudeau also got ahead of Sheinbaum by meeting with the U.S. president-elect first. Both leaders are scrambling to get some assurances before Trump takes office. Hillman said Canada is ready to make new investments in border security and there are plans for more helicopters, drones and law enforcement officers. She also noted an agreement between Canada and the U.S. that allows for migrants caught crossing illegally to be sent back to Canada. She said Mexico and the U.S. do not have a similar agreement. On Monday, Sheinbaum revealed more about her own conversation last week with Trump, saying he 'had agreed' that Mexico wanted to focus on intelligence sharing in anti-drug efforts, noting 'he said that in his opinion that was good.' But she said Mexico would reject any direct U.S. intervention in Mexico and continue to enforce the tight restrictions on U.S. law enforcement agencies in Mexico imposed by her predecessor. 'That is going to maintained,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-s-tariff-threats-create-division-between-canada-and-mexico-over-security-at-borders-/7885051.html	2024-12-02T17:06:43-08:00	
Delaware judge rejects request to restore Musk's $56 billion Tesla pay	Wilmington, Delaware — A Delaware judge ruled Monday that Tesla CEO Elon Musk still is not entitled to receive a $56 billion compensation package despite shareholders of the electric vehicle company voting to reinstate it. The ruling by the judge, Chancellor Kathaleen McCormick of the Court of Chancery, follows her January decision that called the pay package excessive and rescinded it, surprising investors, and cast uncertainty over Musk's future at the world's most valuable carmaker. Musk did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment. Tesla has said in court filings that the judge should recognize a subsequent June vote by its shareholders in favor of the pay package for Musk, the company's driving force who is responsible for many of its advances — and reinstate his compensation. McCormick said Tesla’s board was not entitled to hit 'reset' to restore Musk’s pay package. 'Were the court to condone the practice of allowing defeated parties to create new facts for the purpose of revising judgments, lawsuits would become interminable,' she said in her 101-page opinion. She also said Tesla made multiple material misstatements in its proxy statement regarding the vote and could not claim the vote was a 'cure-all' to justify restoring Musk’s pay. 'Taken together,' the problems with Tesla’s arguments 'pack a powerful punch,' she wrote. Tesla shares fell 1.4% in afterhours trade, following the ruling. McCormick also ordered Tesla to pay the attorneys who brought the case $345 million, well short of the $6 billion they initially requested. She said the fee could be paid in cash or Tesla stock. 'We are pleased with Chancellor McCormick’s ruling, which declined Tesla’s invitation to inject continued uncertainty into Court proceedings,' said a statement from Bernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossmann, one of the three law firms for the plaintiff. The law firm also said it looked forward to defending the court's opinion if Musk and Tesla appealed. Musk and Tesla can appeal to the Delaware Supreme Court as soon as McCormick enters a final order, which could come as soon as this week. The appeal could take a year to play out. After the January ruling, Tesla shareholders flooded the court with thousands of letters arguing that rescinding Musk's pay increased the possibility he would leave Tesla or develop some products like artificial intelligence at ventures other than Tesla. Attorneys for shareholder Richard Tornetta, who sued in 2018 to challenge Musk's compensation package, had argued that Delaware law does not permit a company to use a ratification vote to essentially overturn the ruling from a trial. McCormick in January found that Musk improperly controlled the 2018 board process to negotiate the pay package. The board had said that Musk deserved the package because he hit all the ambitious targets on market value, revenue and profitability. But the judge criticized Tesla's board as 'beholden' to Musk, saying the compensation plan was proposed by a board whose members had conflicts of interest due to close personal and financial ties to him. After the January ruling, Musk criticized the judge on his social media platform X and encouraged other companies to follow the lead of Tesla and reincorporate in Texas from Delaware, although it is unclear if any companies did so. The judge in her January ruling called the pay package the 'biggest compensation plan ever — an unfathomable sum.' It was 33 times larger than the next biggest executive compensation package, which was Musk's 2012 pay plan. As of Monday, the pay package was worth $101.4 billion, according to Equilar, a compensation consulting firm. Musk's 2018 pay package gave him stock grants worth around 1% of Tesla's equity each time the company achieved one of 12 tranches of escalating operational and financial goals. Musk did not receive any guaranteed salary. Tornetta argued that shareholders were not told how easily the goals would be achieved when they voted on the package.	https://www.voanews.com/a/delaware-judge-rejects-request-to-restore-musk-s-56-billion-tesla-pay/7885050.html	2024-12-02T17:02:43-08:00	
US to block sale of cutting-edge, chip-making equipment to China	The Biden administration announced Monday that it has imposed a new set of export controls on China, restricting the sale of cutting-edge, semiconductor-manufacturing equipment and high-bandwidth computer memory to the communist nation. The new rules ban the sale of 24 different kinds of equipment and three different software tools, all of which are used to produce what are known as 'advanced node' semiconductors, the fastest and most efficient chips on the market. The export controls, announced by the Commerce Department’s Bureau of Industry and Security, also restrict the transfer of high-bandwidth memory products, which advanced node semiconductors need to maximize their performance in high-intensity applications, such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. At the same time, the government added 140 companies, mostly in China’s domestic semiconductor manufacturing industry, to a list of entities that U.S. firms and individuals are restricted from doing business with. In general, exporting certain technologies to companies on the list requires a license from the federal government. Blocking military development The latest round of sanctions is specifically aimed at preventing China from fabricating advanced semiconductors on its own, out of concern that it would then incorporate AI into new military hardware and advanced tools of social control. 'Advanced AI models could be used for rapid response scenarios on the battlefield; lowering the barrier to develop cyberweapons or chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear weapons; and utilizing facial and voice recognition to repress and surveil minorities and political dissidents,' the department said in a release announcing the sanctions. 'This action is the culmination of the Biden-Harris Administration’s targeted approach, in concert with our allies and partners, to impair [China’s] ability to indigenize the production of advanced technologies that pose a risk to our national security,' U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo said in a statement. 'The United States has taken significant steps to protect our technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our national security,' national security adviser Jake Sullivan said in the same statement. 'As technology evolves, and our adversaries seek new ways to evade restrictions, we will continue to work with our allies and partners to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading technologies and know-how so they aren’t used to undermine our national security.' China responds In a statement sent to VOA, the Chinese Embassy in Washington condemned the sanctions. 'China strongly opposes the U.S.' latest control measures on semiconductor export. The move is a typical economic coercion and non-market practice,' the embassy said. The embassy accused the United States of 'overstretching' the idea of national security, abusing export control rules and 'bullying.' 'The semiconductor industry is highly globalized,' the statement said. 'The US' abuse of regulatory measures severely hinders normal economic and trade exchanges among countries, undermines market rules and the international economic and trade order, and poses a serious threat to the stability of the global industrial and supply chains. The global semiconductor industry, including US companies, has been severely affected.' The statement concluded with the promise that, 'China will take necessary measures to resolutely safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.' Significant impact Stephen Ezell, vice president for global innovation policy at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, told VOA that the new sanctions are likely to do real damage to China’s effort to create a world-class domestic chip manufacturing industry. In an email exchange with VOA, Ezell said that manufacturing semiconductors is 'perhaps the most complex engineering task humanity undertakes,' and that simply building the machinery to manufacture them requires a vast array of inputs, access to many of which the U.S. can meaningfully restrict. 'Those tools … depend on literally dozens of thousands of inputs and components, many provided by specialized suppliers from across the world,' Ezell wrote. 'If Chinese toolmakers don’t have ready access to these, it makes their task of recreating a wholly indigenous supply chain that much more difficult and expensive.' Ezell said the loss of market share in China will hurt U.S. manufacturers unable to sell into the country, but he pointed out that China’s goal has been to eliminate its dependence on foreign chips anyway, which would produce the same result. 'The way to deal with the challenge is for the United States (and like-minded allies) to stimulate the growth of semiconductor industries in places like India or Malaysia, so sales that are lost in China can be recaptured elsewhere, because we’re expanding semiconductor production in like-minded nations,' Ezell said. He added that it is important that the U.S. team up with other major semiconductor manufacturing and equipment-making nations to institute similar policies toward China. Advanced chips The primary target of the new U.S. export controls are so-called 'advanced node' chips and the equipment used to manufacture them. Advanced node chips’ distinguishing factor is the size of the transistors used in their manufacture. Some transistors can be as small as three nanometers — three one-billionths of a meter — in length. The smaller the individual transistors are, means more of them can be placed on a single chip, making them better at processing information, and more energy efficient. For advanced node chips to operate at their full potential, they need to be paired with high-bandwidth computer memory, which can provide high-speed access to vast amounts of data.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-to-block-sale-of-cutting-edge-chip-making-equipment-to-china/7884774.html	2024-12-02T16:15:07-08:00	
UN: Haitian children account for about half of country's armed gang members	United Nations — The head of the United Nations children's agency said Monday that children make up about half of all armed gang members in Haiti and called for their enhanced protection. 'We estimate that children account for up to 50% of armed group members, while the total number of children recruited by armed groups has jumped by 70% over the past year,' UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell told a U.N. meeting on the situation of children in Haiti. 'They are being used as informants, cooks and sex slaves, and they are being forced to perpetrate violence themselves.' She said that gangs regularly kill and maim children, and that reported incidents of sexual violence against minors has skyrocketed this year by 1,000%. Haiti has been rocked by instability since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. Heavily armed gangs have sought to fill the vacuum, seizing up to 85% of the capital, Port-au-Prince, and expanding their violent grip to some areas beyond it. The violence has caused a catastrophic humanitarian crisis, displacing more than 700,000 people — of whom the U.N. says about half are children. A record 5.4 million Haitians are facing acute hunger. The World Food Program says faminelike conditions are present, particularly in shelters for the displaced in Port-au-Prince. Children are particularly vulnerable, and at least 125,000 are estimated to be acutely malnourished. 'Why is it easier for a young person to get a gun than it is to get food? That is the defining question of the moment,' said Inga King, ambassador of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, speaking on behalf of Caricom, the bloc of Caribbean countries. 'The protection of children must not be an option; it must be an absolute priority,' said Jean Jean Roosevelt, a Haitian musician and UNICEF goodwill ambassador. Roosevelt, who works to prevent youth from being recruited by gangs, performed a song called 'Watch Out Children' at the U.N. Monday. Speaking to reporters after the meeting, Canadian Ambassador Bob Rae emphasized the importance of stabilizing the country. 'If you don't have security, you don't have other things that are required to get us to peace, development and human rights,' Rae said. In June, a multinational security support mission, or MSS as it is known, began its first deployment of about 400 police from Kenya, which is also leading the mission. Jamaica and Belize have also sent some police to assist the embattled Haitian National Police in subduing the gangs. The mission has been beset with delays and financial and equipment shortages, and despite its presence, violence has recently dramatically escalated. Rae said, without giving specifics on numbers or timing, that more police and equipment would be coming to the MSS. In the meantime, Haiti's transitional government has asked the United Nations Security Council to consider turning the non-U.N. force into a U.N. peacekeeping mission, an option U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has been clear should be one of last resort. To transform the mission would take months and need the 15-nation Security Council's authorization. The United States and Ecuador are working on a draft council resolution that would ask Guterres to begin looking at preparing a peacekeeping operation. U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield said Monday that the negotiations were continuing and that 'they are not easy,' because some council members were not on board with the idea. 'But this is what the Haitian people have asked for,' she told reporters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-haitian-children-account-for-about-half-of-country-s-armed-gang-members-/7884775.html	2024-12-02T16:13:29-08:00

Greek islands Rhodes and Lemnos declare state of emergency after deadly storm wreaks havoc	ATHENS, Greece — Authorities on the Greek islands Rhodes and Lemnos declared a state of emergency Monday after storms battered the islands, leaving two dead and widespread damage. Rescue teams, assisted by the military and local authorities, rescued many older residents in flood-hit areas, after strong winds and torrential rain over the weekend flipped cars, caused power outages and damaged roads. Two men were killed in a flooded village on Lemnos, while scores of people were evacuated and taken to hotels in the island's main port. Vassilis Kikilias, the minister for climate crisis and civil protection, urged residents in storm-hit areas to comply with evacuation orders that are announced using cellphone push alerts. 'It is a thousand times better to comply with potentially excessive warnings than to face tragedy,' the minister told private Skai television. Kikilias has pointed to climate change as the cause of worsening weather conditions in Greece in recent years, including an unprecedented series of heatwaves that intensify wildfires, a severe drought this year and massive floods in central Greece in 2023. Rail travel on the Greek mainland was disrupted Monday. Weather warnings remained in effect for islands of the eastern Aegean islands, as well as parts of central and southern mainland Greece.	https://www.voanews.com/a/greek-islands-rhodes-and-lemnos-declare-state-of-emergency-after-deadly-storm-wreaks-havoc-/7884757.html	2024-12-02T15:07:59-08:00	
California lawmakers to begin special session to protect state laws from 2nd Trump presidency	SACRAMENTO, Calif. — California Governor Gavin Newsom and state lawmakers returned to the state Capitol on Monday to begin a special session to protect the state's progressive policies ahead of another Trump presidency. The Democratic governor, a fierce critic of President-elect Donald Trump, is positioning California to once again be the center of a resistance effort against the conservative agenda. He is asking his Democratic allies in the Legislature, who hold supermajorities in both chambers, to approve additional funding to the attorney general's office to prepare for a robust legal fight against anticipated federal challenges. Democratic Assembly member Jesse Gabriel on Monday introduced legislation to set aside $25 million for legal fees to respond to potential attacks by the Trump administration on state policies regarding civil rights, climate change, immigration and abortion access. 'While we always hope to collaborate with our federal partners, California will be ready to vigorously defend our interests and values from any unlawful action by the incoming Trump Administration,' Gabriel said in a statement. California sued the first Trump administration more than 120 times to various levels of success. 'We’re not going to be caught flat-footed,' Newsom said at a recent news conference. Trump often depicts California as representing all he sees wrong in America. Democrats, which hold every statewide office in California and have commanding margins in the Legislature and congressional delegation, outnumber registered Republicans by nearly 2-to-1 statewide. Trump called the Democratic governor 'New-scum' during a campaign stop in Southern California and has relentlessly lambasted the Democratic stronghold over its large number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally, homeless population and thicket of regulations. Trump also waded into a water rights battle over the endangered delta smelt, a tiny fish that has pitted environmentalists against farmers and threatened to withhold federal aid to a state increasingly under threat from wildfires. He also vowed to follow through with his campaign promise of carrying out the mass deportation of immigrants without legal status and prosecuting his political enemies. Before the special session was set to begin, state lawmakers swore in more than two dozen new members and elected leaders for the 2025 legislative session. Hundreds of people also demonstrated around the Capitol on Monday to urge the Legislature to try to stop Trump's mass deportation plans. They carried banners that said 'Not one cent for mass deportation' and 'MAGA out of California.' 'With the results of the presidential election, we need our state elected officials to use every tool and every resource they have available to them to protect our immigrant Californians,' protester Deborah Lee said. State Attorney General Rob Bonta said his office will protect the state’s immigrant population, while Newsom last week unveiled a proposal to revive a rebate program for electric vehicle purchases if the incoming Trump administration eliminates a federal tax credit for people who buy electric cars. Newsom is also considering creating a backup disaster relief fund for the wildfire-prone state after Trump’s threats. Bonta announced legislation Monday aimed at bolstering reproductive rights in the state, including by allowing the attorney general to seek monetary penalties against local governments that infringe on those rights. The proposals are part of the state's efforts to safeguard against threats to abortion access after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. Republican lawmakers blasted Newsom and his Democratic allies over the special session. Representative Vince Fong, who represents the state’s Central Valley farm belt, said California should work with the incoming Trump administration instead. 'Gavin Newsom’s actions are tone-deaf to the concerns of Californians who disapprove of the direction of our state and country,' Fong said in a video on social media. Legislators also are expected to spend the year discussing ways to protect dozens of laws expected to be targeted by the Trump administration, including one that has made the state a sanctuary for people seeking abortions who live in states where such practices have been severely limited. California, the nation’s most populous state, was the first to mandate that by 2035 all new cars, pickup trucks and SUVs sold in California be electric, hydrogen-powered or plug-in hybrids. The state also extends state-funded health care to all low-income residents regardless of their immigration status. Newsom hasn't provided details about what actions the lawmakers will consider but said he wanted funding in place before Trump's inauguration day, January 20. The state spent roughly $42 million in litigation costs during the first Trump administration, officials said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-lawmakers-to-begin-special-session-to-protect-state-laws-from-2nd-trump-presidency-/7884745.html	2024-12-02T14:46:29-08:00	
Cyber Monday shoppers expected to set record in online sales	Consumers in the United States are scouring the internet for online deals as they look to take advantage of the post-Thanksgiving shopping marathon with Cyber Monday. Even though e-commerce is now part of many people's regular routines and the holiday shopping season, Cyber Monday — a term coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation — has become the biggest online shopping day of the year, thanks to the deals and the hype the industry has created to fuel it. Adobe Analytics, which tracks online shopping, expects consumers to spend a record $13.2 billion on Monday, 6.1% more than last year. That would make it the season's — and the year's — biggest shopping day for e-commerce. Online spending is expected to peak between the hours of 8 p.m. and 10 p.m. Monday, per Adobe — reaching an estimated $15.7 million spent every minute. For several major retailers, a Cyber Monday sale is a dayslong event that began over the Thanksgiving weekend. Amazon kicked off its sales event right after midnight Pacific time Saturday. Target's two days of discount offers on its website and app began overnight Sunday. Walmart rolled out its Cyber Monday offers for Walmart+ members Sunday afternoon and opened it up to all customers three hours later, at 8 p.m. Eastern time. Consumer spending for Cyber Week — the five major shopping days between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday — provides a strong indication of how much shoppers are willing to spend for the holidays. Many U.S. consumers continue to experience sticker shock following the period of post-pandemic inflation, which left prices for many goods and services higher than they were three years ago. But retail sales nonetheless have remained strong, and the economy has kept growing at a healthy pace. At the same time, credit card debt and delinquencies have been rising. More shoppers than ever are also on track to use 'buy now, pay later' plans this holiday season, which allows them to delay payments on holiday decor, gifts and other items. Many economists have also warned that President-elect Donald Trump's plan to impose tariffs next year on foreign goods coming into the United States would lead to higher prices on everything from food to clothing to automobiles. The National Retail Federation expects holiday shoppers to spend more this year both in stores and online than last year. But the pace of spending growth will slow slightly, the trade group said, growing 2.5% to 3.5% — compared to 3.9% in 2023. A clear sense of consumer spending patterns during the holiday season won’t emerge until the government releases sales data for the period. But some preliminary data from other sources shows some encouraging signs for retailers. Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, notes that discounts from Thanksgiving onward have 'exceeded expectations' — and online spending throughout Cyber Week is on track to cross a record $40 billion mark combined. U.S. shoppers spent $10.8 billion online on Black Friday, a 10.2% increase over last year, according to Adobe Analytics. That's also more than double what consumers spent in 2017, when Black Friday pulled in roughly $5 billion in online sales. Consumers also spent a record $6.1 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, Adobe said. Meanwhile, software company Salesforce, which also tracks online shopping, estimated that Black Friday online sales totaled $17.5 billion in the U.S. and $74.4 billion globally. And Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks in-person and online spending, reported that overall Black Friday sales excluding automotive rose 3.4% from a year ago. The retail sales indicator, which is not adjusted for inflation, showed online sales jumped by double-digits while in-store purchase rose a modest 0.7%. E-commerce platform Shopify said its merchants raked in a record $5 billion in sales worldwide on Black Friday. At its peak, sales reached $4.6 million per minute — with top categories by volume including clothing, cosmetics and fitness products, according to the Canadian company. Toys, electronics, home goods, self-care and beauty categories were among the key drivers of holiday spending on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, according to Adobe. 'Hot products' included Lego sets, espresso machines, fitness trackers, makeup and skin care. Other data showed physical stores saw fewer customers on Black Friday, underscoring how the huge crowds that were once synonymous with the day after Thanksgiving are now more than happy to shop from the comfort of their homes. RetailNext, which measures real-time foot traffic in stores, reported that its early data showed store traffic on Friday was down 3.2% in the U.S. compared to last year, with the biggest dip happening in the Midwest. While physical items like toys and electronics are always popular around the holidays, experts note that consumers have turned to more 'experience-driven spending' in recent years, especially as the COVID-19 pandemic waned. Adobe notes that shoppers are also buying higher-ticket items this season — with consumers opening their wallets to invest or 'trade up' to more premium versions of products like electronics, appliances and sporting goods.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cyber-monday-shoppers-expected-to-set-record-in-online-sales-/7884748.html	2024-12-02T14:42:48-08:00	
Nigeria's renewed crackdown on oil theft shows impact	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian security operatives recently recovered 1.2 million liters of stolen oil, destroyed scores of illegal refineries and arrested suspected thieves in the latest effort to address crude oil theft in Africa's top oil producer. While many praise the new crackdown, some say authorities need to publicly prosecute and convict offenders. A Nigerian military spokesperson on Sunday announced that the army and other security agencies arrested 17 suspects, dismantled 56 illegal 'oil bunkering' or theft sites, and recovered 1.2 million liters of stolen crude during multiple raids across the Niger Delta in the past week. The raids were part of a larger push to combat oil theft. Energy expert Faith Nwadishi said the renewed efforts are having an impact. 'We see that there’s been an improvement in production coming from the background of about two ... three years ago when Nigerian Upstream commission said that we’re losing about 70% of our production,' Nwadishi said. 'These efforts are beginning to yield some of the results that we’re seeing, but I think that more should be done.' Nigeria has been struggling to curb rampant oil theft for decades. Corruption, poor regulation and a lack of effective security measures have played a role. The Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation estimates the country loses around 200,000 barrels of crude oil per day or about $10 billion annually to illegal activities that include theft and unauthorized refining operations known as 'Kpo Fire.' The term 'Kpo Fire' refers to the explosive sound made when crude oil — illegally siphoned from official pipelines — is heated in a metal cauldron and then condensed into petroleum products. Authorities say oil theft is harming economic growth. Economist Eze Onyekpere said that the latest crackdown by authorities is welcome but that the government must focus on organized criminal networks. 'Nigeria’s crude oil is stolen at a commercial rate, so the expectation is that they should ... go after the real cabals — the people who are doing it at a very bigger level and not just the smaller men and women in the industry,' Onyekpere said. 'It’s a welcome development, and we need more of it.' Nwadishi said Nigerian authorities need to publicly prosecute and convict suspects arrested for oil theft. She said that even though authorities often announce arrests, the prosecution process is usually shrouded in secrecy, giving rise to allegations of manipulation and corruption. 'It’s not enough to say you’re seizing [crude oil],' Nwadishi said. 'Who are the people you’re seizing it from? The ones they have seized before, were they prosecuted? What was the outcome of that prosecution? We have not heard about that. 'And sometimes the people that you see are really not the financiers of the process,' she said. 'We have not seen a really ‘big fish’ caught on this issue of oil theft. We have not seen the financiers.' In 2022, the Nigerian government awarded a multimillion-dollar pipeline surveillance deal to former oil militant, Government Ekpemupolo — popularly known as Tompolo. Between last year and 2024, Nigeria’s crude oil output increased by 16.7%.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-s-renewed-crackdown-on-oil-theft-shows-impact/7887298.html	2024-12-02T14:22:00-08:00	
A look at groups that captured Syria’s Aleppo	Washington — Rebel forces and allied militants launched a significant offensive last week against Syrian government forces in northwestern Syria, capturing Aleppo, the country’s second-largest city. This marks the largest escalation in Syria’s civil war since it began in 2011. Aleppo, once known as Syria’s economic capital, had been controlled by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government since 2016, when government forces, aided by Iranian-backed militias and Russian airstrikes, drove out rebel forces from the eastern parts of the city. Multiple rebel factions and militant groups participated in the battle for Aleppo, code-named Operation Deterrence of Aggression, and headed by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, an Islamist group that controls most of Idlib province in northwest Syria. Formerly known as al-Nusra Front, it was the main affiliate of al-Qaida in Syria until 2017, when it formally severed ties with the global terror group. According to Aaron Zelin, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, the group’s current ideology is rooted in local rather than global goals. 'I still consider them extremists. They still have some foreign fighters in their ranks, and they also backed Hamas' October 7 attack against Israel,' Zelin told VOA, referring to the attack carried out by the Palestinian militant group in 2023, which killed about 1,200 people. HTS Is estimated to have up to 30,000 fighters, largely concentrated in northwestern Syria. 'They essentially situate themselves as what I describe as sort of these political jihadists, where theology no longer guides every action they do, like ISIS or al-Qaida, whereas they put in a lot more political considerations related to this, but they are still very much interested in jihad, as we can see the way that they frame this fight,' Zelin said, referring an acronym for the Islamic State. 'One of the ways that I look at the issue is that they essentially went from global jihad to a local regime,' he added. Turkey-backed rebels Among the other armed groups involved in the Aleppo offensive was the Syrian National Army, or SNA, an umbrella organization for several factions backed by Turkey. The SNA was established in 2017 as the armed force of the Turkish-backed Syrian Interim Government, which had gained control of parts of northwestern Syria. The SNA previously took part in two Turkish-backed offensives against Kurdish forces in 2018 and 2019. Some groups aligned with the SNA have been known for their radical Islamist ideology. Last year, the U.S. Treasury Department imposed sanctions on the Suleiman Shah Brigade and the Hamza Division, two main factions within the SNA, for 'serious human rights abuses against those residing in the Afrin region of northern Syria.' Caroline Rose, director of the Strategic Blind Spots portfolio at the Washington-based New Lines Institute, said, 'It appears that there is tentative, fragile collaboration between HTS and the SNA, following years of tension and infighting. 'While Turkey had belatedly intervened in the rivalry in respect to security in Syria’s northwest, it’s clear that Ankara invested in fostering greater partnership between HTS and the SNA to conduct this offensive into Aleppo,' she told VOA. Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said Monday during a press conference with his Iranian counterpart in Ankara that the latest escalation in Aleppo was the result of long-standing unresolved issues rather than external interventions. He attributed the violence to the Syrian government’s refusal to engage in dialogue with the opposition. As the Aleppo offensive was launched, another was simultaneously announced by the Turkey-backed SNA against U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, in the northern countryside of Aleppo province, primarily around the town of Tel Rifaat. Turkey regards the SDF a terrorist organization. Rose said these different priorities could determine whether the HTS-SNA partnership can last. 'While the SNA is pushing towards Tel Rifaat against SDF forces, HTS is concentrating on establishing proto governance in strategic locations in Aleppo,' she said. 'Turkey will likely play on this rivalry and use it to its advantage as it seeks to redraw battle lines and create leverage with the Assad regime, the U.S., Iran and other actors engaging in Syria.' Several other groups that operate independently are also part of the Aleppo offensive, including Ahrar al-Sham, a coalition of armed Islamist factions established at the beginning of Syria’s conflict. Another Islamist group, the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, emerged in Aleppo in 2014 and has maintained close ties with HTS. This story originated in VOA’s Kurdish service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/a-look-at-groups-that-captured-syria-s-aleppo/7884709.html	2024-12-02T14:12:27-08:00	
Sectarian violence in Pakistan border district claims more than 130 lives	Islamabad — Authorities in Pakistan reported Monday that armed clashes between rival Sunni and Shiite Muslim tribes in a northwestern district bordering the border with Afghanistan have resulted in at least 133 deaths within the past two weeks. The sectarian violence in Kurram in the Pakistani province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa flared up late last month when gunmen ambushed a Shiite vehicle convoy, killing 52 passengers, including women, children, and security personnel escorting them. No group assumed responsibility for the bloodshed, which triggered retaliatory attacks and arson by Shiite tribesmen in the predominantly Sunni village where the convoy was ambushed. The clashes have since escalated into revenge attacks districtwide, leaving more than 80 people dead and nearly 200 injured. The provincial government facilitated a week-long ceasefire between the warring groups, which allowed the two sides to exchange hostages but failed to halt hostilities. Kurram, situated on the Afghan border, is the sole Pakistani district where Shiites constitute the majority of the population, deviating from the national average where Sunnis hold the majority. Ali Amin Gandapur, the provincial chief minister, Monday led a Cabinet meeting where members were briefed on efforts to restore peace in the region. Local media quoted Gandapur as telling the meeting that those responsible for 'the chaos, spreading sectarian hatred, and inciting murder and destruction' would be 'treated as terrorists.' A land dispute between Sunni and Shiite groups sparked weeks of clashes in Kurram earlier this year, killing more than 100 people between August and October. The violence had compelled authorities to halt all traffic to and from the district until early November, when tribal elders brokered a temporary ceasefire, enabling travelers to resume their journey. The November 21 convoy attack and subsequent clashes, however, forced authorities to again close the highway linking the district to the rest of Pakistan, citing security reasons. Residents have reported a shortage of food, fuel, and medicine due to repeated road closures, causing significant hardships across Kurram, which has a population of nearly 800,000. Gandapur announced Monday that the government was taking steps to address the escalating humanitarian crisis in Kurram. He indicated that authorities were considering deploying helicopters to deliver food and medical supplies to the most affected areas. Trade activities between Pakistan and landlocked Afghanistan through the Kharlachi border crossing in the mountainous district have also been disrupted. Sectarian violence in Kurram erupted amid a surge in militancy in several Khyber Pakhtunkhwa districts near or along the Afghan border, the southwestern province of Balochistan, and elsewhere in Pakistan. Nationwide militant attacks have resulted in the deaths of 68 Pakistani security personnel and 50 civilians in November alone, as reported by the Islamabad-based independent Pakistan Institute for Conflict and Security Studies. The Pakistani military has also stepped-up counter-militancy operations, killing dozens of insurgents. In a statement released Sunday, the Pakistani military announced the killing of eight militants in what it said were intelligence-driven operations conducted in two districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. It also confirmed the deaths of two Pakistani soldiers, including an officer, as a result of these operations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sectarian-violence-in-pakistan-border-district-claims-more-than-130-lives/7884594.html	2024-12-02T12:41:41-08:00

Chad orders French troops' departure, triggers fresh anti-French military sentiment	YAOUNDE, CAMEROON — Chadian President Mahamat Idriss Deby has defended his decision to break military ties with France, saying at a news conference Sunday that their defense pact no longer meets Chad’s security needs. The decision requires France to withdraw its troops from the central African nation and echoes growing anti-French sentiment with civil society groups who say it is long overdue. Deby said military ties with France that have existed for close to 65 years are in no way helping to rescue Chad from what he calls growing security challenges, including terrorism and armed conflicts. In a Sunday broadcast on state TV, Deby said his decision to end cooperation agreements with the French military is part of a promise he made during his May 23 inauguration, ending three years of military transition. In the message, Deby said he would build reciprocal relations only with friendly nations that respect each other's independence and sovereignty and assist each other in times of crisis. Deby promised to stop ties with countries he said behaved as if Chad had remained their colony. The central African state first announced that it was ending military ties with France last week. The announcement came after French Foreign Minister Jean-Noel Barrot visited Chad and was told that Chad's military is strong enough to protect civilians and their property, according to government officials. Last Friday, the French foreign ministry said it had taken note of Chad’s decision to end the military agreement with Paris, but gave no further details. Deby's decision has reignited debates on what civil society and opposition groups call France's overbearing influence provoking tensions in several African countries, especially Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger and Senegal. Mamadou Doudet, coordinator of Chad’s Patriotic Movement, an opposition political party, said he was part of several dozen civil society organizations and opposition parties that met in Chad's capital, N'Djamena, on Monday to ask Deby to order the departure of over a thousand French troops stationed in Chad. Doudet said the presence of French troops in Chad is of no use. He said Chad's civil society and opposition find it very difficult to understand why French troops did not assist Chad last month when Boko Haram attacked and killed 40 Chadian soldiers in a military garrison in Lake Chad shared by Chad, Cameroon, Nigeria and Niger. It is not the first time Chadian civil society and opposition groups sought the expulsion of French troops. In November 2023, the groups said Deby should ensure some 1,000 French troops stationed in Chad and several thousand others expelled from Niger should leave Chad before the end of 2023. Yet, close to 1,000 French troops remain in Chad. On Monday, the Concertation Group of Chad's Political Actors, or GCAP, condemned Deby’s decision to end military cooperation with France. GCAP spokesperson Max Kemkoye said Chad's military is not strong enough to handle the many security challenges facing the country. He accused Deby of not consulting his government before making the decision, a claim VOA could not independently verify.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-orders-french-troops-departure-triggers-fresh-anti-french-military-sentiment-/7884520.html	2024-12-02T11:40:41-08:00

Top Romanian court validates first round of presidential race after vote recount	BUCHAREST, ROMANIA — A top Romanian court on Monday validated the first round of a presidential race in which a far-right outsider emerged as the front-runner, plunging the country into turmoil amid allegations of electoral violations and Russian meddling. The Constitutional Court's unanimous decision came after it asked the Central Election Bureau to recount and verify all 9.4 million ballots cast in the first round of the presidential election on Nov. 24. BEC approved the request and said that scanned reports were due to be sent in on Dec. 1. The decision is final. Calin Georgescu, a little-known far-right populist and independent candidate, narrowly won the first round, beating the incumbent Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu. Georgescu will face reformist Elena Lasconi, the leader of the Save Romania Union party, in a Dec. 8. runoff. Lasconi beat Ciolacu by just 2,740 votes. The recount was prompted by a complaint lodged by Cristian Terhes, a presidential candidate who garnered 1% of the ballot. Terhes' press office said the court ordered the recount 'due to indications of fraud,' alleging that valid votes cast for Ludovic Orban — who had dropped out of the race but remained on the ballot — were reassigned to Lasconi. He also claimed that Lasconi's party had urged people to vote before some diaspora polls had closed, saying it violated electoral laws against campaign activities on polling day. On Monday, the BEC submitted partial recount results to the court, which did not include hundreds of thousands of the votes from Romania's large diaspora. Dominic Fritz, the vice president of USR, said in a statement before that court's decision that more than 8 million votes had been recounted, and that 'no one has found any reason to question the final results.' Many observers had warned that invalidating the vote could further fuel the crisis that gripped Romania's political establishment in the wake of the first round. Georgescu's unexpected success prompted a series of protests by people concerned with previous remarks he made in praising Romanian fascist and nationalist leaders and Russian President Vladimir Putin, and who believe he poses a threat to democracy. Many have attributed his victory to his rapid rise in popularity on the social media platform TikTok. According to a report by Expert Forum, a Bucharest-based think tank, Georgescu's account has had an explosion which it said 'appears sudden and artificial, similar to his polling results.' Without naming Georgescu, Romanian President Klaus Iohannis' office said after a Supreme Council of National Defense meeting last Thursday that an analysis of documents revealed that 'a presidential candidate benefited from massive exposure due to preferential treatment granted by the TikTok platform.' Romania's National Audiovisual Council asked the European Commission to investigate TikTok's role in the Nov. 24 vote. Pavel Popescu, the vice president of Romania's media regulator Ancom, said he would request TikTok's suspension in Romania if investigations find evidence of 'manipulation of the electoral process.' TikTok did not respond to a request from The Associated Press. On Sunday, Romania also held a parliamentary election in which pro-Western parties won the most votes and will look to form a coalition government. The ballot also saw a surge of support for far-right nationalists who made huge gains in the country's legislature.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-romanian-court-validates-first-round-of-presidential-race-after-vote-recount/7884472.html	2024-12-02T11:02:50-08:00	
French PM's bold budget move spurs opposition parties to pledge no-confidence	Paris — French Prime Minister Michel Barnier invoked a special constitutional tool on Monday to push through the controversial 2025 budget without a parliamentary vote. He said it was necessary to ensure stability at a time of deep political divisions. Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally and the leftist France Unbowed announced they would file no-confidence motions in response, setting up a vote for as early as Wednesday that could bring down the fragile government. The decision comes as France grapples with a fractured National Assembly following snap elections in June, which left no party or coalition with a majority. President Emmanuel Macron appointed Barnier in September to break the deadlock and tackle the country's ballooning deficit. However, his austerity budget— featuring 40 billion euros in cuts and 20 billion euros in tax hikes — has been widely criticized, escalating tensions in the lower house. The use of the tool, called Article 49.3, allows the government to pass legislation without a parliamentary vote but leaves it exposed to no-confidence motions. Opposition leaders argue that Barnier's concessions, including scrapping an electricity tax hike, do not go far enough to address their concerns. Le Pen accused Barnier of ignoring her party's demands. 'Everyone must shoulder their responsibilities,' she said.The political standoff has unsettled financial markets, with borrowing costs rising sharply amid fears of prolonged instability. Barnier warned of 'serious turbulence' if the budget isn't passed, but critics dismissed his remarks as fearmongering. If the no-confidence motion succeeds, Macron will remain president but will need to appoint a new prime minister to steer legislation through the fractured assembly. The uncertainty threatens to deepen France's economic troubles and reverberate across the eurozone.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-pm-s-bold-budget-move-spurs-opposition-parties-to-pledge-no-confidence-/7884460.html	2024-12-02T11:00:59-08:00

Turkey calls for reconciliation between Syria government and opposition to end conflict	ANKARA, TURKEY — The recent rapid advance by opposition fighters in Syria shows that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad must reconcile with his own people and hold dialogue with the opposition, the Turkish foreign minister said Monday. At a joint news conference in Ankara with his Iranian counterpart, Hakan Fidan said Turkey and Iran, which support opposing sides in Syria's civil war, have agreed to resume diplomatic efforts along with Russia to restore calm days after insurgents launched a lightning offensive and captured almost all of the country's largest city, Aleppo. The swift advance by fighters that Turkey supports was a huge embarrassment for Assad and it comes at a time when his allies — Iran and groups it backs and Russia — are preoccupied with their own conflicts. The push is among the rebels' strongest in years and raises the prospect of another violent front reopening in the Middle East when U.S.-backed Israel is fighting Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, both Iranian-allied groups. Fidan, whose country has backed forces opposed to Assad, blamed the recent flare-up of the conflict on the Syrian government's refusal to enter a dialogue with the opposition that Turkey supports. 'Recent developments show once again that Damascus must reconcile with its own people and the legitimate opposition,' the Turkish minister said. 'Turkey is ready to make all the necessary contribution toward this.' Fidan's comments emerged amid Turkish frustration that recent efforts toward a reconciliation with Assad have fallen flat. The comments indicated that the shock offensive launched by opposition fighters could be aimed at pressuring the Syrian leader to engage in political talks. Turkey has been seeking to normalize ties with Syria to address security threats from groups affiliated with Kurdish militants along its southern border and to help ensure the safe return of more than 3 million Syrian refugees. Assad has insisted that Turkey's withdrawal of its forces from northern Syria be a condition for any normalization between the two countries. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who visited Assad on Sunday before traveling to Ankara, reiterated Tehran's full support for the Syrian government. Iran has been one of Assad's principal political and military supporters and has deployed military advisers and forces after 2011 protests against Assad's rule turned into an all-out war. Iranian-backed Iraqi militias have deployed in Syria to back the government's counteroffensive against the insurgents, an Iraqi militia official and a war monitor said Monday. According to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based opposition war monitor, some 200 Iraqi militiamen riding on pickups crossed into Syria overnight through the strategic Bou Kamal crossing. They were expected to deploy in Aleppo to support the Syrian army's pushback against the insurgents, the monitor said. The rebel offensive in Syria has caused concern among neighboring countries that the conflict could spill over. In Iraq, Interior Ministry spokesperson Brig. Gen. Miqdad Miri said security forces have deployed in greater numbers to protect their large border with Syria. Fidan reiterated Turkey's support for Syria's territorial integrity, but suggested that Turkey would not hesitate to intervene against Syrian Kurdish militia groups that Turkey considers to be terrorists if they 'exploit the environment of instability.' 'It was a mistake to ignore the legitimate demands of the opposition and for the (Syrian) regime not to sincerely engage in the political process,' Fidan said. 'Turkey will never, ever allow terrorist organizations that seek to exploit the environment of instability,' Fidan said. 'We will eliminate any threat to our national security and our people wherever it emerges.' Both Fidan and Araghchi said Turkey, Iran and Russia would convene a new three-way meeting to address the conflict in Syria. 'We have decided to hold closer consultations and dialogue, and with God's permission, we will cooperate to further improve the situation toward peace and stability in our region,' Araghchi said. Russia, whose intervention in Syria's civil war on behalf of Assad was crucial in turning the conflict in his favor, has said it will continue to support him. 'We continue our contacts at the appropriate level and analyze the situation,' Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters Monday. 'A position will be formed regarding what is needed to stabilize the situation.' As Syrian and Russian jets continued pounding targets, two airstrikes hit a group of four hospitals and the health directorate building in Idlib city, the Syrian Civil Defense force that operates in opposition-held areas, known as the White Helmets, said. Two people in Idlib University Hospital died after their oxygen machines turned off following the strikes. Ceiling panels and doors at the hospital were blown off, while ambulances and vehicles outside were severely damaged according to footage taken by a journalist with The Associated Press at the hospital. At least 15 civilians were killed in Idlib city and province, according to the White Helmets. Syrian Kurds were fleeing the fighting in large numbers after Turkish-backed rebels seized Tel Rifaat from rival U.S.-backed Kurdish authorities. The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces largely withdrew and called for a humanitarian corridor to allow people to leave safely in convoys toward Aleppo and later to Kurdish-led northeast regions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/turkey-calls-for-reconciliation-between-syria-government-and-opposition-to-end-conflict-/7884256.html	2024-12-02T08:38:26-08:00	
US unveils fresh export curbs targeting China's chip sector	Washington — The United States announced new export restrictions Monday taking aim at China's ability to make advanced semiconductors — used in weapon systems and artificial intelligence as competition intensifies between the world's two biggest economies. 'The United States has taken significant steps to protect our technology from being used by our adversaries in ways that threaten our national security,' said White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan in a statement. He added that Washington will keep working with allies and partners to 'to proactively and aggressively safeguard our world-leading technologies and know-how.' The latest rules include a restriction of exports to 140 companies, including Chinese chip firms Piotech and SiCarrier Technology. They also impact Naura Technology Group, which makes chip production equipment, according to the Commerce Department. 'We are constantly talking to our allies and partners as well as reassessing and updating our controls,' added Under Secretary of Commerce for industry and security Alan Estevez. The latest announcement also includes controls on two dozen types of chipmaking equipment and three kinds of software tools for developing or producing semiconductors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-unveils-fresh-export-curbs-targeting-china-chip-sector/7884193.html	2024-12-02T07:48:21-08:00	
Analysts say Biden’s first trip to Africa should’ve come earlier in presidency	Nairobi — After promising to visit Africa two years ago at the U.S. Africa summit in Washington, President Joe Biden makes his first presidential trip to the continent where he is visiting Angola with a quick stop in Cabo Verde. Analysts in Africa say the trip should’ve come sooner and some are asking why Angola is the primary destination – given its troubling human rights record. White House officials say President Joe Biden is looking forward to visiting the continent after a promise he made in 2022. But some analysts tell VOA that Biden’s trip, which comes weeks before he steps down, would’ve had more weight if he had done it earlier. Louw Nel, senior political analyst for Oxford Economics Africa, spoke to VOA from South Africa. 'I think his trip is less significant than it would’ve been otherwise just because of the fact that he withdrew as presidential candidate and, of course, now [is] not returning for a second term. So, it really feels like an afterthought to his presidency,' said Nel. After a short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde off Africa’s northwestern coast, President Biden heads south to Angola. There, officials say he plans to focus on U.S. leadership on trade, investment, and infrastructure in Africa. He’ll also recognize Angola’s President João Lourenço’s regional leadership and global partnership on trade, security, and health. More importantly, President Biden will highlight one of his signature initiatives, the investment of the Lobito Corridor — a regional railway project linking natural resource-rich areas stretching from the Angolan port of Lobito to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Zambia. The corridor is part of a wider joint effort between multiple partners aimed at closing the infrastructure gap in growing economies around the world, officials say. Dr. Frances Brown, special assistant to the president and senior director for African Affairs at the National Security Council, speaking about the broader benefits associated with the project. 'What I found really notable about the Lobito Corridor is that it isn’t just about a railroad or critical minerals. It’s also about the communities that are strengthened along the way, it’s about more access to education, it’s about agricultural products moving to market, and it’s about increases in digital connectivity,' said Brown. Last year, U.S.-Angola trade totaled approximately $1.77 billion, making Angola America’s fourth-largest trade partner in Sub-Saharan Africa. Angola has vast mineral deposits and is Africa’s third largest oil producer. But according to Amnesty International, the country’s natural resource wealth has not translated to prosperity for most of its people, resulting in numerous peaceful protests against poverty, unemployment and high cost of living. Nel says some Angolans may see a benefit with this Biden visit. 'Many ordinary Angolans will recognize that Angola desperately needs to diversify its economy, and this is an enormous opportunity to do so, to move away from oil and gas and bolster other parts of the economy and it has massive potential,' said Nel. But others including human rights campaigners and opposition parties, Nel says, will feel aggrieved by President Biden’s visit because they see the Lourenco administration as being rewarded despite growing concerns about the shrinking space for independent civil society organizations and freedom of expression. In a new report, Amnesty International said that anyone who publicly criticizes the Lourenço government risks arrest. And 'if human rights are central to President Biden’s foreign policy, then he must demand Angola’s government immediately …free arbitrarily detained government critics.' Adriano Nuvunga, who runs the Center for Democracy and Human Rights in Mozambique, echoes that sentiment. 'I commend the people of Angola and president Lourenço for hosting President Biden. It means a lot for the people of Angola. While I commend them, I would also want to encourage President Biden to ask those tough questions to President João Lourenço,' said Nuvunga. 'We have a number of human rights defenders in Angola that are detained unjustly, unfairly for doing nothing. They are languishing in jails, some of them in critical conditions,' said Nuvunga. Nuvunga hopes that this could be addressed during this trip.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-say-biden-s-first-trip-to-africa-should-ve-come-earlier-in-presidency-/7884103.html	2024-12-02T07:07:00-08:00	
Chief of ICC lashes out at US and Russia over threats, accusations	The Hague, Netherlands — The president of the International Criminal Court lashed out at the United States and Russia for interfering with its investigations, calling attacks on the court 'appalling.' 'The court is being threatened with draconian economic sanctions by another permanent member of the Security Council as if it was a terrorist organization,' Judge Tomoko Akane said in her address to the institution's annual meeting, which opened on Monday. Akane was referring to remarks made by U.S. Sen. Lindsey Graham, whose Republican party will control both branches of Congress in January, and who called the court a 'dangerous joke' and urged Congress to sanction its prosecutor. 'To any ally, Canada, Britain, Germany, France, if you try to help the ICC, we're going to sanction you,' Graham said on Fox News. Graham was angered by an announcement last month that judges had granted a request from the court's chief prosecutor Karim Khan to issue arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas' military chief for crimes against humanity in connection with the nearly 14-month war in Gaza. This marks the first time the global court of justice calls out a sitting leader of a major Western ally. ICC faces challenges on arrest warrants Graham's threat isn't seen as just empty words. President-elect Donald Trump sanctioned the court's previous prosecutor, Fatou Bensouda, with a travel ban and asset freeze for investigating American troops and intelligence officials in Afghanistan. Akane on Monday also had harsh words for Russia. 'Several elected officials are being subjected to arrest warrants from a permanent member of the Security Council,' she said. Moscow issued warrants for Khan and others in response to the investigation into Putin. The Assembly of States Parties, which represents the ICC's 124 member countries, will convene its 23rd conference to elect committee members and approve the court's budget against a backdrop of unfavorable headlines. The ICC was established in 2002 as the world's permanent court of last resort to prosecute individuals responsible for the most heinous atrocities — war crimes, crimes against humanity, genocide and the crime of aggression. The court only becomes involved when nations are unable or unwilling to prosecute those crimes on their territory. To date, 124 countries have signed on to the Rome Statute, which created the institution. Those who have not include Israel, Russia and China. The ICC has no police force and relies on member states to execute arrest warrants. The decision to warrant issues for Netanyahu and Israel's ex-Defense Minister Yoav Gallant has been denounced by critics of the court and given only milquetoast approval by many of its supporters, a stark contrast to the robust backing of an arrest warrant for Russian President Vladimir Putin last year over war crimes in Ukraine. U.S. President Joe Biden called the warrants for Netanyahu and the former defense minister 'outrageous' and vowed to stand with Israel. A year ago, Biden called the warrant for Putin 'justified' and said the Russian president had committed war crimes. The U.S. is not an ICC member country. France said it would 'respect its obligations' but would need to consider Netanyahu's possible immunities. When the warrant for Putin was announced, France said it would 'lend its support to the essential work' of the court. Another member country, Austria, begrudgingly acknowledged it would arrest Netanyahu but called the warrants 'utterly incomprehensible.' Italy called them 'wrong' but said it would be obliged to arrest him. Germany said it would study the decision. Member Hungary has said it would stand with Israel instead of the court. Global security expert Janina Dill worried that such responses could undermine global justice efforts. 'It really has the potential to damage not just the court, but international law,' she told The Associated Press. Milena Sterio, an expert in international law at Cleveland State University, told the AP that sanctions against the court could affect a number of people who contribute to the court's work, such as international human rights lawyer Amal Clooney. Clooney advised the current prosecutor on his request for the warrants for Netanyahu and others. 'Sanctions are a huge burden,' Sterio said. Accusations against Khan Also hanging heavy over the meeting in The Hague are the internal pressures that Khan faces. In October, the AP reported the 54-year-old British lawyer is facing allegations he tried to coerce a female aide into a sexual relationship and groped her. Two co-workers in whom the woman confided reported the alleged misconduct in May to the court's independent watchdog, which says it interviewed the woman and ended its inquiry after five days when she opted against filing a formal complaint. Khan was never questioned. He has denied the claims. The Assembly of States Parties has announced it will launch an external probe into the allegations. It's not clear if the investigation will be addressed during the meeting. Khan took the floor after Akane. He didn't address the accusations against him or the threats against the court directly, other than to say the institution was facing 'unprecedented challenges.' Instead he highlighted his office's recent request for an arrest warrant against the head of Myanmar's military government and said he planned to request warrants related to Afghanistan and Sudan in the coming months. Late last week, six countries including France, Luxembourg and Mexico asked Khan's office to look into possible crimes in Afghanistan since the Taliban took control in 2021. While Khan isn't obligated to open an investigation in response to such a request, historically court prosecutors have done so. The court, which has long faced accusations of ineffectiveness, will have no trials pending after two conclude in December. While it has issued a number of arrest warrants in recent months, many high-profile suspects remain at large. Member states don't always act. Mongolia refused to arrest Putin when he visited in September. Sudan's former President Omar al-Bashir is wanted by the ICC over accusations related to the conflict in Darfur, but his country has refused to hand him over. Last week, Khan requested a warrant for the head of Myanmar's military regime, Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, for attacks against the country's Rohingya Muslim minority. Judges have yet to decide on that request. 'It becomes very difficult to justify the court's existence,' Sterio said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chief-of-icc-lashes-out-at-us-and-russia-over-threats-accusations/7884096.html	2024-12-02T07:01:28-08:00

German FM urges China to stop backing Russia, work for Ukraine peace	Beijing — German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock on Monday warned her Chinese counterpart that Beijing's support for Moscow would impact ties and instead urged China to help end the Ukraine conflict. Speaking in Beijing, she said the over 1,000-day war was impacting the whole world and condemned the battlefield role of North Korean troops and the use of Chinese-made drones in the conflict. Baerbock urged an international peace process for Ukraine and said 'that is why I am here in China today,' adding that every permanent member of the U.N. Security Council had a 'responsibility for peace and security in the world.' 'The Russian president is not only destroying our European peace order through his war against Ukraine, but is now dragging Asia into it via North Korea,' she told a press briefing. 'My Chinese counterpart and I have therefore discussed in depth that this cannot be in China's interest either.' Germany's top diplomat met with her counterpart Wang Yi for a 'strategic dialogue' as Berlin seeks to build better ties with China while engaging on key differences. Wang told his German counterpart that, 'as the world's second- and third-largest economies' China and Germany must improve ties 'as great powers in a turbulent international situation.' On the day German Chancellor Olaf Scholz made a surprise visit to war-torn Ukraine, Baerbock stressed that 'in order to protect our own German and European security, we must now support Ukraine.' 'And it is just as important to enter into a peace process together in the world, and that is why I am here in China today,' she said. Chinese drone worries China presents itself as a neutral party in the Ukraine war and says it is not sending lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations. But it remains a close political and economic ally of Russia, and NATO members have branded Beijing a 'decisive enabler' of the war, which it has never condemned. 'Drones from Chinese factories and North Korean troops attacking the peace in the middle of Europe are violating our core European security interests,' Baerbock said. She said she had 'advocated a just peace process here in Beijing today, precisely because we come from different perspectives and roles'. Baerbock had earlier told Wang that 'increasing Chinese support for Russia's war against Ukraine has an impact on our relations,' according to a readout by the German foreign ministry. 'Core German and European security interests are affected,' she said. Baerbock also discussed crucial trade ties between Europe's biggest economy and China, which has long been a key market for German automakers and other industrial giants. She urged Chinese authorities to 'engage constructively' with the European Union over tariffs levied on Chinese electric vehicles. 'A level playing field, fair competition and reciprocal market conditions are essential,' she said, according to her spokesperson. At the press briefing, she added that as 'highly subsidized electric cars are now flooding the European market, we have to react to that.' The EU at the end of October imposed extra tariffs on Chinese-made electric cars, after an anti-subsidy probe concluded Beijing's state support was unfairly undercutting European automakers. Germany, whose big auto makers including Volkswagen are facing falling profits and are weighing lay-offs, had in Brussels opposed the EU tariffs and called for continued dialogue with China. Wang said that 'the EU's imposition of high anti-subsidy tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles violates the principles of fair competition and free trade,' according to a readout of the meeting published by China's foreign ministry.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-fm-urges-china-to-stop-backing-russia-work-for-ukraine-peace/7884019.html	2024-12-02T05:54:21-08:00	
Lebanese officials say Israeli strikes hit southern, eastern Lebanon	Lebanon’s health ministry said an Israeli strike Monday killed one person in southern Lebanon, while the Lebanese military said an Israeli strike wounded a soldier in the eastern part of the country. Israel’s military did not immediately comment on the attacks. The strikes come days after Israel and Hezbollah agreed to a cease-fire, bringing a halt to 14 months of fighting that erupted following an attack by Hezbollah ally Hamas on Israel. During its attack, Hamas killed about 1,200 people and took another 250 hostage. There are still about 100 hostages being held in the Gaza Strip, with about one-third believed to be dead. Israeli officials announced Monday that Omer Neutra, an Israeli American soldier who was presumed captured in the October 7, 2023, attack, is now believed to have been killed in the attack. The Israeli military did not detail what new information it may have to make the new determination. Israeli President Isaac Herzog said in a statement that the country’s hearts are with Neutra’s family. 'We must fulfill the ultimate imperative: to return Omer, and all our abducted men and women — the living to their families, and the fallen and murdered to be laid to rest,' Herzog said. In its counteroffensive in Gaza, Israel has killed more than 44,400 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's health ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel, without providing evidence, says it has killed more than 17,000 militants. A top U.S. national security official said Sunday that a ceasefire in Gaza is now 'more likely' following the ceasefire reached in Lebanon. The U.S. and other negotiators 'may have a chance' to end 14 months of fighting in Gaza, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s 'State of the Union' show but declined to make a prediction, 'because we’ve come close before.' Herzog said Sunday, 'There are negotiations taking place behind the scenes, and it can be done.' Sullivan told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' show, 'We are engaged deeply with the key players in the region, and there is activity even today. There will be further conversations and consultations, and our hope is that we can generate a ceasefire and hostage deal, but we're not there yet.' Sullivan spoke a day after Hamas released a videotape of one of the hostages, Israeli American Edan Alexander. Speaking under duress, Alexander blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the 2023 Hamas attack on Israel, saying, 'The prime minister is supposed to protect his soldiers and citizens, and you abandoned us.' Sullivan said the video was 'a cruel reminder of Hamas' brutality and of the fact that they are holding so many hostages from so many countries.' Sullivan called the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, which has largely been holding steady, 'a huge step forward in the Middle East … the opportunity for people to ultimately be able to return to their homes in Israel and in Lebanon.' He said the United States, France and other allies 'are going to work together with the Lebanese Armed Forces through a mechanism to ensure that the ceasefire is implemented effectively. Our goal is to get through these first few days, critical days of a ceasefire, when it's most fragile, have it take full hold, and then ultimately build on it so that it becomes the permanent ceasefire it's intended to be.' The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent much of the past year trying to broker a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages. But the talks have been stalemated, with Israel rejecting Hamas' demand for a complete withdrawal from the territory and Israel demanding that any vestige of Hamas control in the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea be erased.

Malaysia urges Chinese firms to avoid using it to dodge US tariffs	KUALA LUMPUR — Malaysia has urged Chinese companies to refrain from using it as a base to 'rebadge' products to avoid U.S. tariffs, its deputy trade minister said on Monday, amid increasing export restrictions and concerns of a U.S.-China trade war. Washington is expected to further curb exports to Chinese semiconductor toolmakers and sales of certain chipmaking equipment, including products manufactured in Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan, sources have told Reuters. Malaysia is a major player in the semiconductor industry, accounting for 13% of global testing and packaging, and is seen as well placed to grab further business in the sector as Chinese chip firms diversify overseas for assembling needs. 'Over the past year or so... I have been advising many businesses from China not to invest in Malaysia if they were merely thinking of rebadging their products via Malaysia to avoid U.S. tariffs,' Malaysia's deputy trade minister Liew Chin Tong told a forum on Monday. He did not specify the types of businesses. Liew said regardless of whether the U.S. had a Democratic or Republican administration, the world's largest economy would impose tariffs, as seen in the solar panel sector. Washington imposed tariffs on solar exports from Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Cambodia — home to factories owned by Chinese firms — last year and expanded them in October following complaints from manufacturers in the United States. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has threatened to slap an additional 10% tariff on all Chinese imports when he takes office on Jan. 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-urges-chinese-firms-to-avoid-using-it-to-dodge-us-tariffs-/7883903.html	2024-12-02T03:54:02-08:00	
Guinea stadium crush kills 56 people after disputed refereeing decision	CONAKRY, Guinea — A controversial refereeing decision sparked violence and a crush at a soccer match in southeast Guinea, killing 56 people according to a provisional toll, the government said on Monday. The fatalities occurred during the final of a tournament in honor of Guinea's military leader Mamady Doumbouya at a stadium in Nzerekore, one of the nation's largest cities. Some fans threw stones, triggering panic and a crush, the government statement said, promising an investigation. A video authenticated by Reuters showed dozens of people scrambling over high walls to escape. Speaking on condition of anonymity, an official from the city's administration said many victims were minors caught in the turmoil after police started firing tear gas. The official described scenes of confusion and chaos with some parents retrieving bodies before they were officially counted. Videos and pictures shared online showed victims lined up on the ground. In one video, over a dozen inert bodies could be seen, several of them children. Reuters was not immediately able to verify that footage. Opposition group National Alliance for Change and Democracy said authorities bore responsibility for organizing tournaments to bolster political support for Doumbouya in contravention of a transition charter prior to a promised presidential election. There was no immediate response from the military junta to that accusation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/guinea-stadium-crush-kills-56-people-after-disputed-refereeing-decision/7883830.html	2024-12-02T02:56:26-08:00	
Germany announces Ukraine military aid as chancellor makes Kyiv visit	German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged $680 million in military aid for Ukraine as he pledged support for the country during a visit Monday to Kyiv. Scholz said Ukraine can rely on Germany, and that his visit was meant to reinforce that commitment. He said the new military equipment is set to be delivered to Ukraine this month. The visit comes amid questions about future Western aid for Ukraine with the United States set to go through a change of leadership in January. Ukraine’s military said Monday it shot down 52 of 110 drones that Russian forces launched in attacks overnight. The intercepts took place over the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kyiv, Poltava, Sumy, Vinnytsia and Zhytomyr regions, the air force said. Viacheslav Negoda, the head of the military administration of Ternopil region, said on Telegram that Russian attacks killed one person and injured several others. Officials in Cherkasy said falling drone debris damaged several residential buildings. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses shot down 15 Ukrainian aerial drones. The ministry said it destroyed drones over the Kursk, Bryansk and Belgorod regions, and over Russia-occupied Crimea.

Philippines' Marcos says presence of Russian submarine 'very worrisome'	Manila, Philippines — President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. said on Monday the presence of a Russian attack submarine in the Philippines' exclusive economic zone (EEZ) in the South China Sea was 'very worrisome.' 'That’s very concerning. Any intrusion into the West Philippine Sea, of our EEZ, of our baselines, is very worrisome,' Marcos told reporters, referring to part of the South China Sea within the Philippines' maritime zone. A Russian Kilo-class submarine was sighted 80 nautical miles off the western province of Occidental Mindoro on Nov. 28, Navy spokesperson Roy Vincent Trinidad said in a statement on Monday, confirming a report by the Philippine Daily Inquirer newspaper. Philippine navy frigate Jose Rizal established radio contact with the Russian submarine, which confirmed its identity as UFA 490 and its intent. 'The Russian vessel stated it was awaiting improved weather conditions before proceeding to Vladivostok, Russia,' Trinidad said, without elaborating on why it was in the area. Philippine naval forces escorted the submarine to ensure compliance with maritime regulations, he added. Russia's embassy in Manila could not immediately be reached for comment. Russia's Kilo-class submarines are considered some of the quietest submarines and have been constantly refined since the 1980s. China and Russia declared a 'no limits' partnership when Russian President Vladimir Putin visited Beijing in 2022, just days before Moscow launched its invasion of Ukraine. The two countries carried out live-fire naval exercises in the South China Sea in July. Tensions between Manila, a U.S. treaty ally, and Beijing have escalated over the past year due to overlapping claims in the South China Sea. A 2016 arbitral tribunal ruled China's historical claims to the disputed waterway had no basis, a decision Beijing rejects.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-marcos-says-presence-of-russian-submarine-very-worrisome-/7883723.html	2024-12-01T23:18:18-08:00	
Nine Volkswagen plants to strike as labor battle escalates	BERLIN — Workers at nine Volkswagen car and component plants across Germany will strike for several hours on Monday, IG Metall union said, bringing assembly lines to a halt as labor and management clash over the future of the carmaker's German operations. Thousands are expected to gather at the carmaker's headquarters in Wolfsburg. Demonstrations are also expected at the Hanover plant, which employs around 14,000 people, and other component and auto plants including Emden, Salzgitter, and Brunswick. The strikes, which could escalate into 24-hour or unlimited strikes if a deal is not struck in the next round of wage negotiations, will put a dent in Volkswagen's output at a time when the carmaker is already facing declining deliveries and plunging profit. 'How long and how intensive this confrontation needs to be is Volkswagen's responsibility at the negotiating table,' Groeger said on Sunday. A company spokesperson on Sunday said the carmaker respected workers' right to strike and had taken steps to ensure a basic level of supplies to customers and minimize the strike's impact. The union last week proposed measures it said would save $1.6 billion, including forgoing bonuses for 2025 and 2026, which Europe's top carmaker dismissed. Volkswagen has demanded a 10% wage cut, arguing it needs to slash costs and boost profit to defend market share. The company is also threatening to close plants in Germany, a first in its 87-year history. An agreement not to stage walkouts ended on Saturday, enabling workers to carry out strikes from Sunday across VW AG's German plants. The labor union called on employees of the plants housed under subsidiary Volkswagen Sachsen GmbH, which include VW's EV-only plant Zwickau, to strike on both Monday and Tuesday. Negotiations will continue on Dec. 9 over a new labor agreement, with unions vowing to resist any proposals that do not provide a long-term plan for every VW plant.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nine-volkswagen-plants-to-strike-as-labor-battle-escalates/7883718.html	2024-12-01T23:01:54-08:00	
Georgia police fire tear gas to scatter protesters, Russian agencies say	TBILISI, Georgia — Police in Georgia fired water cannon and tear gas to disperse protesters in Tbilisi, the capital, who opposed the government's decision to suspend talks on joining the European Union, while some were detained, Russian agencies said on Monday. Thousands of protesters had taken to the streets for several days in the nation of 3.7 million, accusing the ruling Georgian Dream party of pursuing increasingly authoritarian, anti-Western and pro-Russian policies. Police ended hours of standoff early on Monday by moving demonstrators away from the parliament building and down the central Rustaveli Avenue towards the Tbilisi opera house and began erecting barricades with any material they could find. Amid skirmishes with police, the demonstrators were forced off the avenue as they tossed fireworks at law enforcement officers, who responded with volleys of water cannon and tear gas, Russian agencies said. After months of rising tension, the crisis has worsened since Thursday's announcement that the government would freeze EU talks for four years, with pro-EU demonstrators facing off against police. It was not immediately clear how many protesters were detained early on Monday, when Russia's Interfax news agency said only a small group was left near a metro station. It said 113 police officers were injured during the Tbilisi protests of the last few days, citing the Georgian interior (home) ministry. On Sunday, four opposition groups urged protesters to demand paid leave from their jobs in order to attend protests, as provided by labor law, and asked employers to permit time off. Georgia's pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili called for pressure to be brought on the Constitutional Court to annul elections last month won by Georgian Dream. Both the opposition and Zourabichvili say the poll was rigged. The European Union and the United States said they were alarmed by what they see as Georgia's shift away from a pro-Western path back towards Russia's orbit. Georgian Dream says it is acting to defend the country's sovereignty against outside interference.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-police-fire-tear-gas-to-scatter-protesters-russian-agencies-say/7883708.html	2024-12-01T22:53:16-08:00	
Indonesia, Canada sign comprehensive economic partnership	JAKARTA, Indonesia — Indonesia and Canada on Monday signed a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) that aims to strengthen economic ties between the two G20 members, three years after negotiations began. The agreement will take effect in 2026 and was signed in Jakarta by trade ministers of both countries. Indonesia's trade minister, Budi Santoso, said Indonesia appreciated Canada's support for its plan to prioritize its critical minerals sector, which was vital for its sustainable growth. 'Together, we advance sustainable critical mineral management, supporting Indonesia's net zero target by 2060, and fostering Canadian investment while driving green growth in both nations,' he told a joint press conference. Indonesia has rich deposits of tin, copper and bauxite, among others, and is the world's largest source of nickel ore. It is seeking to extract more value from the minerals by attracting investment into its processing and in the manufacturing of electric vehicle batteries. The United States in July said it had approached Indonesia about joining a multinational mineral security partnership aimed at speeding up development of sustainable critical mineral supply chains. Indonesia also made an agreement with Britain in September to collaborate on critical minerals. Two-way trade between Indonesia and Canada was $3.4 billion last year, according to with Indonesia's trade ministry. Canada has estimated bilateral trade at $5.1 billion in 2023. Canada's main exports to Indonesia were agriculture products fertilizers, while Indonesia mainly exported machinery and electrical machinery as well as garments and footwear. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto met during the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) leaders' summit in Peru last month. Prabowo at the time said he was looking for more cooperation on fisheries, manufacturing and renewable energy sectors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-canada-sign-comprehensive-economic-partnership/7883711.html	2024-12-01T22:48:50-08:00	
Serbia rejects responsibility for a water supply explosion in Kosovo as tensions rise	BELGRADE, Serbia — Serbia on Sunday rejected any responsibility for a powerful explosion that temporarily cut water and power supplies to large swathes of neighboring Kosovo, with Serbia's president claiming such accusations are part of a 'hybrid' warfare against his country. Kosovo officials said police had arrested eight people after an explosion on Friday in the northern Serb-populated part of the state hit a canal that sends water to its two main power plants. Pristina called it a 'terrorist act' conducted by Serbia. Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic rejected those accusations. 'On Friday, there was an attempt of a large hybrid attack on our country,' Vucic said. 'Belgrade and Serbia have nothing to do with those events.' The populist Serbian leader suggested Kosovo was behind the attack but said he would refrain from directly accusing Kosovo Prime Minister Albin Kurti pending an investigation conducted by Belgrade. 'I will not say that Kurti directly ordered the attack,' Vucic said. 'The investigation will show, we have certain suspicions. We believe we have certain findings who could be the perpetrator.' 'During that so-called anti-terrorist operation, Kurti's special forces occupied new intersections and streets, harassing Serbs, and it was all a show for the international public,' Vucic said. Kosovar Prime Minister Albin Kurti said the recent attacks in Kosovo — on a water canal, town hall building and police station — were correlated with the recent attacks from Russia in Ukraine. 'That attack has correlation with the massive air attacks of the Russian Federation against Ukraine, attacks which targeted energy infrastructure in Ukraine,' he said at a news conference on Sunday. Kosovo police have raided 10 locations in the north, confiscating more than 200 military uniforms, six shoulder-fired rocket launchers, long weapons, pistols and ammunition, they said. About 15 to 20 kilograms (30 to 45 pounds) of explosives were used to damage the critical infrastructure, according to Kosovo police chief Gazmend Hoxha. Police also found many emblems of the Russian special forces and Russian empire flags, according to Kurti, adding that 'Serbia is copying Russian methods to threaten Kosovo and the region in general.' The explosion has further fueled tensions between the two Balkan states. Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008, which is not recognized by Belgrade. Most of the Serb minority living in Kosovo still consider Belgrade as their capital. The European Union and the United States strongly denounced the explosion and demanded that the perpetrators are brought to justice.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbia-rejects-responsibility-for-a-water-supply-explosion-in-kosovo-as-tensions-rise/7883670.html	2024-12-01T19:20:04-08:00	
Romanian leftists ahead of resurgent far right in election	BUCHAREST, Romania — Romania's ruling leftist Social Democrats (PSD) looked set to win the most votes in a parliamentary election on Sunday, fending off a resurgent far-right movement that challenges the country's pro-Western orientation, partial results showed. The vote is the second of three consecutive ballots for both a new parliament and a new president, after the first round of the presidential election on Nov. 24 saw an independent far-right candidate, Calin Georgescu, emerge from relative obscurity to become the frontrunner. His unexpected win ushered in support for ultranationalist, hard-right parties, some with overt pro-Russian sympathies, which political analysts said could undermine Romania's support for Ukraine. If final results confirm the preliminary count, a pro-Western coalition led by the PSD would likely have enough seats in parliament to form a government, although the far right would be a substantial force in the legislature. However, a broad coalition would be difficult to form amid disagreements over reforms and measures needed to rein in the country's gaping budget deficit, now the highest in the EU at 8% of economic output. Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University, said the PSD would likely play a central part in any coalition talks. But the results pointed to 'the most fragmented political spectrum since 1990,' he said, in a reflection of deepening social divisions in Romania, which has some of the EU's poorest regions. With 90% of votes counted, the PSD won 23.9% of votes, ahead of the hard-right Alliance for Uniting Romanians with 17.9%. Lasconi's centrist opposition Save Romania Union (USR) had 11.1%, while the junior ruling coalition ally Liberals had 14.6%. Two far-right groupings, SOS and POT, had 7.2% and 5.8%, respectively, and the ethnic Hungarian Party UDMR got 7%. After a campaign dominated by voters' concerns over budget problems and the cost of living, the election pitted the far-right contenders against pro-European mainstream parties that have angered their voters with infighting and corruption allegations. Far-right parties have also used Romania's championing of Ukraine to stoke fears the war could spill over the border unless the country halts its support, as well as resentment over alleged preferential treatment for refugees from Ukraine. Romania has the EU's biggest share of the population at risk of poverty, and swathes of the country need investment to attract jobs. 'I am not voting for any party which has been in parliament before. It is an elimination vote,' Marian Gheorghe, a cab driver, said. 'I have children, and I am tired of telling them 'No' because I can't afford what they need.' 'Where is the justice? Why are Romanian children less than Ukrainian children?' she asked. Social Democrat Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu had ranked third in the presidential ballot first round. The PSD will meet on Monday to decide the terms under which it will negotiate a governing majority, PSD European MP Victor Negrescu said. 'The Social Democrats will take a few days and wait to be courted,' said political commentator Radu Magdin. 'A coalition with centrist parties is more likely than with the hot potato extremists. And much depends on who becomes president.' Who gets to form the government will depend on who wins the presidential election, since the president designates a prime minister, and the timeline for that is unclear. Romania's top court on Friday postponed a decision on whether to annul the first round of the presidential vote until Dec. 2, after the shock result caused suspicions of interference in the campaign. Romanian authorities say they have found evidence of meddling by hostile actors, and the Constitutional Court is yet to validate the results. The court has ordered a recount of the 9.46 million votes cast in the first round, while also considering a request to annul the first-round vote. If a rerun is decided, the first round of voting in the presidential election could take place on Dec. 15 and the runoff could be on Dec. 29.	https://www.voanews.com/a/romanian-leftists-ahead-of-resurgent-far-right-in-election/7883667.html	2024-12-01T19:12:55-08:00	
Catholic church calls on president of El Salvador not to lift ban on gold mining	SAN SALVADOR, El Salvador — The Roman Catholic Church called on the president of El Salvador Sunday not to lift the country's ban on gold mining. Archbishop Jose Luis Escobar Alas asked President Nayib Bukele not to reverse the ban, which has been in place since 2017. 'It will damage this country forever,' Msgr. Escobar Alas said in a homily. That view has also been voiced by civic and environmental groups. On Wednesday, Bukele called the 7-year-old ban on metals mining 'absurd,' and claimed unmined gold would be 'wealth that could transform El Salvador,' in comments on the social platform X. Bukele's party controls El Salvador's Congress by a wide margin and his political opposition has been devastated, so a formal proposal to end the ban is unlikely to meet much resistance. In 2017, El Salvador banned all metals mining above ground and below. A broad coalition of sectors, including the Catholic church, supported the prohibition in order to protect the small country's water resources from contamination. At that point, exploration had revealed deposits of gold and silver, but there was no large-scale metal mining. It's unclear what its gold reserves could be. Bukele on Wednesday proposed 'modern and sustainable' mining that would care for the environment. Environmentalists quickly criticized the president's boosterism. 'It's not true that there's green mining, it's paid for with lives, kidney, respiratory problems and leukemia that aren't immediate,' said Amalia López with the Alliance Against the Privatization of Water. Their concerns include the amount of water needed for mining operations and the storage of water contaminated with heavy metals. It marks a reversal for the highly popular and recently reelected Bukele, who during his first campaign for the presidency in 2019 said he supported the mining ban.	https://www.voanews.com/a/catholic-church-calls-on-president-of-el-salvador-not-to-lift-ban-on-gold-mining/7883656.html	2024-12-01T18:39:23-08:00	
Ireland's incumbent parties look likely to hang on to power after a fractured election	DUBLIN — Ireland's two long-dominant center-right parties looked likely to form a new government as results came in Sunday from a fractured national election, though with a reduced vote share and complex coalition negotiations ahead. In an exception to the global anti-incumbent mood, outgoing governing parties Fianna Fail and Fine Gael took the two largest shares of the vote, narrowly ahead of left-of-center opposition Sinn Fein. Under Ireland's system of proportional representation, vote share does not translate neatly into seats in parliament. With about two-thirds of results declared, Fianna Fail was on course to be the biggest party in the 174-seat Dáil, the lower house of parliament, with Fine Gael and Sinn Fein battling for second place. It's certain that no party will have enough seats to govern on its own, and the most likely outcome is a coalition between Fianna Fail, led by Micheál Martin, and Fine Gael under outgoing Prime Minister Simon Harris. In that case either Harris or Martin — or possibly both, if they strike a job-sharing deal — will become Ireland's next premier, known as the taoiseach. Sinn Fein, which aims to reunify the Republic of Ireland with the U.K. territory of Northern Ireland, lacks a clear path to power because the other two parties say they won't work with it, partly because of its historic ties with the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Ireland uses a complex system of proportional representation in which each of the country's 43 constituencies elects several lawmakers and voters rank candidates in order of preference. As a result, it can take days for full results to be known. 'The people of Ireland have now spoken,' Harris said. 'We now have to work out exactly what they have said, and that is going to take a little bit of time.' The cost of living — especially Ireland's acute housing crisis — was a dominant topic in the three-week campaign, alongside immigration, which has become an emotive and challenging issue in a country of 5.4 million people long defined by emigration. The results of Friday's election mean Ireland has partly bucked the global trend of incumbents being rejected by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures. The next government, like the last, will likely be led by two parties that have dominated Irish politics for the past century. Fine Gael and Fianna Fail have similar policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland's 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat, they formed a coalition, propped up by the Green Party. The Greens had a devastating result, losing all but one of their 12 seats. This time, the winning parties may turn to left-leaning Labour or the Social Democrats, or to independent lawmakers, for support. For all the focus on migration, anti-immigration independents made few breakthroughs. Ireland does not have a significant far-right party to capitalize on the issue. Reelected Fine Gael lawmaker Paschal Donohoe said the main theme of the election was 'the center holding.' Nonetheless, the new government will face huge pressure to ease rising homelessness, driven by soaring rents and property prices, and to better absorb a growing number of asylum-seekers. The big parties' share of the vote continues to decline, and voter disaffection expressed itself in support for small parties and independent candidates. One of the more unorthodox independents was reputed organized crime boss Gerry 'the Monk' Hutch, who saw a groundswell of support after he was bailed on money-laundering charges in Spain in November in order to run for election. Hutch, who last year was acquitted of killing a gangland rival, came within a whisker of winning a seat in Dublin.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ireland-s-incumbent-parties-look-likely-to-hang-on-to-power-after-a-fractured-election-/7883643.html	2024-12-01T18:26:06-08:00	
Big Ten fines Michigan and Ohio State $100,000 each for postgame melee	ROSEMONT, Ill. — The Big Ten Conference announced it fined Michigan and Ohio State $100,000 each for violating the conference's sportsmanship policy for the on-field melee at the end of the Wolverines' win in Columbus on Saturday. 'Not only did the actions of both teams violate fundamental elements of sportsmanship such as respect and civility, the nature of the incident also jeopardized the safety of participants and bystanders,' the Big Ten said in a statement Sunday. A fight broke out at midfield after the Wolverines' 13-10 victory when Michigan players attempted to plant their flag on the OSU logo and were confronted by the Buckeyes. Police used pepper spray to break up the players, who threw punches and shoves. One officer suffered a head injury when he was 'knocked down and trampled while trying to separate players fighting,' a police union official said. The officer was taken to a hospital and has since been released. After the Ohio State players confronted their rivals at midfield, defensive end Jack Sawyer grabbed the top of the Wolverines' flag and ripped it off the pole as the brawl moved toward the Michigan bench. 'We respect the Big Ten Conference's decision in this matter,' Ohio State said in a statement. 'What happened post-game yesterday was unfortunate. Good sportsmanship is always important in everything we do at Ohio State. Moving forward, we will continue to examine and address our post-game protocols to ensure our student-athletes, coaches, visiting teams and staff safely exit the field.' Ohio State police said in a statement that 'multiple officers representing Ohio and Michigan deployed pepper spray.' Michigan players could be seen rubbing their eyes after exposure to the chemical irritant. Michigan coach Sherrone Moore said after the game both teams could have handled the situation differently. 'So much emotions on both sides,' he said. 'Rivalry games get heated, especially this one. It's the biggest one in the country, so we got to handle that better.' A Michigan athletic department spokesman said Sunday night the football program would have no comment beyond the team's remarks Saturday. The scuffle was one of many that broke out Saturday in rivalry games across the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/big-ten-fines-michigan-and-ohio-state-100-000-each-for-postgame-melee/7883647.html	2024-12-01T18:13:43-08:00	
Biden pardons his son Hunter despite previous pledges not to	Washington — President Joe Biden has pardoned his son Hunter sparing the younger Biden a possible prison sentence for federal felony gun and tax convictions and reversing his past promises not to use the extraordinary powers of the presidency for the benefit of his family members. The Democratic president had previously said he would not pardon his son or commute his sentence after his convictions in the two cases in Delaware and California. The move comes weeks before Hunter Biden was set to receive his punishment after his trial conviction in the gun case and guilty plea on tax charges, and less than two months before President-elect Donald Trump is set to return to the White House. It caps a long-running legal saga for the president’s son, who publicly disclosed he was under federal investigation in December 2020 — a month after Joe Biden’s 2020 victory. In June, as Hunter Biden was facing trial in the gun case in Delaware, the president ruled out a pardon or clemency for his son in an interview with ABC News. As recently as Nov. 8, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre ruled out a pardon or clemency for the younger Biden, saying, 'We’ve been asked that question multiple times. Our answer stands, which is no.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-pardons-his-son-hunter-despite-previous-pledges-not-to/7883629.html	2024-12-01T16:52:09-08:00	
Wars, regional tensions boost sales for major arms suppliers	Stockholm — Sales by major arms suppliers were boosted last year by the wars in Ukraine and Gaza and tensions in Asia, with marked increases for manufacturers based in Russia and the Middle East, according to a report published Monday. Sales of arms and military services by the world's 100 largest arms companies totaled $632 billion last year, up 4.2%, the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI) said. They had declined in 2022 due to the inability of these global giants to meet the increase in demand, but many of them managed to restart their production in 2023, according to the report. As a sign of this strong surge in demand, these 100 companies, for the first time, all individually achieved a turnover of more than a billion dollars last year. 'There has been a marked increase in arms sales in 2023, and this trend is expected to continue in 2024,' Lorenzo Scarazzato, a researcher at SIPRI's program on military expenditure and arms production, was quoted as saying in a statement. Sales of the world's top 100 groups 'do not yet fully reflect the scale of demand and many companies have launched recruitment campaigns, showing their optimism for the future,' he adds. Smaller producers have been more efficient in meeting this new demand linked to the wars in Gaza and Ukraine, growing tensions in East Asia and rearmament programs in other regions, SIPRI points out. 'Many of them specialize in one component or build systems that require a single supply chain,' allowing them to react more quickly, Nan Tian, director of the military spending program, told AFP. As the world's leading producers, American groups recorded a 2.5% increase in their sales in 2023 and still represent half of global arms revenues, with 41 American companies among the top 100 in the world. Lockheed Martin and RTX (formerly Raytheon Technologies), the two largest arms groups in the world, recorded a drop in their sales. 'They often rely on complex, multi-tiered supply chains, making them vulnerable to the supply chain challenges that have persisted into 2023,' Nan Tian says. Bond of Russian Rostec Europe, with 27 groups, only posted a 0.2% increase in sales last year, which masks a dual reality. European groups manufacturing complex weapons systems were still working on old contracts last year, which does not reflect the influx of orders recorded since then. Other groups, on the other hand, 'saw their turnover increase substantially, driven by demand linked to the war in Ukraine', notably for munitions, artillery and air defense systems and land systems, writes SIPRI. The figures for Russia, although incomplete, show the effects of an economy largely geared toward war. Sales of the two Russian groups in the ranking showed a 40% increase, mainly due to the 49% increase in sales of the state conglomerate Rostec, according to SIPRI. Manufacturers in the Middle East were buoyed by the war in Ukraine and the first months of the Israeli offensive on Gaza in October 2023. The three Israeli manufacturers in the ranking posted record sales of $13.6 billion, while the three groups based in Turkey, such as drone producer Baykar, saw their sales jump by 24%, supported by the war in Ukraine and Turkey's desire to develop its defense. The general rearmament in Asia is particularly evident in the sales increases of the four South Korean manufacturers and the five Japanese weapons’ makers, with the nine Chinese producers marking time against a backdrop of a 'slow economy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/wars-regional-tensions-boost-sales-for-major-arms-suppliers/7883623.html	2024-12-01T16:32:49-08:00	
Trump appoints Lebanese American Massad Boulos as Middle East adviser	Washington — Donald Trump announced on Sunday that he had appointed American Lebanese businessman Massad Boulos, the father of one of his sons-in-law, as his Middle East adviser. 'Massad is a skilled negotiator and a steadfast advocate for PEACE in the Middle East. He will be a staunch defender of the United States and its interests,' Trump wrote on Truth Social, as the conflict between Israel and Hamas has been plaguing the region for more than a year. A longtime Republican, Boulos built his fortune selling automobiles in Nigeria. The 2022 marriage of his son Michael Boulos to Donald Trump’s daughter Tiffany propelled him into the newly elected billionaire’s inner circle. Boulos took an active part in the presidential campaign, working to convince the Arab community in some key states to vote for Trump. 'Massad is an accomplished lawyer and a highly respected business leader with extensive experience on the international stage,' the president-elect, who is due to take office on January 20, said. A Maronite Christian, Boulos had tried to get elected as a parliamentarian in Lebanon, without success. During the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly said he would end the conflict between Israel and Hamas, without ever revealing a plan to do so. Boulos had explained in October that he shared the same philosophy. Israel 'has military objectives to achieve, namely to get rid of Hamas' infrastructure and its capacity to launch new attacks,' he said in an interview with Sky News. But 'they have to do it very quickly. (...), It cannot last forever,' he added. His appointment comes days after a ceasefire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah, a Lebanese Shiite Islamist movement allied with Hamas and Iran. This truce in Lebanon gives hope for progress in the Middle East to the administration of Joe Biden, still in power for a few weeks. In the wake of the Lebanon deal, the United States is 'actively' working toward a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, Jake Sullivan, the current White House national security adviser, said Sunday. But 'we're not there yet,' he said. On Saturday, Trump also named Charles Kushner, the father of his other son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who is married to Ivanka Trump, as U.S. ambassador to France. An unusual choice for a diplomatic role: Kushner spent a year in federal prison for tax fraud before being pardoned by Trump toward the end of his first term in the White House.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-appoints-lebanese-american-massad-boulos-as-middle-east-adviser/7883617.html	2024-12-01T16:21:05-08:00	
Art collection on 1930s Soviet-engineered famine gifted to Ukraine	The late American businessman Morgan Williams was deeply involved in promoting Ukrainian business as president of the US-Ukraine Business Council. During his time in Ukraine, Williams began collecting artwork related to the Holodomor, a famine engineered by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin in the early 1930’s that killed millions. Now, all that artwork has a home. Hanna Tverdokhlib has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

Taiwan's president meets Hawaii's governor, others in visit China condemns	Honululu, Hawaii — On a two-day visit to Hawaii, Taiwan’s president Lai Ching-te met with the state's governor and congressional representatives as part of a Pacific island tour that has already triggered criticism from Beijing. On Sunday, China’s Foreign Ministry said it 'strongly condemned' U.S. support for Lai’s visit and had lodged a complaint with the U.S. It also denounced a newly announced U.S. weapons sale to Taiwan, a self-governing island that China claims as its own territory. 'China will closely monitor the situation’s development and take resolute and forceful measures to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and territorial integrity,' said the statement. Hawaii was Lai's first stop on a weeklong voyage that will later take him to the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau. They account for three of the 12 countries Taipei has formal diplomatic relations with. Hawaii's Gov. Josh Green on Saturday hosted Lai at the state's emergency management agency where they discussed disaster preparedness. Green, who was a longtime emergency room physician before becoming governor, posted on social media that he and Lai discussed how their experiences in health care informed their governance. Lai is also a physician by training and obtained a Master of Public Health degree from Harvard University. 'Together, we extended a warm aloha to Lai and his delegation, highlighting Hawai'i’s shared values of resilience and collaboration with Taiwan,' Green said in an Instagram post. Lai also visited Bishop Museum, Hawaii’s leading museum of natural history and Native Hawaiian culture. In the evening, Lai posed for photos with Hawaii congressional representatives and state lawmakers at a dinner banquet with the Taiwanese American community. U.S. Rep. Ed Case, a Democrat who represents Honolulu in Congress, said on social media that he told the audience that 'our ties endured on shared values and interests to advance mutual goals and meet shared challenges.' It is unclear whether Lai with meet with any senior officials from the Biden administration or anyone from the incoming Trump administration during his Hawaii stay. President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S. Trump evaded answering whether he would defend the island from Chinese military action. The new arms deal announced by the U.S. State Department Friday includes $385 million in spare parts and equipment for a fleet of F-16s, as well as support for a tactical communication system to Taiwan. The U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act but maintains a position of strategic ambiguity over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by China. Former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen drew vocal opposition from China when she stopped in New York last year on her way to Latin America. Tsai met with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the time. The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a 'stern warning' over what it called collusion between 'separatists and foreign forces' days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped over in the U.S. China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting the island as it views any official contact with foreign governments and Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-president-meets-hawaii-s-governor-others-in-visit-china-condemns/7883373.html	2024-12-01T15:04:48-08:00	
Biden has AIDS Memorial Quilt at White House, observing World AIDS Day	Washington — President Joe Biden on Sunday had the AIDS Memorial Quilt spread on the White House South Lawn for the first time in observance of World AIDS Day. Gathered with the president and his wife, Jill, were survivors, family members and advocates to memorialize the lives lost to the epidemic. The president emphasized the federal government's support for the 1.2 million people in the United States living with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which can lead to AIDS. 'This movement is fully woven into the fabric and history of America,' Biden said. 'For all the lives lost, for all those that are still alive, look at what you’ve already done to change the hearts and minds, to save lives across the country and around the world. That's the power of this movement.' There were 124 sections of the quilt on the lawn to commemorate people who died due to AIDS-related illnesses. Conceived in 1985, the quilt made its first public appearance in 1987. There was also a red ribbon, a symbol of support and awareness for those with HIV and AIDS, draped across the South Portico of the White House. There are 40 million people around the world with HIV, according to the White House. Introducing Biden was Jeanne White-Ginder, whose son, Ryan White, contracted AIDS through a tainted blood transfusion at the age of 13 and died in 1990 at the age of 18. She said her son's experience taught America that 'we needed to fight AIDS and not the people who have it.' The Ryan White CARE Act became law in 1990, and White-Grinder recalled being at the U.S. Capitol to speak for the measure and met Biden when he was a senator from Delaware. The president also saluted Dr. Anthony Fauci, the top U.S. infectious disease expert until leaving the government in 2022, Fauci was in attendance at the event as he worked to treat AIDS, though he's known by much of the country for his efforts to address the coronavirus pandemic that made him a target of criticism by many Republican lawmakers. The Biden administration has sought to make investments to stop the epidemic, and the stigmas attached to people with HIV. Among other steps, it has worked to expand access to PrEP, or the pre-exposure prophylaxis, which at-risk populations use to prevent HIV infections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-has-aids-memorial-quilt-at-white-house-observing-world-aids-day/7883367.html	2024-12-01T14:37:28-08:00	
Bus crash near French ski resort kills 2 people, injures 33	Madrid — A bus crashed Sunday evening near a ski resort in southern France, killing at least two people and injuring 33 others, local authorities said. A total of 47 people including the driver were on the bus when it crashed near the Porte-Puymorens ski resort, the regional administration said. Seven people were in critical condition. Local authorities said a preliminary investigation showed the bus ran into a cliff, but the exact circumstances that may have resulted in such a collision were not immediately clear. Images released by the local firefighter service showed the bus pressed against the side of a cliff, its right side partially crushed, and the windshield was apparently knocked out. More than 120 individuals were involved in the high-altitude rescue effort, including from neighboring Catalonia in Spain and Andorra. Four rescue helicopters were also deployed to the accident scene some 2,000 meters (6,500 feet) in the French Pyrenees mountains. Catalonia's emergency services said on social media platform X, formerly Twitter, that the bus originated from L’Hospitalet de Llobregat, outside Barcelona, Spain. A holiday center in Porte-Puymorens resort was opened to house the surviving passengers. The local ski resort has not opened yet because of a lack of snow. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/bus-crash-near-french-ski-resort-porte-puymorens/7883364.html	2024-12-01T14:24:56-08:00	
Trump nominates former aide Kash Patel to head FBI	Donald Trump’s nomination of Kash Patel, a loyalist of the U.S. president-elect, to be director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation has added to the list of Trump’s unconventional appointments to top-level jobs in his nascent administration. Trump named Patel, 44, to lead the country’s top criminal investigative agency on late Saturday, saying he 'is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and ‘America First’ fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending justice, and protecting the American people.' Patel held three defense, intelligence and national security posts in the first Trump administration but has endeared himself to the incoming chief executive by vowing to clean out the 'deep state' at the FBI. He also said he would launch a campaign of retribution against Trump’s adversaries, including FBI agents who have investigated the once-and-future president, journalists and others. During his first term, Trump suggested naming Patel as the deputy FBI director, but then-Attorney General William Barr, now a Trump critic, said the appointment would only occur 'over my dead body.' Patel has vowed to close the FBI headquarters in Washington and dispatch many of its agents across the country to fight crime, not launch more intelligence-gathering operations. Trump’s first hurdle in installing Patel as the FBI director is that there already is an FBI director, Christopher Wray, who was appointed by Trump and whose 10-year term extends to 2027. Trump would have to fire Wray or Wray would have to resign before Patel could take over. FBI directors are appointed to decade-long terms by design, so that their tenures and investigative directives are not subject to the political whims of the moment. But Trump already fired one FBI director, James Comey, in 2017, before naming Wray. Trump says the FBI is 'badly broken' and has 'lost the confidence of America.' Patel faces a Senate confirmation hearing and is likely to face tough questioning about how he would run the agency and oversee its more than 10,000 criminal investigative agents and another 25,000 staff members. Patel’s appointment comes on top of other unconventional Trump appointments: vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to oversee the health and human services department, talk show host Pete Hegseth, a decorated military officer with scant managerial experience, to be the Pentagon chief, and Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic-congresswoman-turned-staunch-Trump-defender, as director of national intelligence. Trump’s first nominee to be attorney general, former Congressman Matt Gaetz, dropped out after eight days as he faced widespread scrutiny of his alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use; charges Gaetz has denied. Some Republican senators praised Patel’s appointment. Republicans will hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate next year, meaning Patel could lose the support of three senators and still be confirmed, with Vice President-elect JD Vance casting the decisive tie-breaking vote if needed. Senator Bill Hagerty, a Tennessee Republican, told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' that Patel 'represents the type of change that we need to see in the FBI. ... The entire agency needs to be cleaned out.' 'There are serious problems at the FBI,' Hagerty said. 'The American public knows it. They expect to see sweeping change, and Kash Patel's just the type of person to do it.' Another Republican senator, Ted Cruz of Texas, said Patel was a 'very strong nominee' and he thought Patel would be confirmed. 'All of the weeping and gnashing of teeth, all the people pulling their hair out, are exactly the people who are dismayed about having a real reformer come into the FBI,' Cruz told CBS' 'Face the Nation.' A third Republican, Senator Mike Rounds of South Dakota, said, 'Every president wants people that are loyal to themselves.' But he called Wray 'a very good man,' adding, 'I don't have any complaints about the way that he's done his job right now.' Democrats are almost certain to oppose the nomination. Senator Chris Murphy told NBC, 'Patel's only qualification is that he agrees with Donald Trump that the Department of Justice should punish, lock up and intimidate Donald Trump's political opponents.' Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-nominates-former-aide-kash-patel-to-head-fbi/7883356.html	2024-12-01T14:06:38-08:00	
Landmark climate change case to open at top UN court	The Hague — The top United Nations court will take up the largest case in its history Monday, when it opens two weeks of hearings into what countries worldwide are legally required to do to combat climate change and help vulnerable nations fight its devastating impact. After years of lobbying by island nations who fear they could simply disappear under rising sea waters, the U.N. General Assembly asked the International Court of Justice last year for an opinion on 'the obligations of States in respect of climate change.' 'We want the court to confirm that the conduct that has wrecked the climate is unlawful,' Margaretha Wewerinke-Singh, who is leading the legal team for the Pacific island nation of Vanuatu, told The Associated Press. In the decade up to 2023, sea levels have risen by a global average of around 4.3 centimeters (1.7 inches), with parts of the Pacific rising higher still. The world has also warmed 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 Fahrenheit) since pre-industrial times because of the burning of fossil fuels. Vanuatu is one of a group of small states pushing for international legal intervention in the climate crisis. 'We live on the front lines of climate change impact. We are witnesses to the destruction of our lands, our livelihoods, our culture and our human rights,' Vanuatu’s climate change envoy Ralph Regenvanu told reporters ahead of the hearing. Any decision by the court would be non-binding advice and unable to directly force wealthy nations into action to help struggling countries. Yet it would be more than just a powerful symbol since it could serve as the basis for other legal actions, including domestic lawsuits. On Sunday, ahead of the hearing, advocacy groups will bring together environmental organizations from around the world. Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change — who first developed the idea of requesting an advisory opinion — together with World Youth for Climate Justice plan an afternoon of speeches, music and discussions. From Monday, the Hague-based court will hear from 99 countries and more than a dozen intergovernmental organizations over two weeks. It’s the largest lineup in the institution’s nearly 80-year history. Last month at the United Nations’ annual climate meeting, countries cobbled together an agreement on how rich countries can support poor countries in the face of climate disasters. Wealthy countries have agreed to pool together at least $300 billion a year by 2035 but the total is short of the $1.3 trillion that experts, and threatened nations, said is needed. 'For our generation and for the Pacific Islands, the climate crisis is an existential threat. It is a matter of survival, and the world’s biggest economies are not taking this crisis seriously. We need the ICJ to protect the rights of people at the front lines,' Vishal Prasad, of Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, told reporters in a briefing. Fifteen judges from around the world will seek to answer two questions: What are countries obliged to do under international law to protect the climate and environment from human-caused greenhouse gas emissions? And what are the legal consequences for governments where their acts, or lack of action, have significantly harmed the climate and environment? The second question refers to 'small island developing States' likely to be hardest hit by climate change and to 'members of 'the present and future generations affected by the adverse effects of climate change.' The judges were even briefed on the science behind rising global temperatures by the U.N.’s climate change body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, ahead of the hearings. The case at the ICJ follows a number of rulings around the world ordering governments to do more to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In May, a U.N. tribunal on maritime law said that carbon emissions qualify as marine pollution, and countries must take steps to adapt to and mitigate their adverse effects. That ruling came a month after Europe’s highest human rights court said that countries must better protect their people from the consequences of climate change, in a landmark judgment that could have implications across the continent. The ICJ’s host country of The Netherlands made history when a court ruled in 2015 that protection from the potentially devastating effects of climate change is a human right and that the government has a duty to protect its citizens. The judgment was upheld in 2019 by the Dutch Supreme Court.	https://www.voanews.com/a/landmark-climate-change-case-to-open-at-top-un-court/7883344.html	2024-12-01T13:21:20-08:00	
Moana 2' has record $221 million opening, Hollywood celebrates moviegoing feast	New York — Christmas came early at the box office this year. 'Moana 2' brought in a tidal wave of moviegoers over the Thanksgiving Day weekend, setting records with $221 million in ticket sales, according to studio estimates Sunday. That, combined with 'Wicked' and 'Gladiator II,' made for an unprecedented weekend in cinemas and a confluence of blockbusters more like what’s often found in late December. Expectations were high for Walt Disney Co.’s 'Moana 2,' but the film — originally planned as a series for Disney+ before it was redirected to the big screen — blew predictions out of the water. Its five-day opening set a new record for Thanksgiving moviegoing. (The previous best was $125 million for 'Frozen 2' in its second week of release in 2019.) 'Moana 2' added $165.3 million internationally; with $386 million worldwide, it's the second-best global launch of the year. At the same time, the sensation of 'Wicked' showed no signs of slowing down. The Universal Pictures musical brought in $117.5 million over the five-day weekend, pushing its two-week global total to $359.2 million. Not accounting for inflation, 'Wicked' is now the highest grossing Broadway adaptation over 'Grease.' (That 1978 film grossed $190 million, but factoring in inflation would put it past $900 million.) 'Gladiator II,' meanwhile, also held well, dipping 44% from its opening weekend. Ridley Scott’s sequel to his Oscar-winning best picture original collected $44 million in its second weekend. While its steep price tag of $250 million will make profitability challenging, 'Gladiator II' has swiftly gathered $320 million worldwide. Those three films drove the overall box office to a record $420 million in overall Thanksgiving weekend ticket sales, according to Comscore — more than $100 million more than ever before. For an industry that has been battered in recent years by the pandemic, work stoppages and the upheaval caused by streaming, it was a triumphant weekend that showed the still-potent power of Hollywood’s blockbuster machine. Before 'Wicked,' 'Moana 2' and 'Gladiator II' arrived in theaters, ticket sales were running about 25% behind pre-pandemic levels. Michael O’Leary, president and chief executive of the National Association of Theater Owners, said the weekend showed what’s possible when 'all the pieces of the puzzle come together' in compelling big-budget movies with marketing muscle. 'We’re very optimistic that this weekend is the start of what we believe is a full-on charge into the future,' he said. 'The remaining quarter of this year looks very promising and then on into 2025 and 2026. We’re hoping next year is the first kind of normal year this industry has had in a long time.' Like the last time such anticipated movies collided on the release calendar — 2023's much-ballyhooed 'Barbenheimer' — the movie industry again could see evidence of a rising moviegoing tide lifting all blockbusters. In recent years, studios have typically tried to space out most of their biggest releases. Earlier this fall, 'Venom: The Last Dance,' for example, was the No. 1 film for three straight weeks, despite not being particularly successful. 'For a long, long time in Hollywood, there’s been a belief that you don’t put big blockbuster movies up against each other,' said O'Leary. 'But the truth of the matter is that competition is good. It’s good for the movies. It’s good for the studios. It’s good for the theater owners. But it’s particularly good for the moviegoing public.' 'Moana 2' was the nexus of a strategy shift for Disney. When it first began development, it was fashioned as a series for streaming. But when Bob Iger returned as chief executive, he reconsidered the balance between theatrical and streaming. The original 'Moana,' after all, was the most streamed movie on Disney+ in 2023, with the added benefit of $680 million in box office in 2016. Only in February this year did Iger announce the release of 'Moana 2,' with Auli’i Cravalho and Dwayne Johnson returning as the voices of Moana and Maui. 'It just shows you that the big screen and small screen are not adversarial. They can be complementary and additive,' says Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst for Comscore. 'Whoever made that decision to go big screen globally with ‘Moana 2,' that was one of the greatest decisions ever.' And it helped lead a resurgence for Walt Disney Co., whose last two animated November releases — 'Strange World' and 'Wish' — fizzled in theaters. 'Moana 2' may become the third $1 billion-grossing movie for the studio in 2024, along with 'Inside Out 2' and 'Deadpool & Wolverine.' Though reviews for 'Moana 2' have only been 65% 'fresh' on Rotten Tomatoes, audiences gave it an 'A-' CinemaScore. 'Moana 2' is also part of a major rebound for family moviegoing. According to David A. Gross, a film consultant who publishes a newsletter for Franchise Entertainment, family moviegoing in 2024 is going to account for approximately $6.8 billion in ticket sales, roughly the sums of 2022 and 2023, combined. After such large debuts, 'Moana 2' and 'Wicked' are likely to continue to drive moviegoing through December. The only question will be if this year's Christmas movies — historically a much bigger holiday period for theaters — can come anywhere near the Thanksgiving lineup. Among the movies aiming for that holiday corridor are Disney's 'Mufasa: The Lion King,' Paramount's 'Sonic the Hedgehog 3' and Searchlight's 'A Complete Unknown,' with Timothee Chalamet as a young Bob Dylan. Final domestic figures will be released Monday. Estimated ticket sales for Friday through Sunday at U.S. and Canadian theaters, according to Comscore: 1. 'Moana 2,' $135 million. 2. 'Wicked,' $80 million. 3. 'Gladiator II' $30.7 million. 4. 'Red One,' $12.9 million. 5. 'The Best Christmas Pageant Ever,' $3.3 million. 6. 'Bonhoeffer: Pastor. Spy. Assassin,' $2.4 million. 7. 'Venom: The Last Dance,' $2.2 million. 8. 'Heretic,' $956,797. 9. 'The Wild Robot,' $670,000. 10. 'A Real Pain,' $665,000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moana-2-has-record-221-million-opening-hollywood-celebrates-moviegoing-feast-/7883326.html	2024-12-01T12:32:38-08:00	
Storm Bora floods homes, streets in Greek island of Rhodes	Athens, Greece — Torrential rains flooded homes, businesses and roads in the popular Greek tourist island of Rhodes on Sunday, forcing authorities to temporarily ban the use of vehicles as Storm Bora pounded the country for a second day. On Saturday, a man died in flash floods which hit another Greek island in the northern Aegean. The fire service received more than 650 calls to pump water out of flooded buildings on Rhodes island and evacuated 80 people to safer ground, with the city of Ialysos hit the hardest. No injuries were reported. Cars and debris were piled up high in the flooded streets of Rhodes, with residents trying to remove mud from their water-logged properties. 'The situation is tragic, some have lost their homes, some have fled, our cars are in a terrible condition,' said Sofia Kanelli in Ialysos. Fire brigade spokesperson Vassilis Varthakogiannis told Greece's SKAI TV that the bad weather would continue Monday. The Mediterranean country has been ravaged by floods and wildfires in recent years, with scientists saying that Greece has become a 'hot spot' for climate change. 'The conditions in recent years are different; we have sudden rainfall and sudden floods,' Varthakogiannis said. In 2023, more than 20,000 tourists and locals were forced to flee homes and seaside hotels as wildfires burned for days. Thunderstorms and heavy rain also interrupted train services in mainland Greece, especially in the center and north of the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-bora-floods-homes-streets-in-greek-island-of-rhodes/7883303.html	2024-12-01T11:37:42-08:00	
Mali says army drone strike killed senior rebel commander, others	Bamako, Mali — Mali's government said Sunday it had killed a senior Tuareg rebel commander and other rebels in a drone strike on a town in the north of the country. A Reuters journalist in Tinzaouaten on the border with Algeria witnessed the strike on the town, which is under the control of a rebel coalition known as the Permanent Strategic Framework for the Defense of the People of Azawad (CSP-DPA). Tuareg factions had been meeting in Tinzaouaten this week to form a unified political and military structure. 'Several CSP cadres were killed, including the notorious Fahad Ag Almahmoud,' Chodi Ag, a mission manager at Mali's communications ministry, said in a post on Facebook. Separatist groups from northern Mali, largely dominated by ethnic Tuaregs, launched a rebellion against the government in 2012, which was later subsumed into an insurgency by Islamist groups linked to al Qaeda and the Islamic State. A 2015 peace agreement between the government and rebels collapsed in July this year and triggered renewed fighting, including a fierce battle around Tinzaouaten that killed dozens of Malian soldiers and Russian Wagner mercenaries. Almahmoud was a key member of the CSP alliance. He ensured coordination between its factions and represented them in discussions with authorities about the peace agreement. A military source who did not wish to be identified said strikes on Tinzaouaten had killed Almahmoud and other 'terrorist leaders.' The army has not officially commented on the attack. Multiple drone strikes since the July conflict have killed dozens of civilians in Tinzaouaten, including children, doctors and residents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mali-says-army-drone-strike-killed-senior-rebel-commander-others/7883298.html	2024-12-01T11:29:17-08:00	
Heavy snow and numbing temperatures keep parts of the US in deep freeze	LOWVILLE, N.Y. — Heavy snowfall and numbing temperatures kept parts of the U.S. in a deep freeze Sunday as the Thanksgiving holiday weekend draws to a close. Despite the Arctic-type weather, however, snowmobilers and skiers are reveling in their respective wintry terrains, and weather forecasters gave possible good news ahead of the NFL game in Buffalo. In the remote Tug Hill region of upstate New York, where lake-effect snow off Lake Ontario can dump several centimeters of snow at a time, there was up to 117 centimeters in the Barnes Corners area. 'We just keep digging out,' Kevin Tyo, a local businessman, said Sunday. 'We were out all day yesterday, plowing.' Like many locals, he has a plow attached to the front of his truck for much of the winter, 'and I have a tractor with a bucket, and a snowblower.' His advice? 'If you’re not used to it, stay home. If you’re out, slow down.' Buffalo Bills kickoff set for Sunday night In Buffalo, officials with the NFL’s Bills had sought stadium snow shovelers for the season, including ahead of Sunday night’s game against the San Francisco 49ers. The team said it would pay $20 per hour and provide food and hot drinks. A lake-effect storm began hitting the area Saturday near the Bills’ stadium in Orchard Park, New York. Snow was continuing to fall near the stadium just hours ahead of the game, according to the State Weather Risk Communication Center in New York. 'Snowfall totals will be highly dependent on whether the current lake effect snow shifts just south of the stadium, or remains in place over the stadium longer,' the center said in a post on the social media site X. Some motorists stuck for hours along New York-Pennsylvania border Christine Schintzius, her 4- and 8-year-old sons and 12- and 15-year-old nieces had set out on clear roads Friday from Wales, New York, southeast of Buffalo. The family planned to attend a travel hockey tournament in Cleveland but instead found themselves snowbound for 19 hours, stuck inside Schintzius' Honda Pilot. The family ran into seemingly endless lines of stopped traffic, first on Interstate 90 near the New York-Pennsylvania border for 9 hours, and again on Route 5 in Pennsylvania for 10 hours, until being plowed out by some residents. 'There were lines and lines of cars. It was packed, there was tons of people, tons,' Schintzius said by phone Sunday. While stuck on Route 5, Schintzius never turned off her car, afraid it wouldn’t start again in the frigid cold. Two truckers stopped to check on them during the night. In the morning the police checked in, along with a local resident who walked the line of cars with a basket of muffins, handing them out and making sure the stranded drivers had water. 'Thankfully, all of my kids, my nieces, all travel well,' said Schintzius, who had packed a cooler with lunch meats, snacks, yogurt and fruit. 'And luckily I had still basically a full tank of gas.' When they were finally free of the backup Saturday, Schintzius turned around and took a roundabout route home, avoiding the worst of the snow that was still falling. 'We went completely around the storm because I was worried, like I’m not getting stuck in that ever again,' she said. Arctic air late last week brings bitter temperatures A blast of Arctic air late last week brought bitter temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 12 degrees Celsius to minus 7 degrees Celsius) below average to the Northern Plains, the National Weather Service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the U.S. by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees (minus 12 degrees Celsius) below average. Officials in Erie, Pennsylvania, said Sunday that the heavy lake-effect snow has produced 'treacherous' conditions that are causing even snowplows to get stuck as they work around the clock to try to clear city roads. The city estimated Sunday morning that there were 'about 100 cars throughout the city that are blocking roads and need to be towed out of the way so plows can get through.' Commercial vehicles remained banned in both directions of I-90 in western New York along a nearly 216-kilometer stretch to the Pennsylvania line. The National Weather Service said lake-effect snow was expected to continue east of Lake Erie and Lake Ontario on Sunday, with additional snowfall of 30 to 60 centimeters possible. New York, Pennsylvania declare emergencies In a phone interview Saturday with WWNY-TV, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul said the state prepared for the storm for days by deploying snowplows and thousands of workers and consulting with utility providers. She also dispatched personnel from other parts of the state to assist. 'I know it’s something they’re all accustomed to and they can handle, but I want to let them know we are there with reinforcements and to make sure everyone can travel safely, especially over this really busy holiday weekend,' she said. Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro signed a disaster emergency proclamation Saturday and said parts of Erie County in the northwest received nearly 61 centimeters of snow with more expected through Monday night. Pennsylvania State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said. Authorities closed part of I-90 in Pennsylvania and westbound lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania. Michigan battered by lake-effect snow Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. Bands of snow rolling off Lake Superior buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 61 centimeters or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service office in Marquette, Michigan. Motorists were warned of potentially dangerous road conditions for holiday travel on Sunday. 'Expect rapid changes in traveling conditions in and out of snow bands, including snow covered, slick roads, and reduced visibility,' the National Weather Service said Sunday. There were 69 centimeters of snow just northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula’s western reaches, and another 61 centimeters in Munising, in the eastern area. Lake-effect snow could add more than 30.5 centimeters over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 15 to 25 centimeters or higher to the west, Chapman said Saturday. Gaylord, Michigan, received 63 centimeters of snow Friday, setting a new single-day record for the city in a region dotted by ski resorts, said Keith Berger of the weather service’s Gaylord office. The previous record of 43 centimeters was set March 9, 1942. Joseph Delizio, a weather service meteorologist based in Gaylord, said heavy snow, especially lake-effect snow, isn’t unusual this time year, 'but that magnitude certainly is not.' 'We’ve got more snow in the forecast, believe it or not,' he added. The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 32 hectares of ski hill terrain among its 809 hectares. It boosted the base that snowmaking machines will increase before the resort's season opening next weekend, Recreation Director Doug Hoeh said. 'Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it’s great for the snow hills, but it’s bad for the parking lots, so we’re kind of digging out,' Hoeh said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-snow-and-numbing-temperatures-keep-parts-of-the-us-in-deep-freeze/7883288.html	2024-12-01T10:57:16-08:00	
Israel-Hamas ceasefire now ‘more likely,’ US security official says	The chance for an end to more than a year of fighting between Israel and Hamas in Gaza and the release of about 100 hostages held by the militants is now 'more likely' because of last week’s ceasefire reached by Israel with Hezbollah in Lebanon, a top U.S. national security official said Sunday. The U.S. and other negotiators 'may have a chance' to end 14 months of fighting in Gaza, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan told CNN’s 'State of the Union' show but declined to make a prediction, 'because we’ve come close before.' Israel’s mostly ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, said Sunday, 'There are negotiations taking place behind the scenes, and it can be done.' Sullivan told NBC’s 'Meet the Press' show, 'We are engaged deeply with the key players in the region, and there is activity even today. There will be further conversations and consultations, and our hope is that we can generate a ceasefire and hostage deal, but we're not there yet.' Sullivan spoke a day after Hamas released a videotape of one of the hostages, Israeli American Edan Alexander. Speaking under duress, Alexander blamed Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the October 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel, saying, 'The prime minister is supposed to protect his soldiers and citizens, and you abandoned us.' Sullivan said the video was 'a cruel reminder of Hamas' brutality and of the fact that they are holding so many hostages from so many countries.' Hamas triggered the war with Israel, killing about 1,200 people and capturing 250 hostages in the attack 14 months ago. Israel says that about a third of the remaining 100 or so hostages are believed to be dead. In its counteroffensive, Israel has killed more than 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel, without providing evidence, says it has killed more than 17,000 militants. Sullivan called the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, which has largely been holding steady, 'a huge step forward in the Middle East … the opportunity for people to ultimately be able to return to their homes in Israel and in Lebanon.' He said the United States, France and other allies 'are going to work together with the Lebanese Armed Forces through a mechanism to ensure that the ceasefire is implemented effectively. Our goal is to get through these first few days, critical days of a ceasefire, when it's most fragile, have it take full hold, and then ultimately build on it so that it becomes the permanent ceasefire it's intended to be.' Whether the Israel-Hezbollah pact translates into a ceasefire in Gaza remains uncertain. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent much of the past year trying to broker a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages. But the talks have been stalemated, with Israel rejecting Hamas' demand for a complete withdrawal from the territory and Israel demanding that any vestige of Hamas control in the narrow territory along the Mediterranean Sea be erased. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East, without saying how, and pushed Israel to end its fight against Hamas before he takes office January 20. Trump, like Biden, has been a staunch defender of Israel’s prerogative to defend itself. On the Gaza war front, the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees said Sunday it is halting aid deliveries through the main cargo crossing into Gaza because of the threat of armed gangs who have looted recent convoys. It blamed the breakdown of law and order on Israeli policies. Israel had no immediate comment. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, the main aid provider in Gaza, said the route leading to the Kerem Shalom crossing is too dangerous on the Gaza side. Armed men looted nearly 100 trucks traveling on the route in mid-November, and he said gangs stole a smaller shipment Saturday. Kerem Shalom is the only crossing between Israel and Gaza that is designed for cargo shipments and has been the main artery for aid deliveries since the Rafah crossing with Egypt was shut down in May. Last month, nearly two-thirds of all aid entering Gaza came through Kerem Shalom, and in previous months it accounted for an even larger amount, according to Israeli figures. In a post on X, Lazzarini largely blamed Israel for the breakdown of humanitarian operations in Gaza, citing 'political decisions to restrict the amounts of aid,' lack of safety on aid routes and Israel's targeting of the Hamas-run police force, which had previously provided public security. Meanwhile, Israeli strikes in Gaza killed at least six people overnight, including two young children, ages 6 and 8, in the tent where their family was sheltering, medical officials said Sunday. The strike in the Muwasi area, a sprawling tent camp housing hundreds of thousands of displaced people, also wounded the children's mother and their 8-month-old sister, according to Nasser Hospital. In still another Mideast conflict, the Syrian military rushed in reinforcements to push back insurgents from advancing farther after they seized Aleppo in a surprise offensive. The insurgents look over most of the Syrian city Saturday and claimed to have entered the city of Hama. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi is traveling to the Syrian capital Damascus later Sunday. He told reporters that Tehran will back the Syrian government and army. The swift insurgent offensive is an embarrassment for Syria's President Bashar al-Assad and comes at a time when his allies — Iran and its militant groups and Russia — are preoccupied with their own conflicts. Some material in this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-hamas-ceasefire-now-more-likely-us-security-official-says/7883274.html	2024-12-01T10:43:40-08:00	
LA’s sanctuary city ordinance gives hope to city’s undocumented immigrants	Los Angeles has approved a so-called sanctuary city ordinance. It’s a response to President-elect Donald Trump’s promise of mass deportations when he assumes the presidency in January. The ordinance won’t stop federal officials from deporting undocumented immigrants, but it reinforces the city’s vow to protect its immigrant population. Angelina Bagdasaryan has the story, narrated by Anna Rice.

US will not return nuclear weapons to Ukraine	The United States is not considering returning to Ukraine the nuclear weapons it gave up after the Soviet Union collapsed, White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said Sunday. Sullivan made his remarks when questioned about a New York Times article last month that said some unidentified Western officials had suggested U.S. President Joe Biden could give Ukraine the arms before he leaves office. 'That is not under consideration, no. What we are doing is surging various conventional capacities to Ukraine so that they can effectively defend themselves and take the fight to the Russians, not [giving them] nuclear capability,' he told ABC. Last week, Russia said the idea was 'absolute insanity' and that preventing such a scenario was one of the reasons why Moscow sent troops into Ukraine. Kyiv inherited nuclear weapons from the Soviet Union after its 1991 collapse but gave them up under a 1994 agreement, the Budapest Memorandum, in return for security assurances from Russia, the United States and Britain.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-will-not-return-nuclear-weapons-to-ukraine-/7883247.html	2024-12-01T09:57:50-08:00	
Over 40 people hospitalized in Georgia during protests over suspension of EU talks	TBILISI, Georgia — A third night of protests in the Georgian capital against the government's decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union left 44 people hospitalized, officials said Sunday. Tens of thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the parliament Saturday night, throwing stones and setting off fireworks, while police deployed water cannons and tear gas. An effigy of the founder of the governing Georgian Dream party, Bidzina Ivanishvili — a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — was burned in front of the legislature. Georgia's Interior Ministry said Sunday that 27 protesters, 16 police and one media worker were hospitalized. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze warned that 'any violation of the law will be met with the full rigor of the law.' 'Neither will those politicians who hide in their offices and sacrifice members of their violent groups to severe punishment escape responsibility,' he said at a briefing Sunday. He insisted it wasn't true that Georgia's European integration had been halted. 'The only thing we have rejected is the shameful and offensive blackmail, which was, in fact, a significant obstacle to our country's European integration.' The government's announcement came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution criticizing last month's general election in Georgia as neither free nor fair. Kobakhidze also dismissed the U.S. State Department's statement Saturday that it was suspending its strategic partnership with Georgia. The statement condemned Georgia's decision to halt its efforts toward EU accession. 'You can see that the outgoing administration is trying to leave the new administration with as difficult a legacy as possible. They are doing this regarding Ukraine, and now also concerning Georgia,' Kobakhidze said. 'This will not have any fundamental significance. We will wait for the new administration and discuss everything with them.' EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas and enlargement commissioner Marta Kos released a joint statement Sunday on the Georgian government's decision to suspend negotiations. 'We note that this announcement marks a shift from the policies of all previous Georgian governments and the European aspirations of the vast majority of the Georgian people, as enshrined in the Constitution of Georgia,' the statement said. It reiterated the EU's 'serious concerns about the continuous democratic backsliding of the country' and urged Georgian authorities to 'respect the right to freedom of assembly and freedom of expression, and refrain from using force against peaceful protesters, politicians and media representatives.' The ruling Georgian Dream party's disputed victory in the Oct. 26 parliamentary election, which was widely seen as a referendum on Georgia's aspirations to join the EU, has sparked major demonstrations and led to an opposition boycott of parliament. The opposition has said that the vote was rigged with the help of Russia, Georgia's former imperial master, with Moscow hoping to keep Tbilisi in its orbit. Speaking to The Associated Press on Saturday, Georgia's pro-Western President Salome Zourabichvili said that her country was becoming a 'quasi-Russian' state and that Georgian Dream controlled the major institutions. 'We are not demanding a revolution. We are asking for new elections, but in conditions that will ensure that the will of the people will not be misrepresented or stolen again,' Zourabichvili said. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on condition that it meet the bloc's recommendations, but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-40-people-hospitalized-in-georgia-during-protests-over-suspension-of-eu-talks-/7883123.html	2024-12-01T07:02:12-08:00	
Thousands march in Serbia to mark 1 month since roof collapse killed 15 people	NOVI SAD, Serbia — Thousands joined a protest march on Sunday in the northern Serbian city of Novi Sad that marked one month since a concrete canopy outside of the city's railway station collapsed, killing 15 people and injuring two. Protesters held a huge banner with a red handprint at the front of the column — a message for the populist authorities that they have blood on their hands. Participants later left the same symbolic message on the pavement at the main square in Novi Sad while also painting much of the square red. Street protests and blockades have been held almost daily since the Nov. 1 roof collapse, demanding accountability after tons of concrete fell on people sitting or walking below on a sunny day. The railway station building was renovated twice in recent years. Many in Serbia believe rampant corruption and opaque deals resulted in sloppy work and led to the collapse of the roof. While prosecutors have announced the arrests of 13 people, a Serbian court has since released from detention former government construction minister Goran Vesic. This has fueled widespread skepticism of the ongoing investigation, as the populists control both the police and judiciary. The march on Sunday in Novi Sad was held in silence and passed peacefully, unlike some traffic blockades in past weeks when pro-government supporters have sought to disrupt the gatherings and scuffled with the protesters. Scuffles have also erupted in Serbia's parliament between the ruling party and opposition lawmakers. The protests are seen as a challenge for Serbia's authoritarian President Aleksandar Vucic, whose populist government holds firm control over the mainstream media and institutions. Vucic on Sunday defended his supporters' appearance at the opposition-led traffic blockades. Vucic said halting traffic presented the 'ultimate violence' against citizens. Opposition parties are demanding the resignation of Serbia's prime minister and his government, as well as access to full documentation on the train station building and other infrastructure projects carried out in conjunction with Chinese state companies. The station in Novi Sad was originally built in 1964. Its renovation was part of a bigger project with China and Hungary to build a high-speed railway between Belgrade and Budapest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-march-in-serbia-to-mark-1-month-since-roof-collapse-killed-15-people/7883125.html	2024-12-01T07:01:52-08:00	
Social democrats gain and incumbents are punished in Iceland's election	REYKJAVIK, Iceland — Voters in Iceland joined a global trend of punishing incumbents in a parliamentary election, with a center-left party winning the largest share of votes in the North Atlantic island nation. With all the votes tallied on Sunday, the Social Democratic Alliance had won 15 seats in the 63-seat parliament, the Althingi — more than doubling its total — and secured almost 21% of votes, according to national broadcaster RUV. The conservative Independence Party, which led the outgoing government, had 14 seats and a 19.4% vote share, and the centrist Liberal Reform Party 11 seats and about 16% of votes. Three other parties also won seats. Social Democrat leader Kristrún Mjöll Frostadóttir, 36, will likely try to seek coalition partners to command a parliamentary majority. Icelanders voted Saturday after disagreements over immigration, energy policy and the economy forced Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson to pull the plug on his coalition government and call an early election. Counting was delayed in some areas by snowstorms that blocked roads and slowed delivery of ballot boxes to count centers. Since the 2008 financial crisis devastated the economy and ushered in a new era of political instability, Iceland has been governed by multi-party coalitions of various hues. Like many Western countries, Iceland has been buffeted by the rising cost of living and immigration pressures, and voters are taking it out on incumbent governments. Benediktsson's Independence Party and its coalition partners in the outgoing government, the Progressive Party and the Left Greens, all saw their vote share and seat count decline, with the Left Greens losing all eight of its parliamentary seats. Iceland, a volcanic island nation tucked below the Arctic Circle with a population of less than 400,000, is proud of its democratic traditions. The Althingi, founded in 930 by Viking settlers, is arguably the world's oldest legislature. Election turnout was high by international standards, with 80% of registered voters casting ballots.	https://www.voanews.com/a/social-democrats-gain-and-incumbents-are-punished-in-iceland-s-election/7883108.html	2024-12-01T06:38:50-08:00	
Taliban: Afghanistan must participate in future climate talks	Kabul — An Afghan environment official on Sunday said the country must be allowed to participate in future global climate talks, after returning from COP29 in Baku where Taliban officials attended for the first time. The Afghan delegation were invited as 'guests' of the Azerbaijani hosts, not as a party directly involved in the negotiations. It was the first time that an Afghan delegation had attended since the Taliban swept to power in August 2021, having failed to get an invite to the past two COPs (Conference of the Parties) held in Egypt and the United Arab Emirates. 'Afghanistan must participate in such conferences in the future,' said Matiul Haq Khalis, the director general of Afghanistan's National Environmental Protection Agency, at a press conference on Sunday. He described Afghanistan's attendance last month at the talks as a 'big achievement.' 'We participated in the conference this year so that we could raise the voice of the nation about the issues we are facing, what the needs of the people are, we must share these things with the world.' He said the Afghan delegation had meetings with '19 different organizations and governments,' including with delegations from Russia, Qatar, Azerbaijan and Bangladesh. Afghanistan is among the countries most vulnerable to global warming, despite minimal emissions, and the Taliban government have argued that their political isolation should not bar them from international climate talks. The government has imposed an austere version of sharia Islamic law since taking power, severely restricting women's participation in public life in what the United Nations has called a 'gender apartheid.' Among the poorest countries in the world after decades of war, Afghanistan is particularly exposed to the effects of climate change, which scientists say is spurring extreme weather including prolonged drought, frequent floods, and declining agricultural productivity. The United Nations has also called for action to help Afghanistan build resilience and for the country's participation in international talks. Developed countries have committed to providing $100 billion per year in climate finance through 2025 to help developing nations prepare for worsening climate impacts and wean their economies off fossil fuels.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taliban-afghanistan-must-participate-in-future-climate-talks/7883017.html	2024-12-01T04:13:44-08:00	
UN to halt aid deliveries through main Gaza crossing, says route is too dangerous	DEIR AL-BALAH, GAZA STRIP — The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said Sunday it is halting aid deliveries through the main cargo crossing into Gaza because of the threat of armed gangs who have looted recent convoys. The decision could worsen the humanitarian crisis in Gaza as the cold, rainy winter sets in, with hundreds of thousands of people living in squalid tent camps and reliant on international food aid. Experts were already warning of famine in the territory's north, which Israeli forces have almost completely isolated since early October. Philippe Lazzarini, the head of UNRWA, the main aid provider in Gaza, said the route leading to the Kerem Shalom crossing from Israel is too dangerous on the Gaza side. Armed men looted nearly 100 trucks traveling on the route in mid-November, and he said gangs stole a smaller shipment on Saturday. Israeli strikes kill at least 6 people, including children Israeli strikes on the Gaza Strip killed at least six people overnight, including two young children who died in the tent where their family was sheltering, medical officials said Sunday. The strike in the Muwasi area, a sprawling tent camp housing hundreds of thousands of displaced people, also wounded the children's mother and their sibling, according to the nearby Nasser Hospital. An Associated Press reporter at the hospital saw the bodies. A separate strike in the southern city of Rafah, on the border with Egypt, killed four men, according to hospital records. The Israeli military said it was not aware of strikes in either location. Israel says it only targets militants and tries to avoid harming civilians, but its daily strikes across Gaza often kill women and children. In a separate development, a projectile fired by Iran-backed Houthi rebels in Yemen set off air raid sirens in central Israel. The Israeli military said it intercepted the projectile before it entered Israeli territory. Former defense minister accuses Israel of war crimes A former top Israeli general and defense minister has accused the government of ethnic cleansing in northern Gaza, where Israeli forces have been waging the latest in a series of offensives against Hamas since early October. The army has sealed off the northern towns of Beit Hanoun and Beit Lahiya, and the Jabaliya refugee camp, and allowed almost no humanitarian aid to enter. Tens of thousands of people have fled, while the United Nations estimates up to 75,000 remain and experts have warned of famine. Moshe Yaalon, who served as defense minister under Benjamin Netanyahu before quitting in 2016 and emerging as a fierce critic of the prime minister, said the current far-right government is determined to 'occupy, to annex, to ethnically cleanse.' Pressed by an interviewer with a local news outlet on Saturday, he said: 'There is no Beit Lahiya. No Beit Hanoun. [They are] operating now in Jabaliya, and [they] are actually cleaning the territory of Arabs.' Yaalon doubled down on the remarks Sunday in an interview with Israeli radio, saying 'war crimes are being committed here.' Netanyahu's Likud party criticized his earlier remarks, accusing him of making 'false statements' that are 'a prize for the International Criminal Court and the camp of Israel haters.' The ICC has issued arrest warrants against Netanyahu, another former defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and a Hamas commander, accusing them of crimes against humanity. The International Court of Justice is investigating allegations of genocide against Israel. Israel rejects the allegations and says both courts are biased against it. No end in sight to Gaza war despite ceasefire with Hezbollah The war in Gaza began when Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on October 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking around people 250 hostage. Some 100 captives are still being held inside Gaza, around two-thirds of whom are believed to be alive. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed over 44,000 Palestinians, more than half of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not say how many of the dead were combatants. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence. The war has destroyed vast areas of the coastal enclave and displaced 90% of the population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Hundreds of thousands have crammed into squalid tent camps, where conditions have worsened as the cold, wet winter sets in. Israel reached a ceasefire with Lebanon's Hezbollah militants last week that has largely held, but that agreement, brokered by the United States and France, did not address the ongoing war in Gaza. Iran — which supports Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis and armed groups in Syria and Iraq — has exchanged fire with Israel twice this year. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent much of the past year trying to broker a ceasefire in Gaza and the release of the remaining hostages, but those efforts stalled as Israel rejected Hamas' demand for a complete withdrawal from the territory. The Biden administration has said it will make another push for a deal in its final weeks in office. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end the wars in the Middle East, without saying how. He was a staunch defender of Israel and its policies toward the Palestinians during his previous term.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-to-halt-aid-deliveries-through-main-gaza-crossing-says-route-is-too-dangerous/7883001.html	2024-12-01T03:01:11-08:00	
Putin approves record Russian defense spending	KYIV, UKRAINE — Russian President Vladimir Putin approved budget plans, raising 2025 military spending to record levels as Moscow seeks to prevail in the war in Ukraine. Around 32.5% of the budget posted on a government website Sunday has been allocated for national defense, amounting to 13.5 trillion rubles (more than $145 billion), up from a reported 28.3% this year. Lawmakers in both houses of the Russian parliament, the State Duma and Federation Council had already approved the plans in the past 10 days. Russia's war on Ukraine, which started in February 2022, is Europe's biggest conflict since World War II and has drained the resources of both sides. Kyiv has been getting billions of dollars in help from its Western allies, but Russia's forces are bigger and better equipped, and in recent months the Russian army has gradually been pushing Ukrainian troops backward in eastern areas. On the ground in Ukraine, three people died in the southern Ukrainian city of Kherson when a Russian drone struck a minibus on Sunday morning, Kherson regional Gov. Oleksandr Prokudin said. Seven others were wounded in the attack. Meanwhile, the number of wounded in Saturday's missile strike in Dnipro in central Ukraine rose to 24, with seven in serious condition, Dnipropetrovsk regional Gov. Serhiy Lysak said. Four people were killed in the attack. Moscow sent 78 drones into Ukraine overnight into Sunday, Ukrainian officials said. According to Ukraine's air force, 32 drones were destroyed during the overnight attacks. A further 45 drones were 'lost' over various areas, likely having been electronically jammed. In Russia, a child was killed in a Ukrainian drone attack in the Bryansk region bordering Ukraine, according to regional Gov. Alexander Bogomaz. Russia's Defense Ministry said that 29 Ukrainian drones were shot down overnight into Sunday in four regions of western Russia: 20 over the Bryansk region, seven over the Kaluga region, and one each over the Smolensk and Kursk regions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-approves-record-russian-defense-spending/7882994.html	2024-12-01T02:33:00-08:00	
Biden to spotlight Angola’s Lobito Corridor, his legacy to counter China in Africa	WASHINGTON — When U.S. President Joe Biden visits Angola in early December, he will put into focus his legacy infrastructure project aimed at securing crucial supply chains on the African continent. Called the Lobito Corridor, the project is the centerpiece of his administration’s strategy to counter China’s clout in global development. The Lobito Corridor is a $5 billion investment across multiple sectors that is intended to revitalize and extend the 1,300-kilometer Benguela railway line. It will connect the 120-year-old Angolan port of Lobito on the Atlantic Ocean to the Democratic Republic of Congo, and in its second phase, to Zambia. Announced in September 2023, much of the corridor’s financing comes from the Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment. The PGI is a Biden-led 2022 initiative from the Group of Seven wealthiest economies that evolved from his Build Back Better World plan launched in 2021 as a counter to China’s Belt and Road Initiative. Once operational, it will boost access to critical minerals for the United States and its partners, including cobalt and copper, that are essential in electric vehicle manufacturing. According to a U.S. congressional report, 80% of the DRC’s copper mines are Chinese owned. China is responsible for mining 85% of the DRC’s rare earth minerals, including 76% of its cobalt. The Lobito Corridor is expected to cut transportation costs, open access to arable agricultural land and drive climate-resilient economic growth, Helaina Matza, acting special coordinator for the PGI at the U.S. Department of State, said Tuesday in a briefing to reporters. The PGI’s investments will 'amplify the impact of that infrastructure' with projects such as developing solar energy, local electricity networks and desalination efforts, she said. The project is championed by Angolan President Joao Lourenco. Angola owes about $17 billion to China, more than a third of its total debt. The debt is mostly in the form of infrastructure development loans, backed by oil, that funded the country’s economic recovery following three decades of civil war that ended in 2002. PGI to counter BRI Since launching the Belt and Road Initiative, or BRI, in 2013, China has become the main backer of global development financing. In Africa, Beijing has signed loan commitments with 49 African governments and seven regional institutions. From 2013 to 2021, China provided $679 billion for infrastructure projects around the world, according to a U.S. government analysis, while the U.S. provided $76 billion. The U.S., alongside G7 partners, announced in 2022 that the PGI aims to mobilize $600 billion by 2027 as an alternative to infrastructure financing models that are 'often opaque, fail to uphold environmental and social standards, exploit workers and leave the recipient countries worse off.' That’s a lot of financing to catch up to in a few years, and Lobito is 'the first and the most developed' project in that effort, said Witney Schneidman, a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. 'That's the A+ project, but I don’t see a whole lot of other projects,' Schneidman told VOA. The PGI’s other project, the Luzon Corridor, was launched in April to support connectivity between Subic Bay, Clark, Manila and Batangas in the Philippines. In Lobito, the U.S. works mostly with European partners. In Luzon, the U.S. is teaming up with Japan to secure critical industries such as semiconductors. The White House pushed back against the notion that Biden has scaled back his global infrastructure ambitions to the two corridors. 'We’ve mobilized more than $60 billion, just the U.S., and that’s a part of the larger G7,' national security adviser Jake Sullivan told VOA in a briefing earlier this month. 'And that’s not just been for two corridors,' he said. 'That’s been for investments across Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America.' US-Africa strategy In August 2022, the Biden administration launched an Africa strategy that 'reframes the region’s importance to U.S. national security interests,' the strategy says. Later that year, Biden hosted the U.S.-Africa Leaders Summit, where he pledged the U.S. to invest $55 billion in Africa over three years. 'We are overdelivering on that thus far,' Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, said in a briefing Tuesday. 'We’ve invested more than 80% of that commitment.' But much of that $55 billion was allocated under existing programs and does not bring the kind of megaproject that is 'visible to the average African that says the United States financed that in the way that the Chinese do,' said Mvemba Phezo Dizolele, director of the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Which is why the Lobito Corridor stands out, Dizolele told VOA. It is the 'one palpable project that people can look at and say, ‘If this is implemented, then maybe it would move things forward.’' On a continent where the presence of Chinese financing, businesses and migrants are so prevalent that many African countries teach Mandarin in schools and incorporate Chinese characters in public signage, that’s a start. Moving forward, activists hope the U.S. will not set aside social and environmental concerns that have besieged projects under Chinese financing. 'We have to ensure that we can hear all stakeholders engaging in the process,' said Sergio Calundungo, founder of the Social Observatory of Angola. So far, civil society groups have not been invited to the table, but they are ready to ensure that local communities can 'share as much as possible the prosperity through this important infrastructure,' he told VOA. Will it continue? President-elect Donald Trump will enter office in January. While some are concerned that the U.S. commitment to Africa might falter under his America First doctrine, analysts point to initiatives taken under his first administration. In 2018, the Trump administration launched Prosper Africa, an initiative that brings together U.S. government services to help investors do business on the continent. In 2019, it launched the Blue Dot Network, an international certification mechanism to ensure infrastructure projects meet environmental and social standards. They were aware that infrastructure investments needed 'to foster economic growth, to foster stability, but also for U.S. interests globally when competing with China,' said Joseph Lemoine, senior director of the Atlantic Council's Freedom and Prosperity Center. 'I'm hopeful that they will continue those efforts,' he told VOA. Trump also launched the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation in 2020. The DFC is an agency that functions as America’s development bank, with $60 billion in lending capacity. DFC’s first CEO, Adam Boehler, a college roommate of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, spoke openly of linking development aid to foreign policy goals. In a 2020 interview, he admitted promising $2 billion for Indonesia should the country agree to join the Trump administration's Abraham Accords and recognize Israel. 'If you listen to all the Trump people, they want a foreign policy that's transactional,' Schneidman at Brookings said. Trump has promised to take a confrontational approach to China. Analysts say aligning infrastructure financing needs with Trump’s foreign policy goals may be an element in the U.S.-China rivalry that developing nations can leverage.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-spotlight-angola-s-lobito-corridor-his-legacy-to-counter-china-in-africa/7879407.html	2024-12-01T01:31:20-08:00	
Nicaraguans stripped of citizenship live in limbo, scattered across the world	GUATEMALA CITY — Sergio Mena's life dissolved in hours. After years resisting President Daniel Ortega, the rural activist fled Nicaragua in 2018, joining thousands of protesters fleeing a yearslong crackdown on dissent. Mena returned from exile in neighboring Costa Rica in 2021 to continue protesting, only to be thrown in a prison where he said jailers hung prisoners by their feet and shocked them with electricity. 'We were tortured all the time, physically and psychologically, from the moment we arrived until the very last day,' said Mena, 40. Now in exile in Guatemala, Mena may be out of prison but he's far from free. Upon their release, he and hundreds of religious leaders, students, activists, dissidents and journalists were rendered 'stateless' – stripped of their citizenship, homes and government pensions. The United Nations says that they're among 4.4 million stateless people worldwide who struggle to find jobs, education and healthcare or even open bank accounts or marry without valid ID documents. 'Statelessness is torture,' said Karina Ambartsoumian-Clough executive director of United Stateless, a U.S.-based organization advocating for the stateless. 'You just legally cease to exist, even if you're here physically as a human.' Free but unfree In September, Ortega's government loaded Mena and 134 other prisoners onto the flight that took them to Guatemala. They joined 317 others whom the government has deemed adversaries who no longer deserve legal Nicaraguan identities. The Associated Press spoke to more than 24 Nicaraguan exiles who have been stripped of their citizenship and are trying to chart paths forward. They're scattered across the United States, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Mexico and Spain in limbo as they struggle to recover from physical and psychological trauma, extending the torture many suffered in Nicaragua. The Ortega government did not respond to a request for comment by the AP. The agony of statelessness The majority of stateless people worldwide are born to refugees and migrants in countries that don't offer birthright citizenship, the right to become a citizen if you're born within a country's territory. Many Nicaraguans struggle to scrape together enough money to feed themselves. Others hide away in fear that the Nicaraguan government will someday come for them. Many more reel from watching their lives go up in smoke. For those stranded in the U.S. or seeking respite there, President-elect Donald Trump's promises to crack down on immigration and asylum have added more uncertainty. Intensifying repression Ortega's government began stripping people of their citizenship early last year. It was in that crackdown that Mena, the member of a rural activist movement, said he was imprisoned. The government claimed that he had participated in drug trafficking and organized crime, which he denies. In February 2023, the government broke international law when it began sending prisoners to the U.S and most recently to Guatemala. Others in exile were stripped of their citizenship without ever having been jailed. Torment beyond borders The Nicaraguan government has not explained why it released Mena and other people from prison, although experts have speculated about the desire to duck international criticism and the costs involved while continuing to maintain a grip on enemies. Mena lives in a hotel in Guatemala City, where he flips through photos of a crumbling jail, scraps of food and his bruised, beaten body – indelible memories of more than two years in prison. His life is painted by constant fear. 'The tentacles of (the Nicaraguan government) still reach here,' he said with tears in his eyes. The Biden administration has offered the Nicaraguans temporary protections and Mena hopes the U.S. government will grant him asylum, but such protections are likely to vanish or be severely restricted under Trump. The Spanish government has offered to provide nationality to some of the stateless exiles, but few have the resources needed to build a new life in Spain, or are confused about the process. Stateless struggle Allan Bermudez, 54, was a university professor in Nicaragua. He was imprisoned after accusations that he was conspiring against the government as Ortega identified universities as hotbeds for antigovernment protests. In February 2023, he was among 222 prisoners loaded onto a flight to the United States with no idea where they were going. While the U.S. government provided Bermudez and others with temporary support, a few days at a hotel, a new phone, $400 and limited access to aid from a group of NGOs, help has since dried up. Today, Bermudez, who has multiple advanced degrees, works at a Dunkin' Donuts on the fringes of Salisbury, Maryland, struggling to pick up hours. He rents a small room, suffers from chronic heart problems and post-traumatic stress disorder, and has no medical care. 'I haven't bought my medicine, because if I do, I'll have nothing to eat,' he said. Back in Nicaragua, his mother had stroke this year. He's struggled to send money home. With his daughter and wife also back home, he's plagued with anxiety and depression. He applied for asylum in February after living in the U.S. under humanitarian parole offered by the Biden administration but said he hasn't heard back. He's put all his hopes into building a life in the U.S. and doesn't know what he'll do if asylum doesn't come through. 'I can't leave, I have my hands tied,' he said. 'All I can do is pray that God helps me.' Lives upended Like Bermudez, hundreds of thousands have fled Nicaragua. Thousands of civil society organizations have been shuttered, their assets seized as the government seeks to silence any dissent. While many of the Nicaraguan exiles hope to one day return to their country, 82-year-old Moises Hassan has given up hope as he hides away in a town in the mountains of Costa Rica. Hassan was once a guerrilla fighter against the Anastasio Somoza dictatorship and then, alongside Ortega, a member of the junta that succeeded it. He built a family and a home with thousands of books, and planned to live out the rest of his days there. He was elected mayor of the capital, Managua, but saw his life and hopes sour when he began to criticize Ortega's anti-democratic moves. He fled the country in 2021. While on a trip to visit his daughter he heard the government was detaining critics, and knew they would come for him. It was no surprise when his name appeared on a list of people who were stripped of their citizenship and home and called traitors. 'The message is ... 'Don't think that just because you're out of the country that you're out of our reach,'' he said. But he said that with his pension seized along with his belongings, it has been a shock to depend on money from his children. He and his wife remain in their corner of Costa Rica, too scared to even go to the capital, where they worry Ortega's agents could track them down. 'I feel like I'm under house arrest,' he said, cradling his worn, now useless Nicaraguan passport. 'I'm a prisoner in my own home.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/nicaraguans-stripped-of-citizenship-live-in-limbo-scattered-across-the-world-/7881099.html	2024-12-01T01:30:44-08:00	
Everything is expensive!' Bolivia faces a shocking economic collapse	Fuel is rapidly becoming one of Bolivia's scarcest commodities. Long lines of vehicles snake for several kilometers outside gas stations all over Bolivia, once South America's second-largest producer of natural gas. Some of the queues don't budge for days. While frustration builds, drivers like Victor García now eat, sleep and socialize around their stationary trucks, waiting to buy just a few liters of diesel — unless the station runs dry. 'We don't know what's going to happen, but we're going to be worse off,' said García, 66, who inched closer to the pump Tuesday as the hours ticked by in El Alto, a bare-bones sprawl beside Bolivia's capital in the Andean altiplano. Bolivia's monthslong fuel crunch comes as the nation's foreign currency reserves plummet, leaving Bolivians unable to find U.S. dollars at banks and exchange houses. Imported goods that were once commonplace have become scarce. The fuel crisis has created a sense that the country is coming undone, disrupting economic activity and everyday life for millions of people, hurting commerce and farm production and sending food prices soaring. Mounting public anger has driven crowds into the streets in recent weeks, piling pressure on leftist President Luis Arce to ease the suffering ahead of a tense election next year. 'We want effective solutions to the shortage of fuel, dollars and the increase in food prices,' said Reinerio Vargas, the vice rector of Gabriel René Moreno Autonomous University in the eastern province of Santa Cruz, where hundreds of desperate truckers and residents flooded main squares Tuesday to vent their anger at Arce's inaction and demand early elections. In a similar eruption of discontent, protesters shouting, 'Everything is expensive!' marched through the streets of the capital, La Paz, last week. Bolivians say Arce's image has suffered not only because of the crisis but also because his government insists that it doesn't exist. 'Diesel sales are in the process of returning to normal,' Economy Minister Marcelo Montenegro said Tuesday. Arce has repeatedly vowed that his government will end the fuel shortages and lower the prices of basic goods by arbitrary deadlines. On November 10, he again promised he would 'resolve this issue' in 10 days. As the deadlines come and go, the black market currency exchange rate has risen to nearly 40% more than the official rate. Arce's office did not respond to interview requests. 'The queues are getting longer and longer,' said 38-year-old driver Ramiro Morales, who needed a bathroom after four hours in line Tuesday but feared losing his place if he went searching for one. 'People are exhausted.' It's a shocking turnaround for the landlocked nation of 12 million people that was a South American economic success story in the 2000s, when the commodities bonanza generated tens of billions of dollars under the nation's first Indigenous president, former President Evo Morales. Morales, Arce's onetime mentor, is his present-day rival in the fight to be the ruling party's candidate next year. But when the commodities boom ended, prices slumped and gas production dwindled. Now, Bolivia spends an estimated $56 million a week to import most of its gasoline and diesel from Argentina, Paraguay and Russia. Economy Minister Montenegro on Tuesday pledged that the government would continue providing fuel subsidies that critics say it can't afford. Banners from two years ago boasting that Bolivia's inflation is the lowest in South America still greet tourists arriving at El Alto International Airport. Now, inflation is among the highest in the region. Fuel shortages prevent farmers from getting their produce to distribution centers and markets, triggering a sharp price hike for food staples. Last week in La Paz and neighboring El Alto, hungry Bolivians jostled in long lines to buy rice after much-delayed shipments finally arrived from Santa Cruz, the country's economic engine some 850 kilometers away. With the diesel shortage affecting everything from the operation of tractors to the sourcing of machinery parts, the shortage is also hurting farmers during the crucial planting season. 'Without diesel, there is no food for 2025,' said Klaus Frerking, the vice president of the Eastern Agricultural Chamber of Bolivia. The prices of potatoes, onions and milk have doubled in El Alto's main wholesale food market in the past month, vendors said, overshooting the country's nearly 8% inflation rate. Nervous Bolivians are cutting back on their consumption. 'You have to search a lot to find the cheapest food,' said 67-year-old Angela Mamani, struggling to pull together meals for her six grandchildren at El Alto's open-air market Tuesday. She planned to buy vegetables but didn't have enough cash and went home empty-handed. This week, Arce's government presented a 2025 budget — with a 12% increase in spending — that drew backlash from lawmakers and business leaders who said it would lead to more debt and more inflation. While the governing Movement Toward Socialism party tears itself apart in the power struggle between Arce and Morales, both politicians have seen the economic morass as a way to strengthen their positions ahead of 2025 elections. 'They deny there are problems. They blame external contexts and conflicts,' said Bolivian economic analyst Gonzalo Chávez. Morales' supporters last month launched 24-day protest partly targeting Arce's handling of the economy that blocked main roads and stranded commercial shipments, costing the government billions of dollars. Security forces broke up the rallies almost a month ago. But on Tuesday, Arce's government continued to blame Morales' blockades for spawning the ubiquitous fuel lines. 'We need change,' said Geanina García, a 31-year-old architect scouring the grocery hub of El Alto for cheap deals — a once-routine errand that she said had turned into a nightmare. 'People don't live off politics, they live day to day, off of what they produce and what they earn.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/everything-is-expensive-bolivia-faces-a-shocking-economic-collapse/7881016.html	2024-12-01T01:30:11-08:00	
New EU chiefs visit Kyiv on first day of mandate	KYIV, UKRAINE — The EU's new top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, and head of the European Council, Antonio Costa, arrived in Kyiv on Sunday in a symbolic show of support for Ukraine on their first day in office. 'We came to give a clear message that we stand with Ukraine, and we continue to give our full support,' Costa told media outlets including AFP accompanying them on the trip. The European Union's new leadership team is keen to demonstrate it remains firm on backing Kyiv at a perilous moment for Ukraine nearly three years into its fight against Russia's all-out invasion. Questions are swirling around the future of U.S. support once Donald Trump assumes office in January and there are fears he could force Kyiv to make painful concessions in pursuit of a quick peace deal. Meanwhile, tensions have escalated as Russian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike government buildings in Kyiv with his new Oreshnik missile after firing it at Ukraine for the first time last month. The Kremlin leader said the move is a response to Kyiv getting the green light to strike inside Russia with American and British missiles, and he has threatened to hit back against the countries supplying the weaponry. As winter begins, Russia has also unleashed devastating barrages against Ukraine's power grid and on the frontline Kyiv's fatigued forces are losing ground to Moscow's grinding offensive. 'The situation in Ukraine is very, very grave,' Kallas, a former prime minister of Estonia, said. 'But it's clear that it comes at a very high cost for Russia as well.' Ceasefire? The new EU leaders -- the bloc's top officials along with European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen -- were set to hold talks with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. Zelenskyy on Friday appeared to begin staking out his position ahead of any potential peace talks. He called on NATO to offer guaranteed protections to parts of Ukraine controlled by Kyiv in order to 'stop the hot stage of the war,' and implied he would then be willing to wait to regain other territory seized by Russia. 'If we speak ceasefire, [we need] guarantees that Putin will not come back,' Zelenskyy told Britain's Sky News. Kallas said that 'the strongest security guarantee is NATO membership.' 'We need to definitely discuss this -- if Ukraine decides to draw the line somewhere then how can we secure peace so that Putin doesn't go any further,' she said. Diplomats at NATO say there appears little prospect of the alliance granting Ukraine membership soon given opposition from a raft of members cautious of getting dragged into war with Russia. Kallas said the EU 'shouldn't really rule out anything' in terms of the question of sending European troops to help enforce any ceasefire. 'We should have this strategic ambiguity around this,' she said. 'Transactional language' Trump has cast doubt on continuing Washington's vast aid for Ukraine and called on EU countries to do more. Europe together has spent around $125 billion on supporting Ukraine since Russia's 2022 invasion, while the United States alone has coughed up over $90 billion, according to a tracker from the Kiel Institute. Kallas said the EU would use a 'transactional language' to try to convince Trump that backing Kyiv was in the interest of the U.S. 'Aid for Ukraine is not charity,' she said. 'A victory for Russia definitely emboldens China, Iran, North Korea.' The new EU foreign policy chief said the bloc would continue seeking to put Ukraine in the 'strongest' position -- if and when Kyiv chose it was time to negotiate with Moscow. But she conceded that it was becoming 'increasingly difficult' for the 27-nation bloc to agree on new ways to ramp up support for Ukraine. 'This war has been going on for quite some time and it is harder and harder to explain it to our own people,' she said. 'But I don't see any option.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-eu-chiefs-visit-kyiv-on-first-day-of-mandate/7882982.html	2024-12-01T01:24:44-08:00	
Interpol clamps down on cybercrime, arrests 1,006 suspects in Africa	DAKAR, SENEGAL — Interpol arrested 1,006 suspects in Africa during a massive two-month operation, clamping down on cybercrime that left tens of thousands of victims, including some who were trafficked, and produced millions in financial damages, the global police organization said Tuesday. Operation Serengeti, a joint operation with Afripol, the African Union's police agency, ran from September 2 to October 31 in 19 African countries and targeted criminals behind ransomware, business email compromise, digital extortion and online scams, the agency said in a statement. 'From multi-level marketing scams to credit card fraud on an industrial scale, the increasing volume and sophistication of cybercrime attacks is of serious concern,' said Valdecy Urquiza, the Secretary General of Interpol. Interpol pinpointed 35,000 victims, with cases linked to nearly $193 million in financial losses worldwide, stating that local police authorities and private sector partners, including internet service providers, played a key role in the operation. Jalel Chelba, Afripol's executive director, said in the statement: 'Through Serengeti, Afripol has significantly enhanced support for law enforcement in African Union Member States.' Serengeti's results were a 'drastic increase' compared to operations in Africa in previous years, Enrique Hernandez Gonzalez, Interpol's Assistant Director of Cybercrime Operations, told The Associated Press. Interpol's previous cybercrime operations in Africa had only led to 25 arrests in the last two years. 'Significant progress has been made, with participating countries enhancing their ability to work with intelligence and produce meaningful results,' Gonzalez said. In Kenya, the police made nearly two dozen arrests in an online credit card fraud case linked to losses of $8.6 million. In the West African country of Senegal, officers arrested eight people, including five Chinese nationals, for a $6 million online Ponzi scheme. Chelba said Afripol's focus now includes emerging threats like Artificial Intelligence-driven malware and advanced cyberattack techniques. Other dismantled networks included a group in Cameroon suspected of using a multi-level marketing scam for human trafficking, an international criminal group in Angola running an illegal virtual casino and a cryptocurrency investment scam in Nigeria, the agency said. Interpol, which has 196 member countries and celebrated its centennial last year, works to help national police forces communicate with each other and track suspects and criminals in fields like counterterrorism, financial crime, child pornography, cybercrime and organized crime. The world's biggest — if not best-funded — police organization has been grappling with new challenges including a growing caseload of cybercrime and child sex abuse, and increasing divisions among its member countries. Interpol had a total budget of about 176 million euros (about $188 million) last year, compared to more than 200 million euros at the European Union's police agency, Europol, and some $11 billion at the FBI in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/interpol-clamps-down-on-cybercrime-arrests-1-006-suspects-in-africa/7879846.html	2024-12-01T00:01:58-08:00	
Berlin's traditional Christmas markets reflect city's growing diversity	BERLIN — The smells of mulled wine, roasted almonds and hot bratwurst are wafting through the air across the German capital again, as the city's more than 100 Christmas markets are opening their doors this week. But the annual tradition that Germans have cherished since the Middle Ages — and successfully exported to much of the Western world — has become a pretty diverse affair, at least in Berlin. The city of 3.8 million, which takes pride in its tolerance and diversity, offers Christmas markets for pretty much every taste these days. Nowadays, almost 40% of Berliners have immigrant roots, and the city's LGBTQ+ community is considered one of the biggest in the country. So it comes as no surprise that popular Christmas markets include a LGBTQ+ one offering rainbow pierogi and entertainment by drag queens, a Scandinavian market selling moose goulash and reindeer salami and a market tempting revelers with naughty gift ideas, along with a historical market that takes visitors back to medieval times. 'It's a lovely atmosphere,' Paul Middleton said of the LGBTQ+ market Christmas Avenue, which is illuminated in the colors of the rainbow. 'It's great to do something for the LGBTQ+ community and offer something positive in a safe environment where everyone's welcome, no matter what background,' said Middleton, who moved to Berlin from London three years ago 'for love.' Middleton was busy selling gay-themed Christmas shirts next to stalls offering suggestive candles and soaps in neon colors. The market also attracts heterosexual couples, neighborhood residents and groups of moms with baby strollers, said Sebastian Ahlefeld, a spokesperson for Christmas Avenue. 'You can meet lots of friends, relax, enjoy a mulled wine and simply kick off the Christmas season,' said Marco Klingberg, who visited the market with friends on Monday night. Klingberg, a police officer and member of the LGBTQ+ police organization in Brandenburg, the state surrounding Berlin, pointed out that despite the city's reputation as a gay-friendly city, attacks on members of the community are a concern, and it was great to have a protected environment for celebrating. 'First and foremost, it's a safe space,' he said. Security is an issue not only at the LGBTQ+ market, where all visitors undergo a bag check before entering. Groups of police officers were patrolling most markets on Monday night, as memories of a deadly terror attack on a Christmas market eight years ago are still fresh for many Berliners. On December 19, 2016, an Islamist attacker plowed through a crowd of Christmas market-goers with a truck, killing 13 people and injuring dozens more in the German capital. The attacker was killed days later in a shootout in Italy. Despite increased surveillance, visitors at the Scandinavian-themed Lucia market in Berlin's Prenzlauer Berg neighborhood were hanging out in crowds on the compound of a former brewery. Kids enjoyed merry-go-rounds while their parents stood in line for Finnish honey and Icelandic mulled wine infused with hard liquor or chatted and warmed up at fire pits. 'I've been coming here every year since kindergarten times,' said Mathilda Schmidt, 21, pointing to kids cheering as they jumped on a trampoline. She was standing in line with her boyfriend for bratwurst and potato pancakes. At Humboldt Forum Christmas market near the Spree river, vendors were offering more exotic dishes including jerk chicken with cooked bananas at a Jamaican food stand, Argentinian empanadas, French salamis and Hungarian langos, a deep-fried flatbread. While the city's biggest markets are open for weeks and usually close only the day before Christmas Eve, smaller markets often open for a weekend or a day. They include the Kinky Christmas market in the Kreuzberg neighborhood that invites visitors on December 1 only, seeking those who may find traditional markets 'too overwhelmingly contemplative and traditional.' More than 20 stalls will offer sexy 'fashion, accessories, jewelry, toys and all kinds of naughty gift ideas,' the city of Berlin says on its website. While Berliners seem to nonchalantly enjoy the variety of Christmas market offerings, they were fiercely united in their complaint about the increasing price of mulled wine — with one small cup now selling for up to seven euros ($7.36).	https://www.voanews.com/a/berlin-s-traditional-christmas-markets-reflect-city-s-growing-diversity/7879819.html	2024-12-01T00:00:40-08:00	
Eggs are available but pricier as the holiday baking season begins	U.S. egg prices are rising once more as a lingering outbreak of bird flu coincides with the high demand of the holiday baking season. But prices are still far from the recent peak they reached almost two years ago. And the American Egg Board, a trade group, says egg shortages at grocery stores have been isolated and temporary so far. 'Those are being rapidly corrected, sometimes within a day,' said Emily Metz, the Egg Board's president and chief executive officer. The average price for a dozen eggs in U.S. cities was $3.37 in October, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. That was down slightly from September, and down significantly from January 2023, when the average price soared to $4.82. But it was up 63% from October 2023, when a dozen eggs cost an average of $2.07. Sometimes, supermarkets may be to blame for price spikes. During testimony in August in the Federal Trade Commission's case seeking to block Kroger's merger with Albertsons, Kroger's senior director for pricing acknowledged that the company has raised the cost of milk and eggs beyond the levels of inflation. But there are other factors behind the price increases. Metz said the egg industry sees its highest demand in November and December, for example. 'You can't have your holiday baking, your pumpkin pie, your stuffing, without eggs,' she said. Avian influenza is another big reason for the higher prices. The current bird flu outbreak that began in February 2022 has led to the slaughter of more than 111 million birds, mostly egg-laying chickens. Anytime the virus is found, every bird on a farm is killed to limit the spread of the disease. More than 6 million birds have been slaughtered just this month because of bird flu. They were a relatively small part of the total U.S. egg-laying flock of 377 million chickens. Still, the flock is down about 3% over the past year, contributing to a 4% drop in egg production, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. The latest wave of bird flu is scrambling supplies of cage-free eggs because California has been among the hardest hit states. California, Nevada, Washington and Oregon all require eggs sold in their states to be cage-free. 'We're having to move eggs from other areas of the country that are producing cage-free to cover that low supply in those states, because those states only allow for cage-free eggs to be sold,' Metz said. Cage-free requirements are set to go into effect in Arizona, Colorado and Michigan next year and in Rhode Island and Utah in 2030. Demand for such specialty eggs may also be contributing to avian flu, which is spread through the droppings of wild birds as they migrate past farms. Allowing chickens to roam more freely puts them at greater risk, said Chad Hart, a professor and agricultural economist at Iowa State University. 'It's really hard to control that interaction between domesticated birds and wild birds,' Hart said. 'Some of those vectors have been opened up because we're asking the egg industry to produce in ways that we didn't ask them to before.' Metz said climate change and extreme weather are also blowing some wild birds off course. 'We have birds that have been displaced by hurricanes, by wildfires, and those birds are now circulating in areas that they otherwise might not circulate or at times of the year that they otherwise may not be circulating,' she said. 'And those are all new variables that our farmers are having to deal with.' Hart said the egg industry is trying to rebuild the flock, but that also can limit supplies, since farmers have to hold back some eggs to hatch into new chickens. Still, there is some good news on U.S. poultry farms. The price of chicken feed — which represents 70% of a farmer's costs — has fallen significantly after doubling between 2020 and 2022, Hart said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/eggs-are-available-but-pricier-as-the-holiday-baking-season-begins/7879804.html	2024-11-30T23:59:30-08:00	
More sand is in sight for a Jersey Shore resort town's deteriorating beaches	NORTH WILDWOOD, NEW JERSEY — A decade-long conflict over the condition of a New Jersey resort town's beaches, involving tens of millions of dollars in litigation and fines, could come to an end soon. Patrick Rosenello, the mayor of North Wildwood, says his town has reached an agreement with the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection to drop claims on both sides and move forward with measures to widen beaches in the community, popular with tourists from the Philadelphia area. The agreement, which is up for a vote Tuesday by North Wildwood's council, would resolve all outstanding disputes between the parties, the Republican mayor said. The tentative timing of the replenishment is sometime in 2025, he said. The agreement includes canceling the $12 million New Jersey has fined North Wildwood for unauthorized beach repairs that the state says could actually worsen erosion. It also calls for the city to drop a lawsuit against the state seeking reimbursement for the $30 million it has spent trucking in sand for emergency repairs to eroded sections of its beach over the past decade. 'We agreed that we will concentrate on protecting our beaches instead of suing each other,' Rosenello said Wednesday. At the root of the dispute is the fact that North Wildwood is virtually the only Jersey Shore community that has yet to receive a full beach replenishment project from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Officials say difficulty in getting easements from affected property owners has contributed to the delay. Erosion had become so bad in parts of North Wildwood that protective sand dunes were obliterated, leaving homes and businesses vulnerable to flooding and wave damage in the event of a major storm, At one point in January, Rosenello posed for photos on the beach with what was left of a dune barely reaching his knees. The state Department of Transportation did an interim replenishment project last summer after Democratic Governor Phil Murphy called the erosion in North Wildwood 'shocking.' Rosenello said that work has held up well in the ensuing months. The environmental department declined to comment on the proposed agreement. Rosenello predicted it will be approved by the council and signed and sent to the state Tuesday. In addition to ending the litigation, North Wildwood will contribute $1 million to the eventual cost of the federal beach replenishment project once it arrives in the city, and will pay $700,000 into a state water pollution control fund, the mayor said. The agreement also lays out a clear regulatory path for North Wildwood to obtain the environmental permits it needs to carry out other shore protection work including extension of a sea wall. On several occasions, North Wildwood carried out emergency repairs, including construction of an earlier bulkhead without approval from the state. Shawn LaTourette, New Jersey’s environment protection commissioner, warned the town in 2023 that unauthorized work could have more serious consequences if it continues, including potential loss of future shore protection funding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-sand-is-in-sight-for-a-jersey-shore-resort-town-s-deteriorating-beaches-/7878895.html	2024-11-30T23:58:51-08:00	
US proposes new habitat protections in southern Rockies for Canada lynx	BILLINGS, MONTANA — U.S. wildlife officials finalized a recovery plan for imperiled populations of Canada lynx on Wednesday and proposed new habitat protections in the southern Rocky Mountains for the forest-dwelling wildcats that are threatened by climate change. The fate of the proposal is uncertain under President-elect Donald Trump: Officials during the Republican's first term sought unsuccessfully to strip lynx of protections that they've had since 2000 under the Endangered Species Act. Almost 20,000 square kilometers of forests and mountains in Colorado and northern New Mexico are covered under the habitat proposal. That's different from a previous plan that left out the southern Rockies and concentrated instead on recovery efforts elsewhere, including Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota and Maine. 'This is a significant change and a good one,' said Matthew Bishop, an attorney for Western Environmental Law Center who has been involved in efforts to protect lynx through court actions. 'They weren't really committing to conserve lynx in Colorado anymore, and now they are.' Areas of protected habitat also are being added in Idaho and Montana. Protected areas in Wyoming would be sharply reduced under Wednesday's proposal. Wildlife officials said they were removing locations where they consider lynx unlikely to thrive in the future, while adding new areas that the latest science suggests are more suitable to their long-term survival. Lynx are elusive animals that live in cold boreal forests and prey primarily on snowshoe hares. They originally received federal protections because the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management didn't have sufficient regulations in place to shield their populations from potential harm. Those protective rules are now in place, but climate change has emerged as a new, worsening threat. Warmer temperatures are melting away the lynx's snowy habitat and could decrease the availability of snowshoe hares. Declines for lynx are expected across the contiguous U.S. under even the most optimistic warming scenario that officials have considered. Most areas suitable for lynx are in Canada and Alaska, where the animals are widespread and hunting and trapping of them is allowed. Their numbers never were great in the contiguous U.S., which is at the southern fringe of the species range, but the hope is to maintain some population strongholds so they can persist in a warmer world. The changes announced Wednesday follow a 2016 court ruling that faulted federal wildlife officials for not designating protections for lynx habitat in Colorado and some parts of Montana and Idaho. There are more than 1,100 lynx in the contiguous U.S., according to estimates from scientists. Those numbers are expected to plummet in some areas, and officials are aiming for a minimum contiguous U.S. population of a combined 875 lynx over a 20-year period. More than 200 lynx were reintroduced in Colorado beginning in 1999 and at the time their prospects were considered uncertain. 'There were concerns about whether it would stick,' said U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service lynx biologist Jim Zelenak. 'But they do seem to be hanging on.' Now that area could become one of the future population strongholds, with the southern Rockies in Colorado and the region around Yellowstone National Park are most likely to have temperatures favorable to lynx for the longest time, he said. Maine has the most lynx currently but is expected to be hit harder by climate change. 'We've got this overarching threat of climate warming, and so we want to do everything we can to minimize the effects that we can control,' Zelenak said. 'So we don't want to put roads in the wrong places. We don't want to permanently convert very much of the habitat at all in the hopes that we can keep these populations viable coming into a warming future.' Habitat protections in Maine and Minnesota would remain unchanged under the proposal. A final decision is expected late next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-proposes-proposed-for-new-habitat-protections-in-southern-rockies-for-canada-lynx-/7879839.html	2024-11-30T23:56:53-08:00	
Turmoil overshadows Romania vote as far right hopes to gain ground	BUCHAREST, ROMANIA — Still reeling from this week's shock developments, Romanians returned to the polls Sunday to elect their Parliament, with the far right tipped to win, potentially heralding a shift in the NATO country's foreign policy. Romania was thrown into turmoil after a top court ordered a recount of the first round of last week's presidential election won by Calin Georgescu, a little-known far-right admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin. A runoff in that poll is slated for December 8. Despite accusations of Russian influence and alleged interference via TikTok, Sunday's parliamentary elections went ahead as planned. While the recounting of more than 9 million ballots appeared to proceed quickly, people on the streets of Bucharest expressed worries about the recent twists and turns. 'What's going on now doesn't seem very democratic,' Gina Visan told AFP at a Christmas market in Bucharest. 'They should respect our vote. We're disappointed, but we're used to this kind of behavior,' said the 40-year-old nurse, echoing voter's distrust in traditional parties. Polling stations opened at 7 a.m. (0500 GMT) and will close at 9 p.m., with an exit poll due to be published shortly afterward. The first official results are expected later in the evening. Confusion, anger and fear Amid allegations of irregularities and possible interference in the election, concerns over the transparency of the electoral process have emerged, with independent observers being denied access to the recount. According to Septimius Parvu of the Expert Forum think tank, the recount order by Romania's Constitutional Court had 'many negative effects,' including undermining confidence in institutions. 'We've already recounted votes in Romania in the past, but not millions of votes, with parliamentary elections in the middle of it all,' said Parvu. 'No decision made during this crucial period should limit the right of Romanians to vote freely nor further put at risk the credibility of the election process,' the U.S. Embassy in Romania stressed. But the top court's decision is likely to boost the far right, Parvu said. The NATO member of 19 million people has so far resisted rising nationalism in the region, but experts say it faces an unprecedented situation as anger over soaring inflation and fears of being dragged into Russia's war in neighboring Ukraine have mounted. George Sorin in Bucharest said he hopes the far right will score well, claiming the current Parliament had mostly served the interests of 'Brussels and Ukraine' instead of 'national interests.' Outgoing President Klaus Iohannis said Sunday's vote would determine Romania's future -- whether it will 'remain a country of freedom and openness or collapse into toxic isolation and a dark past.' Far right eyes breakthrough Romania's political landscape has been shaped by two major parties for the past three decades, but analysts predict a fragmented Parliament to emerge from Sunday's vote, influencing the chances of forming a future government. Polls show that three far-right parties are predicted to claim more than 30% of the vote share combined. Among them is the AUR party, whose leader George Simion won nearly 14% of the presidential vote, which topped the latest polls on more than 22%. 'We are here, standing, alive, more numerous than ever, and with a huge opportunity ahead of us,' Simion -- a fan of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump -- recently told his supporters. The Party of Young People (POT), which was founded in 2023 and has meanwhile thrown its support behind Georgescu, could reach the 5% threshold to enter Parliament and there is also the extreme-right SOS Romania party, led by firebrand Diana Sosoaca. In recent years, around 30% of Romanians have embraced far-right views, even if they have not always voted for them in elections. Elena Lasconi's pro-European USR party has warned that the country faces 'a historic confrontation' between those who wish to 'preserve Romania's young democracy' and those who want to 'return to the Russian sphere of influence.' The ruling Social Democrats (PSD) and the National Liberal Party (PNL), which suffered a defeat in the presidential ballot, have centered their campaigns on their 'experience.' 'The political scene is completely reset,' said political scientist Remus Stefureac, adding that 2025 'will be extremely complicated in terms of security risks.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/turmoil-overshadows-romania-vote-as-far-right-hopes-to-gain-ground/7882956.html	2024-11-30T22:10:43-08:00	
India's top court weighs in on mosque–temple controversy	A trial court's order that triggered violence this week, leaving six Muslims dead, should be taken to the Uttar Pradesh state's highest court, India's Supreme Court said Friday. The Supreme Court also asked the trial court not to proceed with the order against Shahi Jama Masjid, a 16th century mosque, until the Allahabad High Court acts on the lawsuit that the mosque will likely file shortly. A trial court, acting on a petition by some Hindu groups, on November 19 ordered a survey team to inspect the mosque in Sambhal. In the petition, the Hindu groups claimed that the mosque was built in 1526 at the site of a Hindu temple demolished by the Muslim Mughal emperor Babur. Former Indian Supreme Court Justice Madan Lokur said to VOA in an email that the court order for the inspection of the mosque was 'a clear violation of the Places of Worship Act, 1991,' referring to a law that froze the status of all religious places of worship as they were on August 15, 1947, the date of India's independence, and prohibits their conversion to any other religion. 'I'm quite shocked that the (Sambhal) court even took 'cognizance of the case' [actively considering the matter]. The damage caused by the court taking cognizance can have a long-term effect,' Lokur told the VOA. 'Instead of directing the case to the High Court, the Supreme Court itself should have entertained the appeal against the order anticipating an escalation of cases. There is an urgent need to avoid even the slightest delay, otherwise cases will keep multiplying causing great damage to the polity.' A 'hasty' order? Muslims have been using the Shahi Jama Masjid Mosque in Sambhal for almost 500 years. In recent years, some right-wing Hindu groups began claiming that Babur, founder of the 16th-century Mughal Empire, destroyed the Harihar Temple and used the rubble to build the mosque. A survey by experts could lead to the discovery of the ruins of the ancient temple, the groups said. After the Hindu groups filed the petition on November 19, the local court in Sambhal ordered a survey of the functioning mosque's premises. In an unusually quick response, a team of experts from the Uttar Pradesh state authorities inspected the site of the mosque on the same day, apparently looking for the ruins of any Hindu temple. When the team returned to the mosque on a second visit on November 24, allegedly not notifying mosque authorities in advance, local Muslims tried to resist them. Violence erupted as the police tried to disperse the Muslim protesters. At one point the police allegedly opened fire, killing six Muslims and injuring many others. Supreme Court lawyer Balraj Singh Malik said the judge at the court in Sambhal acted 'in a haste' when ordering the survey, leading to the six deaths. 'In the case of such a sensitive matter, the court should have given the respondents a chance to speak before passing an order. The due course of law was not followed, and instead an immediate order was issued,' Malik told VOA. A stubborn problem For decades, Hindu right-wing groups have claimed that many mosques and Islamic shrines in the country were built after razing 'thousands' of Hindu temples during the period of the Muslim rulers. The groups launched a campaign insisting that 'one by one' they would reclaim the lands where, according to them, the ancient temples had stood. A year after the 1991 act protecting places of worship came into force, a Hindu mob pulled down the 16th-century Babri Masjid mosque in the Indian city of Ayodhya, triggering communal violence that killed around 2,000 people across the country. Hindu groups claimed that the mosque stood where the Hindu deity Ram had been born. In 2019, the Supreme Court awarded the land where Babri Masjid had stood to Hindus and said that in the future the Places of Worship Act would be strictly enforced and no such Hindu claim against any mosque would be entertained by any court. Yet, over the past few years, right-wing Hindu groups have filed hundreds of petitions with courts across the country seeking control of many mosques and other Islamic structures claiming that they stood on the sites of razed Hindu temples. Professor and social activist Apoorvanand said that while the deaths in Sambhal are concerning, it is more worrying that Indian courts are 'too willing' to initiate processes aimed at turning sacred Islamic sites into disputed structures. 'Across India, courts are admitting petitions claiming that Islamic places of worship were earlier Hindu ones,' the Delhi University professor, who goes by only his first name, told VOA in an email. 'The violence at Sambhal also shows that the civil and police administration work as the coercive arms of the Hindutva bodies. They criminalize protests by Muslims and are not shy of firing on them at the first instance,' he added. Former chairman of the Delhi Minorities Commission, Zafarul-Islam Khan told VOA that old monuments like ancient mosques are 'easy targets' for Hindu nationalist forces because such sites usually do not have any documents from when they were first built. 'The Hindutva party, too, does not possess any papers or historical evidence. So, they demand a 'survey' of any particular mosque and such surveys are done by people sympathetic towards them, eager to support the Hindutva claim,' he said, adding that the Hindu Nationalist groups have prepared a list of 3,000 such mosques, which means that such anti-Muslim cases may continue for years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-top-court-weighs-in-on-mosque-temple-controversy/7882935.html	2024-11-30T19:26:16-08:00	
France accuses countries of 'obstruction' at plastic talks	BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA — France on Sunday accused a handful of countries of obstructing negotiations in South Korea to reach the world's first treaty to curb plastic pollution. 'We also are worried by the continuing obstruction by the so-called like-minded countries,' Olga Givernet, France's minister delegate for energy, told reporters, referring to a group of mostly oil-producing nations. Nearly 200 countries are in the port city of Busan for negotiations on a deal to curb plastic pollution, with only a few hours left on the clock. 'Finding an agreement for us on (an) ambitious treaty that reduces plastic pollution remains an absolute priority for France,' Givernet said. 'We are planning on pushing it, pushing it again.' More than 90% of plastic is not recycled, while plastic production is expected to triple by 2060. Efforts to reach the landmark agreement have been locked over several key sticking points, particularly reducing production and phasing out chemicals believed or known to harm human health. More than 100 countries back those measures and insist a treaty without them will fail to solve the pollution crisis. But around a dozen nations -- mostly producers of plastic precursors derived from fossil fuels -- are strongly opposed. 'We still have a few hours left in these negotiations, there is time to find common ground, but Rwanda cannot accept a toothless treaty,' said Juliet Kabera, director general of the Rwanda Environment Management Authority. The latest draft text remains full of opposing views and contradictory language, and a promised new version after long hours of negotiations into Saturday night has not yet been published.	https://www.voanews.com/a/france-accuses-countries-of-obstruction-at-plastic-talks-/7882924.html	2024-11-30T18:37:44-08:00	
President-elect Trump has sought Orban's take on Ukraine war, sources say	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has held multiple phone conversations with Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban since winning the November 5 presidential election, according to sources who spoke to RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service. Hungarian government sources said Trump has sought Orban’s opinion on ending the Ukraine war, which has continued to drag on since Russia’s full-scale invasion of its neighbor in February 2022. On the campaign trail, Trump criticized the billions of dollars that the United States has poured into Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion. He has also said he could end the war within 24 hours of retaking the White House, a statement that some have interpreted as meaning that Ukraine would have to surrender territory that Russia now occupies. Orban, who has maintained friendly ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Trump, has been critical of EU aid for Ukraine and has obstructed the bloc’s sanctions regime against Moscow. Preparations reportedly are under way for Orban to take a second crack at a peace mission in December to bookend Hungary’s rotating EU presidency after his first attempt in July when Budapest’s tenure started. In a move criticized by several EU leaders, Orban traveled to Moscow to meet Putin in July after a trip to Kyiv with a mystery ceasefire proposal for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. He then traveled to China and finally the United States to meet Trump, who was then on the presidential campaign trail. Details of a potential peace mission in December are not clear, but sources suggested to RFE/RL’s Hungarian Service that it may involve delivering Trump’s messages to Zelenskyy, Putin, and Chinese President Xi Jinping.	https://www.voanews.com/a/president-elect-trump-has-sought-orban-s-take-on-ukraine-war-sources-say/7882921.html	2024-11-30T18:24:37-08:00	
Trump set to nominate former prosecutor to head FBI	WASHINGTON — Republican President-elect Donald Trump announced on Saturday night that he will nominate former National Security official and loyalist Kash Patel to lead the FBI, signaling an intent to replace the bureau's current director, Christopher Wray. Patel, who during Trump's first term advised both the director of national intelligence and the secretary of defense, has previously called for stripping the FBI of its intelligence-gathering role and purging its ranks of any employee who doesn’t support Trump's agenda. 'The biggest problem the FBI has had has come out of its intel shops. I'd break that component out of it. I'd shut down the FBI Hoover building on day one and reopen it the next day as a museum of the deep state,' Patel said in a September interview on the conservative 'Shawn Ryan Show.' 'And I'd take the 7,000 employees that work in that building and send them across America to chase down criminals. Go be cops. You're cops. Go be cops.' With the nomination of Patel, Trump is signaling that he is preparing to carry out his threat to oust Wray, a Republican first appointed by Trump, whose 10-year term at the FBI does not expire until 2027. FBI directors by law are appointed to 10-year terms as a means of insulating the bureau from politics. Wray, whom Trump tapped after firing James Comey in 2017 for investigating his 2016 campaign, has been a frequent target of Trump's supporters' ire. During Wray's tenure, the FBI carried out a court-approved search at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate to look for classified documents. He has also faced criticism for his oversight role of a directive by Attorney General Merrick Garland aimed at working to protect local school boards from violent threats and harassment. Special Counsel Jack Smith, who led the two federal prosecutions against Trump for his role in subverting the 2020 election and retaining classified documents, on November 25 asked the judges overseeing those cases to dismiss them before Trump takes office on January 20, citing a Justice Department policy of not prosecuting a sitting president. Wray had previously signaled no intention of stepping down early and was busy planning events well into his 2025 calendar, according to a person familiar with the matter. Patel, 44, who previously worked as a federal public defender and a federal prosecutor, emerged as a controversial figure during Trump's first term in the White House. He was instrumental in working to lead the House Republicans' probe into the FBI's 2016 investigation into contacts between Trump's 2016 campaign and Russia during his time as an aide to former House Intelligence Committee Chair Devin Nunes. Later, during Trump's first impeachment trial, ex-National Security Council official Fiona Hill told House investigators she was concerned that Patel was secretly serving as a back channel between Trump and Ukraine without authorization. Patel denied those allegations. After Trump left office in January 2021, Patel was one of several people Trump designated as a representative for access to his presidential records. He was one of the few former Trump administration officials who claimed, without evidence, that Trump had declassified all the records in question. He was later subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury in connection with the probe. As a private citizen, Patel wrote a book called 'Government Gangsters' which Trump in 2023 declared would be used as a 'roadmap to end the Deep State's Reign.' Patel's nomination is likely to garner pushback from Senate Democrats and possibly even some Republicans, though Patel has received public support from some high-profile Republicans such as Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-set-to-nominate-former-prosecutor-to-head-fbi-/7882917.html	2024-11-30T18:06:35-08:00	
Namibia opposition leader says party will not recognize vote	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — Namibia's top opposition presidential candidate, Panduleni Itula, said Saturday that his party would not recognize the results of a controversially extended election marred by chaos and allegations of foul play. Speaking just before the close of polls on the final day of voting, Itula, whose Independent Patriots for Change (IPC) is hoping to end 34 years of rule by the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), said that no matter the result, 'the IPC shall not recognize the outcome of that election.' 'The rule of law has been grossly violated, and we cannot call these elections by any means or measure as free, fair and legitimate,' said Itula, who finished second in the 2019 vote. With just 10 of the country's 121 constituencies counted, partial results showed SWAPO's candidate, Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, leading with 48% of the vote, followed by Itula with 29%. Electoral authorities decided to prolong voting in the presidential and legislative polls, after the original election day — Wednesday — was marred by logistical and technical failures that led to hours-long queues, which some voters eventually abandoned. Opposition parties have complained about the chaos and alleged voter suppression by the authorities in the face of a strong turnout for the ruling party's rivals. An organization of southern African human rights lawyers serving as election monitors said that the delays at the ballot box were intentional and widespread. 'There were deliberate delays of voting processes in more than 63% of the total polling stations across the country,' the lawyers said in a report. Itula said that the IPC would 'fight... to nullify the elections through the processes that are established within our electoral process,' calling on Namibia's President Nangolo Mbumba to call a cabinet meeting 'to determine exactly what should be done.' On Saturday, hundreds of people queued up at the sole polling station in the capital Windhoek, where some 2,500 voters had cast their ballots Friday. Sielfriedt Gowaseb, 27, managed to vote in less than 30 minutes Saturday but was critical of the arrangements. 'They should have set up at least another polling station where the majority of Namibians live. We would have needed more venues, one in the suburbs. Most Namibians don't live in the central business district,' he said. Namibia's opposition is hoping to unseat SWAPO, which is facing its toughest challenge ever as disenchanted younger voters across southern Africa reject traditionally dominant liberation-era parties. SWAPO has governed Namibia since leading it to independence from apartheid South Africa in 1990, but high youth unemployment and enduring inequalities have eroded its support. Around 42% of the 1.5 million registered voters are aged under 35. Naita Hishoono, executive director of the Namibia Institute for Democracy, a nonpartisan group, echoed popular dissatisfaction. 'It would have been helpful to open more than 36 polling stations... each constituency should have at least one polling station open to accommodate everybody. Every voter should only stay half an hour to an hour in line and the whole voting process should take no more than 15 minutes,' she said. SWAPO's Nandi-Ndaitwah, 72, could become the first woman to lead the country if she is elected. But she is facing a fierce challenge from Itula, who said that Namibia had been 'betrayed' by the electoral authority's incompetence. The Electoral Commission of Namibia (ECN) has admitted to failures in the organization of the vote, including a shortage of ballot papers and the overheating of electronic tablets used to register voters. Itula, a former dentist and lawyer, came second in the last presidential election with 29% of the vote while standing as an independent. That performance was all the more remarkable for the fact it reduced SWAPO leader Hage Geingob's vote share to just 56%. Geingob, who died in February, had won nearly 87% of the vote five years before that.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-opposition-leader-says-party-will-not-recognize-vote/7882916.html	2024-11-30T17:45:12-08:00	
Biden makes historic first visit by US president to Angola	THE WHITE HOUSE — U.S. President Joe Biden is 'excited' to make his first trip to the African continent next week and will first stop briefly in the small island nation of Cabo Verde before making landfall in the Southwest African nation of Angola, a top White House official told VOA Friday. 'He is excited and really looking forward to the trip,' Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council, told VOA at the White House. 'I think the president really sees this as a way to sum up all that he's tried to put forward during this administration on our Africa strategy.' While there, she said, he will work on three objectives: on bolstering regional security, notably in the neighboring Democratic Republic of Congo; on growing economic opportunities in the region; and on improving technological and scientific cooperation. 'He sees Angola as the perfect place for this,' she said. Some analysts say the fulfillment of Biden's vow to visit Africa — made in 2022 — is well overdue. Biden originally planned to visit Angola in October; he postponed that trip because Hurricane Milton was bearing down on the eastern United States. 'I think coming, as it does, at the very tail end of his administration, without much to, I think, really celebrate in terms of his involvement in Africa, that I think the visit will ring rather hollow,' Cameron Hudson, a senior fellow in the Africa Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, told VOA. The main attraction of the short visit is a major U.S.-financed development project: the 1,300-kilometer Lobito rail corridor, which connects the mineral-rich African interior to the southwestern port. The U.S. says it has pulled together more than $4 billion in U.S. investment on the project. When asked by VOA if Biden will attempt to discuss Angola's many documented human rights problems, Brown repeated a refrain often voiced by Biden administration officials, saying: 'he never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts.' The short stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde could be seen as a way to balance this concern, Michael Walsh, a visiting researcher at the Lasky Center of the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich, told VOA. 'They're trying to, you know, add a stop that provides an opportunity for the Biden administration to say, look, we actually are visiting a flawed democracy as well as a hybrid regime,' he said. He added, 'That provides them with an opportunity to try to, I guess, mitigate some of the criticism that would be forthcoming during the visit by saying that the Biden administration isn't just stopping in one African country. They actually stopped in two and one of those is on the other side of the democracy spectrum.' Angola's president, Joao Lourenco, is a prominent figure on the African continent, using his status as leader of a subcontinental oil giant to build his influence and to work to settle conflicts near and far, both in neighboring Congo and in the West African 'coup belt.' This, Brown said, ties into one of Biden's core beliefs as he prepares to leave office: That the U.S. sees African nations as partners and problem-solvers. While there, she said, Biden plans to deliver remarks on how he sees the future of relations between Washington and the continent. 'I think he wants to leave behind his recognition that African leadership for solving some of these challenges is essential, and that's why he'll be amplifying Angola's role mediating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere,' she said. 'And I think he wants to convey the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angolan partnership, which is in many ways the story of the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-African relationship over many centuries.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-makes-historic-1st-visit-by-us-president-to-angola/7882003.html	2024-11-30T17:29:46-08:00

Trump names pardoned real estate developer Charles Kushner for US ambassador	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump said Saturday he intends to nominate real estate developer Charles Kushner father of Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, to serve as ambassador to France. Trump made the announcement in a Truth Social post, calling Charles Kushner 'a tremendous business leader, philanthropist, & dealmaker.' Kushner is the founder of Kushner Companies, a real estate firm. Jared Kushner is a former White House senior adviser to Trump who is married to Trump’s eldest daughter, Ivanka. The elder Kushner was pardoned by Trump in December 2020 after pleading guilty years earlier to tax evasion and making illegal campaign donations. Prosecutors alleged that after Charles Kushner discovered his brother-in-law was cooperating with federal authorities in an investigation, he hatched a scheme for revenge and intimidation. Kushner hired a prostitute to lure his brother-in-law, then arranged to have the encounter in a New Jersey motel room recorded with a hidden camera and the recording sent to his own sister, the man’s wife, prosecutors said. Kushner eventually pleaded guilty to 18 counts including tax evasion and witness tampering. He was sentenced in 2005 to two years in prison — the most he could receive under a plea deal, but less than what Chris Christie, the U.S. attorney for New Jersey at the time and later governor and Republican presidential candidate, had sought. Christie has blamed Jared Kushner for his firing from Trump’s transition team in 2016, and has called Charles Kushner’s offenses 'one of the most loathsome, disgusting crimes that I prosecuted when I was U.S. attorney.' Trump and the elder Kushner knew each other from real estate circles and their children were married in 2009.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-names-pardoned-real-estate-developer-charles-kushner-for-us-ambassador/7882913.html	2024-11-30T17:20:41-08:00	
Clashes erupt outside Georgia parliament between police, pro-EU protesters	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Violent clashes erupted on Saturday outside Georgia's parliament between police and demonstrators protesting the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks amid a post-election crisis, Agence France-Presse reporters witnessed. Thousands of people gathered in Georgia's capital, Tbilisi, on Saturday for a third night of protests that saw dozens of protesters arrested. The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-European opposition said was fraudulent. Masked police in riot gear fired rubber bullets, tear gas and water cannons as they moved in to disperse protesters hurling fireworks, while flames were seen coming from a window of the parliament building. Demonstrators erected barricades on Tbilisi's main avenue. 'I am afraid — I won't hide it — that many people will get injured, but I am not afraid to stand here,' 39-year-old Tamar Gelashvili told AFP near the parliament building earlier in the day. Protests were also reported in numerous cities across Georgia. 'The actions of some individuals present at the protest became violent shortly after the demonstration began,' said the interior ministry. 'Police will respond appropriately and in accordance with the law to every violation.' More than 100 people have been arrested over the last two days, when law enforcement cracked down on protesters, firing water cannon and tear gas at demonstrators. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's announcement on Thursday that Georgia would not seek accession talks with the EU until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition. Critics accuse Georgian Dream, in power for more than a decade, of having steered the country away from the EU in recent years and of moving closer to Russia, an accusation it denies. Hundreds of public servants, including from the ministries of foreign affairs, defense and education, as well as a number of judges, issued joint statements protesting Kobakhidze's decision. Some 160 Georgian diplomats criticized the move as contradicting the constitution and leading the country 'into international isolation.' A number of Georgia's ambassadors resigned in protest. On Friday, AFP reporters saw riot police fire water cannon and tear gas at pro-EU protesters gathered outside parliament who tossed eggs and fireworks. Clashes broke out later between protesters and police, who moved in to clear the area, beating demonstrators — some of whom threw objects — and journalists, deliberately targeting those identified as members of the media. Georgia's special investigation service said it had opened a probe into 'allegations of abuse of official authority through violence by law enforcement officers against protesters and media representatives.' More than 100 schools and universities suspended academic activities in protest. Pro-Western opposition parties are boycotting the new parliament, while President Salome Zurabishvili, who is at loggerheads with Georgian Dream, has sought to annul the election results through the country's constitutional court. In an exclusive interview to AFP on Saturday, Zurabishvili said she will not step down until last month's contested parliamentary elections are re-run. The Paris-born former French diplomat said on Saturday that she had set up a 'national council' — consisting of opposition parties and civil society representatives — that will ensure 'stability in this country.' 'I will be the representative of this legitimate, stable transition.' After the October vote, a group of Georgia's leading election monitors said they had evidence of a complex scheme of large-scale electoral fraud. Brussels has demanded an investigation into what it said were serious irregularities reported by election monitors. Georgian Dream MPs voted unanimously on Thursday for Kobakhidze to continue as prime minister, even as the opposition boycotted parliament, deepening a serious legitimacy crisis at the legislature and the government. The crackdown on protests has provoked international condemnation. 'We condemn excessive force used against Georgians exercising their freedom to protest and have suspended our Strategic Partnership with Georgia,' U.S. State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said on Saturday. 'Georgian Dream's decision to suspend EU accession is a betrayal of the Georgian constitution.' France, Britain, Ukraine, Poland, Sweden and Lithuania were among the countries to voice concern. The human rights office of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) said: 'The action of law enforcement officials while policing peaceful protests in Georgia is of deep concern and a serious breach of the right to freedom of peaceful assembly.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/clashes-erupt-outside-georgia-parliament-between-pro-eu-protesters-police-/7882908.html	2024-11-30T17:12:19-08:00	
Activists: Mexico breaks up 2 migrant caravans heading to US	TAPACHULA, Mexico — Mexican immigration authorities have broken up two small migrant caravans headed to the U.S. border, activists said Saturday. Some migrants were bused to cities in southern Mexico, and others were offered transit papers. The action comes a week after U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened to slap 25% tariffs on Mexican products unless the country does more to stem the flow of migrants to the U.S. border. On Wednesday, Trump wrote that Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum had agreed to stop unauthorized migration across the border into the United States. Sheinbaum wrote on her social media accounts the same day that 'migrants and caravans are taken care of before they reach the border.' Migrant rights activist Luis Garcia Villagran said the breaking-up of the two caravans appeared to be part of 'an agreement between the president of Mexico and the president of the United States.' The first of the caravans started out from the southern Mexico city of Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, on November 5, the day Trump was elected. At its height it had about 2,500 people. In almost four weeks of walking, it had gone about 270 miles (430 kilometers) to Tehuantepec in the state of Oaxaca. In Tehuantepec, Mexican immigration officials offered the tired migrants free bus rides to other cities in southern or central Mexico. 'They took some of us to Acapulco, others to Morelia, and others from our group to Oaxaca city,' said Barbara Rodriguez, an opposition supporter who left her native Venezuela after that country's contested presidential elections earlier this year. Rodriguez said by telephone she later caught a bus on her own to Mexico City. The second caravan of about 1,500 migrants set out on November 20 and made it about 140 miles (225 kilometers) to the town of Tonala, in Chiapas state. There, authorities offered a sort of transit visa that allows travel across Mexico for 20 days. Sheinbaum has said she is confident that a tariff war with the United States can be averted. But her statement — the day after she held a phone call with Trump — did not make clear who had offered what. Apart from the much larger first caravans in 2018 and 2019 — which were provided buses to ride part of the way north — no caravan has ever reached the U.S. border walking or hitchhiking in any cohesive way, though some individual members have made it. For years, migrant caravans have often been blocked, harassed or prevented from hitching rides by Mexican police and immigration agents. They have also frequently been rounded up or returned to areas near the Guatemalan border.	https://www.voanews.com/a/activists-mexico-breaks-up-2-migrant-caravans-heading-to-us-/7882905.html	2024-11-30T16:52:51-08:00	
Snow blankets parts of US during busy holiday travel weekend	BUFFALO, NEW YORK — The first big snowfall of the season blanketed towns along Lake Erie on Saturday in the middle of the hectic holiday travel and shopping weekend. Numbing cold and heavy snow are forecast to persist into next week and cause hazards in the Great Lakes, Plains and Midwest regions. The heavy snow led to a state of emergency declaration in parts of New York and a disaster declaration in Pennsylvania, with officials warning of dangerous conditions for Thanksgiving travelers trying to return home. 'Travel will be extremely difficult and hazardous this weekend, especially in areas where multiple feet of snow may accumulate very quickly,' the National Weather Service said. Part of I-90 in Pennsylvania was closed, as were westbound lanes of the New York Thruway heading toward Pennsylvania. Nearly 2 feet (61 centimeters) of snow fell in parts of New York, Ohio and Michigan, and 29 inches (73 centimeters) was recorded in Pennsylvania's northwestern tip. With roads in some parts impassable in northwestern Pennsylvania, scores of people took refuge overnight in the lobby and hallways of a fully booked Holiday Inn near I-90. Hotel staffer Jeremiah Weatherley said dozens of people rolled in as the snow piled up, and workers opened the conference room and gave them blankets to sleep on the floor. 'It was hard to manage, but we had no choice,' he said. 'They just showed up, and we don't want to turn people away.' Weatherley was handing out bagels, juice and cereal Saturday morning as people helped one another dig out their cars from the snow. 'Everyone helped each other,' he said. 'It was pretty cool.' This week's blast of Arctic air also brought temperatures of 10 to 20 degrees Fahrenheit below average to the Northern Plains, the weather service said, prompting cold advisories for parts of North Dakota. Frigid air was expected to move over the eastern third of the United States by Monday, with temperatures about 10 degrees below average. Parts of Michigan were battered by lake-effect snow, which happens when warm, moist air rising from a body of water mixes with cold dry air overhead. Bands of snow that have been rolling off Lake Superior for the past three days buried parts of the Upper Peninsula under 2 feet (61 centimeters) or more, said Lily Chapman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service's office in Marquette, Michigan. Twenty-seven inches (69 centimeters) of snow was on the ground just northeast of Ironwood, in the Upper Peninsula's western reaches, she said. Another 2 feet (61 centimeters) fell in Munising, in the eastern part of the peninsula. Chapman said continued lake-effect snow could add more than a foot (30.5 centimeters) over the eastern Upper Peninsula through Monday morning, with 6 to 10 inches (15 to 25 centimeters) or higher to the west. Meanwhile steady winds that trained snow bands Friday on Gaylord, Michigan, dumped 24.8 inches (63 centimeters), setting a new single-day record for the city, which sits in a region dotted by ski resorts, said Keith Berger, a meteorologist with the weather service's Gaylord office. The previous record of 17.0 inches (43 centimeters) was from March 9, 1942. The snowfall was good news for Treetops Resort, which features 80 acres (32 hectares) of ski hill terrain among its 2,000 acres (809 hectares), said Doug Hoeh, the resort's director of recreation. It boosted the base that snowmaking machines will be adding to in the coming days before the resort opens for the season next weekend. 'Obviously when you get that much snowfall, it's great for the snow hills, but it's bad for the parking lots, so we're kind of digging out,' Hoeh said. 'But we're close to being ready to pull the trigger on skiing, and the natural snowfall definitely helps.' In Pennsylvania, Governor Josh Shapiro signed a proclamation of disaster emergency and said parts of Erie County in the state's northwest had already received nearly 2 feet (1 meter) of snow with more expected through Monday night. State Police responded to nearly 200 incidents during the 24-hour period from 6 a.m. Friday to 6 a.m. Saturday, officials said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/snow-blankets-parts-of-us-during-busy-holiday-travel-weekend-/7882903.html	2024-11-30T16:35:37-08:00	
9 killed in Ethiopia Oromia region attack	ADDIS ABABA, ETHIOPIA — Residents and relatives say at least nine people were killed during an attack in the Arsi Zone of the Oromia region of Ethiopia on Thursday. Adebebu Workineh is a resident of the Shirka Woreda — or district — in the Arsi Zone, about 250 kilometers southeast of Addis Ababa. He told VOA his younger brother, Haile Workineh, was among the nine victims. 'The perpetrators called him from his house and later killed him at a nearby river alongside others,' Workineh said in Amharic. Among the dead were women and elders, he added. 'During the raid I heard [about] the abduction by phone, but I thought they would ask for ransom as usual. They were carrying rifles, and we were afraid to confront them at the time,' he said in Amharic. A second resident of Shirka, who would not give his name because of fear for his safety, said most of the victims were Christians. The whereabouts of four other people who were abducted are not known, he told VOA. Social media sites published purported video of nine bodies wrapped in white clothes being buried together. VOA was not able to independently verify the video. The Arsi Zone, a region known for agriculture, is now marred by violence and killing. Residents blamed the Oromo Liberation Army, an outlawed rebel group fighting against the Ethiopian government army, for the killings. Jiregna Gudeta, an adviser to the OLA commander, told VOA he has no detailed information about the incident and denied OLA was involved. Residents say local authorities do little to protect civilians. The ENAT Party, one of the opposition political parties in Ethiopia, has condemned the attack. 'Our concern is not the dead ones, we [are] reaching out to the state officers for the people who are about to be the victim of such killing, we immediately call for the state to act,' said Getnet Worku, secretary-general of the party. Oromia regional authorities declined to comment on the attack. Peace rallies were held in six zones in the Oromia region in mid-November. Participants of the demonstrations said the aim was to condemn OLA and demand peace in the region. Oromia region spokesperson Hailu Adugna said at the time that the rallies were organized by the local communities and that government officials had no role. But some witnesses told VOA that government officials were urging people to participate in the demonstrations. Jiregna, reacting to the demonstrations in mid-November, said their group is ready to resolve conflicts peacefully. He said it is doubtful whether the people or the government organized the rally for peace. A previous round of peace talks last year between Ethiopia's federal government and the OLA in Tanzania's semi-autonomous island of Zanzibar — has failed to end the violence. The two sides blamed each other for the failure of the talks. The government cited 'unrealistic demands' by the armed group while OLA accused the government of failing to address 'fundamental problems' facing the country, according to Reuters. This story originated in VOA's Horn of Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/killed-in-ethiopia-oromia-region-attack/7882733.html	2024-11-30T15:36:38-08:00	
After entering Aleppo, Syrian insurgents advance to nearby province	BEIRUT — Thousands of Syrian insurgents took over most of Aleppo on Saturday, establishing positions in the city and controlling its airport before expanding their shock offensive to a nearby province. They faced little to no resistance from government troops, according to fighters and activists. A war monitor, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the insurgents led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham seized control of Aleppo International Airport, the first international airport to be controlled by insurgents. Thousands of fighters moved on, facing almost no defense from government forces, to seize towns and villages in northern Hama, a province where they had a presence before being expelled by government troops in 2016. They claimed Saturday evening to have entered Hama city. The surprise offensive is a huge embarrassment for Syria's President Bashar Assad and raised questions about his armed forces' preparedness. The insurgent offensive launched from their stronghold in the country's northwest appeared to have been planned for years. It comes at a time when Assad's allies were preoccupied with their own conflicts. Turkey, a main backer of Syrian opposition groups, said its diplomatic efforts had failed to stop government attacks on opposition-held areas in recent weeks, which were in violation of a de-escalation agreement sponsored by Russia, Iran and Ankara. Turkish security officials said a limited offensive by the rebels was planned to stop government attacks and allow civilians to return, but the offensive expanded as Syrian government forces began to retreat from their positions. Two-pronged attack The insurgents, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and including Turkey-backed fighters, launched their shock offensive Wednesday. They first staged a two-pronged attack in Aleppo and the Idlib countryside, entering Aleppo two days later and securing a strategic town that lies on the highway that links the city to the capital and the coast. By Saturday evening, they seized at least four towns in the central Hama province and claimed to have entered the provincial capital. Syria's armed forces said in a statement Saturday that to absorb the large attack on Aleppo and save lives, it redeployed troops and equipment and was preparing a counterattack. The statement acknowledged that insurgents entered large parts of the city but said they have not established bases or checkpoints. Later Saturday, the armed forces sought to dispel what it said were lies about its forces retreating or defecting, saying the general command was carrying out its duties in 'combatting terrorist organizations.' The return of the insurgents to Aleppo was their first since 2016, following a grueling military campaign in which Assad's forces were backed by Russia, Iran and its allied groups. The 2016 battle for Aleppo was a turning point in the war between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters after 2011 protests of Assad's rule turned into an all-out war. After appearing to be losing control of the country to the rebels, the Aleppo battle secured Assad's hold on strategic areas of Syria, with opposition factions and their foreign backers controlling areas on the periphery. This week's lightning offensive threatened to reignite the country's civil war, which had been largely in a stalemate for years. Late Friday, witnesses said two airstrikes hit the edge of Aleppo, targeting insurgent reinforcements and falling near residential areas. The Observatory said 20 fighters were killed. Insurgents were filmed outside police headquarters, in the city center, and outside the Aleppo citadel, the medieval palace in the old city center, and one of the largest in the world. They tore down posters of Assad. The push into Aleppo followed weeks of simmering low-level violence, including government attacks on opposition-held areas. The offensive came as Iran-linked groups, primarily Lebanon's Hezbollah, which has backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battles at home. A ceasefire in Hezbollah's two-month war with Israel took effect Wednesday, the same day that Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days. Speaking from the heart of the city in Saadallah Al-Jabri square, opposition fighter Mohammad Al Abdo said it was his first time back in Aleppo in 13 years, when his older brother was killed at the start of the war. Abdulkafi Alhamdo, a teacher who fled Aleppo in 2016 and returned Friday night after hearing the insurgents were inside, described 'mixed feelings of pain, sadness and old memories.' 'As I entered Aleppo, I kept telling myself this is impossible. How did this happen?' Alhamdo said he walked through the city at night visiting the Aleppo citadel, where the insurgents raised their flags, a major square and the university of Aleppo, as well as the last spot he was in before he was forced to leave for the countryside. 'I walked in (the empty) streets of Aleppo, shouting, 'People, people of Aleppo. We are your sons,'' he told The Associated Press in a series of messages. Aleppo residents reported hearing clashes and gunfire, but most stayed indoors. Some fled the fighting. Schools and government offices were closed Saturday as most people stayed indoors, according to Sham FM radio, a pro-government station. Bakeries were open. Witnesses said the insurgents deployed security forces around the city to prevent any acts of violence or looting. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said Friday Aleppo's two key public hospitals were reportedly full of patients while many private facilities closed. In social media posts, the insurgents were pictured outside of the citadel, the medieval palace in the old city center, and one of the largest in the world. The Syrian Kurdish-led administration in the country's east said nearly 3,000 people, most of them students, had arrived in their region after fleeing the fighting in Aleppo, which has a sizeable Kurdish population. On a state TV morning show Saturday, commentators said army reinforcements and Russia's assistance would repel the 'terrorist groups,' blaming Turkey for supporting the insurgents' push into Aleppo and Idlib provinces.	https://www.voanews.com/a/after-entering-aleppo-syrian-insurgents-advance-to-nearby-province-/7882716.html	2024-11-30T15:11:22-08:00	
Hamas releases video of US-Israeli hostage in Gaza	JERUSALEM — The Palestinian militant group Hamas released on Saturday a video of an Israeli-American hostage pleading for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to secure his release. The mother of hostage Edan Alexander said she was shaken by the 3 1/2-minute video that showed the 20-year-old captive looking pale and seated in a dark space against a wall. He identified himself and addressed his family, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Trump. The video 'gives us hope, but it also shows how difficult it is for Edan and for the other hostages, and how much they are crying out and praying for us to rescue them,' his mother, Yael Alexander, said at a Tel Aviv rally calling for the hostages' release. 'My dear, beloved Edan, we miss you painfully,' she said before she called on Israel's leaders to end the war in Gaza and make a deal with Hamas to release the hostages. Netanyahu said in a statement that the video was cruel psychological warfare and that he had told Alexander's family in a phone call that Israel was working tirelessly to bring the hostages home. Alexander, a soldier at the time, was abducted and taken to Gaza during the October 7, 2023, attack by Hamas on southern Israel. Around half of the 101 foreign and Israeli hostages still held incommunicado in Gaza are believed to still be alive. Hamas leaders were expected to arrive in Cairo on Saturday for ceasefire talks with Egyptian officials to explore ways to reach a deal that could secure the release of hostages in return for Palestinian prisoners. The fresh bid comes after Washington said this week it was reviving efforts toward that goal. The Hostages Families Forum urged the administrations of both outgoing U.S. President Joe Biden and Trump — who takes office in January — to step up efforts to secure a hostage release. 'The hostages' lives hang by a thread,' the group said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hamas-releases-video-of-us-israeli-hostage-in-gaza-/7882705.html	2024-11-30T13:58:55-08:00	
Trump threatens BRICS nations with 100% tariff if they replace US dollar	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump threatened 100% tariffs Saturday against a bloc of nine nations if they act to undermine the U.S. dollar. His threat was directed at countries in the so-called BRICS alliance, which consists of Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Egypt, Ethiopia, Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Turkey, Azerbaijan and Malaysia have applied to become members of the alliance, and several other countries have expressed interest in joining. While the U.S. dollar is by far the most-used currency in global business and has survived past challenges to its preeminence, members of the alliance and other developing nations say they are fed up with America's dominance of the global financial system. Trump, in a Truth Social post, said, 'We require a commitment from these Countries that they will neither create a new BRICS Currency, nor back any other Currency to replace the mighty U.S. Dollar or, they will face 100% Tariffs, and should expect to say goodbye to selling into the wonderful U.S. Economy.' At a summit of BRICS nations in October, Russian President Vladimir Putin accused the U.S. of 'weaponizing' the dollar and described it as a 'big mistake.' 'It's not us who refuse to use the dollar,' Putin said at the time. 'But if they don't let us work, what can we do? We are forced to search for alternatives.' Russia has specifically pushed for the creation of a new payment system that would offer an alternative to the global bank messaging network, SWIFT, and allow Moscow to dodge Western sanctions and trade with partners. Trump said there is 'no chance' BRICS will replace the U.S. dollar in global trade and any country that tries to make that happen 'should wave goodbye to America.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-threatens-brics-nations-with-100-tariff-if-they-replace-us-dollar-/7882696.html	2024-11-30T13:16:28-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau returns home without assurances US tariffs are off table	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau returned home Saturday after his meeting with Donald Trump without assurances the president-elect will back away from threatened tariffs on all products from the major American trading partner. Trump called the talks productive but signaled no retreat from a pledge that Canada says unfairly lumps it in with Mexico over the flow of drugs and migrants into the United States. After the leaders' hastily arranged dinner Friday night at Trump's Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, Trudeau spoke of 'an excellent conversation.' Trump said in a Truth Social post later Saturday that they discussed 'many important topics that will require both Countries to work together to address.' Among the issues in need of such cooperation, Trump cited fentanyl and the 'Drug Crisis that has decimated so many lives as a result of Illegal Immigration,' fair trade deals 'that do not jeopardize American Workers' and the U.S. trade deficit with its ally to the north. Trump asserted that the prime minister had made 'a commitment to work with us to end this terrible devastation' of American families from fentanyl from China reaching the United States through its neighbors. The U.S., he said, 'will no longer sit idly by as our Citizens become victims to the scourge of this Drug Epidemic.' The Republican president-elect has threatened to impose a 25% tax on all products entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico as one of his first executive orders when he takes office in January. U.S. customs agents seized 43 pounds of fentanyl at the Canadian border last fiscal year, compared with 21,100 pounds at the Mexican border. On immigration, the U.S. Border Patrol made 56,530 arrests at the Mexican border in October alone and 23,721 arrests at the Canadian border between October 2023 and September 2024 — and Canadian officials say they are ready to make new investments in border security. Trudeau called Trump after the Republican's social media posts about the tariffs last Monday and they agreed to meet, according to an official familiar with the matter who was not authorized to publicly discuss details of the private talks. The official said other countries are calling Canadian officials to hear how the meeting was arranged and to ask for advice. Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, after speaking with Trump on the telephone, said Thursday she was confident a tariff war with Washington would be averted. At the dinner that was said to last three hours, Trump said he and Trudeau also discussed energy, trade and the Arctic. A second official cited defense, Ukraine, NATO, China, the Mideast, pipelines and the Group of Seven meeting in Canada next year as other issues that arose. Trudeau's office said in a statement that the leaders 'shared a productive wide-ranging discussion' centering on 'collaboration and strengthening our relationship,' adding, 'As Canada's closest friend and ally, the United States is our key partner, and we are committed to working together in the interests of Canadians and Americans.' Trump, during his first term as president, once called Trudeau 'weak' and 'dishonest,' but it was the prime minister who was the first G7 leader to visit Trump since the November 5 election. 'Tariffs are a crucial issue for Canada and a bold move was in order. Perhaps it was a risk, but a risk worth taking,' said Daniel Beland, a political science professor at McGill University in Montreal. Trudeau said Friday that Trump was elected because he promised to bring down the cost of groceries but now was talking about adding 25% to the cost of all kinds of products, including potatoes from Prince Edward Island in Atlantic Canada. 'It is important to understand that Donald Trump, when he makes statements like that, he plans on carrying them out. There's no question about it,' Trudeau said. 'Our responsibility is to point out that he would not just be harming Canadians, who work so well with the United States, but he would actually be raising prices for Americans citizens as well and hurting American industry and business,' he said. The threatened tariffs could essentially blow up the North American trade pact that Trump's team negotiated during his first term. Trudeau noted they were able to successfully renegotiate the deal, which he calls a win for both countries. When Trump imposed higher tariffs as president, other countries responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own. Canada, for instance, announced billions of new duties in 2018 against the U.S. in a response to new taxes on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada is the top export destination for 36 U.S. states. Nearly $2.7 billion worth of goods and services cross the border each day. About 60% of U.S. crude oil imports are from Canada, and 85% of U.S. electricity imports are from Canada. Canada is also the largest foreign supplier of steel, aluminum and uranium to the U.S. and has 34 critical minerals and metals that the Pentagon is eager for and investing in for national security. Canada is one of the most trade-dependent countries in the world, and 77% of Canada's exports go to the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7882686.html	2024-11-30T12:48:49-08:00	
Kosovo arrests 8 linked to canal explosion, tensions with Serbia rise	PRISTINA, KOSOVO — Kosovo's Interior minister Xhelal Svecla said Saturday that police had arrested eight people after an explosion hit a canal that sends water to its two main power plants, an incident Pristina labeled a 'terrorist act' by neighboring Serbia. 'Somehow we managed to fix the damage, arrest the suspects and confiscate a huge arsenal of weapons,' Svecla said during a live-streamed news conference. Serbia's President Aleksandar Vucic denied what he said were 'baseless accusations' about Belgrade's involvement in the incident, which occurred Friday around 7 p.m. (1800 GMT). Police commander Gazmend Hoxha said those arrested 'are suspected of inciting, organizing and even executing these recent terrorist acts and in particular the one in the canal of Iber Lepenc.' Hoxha said an initial investigation had shown that between 15 and 20 kilos of explosives were used in the attack. Police raided 10 locations, confiscating more than 200 military uniforms, six shoulder-fired rocket launchers, long weapons, pistols and ammunition, he said. Police said most of the people arrested belong to the local Serb organization Civilna Zastita (Civil Protection), which the government in Kosovo has declared as a terrorist organization. Reuters was unable to contact the group. Tensions with Serbia The explosion has increased tensions between the two Balkan countries. Ethnic Albanian-majority Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 almost a decade after a guerrilla uprising against its rule, but Serbia has not recognized Kosovo as an independent state. Relations remain especially frayed in the north of the country where the blast occurred, and where the Serb minority refuses to recognize Kosovo's statehood and still sees Belgrade as their capital. Kosovo's Security Council, which held emergency talks early Saturday, said it had activated armed forces to prevent similar attacks. Security was already heightened after two recent attacks where hand grenades were hurled at a police station and municipality building in northern Kosovo where ethnic Serbians live. 'The Security Council has approved additional measures to strengthen security around critical facilities and services such as bridges, transformer stations, antennas, lakes, canals,' the council said in a statement Saturday. NATO, which has maintained a peacekeeping force in Kosovo since 1999, condemned the attack in a statement Saturday. Its personnel have provided security to the canal and the surrounding area since the blast, it said. A Reuters reporter visited the site Saturday, where silt had poured through a hole in the canal's concrete wall. Workers had installed a series of large tubes to bypass the leak. Power supplies appeared to be largely intact, but the drinking water supply was disrupted in some areas.

Russian police raid Moscow nightclubs in LGBTQ+ crackdown	MOSCOW — Russian police raided several bars and nightclubs across Moscow on Saturday as part of the government’s crackdown on 'LGBTQ+ propaganda,' state media reported. Smartphones, laptops and video cameras were seized, while clubgoers had their documents inspected by officers, Russia’s Tass news agency said, citing sources in law enforcement. The raids come exactly a year since Russia’s Supreme Court ruled that the 'LGBTQ+ movement should be banned as an 'extremist organization.' Its decision followed a decadeslong crackdown on LGBTQ+ rights in Russia, where President Vladimir Putin has touted 'traditional family values' as a cornerstone of his quarter-century in power. Footage shared on social media appeared to show police ordering partygoers to lie on the floor as officers moved through Moscow’s Arma nightclub. The capital’s Mono bar was also targeted, Russian media reported. In a post on Telegram on Saturday, the club’s management didn't directly reference an incident with law enforcement, but wrote, 'Friends, we’re so sorry that what happened, happened. They didn’t find anything forbidden. We live in such times, but life must go on.' Police also detained the head of the 'Men Travel' tour agency Saturday under anti-LGBT laws, Tass reported. The news agency said that the 48-year-old was suspected of preparing a trip for 'the supporters of nontraditional sexual values' to visit Egypt over Russia’s New Year's holidays. The raids mirror the concerns of Russian activists who warned that Moscow’s designation of the 'LGBTQ+ movement' as 'extremist' — despite it not being an official entity — could see Russian authorities crack down at will on groups or individuals. Other recent laws have also served to put pressure on those that the Russian government believes aren't in line with the country’s 'traditional values.' On November 23, Putin signed into law a bill banning the adoption of Russian children by citizens of countries where gender-affirming care is legal. The Kremlin leader also approved legislation that outlaws the spread of material that encourages people not to have children.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-police-raid-moscow-nightclubs-in-lgbtq-crackdown-/7882661.html	2024-11-30T11:56:06-08:00	
Rapid collapse of Syrian forces around Aleppo stuns many	CAIRO — The rapid collapse of Syrian government forces inside and around the country's second-largest city, Aleppo, has caught many observers by surprise and is causing a domino effect on many parts of the country. Rebel fighters, who oppose Syrian President Bashar Assad and include those from the terrorist Jabhat al Nusra group, fired weapons Saturday inside Syria's northern 'economic capital' of Aleppo after the withdrawal of government forces from the city. Amateur video showed rebel fighters in control of Aleppo's central Saadallah Jabari Square, in addition to Aleppo University and the city's provincial government headquarters. Saudi-owned Al Arabiya TV reported that Syrian government forces also withdrew from Aleppo's civilian and military airports. Abu Dhabi-based Sky News Arabia showed amateur video of rebels apparently in control of the military airport. Britain-based Syrian analyst Rami Abdulrahman, of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told Arab media that Iranian forces and their proxy militia allies have withdrawn from many positions in and around Aleppo. Abdulrahman said that Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces withdrew from the region after a drone attacked them and their allies, including Hezbollah and Iraqi Shiite militia fighters, who pulled out alongside them. Arab media reported that the entire region between Aleppo and the rebel-controlled province of Idlib had fallen and that large towns south of Aleppo on the main Aleppo-Damascus highway, including Saraqib and Maarat al-Numan, also were captured. It was not clear if other large Syrian cities would fall, but Joshua Landis, who heads the Middle East studies program at the University of Oklahoma, told VOA that all eyes are now on Hama, which is Syria's fourth-largest city. Landis said he believes it is possible the capital of Damascus may fall, because government supporters are dispirited and have lost the will to fight. Despite Turkish government denials, Landis says the entire operation has 'Turkish fingerprints written all over it,' since 'all the arms and food and money that enter Idlib come from Turkey.' 'I'm sure Turkey wanted to give Assad a slap in the face and bring him to the [negotiating] table,' Landis said, 'but it's clearly set off dominoes that I don't think anyone expected [to fall].' Landis said there are several reasons for Assad's weakness, including Israel's 'pulling the stuffing out of [his ally] Hezbollah' and the 'relentless Israeli pounding of Syrian government positions' and those of their allies inside the country since the outset of the Gaza conflict on October 7, 2023. Syrian analysts also told Arab media that the Iran-Syria axis 'has been weakened since the road from Tehran to Beirut is no longer open and arms are no longer able to reach Iran's proxy militia allies. In addition, Syrian ally Russia 'has its hands tied at the moment because of its conflict with Ukraine.' Turkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan denied that his government had any responsibility in the Syrian rebel onslaught on Aleppo. 'Turkey is playing an increasing role in trying to achieve peace in the region.' Russian forces reportedly pulled out of several strategic positions in the region overnight, but Russian and Syrian warplanes bombed rebel forces in Aleppo and other parts of the region, causing numerous rebel casualties, according to the Syrian military.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rapid-collapse-of-syrian-forces-around-aleppo-stuns-many/7882626.html	2024-11-30T10:27:37-08:00	
East African summit urges peace in eastern Congo	ARUSHA, TANZANIA — East African heads of state made another push for peace Saturday in eastern Congo, but its prospects remained bleak following a regional summit that was marked by the Congolese president's absence and an early departure of his Rwandan counterpart. A communique read at the end of the closed-door meeting of the East African Community in Arusha, Tanzania, stated only the need to combine regional and broader peace initiatives for sustainable peace in eastern Congo. Violence has reemerged in one of the world's most protracted conflicts in eastern Congo, where Congo’s government accused the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group of 'ethnic cleansing' in mineral-rich areas close to Rwanda's border. Rwandan President Paul Kagame left shortly after the closed-door meeting in Arusha. There was no official explanation for Congolese President Felix Tshisekedi's absence at the summit. Congo alleges that Rwanda has been involved in war crimes in the east, and U.S. and U.N. experts accuse it of giving military backing to M23. Rwanda denies the claim, but in February admitted that it has troops and missile systems in eastern Congo to safeguard its security, pointing to a buildup of Congolese forces near the border. U.N. experts estimate there are up to 4,000 Rwandan forces in Congo. A July truce brokered by the United States and Angola has reduced the fighting between Rwandan and Congolese forces but fighting between M23 and other militias continues. Other leaders at the summit were Presidents Salva Kiir of South Sudan, Samia Suluhu Hassan of Tanzania, William Ruto of Kenya, Yoweri Museveni of Uganda and Hassan Sheikh Mohamud of Somalia. Burundi was represented by its vice president. Ruto was elected as the new chairperson of the EAC Summit, succeeding Kiir. 'Our focus must be on increasing competitiveness, promoting value-added production and boosting intra-regional trade to create jobs and transform our economies,' Ruto said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/east-african-summit-urges-peace-in-eastern-congo/7882618.html	2024-11-30T10:16:30-08:00	
Polish leader visits defensive fortifications on border with Russia	DABROWKA, POLAND — Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk traveled Saturday to his country's border with the Russian region of Kaliningrad to inspect progress in the construction of military fortifications along the eastern frontier, calling it 'an investment in peace.' Tusk’s visit comes a month before Poland is to take over the rotating presidency of the 27-member European Union. Polish officials say their priority is to urge Europeans to beef up defenses at a time of Russian aggression and with change coming soon in Washington. Some European leaders are concerned that the incoming administration of Donald Trump might be less committed to Europe’s defense. Tusk also proposed this week that Poland and the Nordic and Baltic countries carry out joint navy patrols in the strategically important Baltic Sea, following the suspected sabotage of undersea data cables. Poland's government and army began building the system dubbed East Shield this year. It will eventually include approximately 800 kilometers (500 miles) along the Polish borders with Russia and Belarus, at a time when Western officials accuse Russia of waging hybrid attacks against the West that include sabotage, the weaponization of migration, disinformation and other hostile measures. 'The better the Polish border is guarded, the more difficult it is to access for those with bad intentions,' Tusk said at a news conference near the village of Dabrowka as he stood in front of concrete antitank barriers. Poland has been at the mercy of aggressive neighbors over the past centuries and has become a leading European voice for security at a time when France and Germany are weakened by internal political problems. Poland aims to spend 4.7% of its gross domestic product on defense next year, making it one of NATO's leaders in defense spending. Tusk's government estimates that the strategic military project will cost at least 10 billion zlotys ($2.5 billion). Poland’s borders with Russia, Belarus — as well as Ukraine — are the easternmost external borders of the European Union and NATO. Tusk said he expected the East Shield to eventually be expanded to protect the small Baltic states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania. 'Everything we are doing here — and we will also be doing this on the border with Belarus and Ukraine — is to deter and discourage a potential aggressor, which is why it is truly an investment in peace,' Tusk said. 'We will spend billions of zlotys on this, but right now the whole of Europe is observing these investments and our actions with great satisfaction and will support them if necessary.' Tusk did not elaborate on his plans for reinforcing the border with Ukraine, a close ally. Along the frontier, antitank barriers known as 'hedgehogs' will be integrated with natural barriers like ditches. Tusk said parts of the project are not visible to the naked eye, but it is nonetheless the largest project of its nature in Europe since the end of World War II. The plans also include the construction of threat reconnaissance and detection systems, forward bases, logistics hubs, warehouses and the deployment of antidrone systems, the state news agency PAP reported.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polish-leader-visits-defensive-fortifications-on-border-with-russia/7882608.html	2024-11-30T10:09:20-08:00	
What to know about plastic pollution crisis as treaty talks conclude	BUSAN, SOUTH KOREA — The world’s nations will wrap up negotiating a treaty this weekend to address the global plastic pollution crisis. Their meeting is scheduled to conclude Sunday or early Monday in Busan, South Korea, where many environmental organizations have flocked to push for a treaty to address the volume of production and toxic chemicals used in plastic products. Greenpeace said it escalated its pressure Saturday by sending four international activists to Daesan, South Korea, who boarded a tanker headed into port to load chemicals used to make plastics. Graham Forbes, who leads the Greenpeace delegation in Busan, said the action is meant to remind world leaders they have a clear choice: Deliver a treaty that protects people and the planet, or side with industry and sacrifice the health of every living person and future generations. Here’s what to know about plastics: Every year, the world produces more than 400 million tons of new plastic. The use of plastics has quadrupled over the past 30 years. Plastic is ubiquitous. And every day, the equivalent of 2,000 garbage trucks full of plastic are dumped into the world’s oceans, rivers and lakes, the U.N. said. Most nations agreed to make the first global, legally binding plastic pollution accord, including in the oceans, by the end of 2024. Plastic production could climb about 70% by 2040 without policy changes. The production and use of plastics globally is set to reach 736 million tons by 2040, according to the intergovernmental Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Panama is leading an effort to address the exponential growth of plastic production as part of the treaty, supported by more than 100 countries. There’s just too much plastic, said Juan Carlos Monterrey, head of Panama’s delegation. 'If we don’t have production in this treaty, it is not only going to be horribly sad, but the treaty may as well be called the greenwashing recycling treaty, not the plastics treaty,' he said in an interview. 'Because the problem is not going to be fixed.' China, the United States and Germany are the biggest plastics players. China was by far the biggest exporter of plastic products in 2023, followed by Germany and the U.S., according to the Plastics Industry Association. Together, the three nations account for 33% of the total global plastics trade, the association said. The United States supports having an article in the treaty that addresses supply, or plastic production, a senior member of the U.S. delegation told The Associated Press Saturday. Most plastic ends up as waste Less than 10% of plastics are recycled. Most of the world’s plastic goes to landfills, pollutes the environment or is burned. Sarah Dunlop, head of plastics and human health at the Minderoo Foundation, said chemicals are leaching out of plastics and 'making us sick.' The International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Plastics held an event about the impact of plastics Saturday on the sidelines of the talks. They want the treaty to fully recognize their rights and the universal human right to a healthy, clean, safe and sustainable environment. Juan Mancias of the Carrizo/Comecrudo Nation in Texas spoke about feeling a spiritual connection to the land. 'Five hundred years ago, we had clean water, clean air, and there was no plastics,' he said. 'What happened?' Many plastics are used for packaging About 40% of all plastics are used in packaging, according to the United Nations. This includes single-use plastic food and beverage containers — water bottles, takeout containers, coffee lids, straws and shopping bags — that often end up polluting the environment. U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen told negotiators in Busan the treaty must tackle this problem. 'Are there specific plastic items that we can live without, those that so often leak into the environment? Are there alternatives to these items? This is an issue we must agree on,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-to-know-about-plastic-pollution-crisis-as-treaty-talks-conclude/7882600.html	2024-11-30T09:53:27-08:00	
More than 100 Rohingya refugees rescued off Indonesia, UN says	BANDA ACEH, INDONESIA — More than 100 Rohingya refugees, including women and children, have been rescued after their boat sank off the coast of Indonesia, the United Nations refugee agency said Saturday. The mostly Muslim ethnic Rohingya are heavily persecuted in Myanmar and thousands risk their lives each year on long and dangerous sea journeys to reach Malaysia or Indonesia. 'We received a report from the East Aceh government that there are 116 refugees in total,' UNHCR's Faisal Rahman told AFP on Saturday. 'The refugees are still on the beach right now; it has not been decided where they would be taken,' Rahman said. He said the flimsy wooden boat carrying the Rohingyas was found half-submerged not far from the beach off the coast of northeastern Sumatra island. Local fisherman Saifudin Taher said the boat was first spotted entering East Aceh waters Saturday morning, and a few hours later it nearly sank. 'All passengers survived, but one of them was ill and ... immediately received treatment,' Saifudin told AFP, adding that the boat was only 100 meters away from the shore and that the refugees could walk easily to safety. Rohingya arrivals in Indonesia tend to follow a cyclical pattern, slowing during the stormy months and picking back up when sea conditions calm down. Last month, 152 Rohingya refugees were finally brought ashore after being anchored for days off the coast of South Aceh district while officials decided whether to let them land. Indonesia is not a signatory to the U.N. refugee convention and says it cannot be compelled to take in refugees from Myanmar, calling instead on neighboring countries to share the burden and resettle Rohingya who arrive on its shores. Many Acehnese, who have memories of decades of bloody conflict themselves, are sympathetic to the plight of their fellow Muslims. But others say their patience has been tested, claiming the Rohingya consume scarce resources and occasionally come into conflict with locals. In December 2023, hundreds of students forced the relocation of more than 100 Rohingya refugees, storming a community hall in Aceh where they were sheltering and vandalizing their belongings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/more-than-100-rohingya-refugees-rescued-off-indonesia-un-says/7882564.html	2024-11-30T09:07:43-08:00	
Ukraine says war has damaged most of its civilian airports	KYIV, UKRAINE — Fifteen of Ukraine's civilian airports have been damaged since Russia invaded the country in February 2022, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal was quoted as saying by local media on Saturday. Ukraine, which the state aviation service says has 20 civilian airports, has been exploring avenues to partially open its airspace. It has been closed since the start of the war. Ukrainians who want to fly abroad currently must go via road or rail to neighboring countries to catch flights. For those living in the east, the journey out of Ukraine can take a day in itself. 'We conducted a risk assessment and determined the needs of the air defense forces to partially open the airspace,' local news agency Ukrinform quoted Shmyhal as saying at a transportation conference. 'Security issues and the military situation remain key to this decision,' he said. Shmyhal said that Russia attacked Ukraine's port infrastructure nearly 60 times in the last three months, damaging or destroying nearly 300 facilities and 22 civilian vessels. A senior partner at insurance broker Marsh McLennan told Reuters earlier this month that Ukraine could reopen the airport in the western city of Lviv in 2025 if regulators deem it safe and a political decision is made.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-war-has-damaged-most-of-its-civilian-airports/7882524.html	2024-11-30T08:17:26-08:00

Taiwan's president departs for Pacific visit with 2-day stop in US	TAOYUAN, TAIWAN — Taiwan's president departed Saturday on a trip to the South Pacific that will include a two-day transit in the United States, his first since assuming office. The planned stopovers in Hawaii and the territory of Guam have already drawn fierce criticism from Beijing, which claims Taiwan as its own territory and objects to official exchanges between it and the U.S., the island's biggest backer and military provider. Lai Ching-te left on a weeklong trip to visit the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu and Palau — three diplomatic allies of the self-governed island in the Pacific. 'I want to use the values of democracy, peace and prosperity to continue to expand our cooperation with our allies, to deepen our partnership and let the world see Taiwan not just as a model of democracy, but a vital power in promoting the world's peace and stability, and prosperous development,' he said at Taoyuan International Airport ahead of his departure. Although Taiwan retains strong contacts with dozens of other nations, it has only 12 formal diplomatic allies. The self-ruled democracy has recently been facing increasing pressure from China. It is unclear whether Lai will meet with any members of the incoming U.S. administration during his transit. President-elect Donald Trump said in an interview with Bloomberg in July that Taiwan should pay for its defense. The island has purchased billions of dollars of defense weaponry from the U.S. Trump avoided answering whether he would defend the island from Chinese military action. On Friday, the U.S. State Department said it approved the sale of $385 million in spare parts and equipment for the fleet of F-16s, as well as support for a tactical communication system to Taiwan. While the U.S. is obligated to help the island defend itself under the Taiwan Relations Act, it has maintained a position of strategic ambiguity over whether it would ever get involved if Taiwan were to be invaded by China. A second Trump administration is expected to test U.S.-China relations even more than the Republican’s first term, when the U.S. imposed tariffs on more than $360 billion in Chinese products. Taiwan is one of the main sources of tension in the bilateral relationship. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said on Friday if the U.S. wanted to maintain peace in the Taiwan Strait, it is important for it to handle the Taiwan issue 'with utmost caution, clearly opposing Taiwan independence and supporting China’s peaceful reunification.' She also said China firmly opposes any form of official interaction between the U.S. and Taiwan, including visits by Taiwan’s leaders to the U.S. for any reason. When former Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen went to the U.S. last year as part of a transit to Latin America, it drew vocal opposition from China. Tsai met with the former House of Representatives Speaker Kevin McCarthy at the time. The Chinese military also launched drills around Taiwan last year as a 'stern warning' over what it called collusion between 'separatists and foreign forces' days after Lai, then Taiwan’s vice president, stopped over in the U.S. China also strongly objects to leading American politicians visiting the island, as it views any official contact with foreign governments and Taiwan as an infringement on its claims of sovereignty over Taiwan. Washington switched its formal recognition from Taipei to Beijing in 1979.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-s-president-departs-for-pacific-visit-with-2-day-stop-in-us/7882513.html	2024-11-30T08:05:39-08:00	
Kenya, Uganda to mediate Ethiopia-Somalia dispute	NAIROBI, KENYA — Kenyan President William Ruto said Saturday that he and Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni will help mediate a dispute between Ethiopia and Somalia, which threatens the stability of the region. Landlocked Ethiopia, which has thousands of troops in Somalia to fight al-Qaida-linked insurgents, has fallen out with the Mogadishu government over its plans to build a port in the breakaway region of Somaliland in exchange for possible recognition of its sovereignty. Somaliland has struggled to gain international recognition, despite governing itself and enjoying comparative peace and stability since declaring independence in 1991. The spat has drawn Somalia closer to Egypt, which has quarreled with Ethiopia for years over Addis Ababa's construction of a vast hydro dam on the Nile River, and Eritrea, another of Ethiopia's foes. 'Because the security of Somalia ... contributes significantly to the stability of our region and the environment for investors and businesspeople and entrepreneurs to thrive,' Ruto said at a news conference. Several attempts to resolve the feud in Ankara, Turkey, failed to achieve a breakthrough. Ethiopia's government and foreign affairs spokespeople did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Somalia's foreign minister could not immediately be reached by Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-uganda-to-mediate-ethiopia-somalia-dispute/7882430.html	2024-11-30T06:09:44-08:00	
Georgia arrests 107 more people as pro-EU protests continue	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Georgia on Saturday said authorities arrested 107 people during a second day of protests sparked by the government's decision to delay European Union membership talks. The Black Sea nation has been rocked by turmoil since the ruling Georgian Dream party claimed victory in an October 26 parliamentary election that the pro-EU opposition said was fraudulent. The Interior Ministry said 107 people were detained for 'disobedience to lawful police orders and petty hooliganism.' 'Throughout the night ... protesters threw various objects, including stones, pyrotechnics, glass bottles and metal items, at law enforcement officers,' it said, adding that '10 employees of the Ministry of Internal Affairs were injured.' The ministry earlier said 32 police officers were wounded and 43 protestors detained on Thursday. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze's statement Thursday that Georgia will not seek to open accession talks with the European Union until 2028 ignited a furious reaction from the opposition and two days of protests. He later accused the opposition and the EU ambassador to Georgia of distorting his words. He insisted membership in the bloc 'by 2030' remains his 'top priority.' 'Resistance movement' On Friday, AFP reporters saw riot police fire water cannons and tear gas at pro-EU protesters gathered outside the parliament in Tbilisi, who tossed eggs and fireworks. Clashes broke out later between protesters and police, who moved in to clear the area outside parliament, beating demonstrators, some of whom threw objects. Independent TV station Pirveli said one of its journalists was hospitalized with serious injuries. Protests were also held in other cities across Georgia on Friday, independent TV station Mtavari reported. Pro-Western opposition parties are boycotting the new parliament, while President Salome Zurabishvili has sought to annul the election results through the country's constitutional court. In a televised address to the nation on Friday evening, the pro-Western president — who is at loggerheads with the ruling party — said: 'The resistance movement has begun. ... I stand in solidarity with it. We will remain united until Georgia achieves its goals: to return to its European path, secure new elections.' 'Brutal repression' After the October vote, a group of Georgia's leading election monitors said they had evidence of a complex scheme of large-scale electoral fraud. Brussels has demanded an investigation into what it said were 'serious irregularities' reported by election monitors. Georgian Dream MPs voted unanimously Thursday for Kobakhidze to continue as prime minister, even as the opposition boycotted parliament, which faces a serious legitimacy crisis. 'Police actions in Tbilisi mark another punitive attack on the right to peaceful assembly,' said Amnesty International. France, Britain, Ukraine, Poland, Sweden and Lithuania were among the countries to voice concern. The Council of Europe condemned what it described as 'brutal repression,' urging Georgia to remain 'faithful to European values.' In recent years, critics accused Georgian Dream — in power for more than a decade — of moving the country away from Europe and closer to Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7882387.html	2024-11-30T04:18:15-08:00	
Israeli military strikes kill 25 Palestinians in Gaza, medics say	The Israeli military said it killed a Palestinian it accused of involvement in Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack on Israel in a vehicle strike in the Gaza Strip, and is investigating claims that the person was an employee of aid group World Central Kitchen. At least 25 Palestinians were killed in Israeli military strikes across Gaza overnight and into Saturday, with most casualties reported in northern areas, medics told Reuters. Among those killed, at least seven died in an Israeli strike on a house in central Gaza City, according to a statement from Gaza Civil Defense and official Palestinian news agency WAFA early Saturday. Gaza Civil Defense also reported that one of its officers was killed in attacks in northern Gaza's Jabalia, bringing the total number of civil defense workers killed since October 7, 2023, to 88. Earlier on Saturday, WAFA reported that three employees of the World Central Kitchen, a U.S.-based, nongovernmental humanitarian agency, were killed when a civilian vehicle was targeted in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. The World Central Kitchen has not yet commented on the incident.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-military-strikes-kill-25-palestinians-in-gaza-medics-say/7882381.html	2024-11-30T04:02:56-08:00	
Ukrainian president says NATO membership can end 'hot phase' of war	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says being admitted into NATO could end what he described as the 'hot phase of the war' waged by Russia. In an interview with Sky News aired on November 29, Zelenskyy suggested that he would be willing to consider a ceasefire if Ukraine’s unoccupied territories fell under NATO’s protection and the invitation to join the alliance recognized Ukraine’s international borders. Russia annexed Ukraine’s Crimean Peninsula in 2014 and has been occupying 20% of Ukrainian territory since launching its full-scale invasion in February 2022. 'If we want to stop the hot phase of the war, we need to take under the NATO umbrella the territory of Ukraine that we have under our control,' Zelenskyy said, adding that the occupied eastern parts of the country could then be taken back 'in a diplomatic way.' This comes as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has criticized the billions of dollars that the United States has poured into Ukraine since Russia launched its invasion. Trump has also said he could end the war within 24 hours of retaking the White House, a statement that has been interpreted as meaning that Ukraine would have to surrender territory that Russia now occupies. Earlier this week, Trump named Keith Kellogg, a retired army lieutenant general who has long served as a top adviser to Trump on defense issues, as his nominee to be special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg has advocated telling the Ukrainians that if they don't come to the negotiating table, U.S. support would dry up, while telling Russian President Vladimir Putin that if he doesn't come to the table, the United States would give the Ukrainians 'everything they need to kill you in the field.' For the past several months, Russia has been battering Ukrainian cities with increasingly heavy drone, missile and glide-bomb strikes, causing casualties and damaging energy infrastructure as the cold season settles in. Earlier this month, a senior United Nations official, Rosemary DiCarlo, warned that Moscow's targeting of Ukraine's energy infrastructure could make this winter the 'harshest since the start of the war' nearly three years ago. Ukraine has launched several counterattacks since the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden, the top foreign supporter of Ukraine in its battle against Russia's invasion, and Kyiv's European allies authorized the use of long-range missiles against targets inside Russia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-president-says-nato-membership-can-end-hot-phase-of-war/7882377.html	2024-11-30T03:54:25-08:00	
Iceland votes for new parliament amid disagreements on immigration, economy	REYKJAVIK, ICELAND — Icelanders will elect a new parliament Saturday after disagreements over immigration, energy policy and the economy forced Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson to pull the plug on his coalition government and call early elections. This is Iceland’s sixth general election since the 2008 financial crisis devastated the economy of the North Atlantic island nation and ushered in a new era of political instability. Opinion polls suggest the country may be in for another upheaval, with support for the three governing parties plunging. Benediktsson, who was named prime minister in April following the resignation of his predecessor, struggled to hold together the unlikely coalition of his conservative Independence Party with the centrist Progressive Party and the Left-Green Movement. Iceland, a nation of about 400,000 people, is proud of its democratic traditions, describing itself as arguably the world’s oldest parliamentary democracy. The island’s parliament, the Althingi, was founded in 930 by the Norsemen who settled the country. Here’s what to look for in the contest. How does the election work? Voters will choose 63 members of the Althingi in an election that will allocate seats both by regional constituencies and proportional representation. Parties need at least 5% of the vote to win seats in parliament. Eight parties were represented in the outgoing parliament, and 10 parties are contesting this election. Turnout is traditionally high by international standards, with 80% of registered voters casting ballots in the 2021 parliamentary election. Why now? A windswept island near the Arctic Circle, Iceland normally holds elections during the warmer months of the year. But on Oct. 13 Benediktsson decided his coalition couldn’t last any longer, and he asked President Halla Tómasdóttir to dissolve the Althingi. 'The weakness of this society is that we have no very strong party and we have no very strong leader of any party,’' said Vilhjálmur Bjarnson, a former member of parliament. 'We have no charming person with a vision … That is very difficult for us.' Why is Iceland's politics so fractured? The splintering of Iceland's political landscape came after the 2008 financial crisis, which prompted years of economic upheaval after its debt-swollen banks collapsed. The crisis led to anger and distrust of the parties that had traditionally traded power back and forth, and prompted the creation of new parties ranging from the environment focused Left-Green Alliance to the Pirate Party, which advocates direct democracy and individual freedoms. 'This is one of the consequences of the economic crash,' said Eva H. Önnudóttir, a professor of political science at the University of Iceland. 'It’s just the changed landscape. Parties, especially the old parties, have maybe kind of been hoping that we would go back to how things were before, but that’s not going to happen.' What are the issues? Like many Western countries, Iceland has been buffeted by the rising cost of living and immigration pressures. Inflation peaked at an annual rate of 10.2% in February 2023, fueled by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. While inflation slowed to 5.1% in October, that is still high compared with neighboring countries. The U.S. inflation rate stood at 2.6% last month, while the European Union’s rate was 2.3%. Iceland is also struggling to accommodate a rising number of asylum-seekers, creating tensions within the small, traditionally homogenous country. The number of immigrants seeking protection in Iceland jumped to more than 4,000 in each of the past three years, compared with a previous average of less than 1,000. What about the volcano? Repeated eruptions of a volcano in the southwestern part of the country have displaced thousands of people and strained public finances. One year after the first eruption forced the evacuation of the town of Grindavik, many residents still don’t have secure housing, leading to complaints that the government has been slow to respond. But it also added to a shortage of affordable housing exacerbated by Iceland’s tourism boom. Young people are struggling to get a foot on the housing ladder at a time when short-term vacation rentals have reduced the housing stock available for locals, Önnudóttir said. 'The housing issue is becoming a big issue in Iceland,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iceland-votes-for-new-parliament-amid-disagreements-on-immigration-economy-/7882357.html	2024-11-30T02:36:25-08:00	
As numbers of globetrotting Indians surge, many turn to Asia	NEW DELHI — The rebound of India’s economy in the wake of COVID-19 has spurred a renewed interest in overseas vacations by Indians, beyond prepandemic levels, with many of them now turning to Asian destinations. Travel companies say business is booming throughout the year, driven by growing disposable incomes in a growing middle class and an ambitious young population. 'Earlier travel picked up in the summer and festive seasons, but post the pandemic we have observed that Indians travel throughout the year. Younger Indians want to do multiple short-haul holidays while older people want to do longer overseas holidays,' according to Neil Patel, cofounder of Veena World, a Mumbai-based travel agency. Meanwhile, tastes are changing. While Europe, once the preferred holiday destination for many Indians, still remains popular, many are turning their attention to Asia -- from countries in the east like Japan and Vietnam to Middle Eastern destinations like Dubai and Abu Dhabi and Central Asian republics such as Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Georgia. Some find the elaborate documentation required to visit a European country cumbersome. Others find Asian destinations far more affordable. After a European vacation in 2022, Kumkum Sharma and her husband, Vinayak Gawankar, have turned their attention to Southeast Asia. Last year, the Mumbai-based couple headed to Singapore and Malaysia and this year they vacationed in Vietnam and Thailand. 'Europe is slightly expensive. After getting married, much of our budget goes into household expenses, so we decided Southeast Asian countries are better. You get to experience a new culture as well,' Gawankar, a marketing consultant, said. Sharma, a corporate employee, took her parents with her to Singapore and Malaysia for their first overseas trip. 'Traveling through Southeast Asian countries is definitely friendlier for Indians. Also you need more time and more planning to travel to Europe,' she said. Kalyani Jagwani, a Kolkata homemaker, and her businessman husband, Devanand, spent two weeks in Japan in October, visiting such places as Kyoto, Tokyo and Hakone, well known for its hot springs and for its natural beauty. 'We had already visited Europe a few times and we wanted a new experience. And we were really attracted by the videos we saw of the fall season when the landscape turns beautiful,' Kalyani Jagwani said. With the number of Indian tourists surging, several Asian countries are wooing them. Some are offering visa-free travel, while budget airlines are opening more routes from India. Two years ago, Vietair, a low-cost Vietnamese carrier that only flew to Delhi and Mumbai expanded flights to several smaller cities, a move that paid dividends. Nearly half a million Indian tourists are expected to visit Vietnam this year, attracted by fares under $400. Tourism-reliant Thailand, which eliminated visa requirements for Indians in November 2023 for one year, extended the facility indefinitely last month. It is helping boost numbers – compared to the 1 million Indians who visited a decade ago, more than 1.5 million visited through October of this year. Sri Lanka has also allowed visa-free travel for Indians while Japan has introduced a simplified e-visa process. Middle Eastern countries are roping in Bollywood stars to promote their destinations -- India’s hugely popular Hindi film industry has always had a strong influence on Indian travelers’ choice of destinations. A top actor, Ranveer Singh, who once promoted Switzerland, is brand ambassador for Abu Dhabi. Popular actors Saif Ali Khan and his daughter Sara Ali Khan, promote Dubai. Other countries are flying in travel writers and influencers in bigger numbers than ever earlier. Those with deeper pockets are exploring more distant places. Sumitra Senapaty, whose travel club 'Women on Wanderlust' organizes all-women trips, says her clients want to explore more off-beat destinations. 'They are tired of doing the usual touristy places and want to go to different places. This year, I have organized vacations to Easter Island and Puerto Natales in Chile, Patagonia in South America and Azores, a Portuguese archipelago,' she said. The number of Indians taking two or more overseas trips grew 32% last year, according to a report by India’s leading online travel company, MakeMyTrip. 'I think people want to live in the moment, because we don’t know what tomorrow brings,' Patel, of Veena World, said. 'As incomes increase, people want to invest more in experiences – this is the big change we have seen post the pandemic.' Many travelers agree. Besides visiting monasteries, gardens and the usual tourist spots in Japan, the Jagwanis spent one day in a ryokan, a traditional Japanese inn that offers a window into the way of life in the old days. 'We slept on the floor on mattresses, had typical Japanese food, and a traditional bath with mineral salts,' Kalyani Jagwani recalled. 'It was a novelty experience that plugged us into Japanese culture.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-numbers-of-globetrotting-indians-surge-many-turn-to-asia/7882354.html	2024-11-30T02:17:56-08:00	
Icebreaker deal would challenge Russian supremacy in Arctic	HALIFAX, CANADA — With the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding this month, the United States, Canada and Finland are moving ahead on what military analysts see as a belated but much-needed answer to a mounting Russian and Chinese threat in the Arctic Ocean. Under the arrangement whimsically labeled the Icebreaker Collaboration Effort, or ICE Pact, the three nations have agreed to share research, knowledge and capabilities in building a still unspecified number of icebreakers capable of enforcing each nation's sovereignty in an ocean that has become increasingly navigable because of climate change. While the retreat of the polar icecap is steadily opening the region for commercial traffic and mineral exploration, the ICE Pact is largely driven by concerns over the Arctic capabilities of an increasingly hostile Russia and the rapidly growing presence of China. 'Up until this past summer, you would expect one Chinese research vessel in the Arctic. This past summer, there were five,' said U.S. Coast Guard Commandant Admiral Linda Fagan at a security forum in the Canadian city of Halifax this month. 'This summer they were operating in tandem surface action groups with both China and Russia, 60 to 70 miles off the coast of Alaska,' Fagan added. 'If we were to see that same pattern of behavior off the East or the West Coast of the [contiguous] United States, it would have the attention of the United States.' Speaking at the same forum, Canadian Defense Minister Bill Blair said his country has been watching 'the activities of two particular adversaries, China and Russia, in the area, which are deeply concerning to us and, frankly, their aggression and assertions in the region are somewhat different.' Blair said that in passages through the Arctic, the Russians 'have not demonstrated respect to the international rules-based order and respect for other countries sovereignty and economic interests.' China, he said, approaches the Arctic in two ways, the first being significant investment in critical and other infrastructure. 'And the second one is through what they term scientific research. And we've seen a huge increase in their presence in the Arctic. And it's not just scientific research. They're mapping the sea floor. They're gathering intelligence,' he said. Experts say Russia is far ahead of the United States and its NATO allies in icebreaker capability, largely because it has for years been developing a commercial shipping route across its Arctic coast known as the Northern Sea Route. The route is of particular interest to China as a shortcut for its lucrative trade with Europe. But Russian icebreaking is no longer limited to economic development, according to Heather Exner-Pirot, a global fellow at the Washington-based Wilson Center's Polar Institute. 'Its first armed combat icebreaker, the Ivan Papanin, is in sea trials and scheduled to join Russia's Northern Fleet by the end of 2024,' she wrote on the Wilson Center website in July. 'And China is quickly gaining capacity, having commissioned its fourth polar-capable vessel, the Jidi, last week,' added Exner-Pirot, who is also the director of energy, natural resources and environment at the Ottawa-based Macdonald-Laurier Institute. If the Western alliance hopes to match Russian and Chinese capabilities in the Arctic, it has a lot of catching up to do. While precise counts vary according to how one defines a polar-capable icebreaker, the CIA World Factbook says Russia has 18 such vessels of varying classes, part of a world-leading fleet of 46 icebreakers including the world's only two nuclear-powered icebreakers. It has 11 more planned or under construction, according to a chart prepared by the U.S. Coast Guard Office of Waterways and Ocean Policy. Icebreakers - The World Factbook Canada ranks second in the world with 18 total icebreakers, according to the CIA World Factbook, but only one is suitable for polar missions. The others are mostly deployed to maintain commercial shipping channels through the St. Lawrence Seaway and the Great Lakes in winter. Canada has two more polar icebreakers under construction and another five planned. Finland has at least eight polar-capable icebreakers, according to most assessments, and uses them mainly to clear ice around its Baltic Sea ports. It is also regarded as the world leader in the design and construction of icebreakers but has been unable to sell them to its main customer, Russia, since that country's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Its expertise will be critical to the ICE Pact program. The United States has only two operational polar-capable vessels, both of which are nearing the end of their lifespan, a senior administration official told Reuters earlier this year. A third vessel is being cannibalized for parts. The U.S. currently has three more polar-capable icebreakers planned and hopes to secure funding for an additional three, according to a RAND Corporation report. The U.S. Coast Guard Is Building an Icebreaker Fleet: What Comes Next? Issues and Challenges 'While Russia has steadily expanded its world-leading fleet, and China is making significant inroads, Canada and the U.S. have let their icebreakers age and their shipbuilding capacity atrophy,' Exner-Pirot wrote in her Wilson Center article. 'Even with the recent resolve to reverse trend and commit billions in new dollars to icebreakers, previous neglect has led to shipbuilding programs that are frequently over time and over budget,' she wrote. 'The ICE Pact aims to turn the ship around.' Deep-water ports where the West's new icebreakers can take on provisions and fuel may be an even tougher problem to solve. 'Russia also has 17 deep-water ports on that [Arctic] Ocean, Canada has none, and so we need to do better,' Blair said at the Halifax International Security Forum. 'They also have significant additional capabilities in icebreakers and military presence in the region.' Canada does hope to open a deep-water naval facility soon at Nanisivik, at the north end of Baffin Island, which would allow it to command the entrance to the Northwest Passage across Canada's Arctic. But the facility is 10 years behind schedule as a result of logistical and environmental delays. Due to escalating costs, plans for the facility were scaled back to make it operational for only four months a year rather than 12. The station is primarily intended for use as a refueling station for vessels patrolling Arctic Sea routes. It remains unclear how many new vessels will be built under the ICE Pact or how soon they will be completed, though it is expected that each of the three participants will send the work to shipyards in its own country. Finnish shipyards are said to be capable of building an icebreaker within two years, but progress in the United States and Canada has often stretched out much longer. At the Halifax forum, U.S. Admiral Fagan brushed off a mischievous suggestion that, given the rate at which the Arctic ice pack is retreating, by the time the new icebreakers are completed they may no longer be needed. 'The ability to create year-round presence [in the Arctic] from a sovereignty and defense standpoint requires heavy icebreakers,' she said. 'It requires it now and into the foreseeable future. And so, this is not a waste there, but we need to accelerate. We need to continue the partnership.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/icebreaker-deal-would-challenge-russian-supremacy-in-arctic/7881858.html	2024-11-30T00:20:32-08:00	
Chinese scientists rush to climate-proof potatoes	YANQING, CHINA — In a research facility in the northwest of Beijing, molecular biologist Li Jieping and his team harvest a cluster of seven unusually small potatoes, one as tiny as a quail's egg, from a potted plant. Grown under conditions that simulate predictions of higher temperatures at the end of the century, the potatoes provide an ominous sign of future food security. At just 136 grams, the tubers weigh less than half that of a typical potato in China, where the most popular varieties are often twice the size of a baseball. China is the world's biggest producer of potatoes, which are crucial to global food security because of their high yield relative to other staple crops. But they are particularly vulnerable to heat, and climate change, driven by fossil fuel emissions, is pushing temperatures to dangerous new heights while also worsening drought and flooding. With an urgent need to protect food supplies, Li, a researcher at the International Potato Center (CIP) in Beijing, is leading a three-year study into the effects of higher temperatures on the vegetable. His team is focusing on China's two most common varieties. 'I worry about what will happen in the future,' Li said. 'Farmers will harvest fewer potato tubers, it will influence food security.' Li's team grew their crop over three months in a walk-in chamber set at 3 degrees Celsius above the current average temperature in northern Hebei and Inner Mongolia, the higher altitude provinces where potatoes are usually grown in China. Their research, published in the journal Climate Smart Agriculture this month, found the higher temperatures accelerated tuber growth by 10 days, but cut potato yields by more than half. Under current climate policies, the world is facing as much as 3.1 C of warming above pre-industrial levels by 2100, according to a United Nations report released in October. Farmers in China say they are already feeling the effect of extreme weather events. In Inner Mongolia, dozens of workers clutching white sacks rush to gather potatoes dug up from the soil before the next downpour. 'The biggest challenge for potatoes this year is the heavy rain,' said manager Wang Shiyi. 'It has caused various diseases... and greatly slowed down the harvest progress.' Meanwhile, seed potato producer Yakeshi Senfeng Potato Industry Company has invested in aeroponic systems where plants are grown in the air under controlled conditions. Farmers are increasingly demanding potato varieties that are higher-yielding and less susceptible to disease, particularly late blight, which caused the Irish Potato Famine of the mid-19th century and thrives in warm and humid conditions. 'Some new and more aggressive (late blight) strains have begun to appear, and they are more resistant to traditional prevention and control methods,' said general manager Li Xuemin, explaining the Inner Mongolia-based company's strategy. The research by CIP, which is headquartered in Lima, is part of a collaborative effort with the Chinese government to help farmers adapt to the warmer, wetter conditions. In the greenhouse outside Li's lab, workers swab pollen on white potato flowers to develop heat-tolerant varieties. Li says Chinese farmers will need to make changes within the next decade, planting during spring instead of the start of summer, or moving to even higher altitudes to escape the heat. 'Farmers have to start preparing for climate change,' Li said. 'If we don't find a solution, they will make less money from lower yields and the price of potatoes may rise.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-scientists-rush-to-climate-proof-potatoes/7881022.html	2024-11-30T00:19:42-08:00	
Ghana parties stoke anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment ahead of election	LAGOS, NIGERIA — Ghana's LGBTQ+ community faces an impossible choice in next month's general elections after the leading presidential candidates all promised to crack down on gay rights to tap into widespread anti-LGBTQ+ sentiment in the country. One of the first tasks the winner of the December 7 vote may face is to sign into law or veto a bill parliament passed earlier this year that includes jail time for anyone identifying as LGBTQ+. The Supreme Court is due to rule on the bill's constitutionality on December 18 after weighing legal challenges against it. The ruling party candidate, Mahamudu Bawumia, has repeatedly vowed to sign the bill. While his main challenger, former president John Dramani Mahama, has not explicitly said whether he will approve it, he has argued that Ghana must strengthen laws against LGBTQ+ activities and persons, accusing the West of promoting homosexuality in the West African nation. 'These are people who are actually supposed to protect me. My vote and the rest of the community's will put them in a position of leadership,' Abena told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 'I feel like I do not belong.' Ghana already criminalizes gay sex, but the proposed law broadens what counts as illegal activity and increases penalties, which human rights groups say will worsen the persecution of sexual and gender minorities. The bill stipulates up to five years in prison for same-sex activities, allows for the prosecution of those who identify as non-binary and punishes advocacy work, including funding programs for sexual minorities. It also includes prison terms for friends, family members and property owners who fail to report anyone perceived or identified as LGBTQ+. 'The bill seeks to divide me and my family,' Abena said. 'Anybody who knows (my identity)within the family and does not report (me and)someone else does ... could also go to jail.' 'Public psyche' The long-running debate around the bill, first introduced in 2021, has exacerbated already prevalent anti-LGBTQ+ attitudes in the religiously conservative country. An Afrobarometer survey published in 2021showed just 7% of the public in Ghana expresses tolerance for same-sex relationships. In October, religious groups took to the streets to ask for the immediate passage of the bill. Church leaders have called same-sex acts 'immoral' and against 'Christianity, the Ghanaian tradition and culture.' 'Even though it has not become law, it has seeped into the psyche of the public, which is basically homophobic, in the sense that they want the passage of the bill, and there have been increases in the level of attacks and intimidation against LGBTQ persons,' said Michael Akagbor, the senior officer on human rights at the Centre for Democracy and Development Ghana. Akagbor also said the contest between political parties vying for the most anti-LGBTQ+ label had come to a draw, effectively making it a 'non-election issue.' But other advocates warn that LGBTQ+ individuals risk increased attacks in an already hostile environment and they and their supporters could face greater discrimination if the law passes. The law's provision criminalizing friends and family who do not report on their loved ones 'has already forced many LGBTQ individuals into hiding(and)led to loss of employment, housing and even educational opportunities,' said Hans Burinyuy, director of communications at LGBT+ Rights Ghana. 'If the bill becomes law, professional options for openly LGBTQ-friendly educators and advocates like me may narrow, especially if more institutions adopt rigid stances in response,' Burinyuy told the Thomson Reuters Foundation. 'For me, maintaining personal safety has now involved more caution regarding who I interact with and what information I disclose,' he said. International response The European Union called the passage of the bill in February 'profoundly disturbing,' pointing out that it violated Ghana's constitution and its international human rights commitments. 'There is also the issue of losing the donor funding if the country goes on with the bill, and that has already been communicated by the Ministry of Finance to the Ghanaian populace,' said Akagbor. The Supreme Court is considering legal petitions that parliament failed to comply with procedural issues when passing the bill, including failure to assess the economic implications of the law. The court can either send it back to parliament for amendment, allow it to be passed onto the president for assent, or strike it out. For Abena, the court decision will come too late to help her decide how to cast her ballot in the general election. 'I feel the country isn't safe for people like me if the first, second and third options are all using the LGBT bill to score more points,' she said. 'When they come into power, they are going to make sure that these persons are criminalized.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ghana-parties-stoke-anti-lgbtq-sentiment-ahead-of-election/7881015.html	2024-11-30T00:18:59-08:00	
Intimate documentary captures the Beatles goofing around as they take America by storm in 1964	NEW YORK — Likely most people have seen iconic footage of the Beatles performing on 'The Ed Sullivan Show.' But how many have seen Paul McCartney during that same U.S. trip feeding seagulls off his hotel balcony? That moment — as well as George Harrison and John Lennon goofing around by exchanging their jackets — are part of the Disney+ documentary 'Beatles '64,' an intimate look at the English band's first trip to America that uses rare and newly restored footage. It streams Friday. 'It's so fun to be the fly on the wall in those really intimate moments,' says Margaret Bodde, who produced alongside Martin Scorsese. 'It's just this incredible gift of time and technology to be able to see it now with the decades of time stripped away so that you really feel like you're there.' 'Beatles '64' leans into footage of the 14-day trip filmed by documentarians Albert and David Maysles, who left behind 11 hours of the Fab Four goofing around in New York's Plaza hotel or traveling. It was restored by Park Road Post in New Zealand. 'It's beautiful, although it's black and white and it's not widescreen,' says director David Tedeschi. 'It's like it was shot yesterday and it captures the youth of the four Beatles and the fans.' The footage is augmented by interviews with the two surviving members of the band and people whose lives were impacted, including some of the women who as teens stood outside their hotel hoping to catch a glimpse of the Beatles. 'It was like a crazy love,' fan Vickie Brenna-Costa recalls in the documentary. 'I can't really understand it now. But then, it was natural.' The film shows the four heartthrobs flirting and dancing at the Peppermint Lounge disco, Harrison noodling with a Woody Guthrie riff on his guitar and tells the story of Ronnie Spector sneaking the band out a hotel back exit and up to Harlem to eat barbeque. The documentary coincides with the release of a box set of vinyl albums collecting the band's seven U.S. albums released in '64 and early '65 — 'Meet The Beatles!,' 'The Beatles' Second Album,' 'A Hard Day's Night' (the movie soundtrack), 'Something New,' 'The Beatles' Story,' 'Beatles '65' and 'The Early Beatles.' They had been out of print on vinyl since 1995. The Beatles' U.S. visit in 1964 also included concerts at Carnegie Hall, a gig at the Washington Coliseum in Washington, D.C., and a visit to Miami, where the band met Muhammad Ali. The documentary shows members of the band reading newspaper coverage of themselves. Viewers may learn that the Beatles — now revered — were often met with ridicule or rudeness from the older generation. At the British Embassy in New York, the four were treated as lower class, while renowned broadcaster Eric Sevareid, doing a piece for CBS, compared the reaction to the Beatles to the German measles. 'You're nothing but four Elvis Presleys,' one reporter told them during a press conference, to which the boys good-naturedly started gyrating as Ringo Starr screamed 'It's not true!' 'Why the establishment was against them is sort of a mystery to me,' says Tedeschi. 'I think older people believed that music would go back to the big bands.' Musicians like Sananda Maitreya, Ron Isley and Smokey Robinson also discuss the Fab Four and what they took from Black music. There also are interviews with residents of Harlem, critic Joe Queennan and filmmaker David Lynch, who saw the Beatles play the Washington Coliseum. 'Beatles '64' tries to explain why young people were so besotted by John, Paul, George and Ringo. Their visit came just months after the assassination of President John. F. Kennedy and Tedeschi argues Beatlemania was a salve for a nation in mourning. 'Part of it is I think that the light was just off. They were depressed. Everything was dark. And 'I Want to Hold Your Hand' lit them up,' says Tedeschi. As McCartney says in the documentary: 'Maybe America needed something like the Beatles to lift it out of mourning and just sort of say 'Life goes on.''	https://www.voanews.com/a/intimate-documentary-captures-the-beatles-goofing-around-as-they-take-america-by-storm-in-1964/7879844.html	2024-11-30T00:17:56-08:00	
Will Trump's return lead to a new wave of bestselling books?	NEW YORK — As she anticipates her estranged uncle's return to the White House, Mary Trump isn't expecting any future book to catch on like such first-term tell-alls as Michael Wolff's million-selling Fire and Fury or her own blockbuster, Too Much and Never Enough. 'What else is there to learn?' she says. 'And for people who don't know, the books have been written. It's all really out in the open now.' For publishers, Donald Trump's presidential years were a time of extraordinary sales in political books, helped in part by Trump's legal threats and angered tweets. According to Circana, which tracks around 85% of the hardcover and paperback market, the genre's sales nearly doubled from 2015 to 2020, from around 5 million copies to around 10 million. Besides books by Wolff and Trump, other bestsellers included former FBI Director James Comey's A Higher Loyalty, former national security adviser John Bolton's The Room Where it Happened and Bob Woodward's Fear. Meanwhile, sales for dystopian fiction also jumped, led by Margaret Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale, which was adapted into an award-winning Hulu series. But interest has dropped back to 2015 levels since Trump left office, according to Circana, and publishers doubt it will again peak so highly. Readers not only showed little interest in books by or about President Joe Biden and his family — they even seemed less excited about Trump-related releases. Mary Trump's Who Could Ever Love You and Woodward's War were both popular this fall, but neither has matched the sales of their books written during the first Trump administration. 'We've been there many times, with all those books,' HarperCollins publisher Jonathan Burnham says of the various Trump tell-alls. He added that he still sees a market for at least some Trump books — perhaps analyzing the recent election — because 'there's a general, serious smart audience, not politically aligned in a hard way,' one that would welcome 'an intelligent voice.' 'It's like the reboot of any hit TV show,' says Eric Nelson, publisher and vice president of Broadside Books, a conservative imprint of HarperCollins that's released books by Jared Kushner, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and Trump Cabinet nominees Pete Hegseth and Sen. Marco Rubio. 'You're not hoping for ratings like last time, just better ratings than the boring show it's replacing.' In the days following Trump's victory, The Handmaid's Tale and George Orwell's 1984 returned to bestseller lists, along with more contemporary works such as Timothy Snyder's On Tyranny, a 2017 bestseller that expanded upon a Facebook post Snyder wrote soon after Trump defeated Hillary Clinton. Books appealing to pro-Trump readers also surged, including those written by Cabinet picks — Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s The Real Anthony Fauci and Hegseth's The War on Warriors — and Vice President-elect J.D. Vance's Hillbilly Elegy, his 2016 memoir that's sold hundreds of thousands of copies since Trump selected him as his running mate. First lady Melania Trump's memoir, Melania, came out in October and has been high on Amazon.com bestseller lists for weeks, even as critics found it contained little newsworthy information. According to Circana, it has sold more than 200,000 copies, a figure that does not include books sold directly through her website. 'The Melania book has done extraordinarily well, better than we thought,' says Barnes & Noble CEO James Daunt. 'After Election Day, we sold everything we had of it.' Conservative books have sold steadily over the years, and several publishers — most recently Hachette Book Group — have imprints dedicated to those readers. Publishers expect at least some critical books to reach bestseller lists — if only because of the tradition of the publishing market favoring the party out of power. But the nature of what those books would look like is uncertain. Perhaps a onetime insider will have a falling out with Trump and write a memoir, like Bolton or former Trump attorney Michael Cohen, or maybe some of his planned initiatives, whether mass deportation or the prosecution of his political foes, will lead to investigative works. A new Fire and Fury is doubtful, with the originally only possible because Wolff enjoyed extraordinary access, spending months around Trump and his White House staff. Members of the president-elect's current team have already issued a statement saying they have refused to speak with Wolff, calling the author a 'known peddler of fake news who routinely concocts situations, conversations, and conclusions that never happened.' A publicist for Wolff declined to comment. Woodward, who interviewed Trump at length for the 2020 bestseller Rage, told The Associated Press that he had written so much about Trump and other presidents that he wasn't sure what he'd take on next. He doesn't rule out another Trump book, but that will depend in part on the president-elect, how 'out of control he gets,' Woodward said, and how far he is able to go. 'He wants to be the imperial president, where he gets to decide everything and no one's going to get in his way,' Woodward said. 'He's run into some brick walls in the past and there may be more brick walls. I don't know what will happen. I'll be watching and doing some reporting, but I'm still undecided.' 5 bestselling Trump-related books, per Circana Too Much and Never Enough, by Mary Trump: 1,248,212 copies Fire and Fury, by Michael Wolff: 936,116 copies Fear, by Bob Woodward: 872,014 copies The Room Where It Happened, by John Bolton: 676,010 copies Rage, by Bob Woodward: 549,685 copies These figures represent total sales provided by Circana, which tracks about 85% of the print market and does not include e-book or audiobook sales.	https://www.voanews.com/a/will-trump-s-return-lead-to-a-new-wave-of-bestselling-books-/7879829.html	2024-11-30T00:17:27-08:00	
Foreign smartphone sales in China drop 44% in October, data show	New data released Wednesday from a Chinese government-affiliated research firm showed sales of foreign-branded smartphones, including Apple’s iPhone, fell 44.25% year-on-year in China in October, while overall phone sales in China have increased 1.8%, Reuters reported. The data released by the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology revealed sales of foreign-branded phones in China decreased to 6.22 million units last month, down from 11.149 million units a year earlier. The decrease of foreign phone sales comes in the wake of Chinese tech conglomerate Huawei’s rise to the top of the phone market in China. Huawei was widely popular in China’s smartphone market last year when it released the Mate 60 Pro, a phone with a tiny computer chip more advanced than any other chip previously made by a Chinese company. Chinese consumers have eagerly embraced Huawei's smartphones, drawn to the appeal of locally made technology — an option that has swayed many who might have previously chosen iPhones. On Tuesday, the Chinese phone maker launched the next generation of the Mate 60 Pro, the Mate 70 series. The smartphone was described by Huawei’s consumer group chairman Richard Yu as the 'smartest' Mate phone, The New York Times reported. The Mate 70 series features hardware and software that are the most independent from Western influence to date. Highlights of Huawei’s newest phone include artificial intelligence-enabled functions and improved photography. The phone uses an operating system of HarmonyOS, which allows the smartphones to connect with smart devices. Huawei’s ability to self-supply the chips required for its hardware and software represents a notable development, following previous U.S. measures to restrict the company’s access to key partners and suppliers. AI technology relies on advanced semiconductor chips, a critical resource that has received attention amid tensions between Beijing and Washington, as both countries compete to dominate the advanced technology industry.

As Arctic climate warms, even Santa runs short of snow	ROVANIEMI, FINLAND — With less than a month to go until Christmas, Santa Claus is busy preparing, but the warming climate and lack of snow in his Arctic hometown have him worried. By this time of year, the town of Rovaniemi in Finnish Lapland — marketed by tourism officials since the 1980s as the 'real' home of Santa Claus — should be white and pretty. But on a recent visit, rain poured down from a gloomy slate sky and the temperature was well above freezing, with the thermometer showing +2 degrees Celsius (35.6 degrees Fahrenheit). 'My reindeer can fly, so that's no problem,' said the man in the red suit and long white beard, resting his weary legs after a long day of meeting excited children and adults. But 'we can see that climate change is real. And it's affecting the reindeer. It's affecting life here in the Arctic,' added the man, whose employers declined to identify him by his real name. Herders say milder and more unpredictable winters have left reindeer struggling to dig up their main food, lichen. Snow and ice have melted and refrozen, burying it under layers of packed ice. The Arctic is warming faster than other parts of the world due to climate change — nearly four times as fast, according to research published by Finland-based scientists in the journal Nature in 2022. Warming global temperatures, driven by humans burning fossil fuels, have been aggravating weather disasters such as floods and droughts worldwide in recent years. In Finnish Lapland, after a historically warm summer, a new November temperature record was set a few weeks ago when 11.1 C (51.98 F) was measured in the town of Utsjoki, breaking the previous record of 11.0 C (51.8 F) from 1975. Tourism boom Tourists flock to Rovaniemi from around the world to see its enchanting snowy landscapes and experience the Arctic cold. With only a few hours of daylight this time of the year, many also hope to see the spectacular colors of the Northern Lights streaking across the dark skies. Last year, the town registered a record high of more than one million overnight stays. Visitors looking to get a glimpse of Santa can meet the man himself at different locations in Rovaniemi, including the Santa Park underground theme park and the nearby Santa Claus Village. 'It's super nice. It's like in the Christmas movies, super magical,' said Maria Batista Torres from Tenerife in Spain, visiting the Santa Claus Village with her two young children. Glittering fairy lights illuminate rooftops and trees in the Santa Claus Village, which is open all year round. 'I figured it would be much more snowy,' however, said Wenguel, a visitor from the United States. 'I mean, it still feels like Christmas ... but I figured it would be a little bit more Santa-like.' In addition to meeting Santa Claus, visitors can pay to go snowmobiling or jump on a reindeer sleigh ride. While visiting Santa Claus Village is free, a picture taken with Santa costs a minimum of 40 euros ($42). Wishing for peace Gloomy skies aside, Santa Claus's Post Office in Santa Claus Village was bustling with activity, as red-hooded elves busily stamped cards and sorted piles of letters in the Christmas rush. 'In December there can be about 30,000 letters each day,' said postal elf Heidi Mustonen, who has worked here for 20 years. Over half a million letters to Santa find their way here every year, Heidi said, insisting that every letter gets opened and read thoroughly. Most of the letters were wish lists, but both children and adults also wrote to tell Santa about their personal concerns, fears, wishes and joys, with many of the envelopes containing drawings and small gifts. 'This year many people have wished for peace,' Heidi said. Most letters sent from Asian countries were written by young adults, with many wishing for strength to cope with their studies, she said. Letters from European countries were mostly written by children. Heidi said she loved the warm and happy atmosphere in Santa's village, but did wish for snowfall to brighten up the landscape. 'We would make snow everywhere if we could. But we are just postal elves.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-arctic-climate-warms-even-santa-runs-short-of-snow/7879054.html	2024-11-30T00:16:18-08:00	
Biden plans to highlight investment, partnership during Africa trip	WHITE HOUSE — President Joe Biden will make his first presidential trip to Africa next week, visiting Angola and making a stop in the island nation of Cabo Verde, a top White House official told VOA. His short visit will center around the Lobito Corridor, a 1,300-kilometer rail line that brings resources from the continent’s rich interior to Angola’s busiest port. VOA’s Philip Alexiou spoke exclusively with Frances Brown, senior director for African affairs at the National Security Council. This interview has been edited for length and clarity. VOA: How is the president feeling about this trip and what does he want to accomplish? Frances Brown, White House director for African affairs: He is excited and really looking forward to the trip. The president often talks about how it's impossible to meet today's global challenges without African leadership and African partnership, and we really see Angola as exhibit A. We are working with Angola on a few really important things. One is bolstering peace and security in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. Another is growing economic opportunities in the region. A third is technological and scientific cooperation. VOA: What are the deliverables? Are they going to be substantial? Brown: You will see a lot of announcements and deliverables on the Lobito Corridor. Already the U.S. has mobilized billions of dollars towards the corridor. I think you can expect the president to engage with various components of that infrastructure effort. I think you can expect to hear more as well on the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which recently signed a compact in Zambia. And I think you'll hear a lot of new deliverables on global health security, on agribusiness, on new forms of security sector cooperation. VOA: With so many moving parts in these efforts, what level of transparency can the U.S. ensure? What kind of accountability can it offer the people in the region? Brown: This is something that's really important to the president. The Lobito Corridor is about investment, it's about infrastructure, but it's also about ensuring that it benefits communities more broadly. It's part of the broader initiative, the Partnership on Global Investment and Infrastructure, that the president has laid out. And this is really signaling how under President Biden's administration, we've gone from an aid-driven model on engagement with Africa to an investment-driven model, and how we're thinking creatively about how to demonstrate that value proposition. When we think about the Lobito Corridor, it's all about sustainable economic development, it's all about a transparent contracting process. It's about ensuring that it boosts regional trade, that it creates quality jobs and improves lives. VOA: Is President Biden going to bring up human rights issues with Angolan President Joao Lorenzo? Brown: President Biden never shies away from talking about democracy and human rights issues with counterparts. And I think that's pretty consistent with the way he's been throughout his long career in public service. VOA: Focusing now on Sudan, President Biden has called for peace. It’s one of the worst crises that we've seen in a long time. The U.N. is saying it's a neglected and ignored crisis, the worst humanitarian situation in recent history. Does the administration see it that way? And what can be done? Brown: President Biden has been really outspoken on Sudan. You might have seen in his big speech at the U.N. General Assembly, he talked about the level of suffering in Sudan. He talked about how it was essential that the generals silence the guns and that we avert a wider famine. He's also been pretty forthright on calling for those who are obstructing humanitarian assistance to let that aid in. He's also talked about outside actors being an important part of this equation. This month, every member of the Security Council at the U.N., except for Russia, voted in favor of a resolution that would have further called for humanitarian assistance, protections for civilians and an end to the violence. The president has instructed his team to work this hard. Secretary [of State Antony] Blinken, in the last couple of weeks, has continued to engage regional states and other actors to press for unhindered humanitarian access. VOA: Moving on to the Sahel, a number of Francophone countries are forming new regional blocs, shifting away from the West and sort of aligning themselves with Russian mercenaries, the Wagner Group, and groups of this nature. How concerning is this to the administration? Brown: Even though there have been those changes that you've mentioned in the Sahelian states — particularly Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali — other West African partners, including those along the coast, have been really clear to us that they want the durability and longevity of U.S. security engagement in the region. So, we continue to work very closely on that. I'd also say more broadly that President Biden has made it really clear that he thinks it's important we continue to engage particularly with democratic partners. And on this trip that is forthcoming, the president will be stopping as well in West Africa, in Cabo Verde, which is a key democratic partner on the continent. VOA: Is there anything that the U.S. can do to counter extremism on the continent, especially since U.S. influence has been sort of downgraded since they've had to leave Niger? Brown: It’s worth remembering that we don't have a military footprint in the majority of countries on the continent. And that's been the case always. We make security arrangements with host countries, with partners based on specific shared interests. And through the administration, we've worked to foster mutually beneficial security partnerships by working by, with and through African partners. So that's how we see those collaborations. VOA: Finally, the continent is very young — the median age around 19 years old. And its leaders are really old. How does the U.S. leadership deal with that? Brown: You’re absolutely right. It is an extremely young continent, and it is the future. President Biden often talks about how by 2050, one in four humans on Earth will be from Africa. So that's very much guiding President Biden's engagement with the continent. I think the way the administration takes that forward is by thinking about how no challenge that we're trying to solve globally, we can solve without African partnership and African leadership. That's why we've championed African voices at the U.N. Security Council, on the boards of the international financial institutions, at the G20 — we successfully got the African Union seat there. So, I think from the administration's perspective, just continuing to elevate and champion African voices so they can be part of shaping the future is how we think that's best approached. VOA: What does the president want to leave behind when he departs the continent and he winds down as president? Brown: I think the president wants to leave, first, the recognition of U.S. leadership and partnership, particularly on trade, investment and a new approach to the continent that's not defined by assistance, but instead by investment and partnership. I think he wants to leave behind his recognition that African leadership for solving some of these challenges is essential, and that's why he'll be amplifying Angola's role mediating in the Democratic Republic of Congo and elsewhere. And I think he wants to convey the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-Angolan partnership, which is in many ways the story of the remarkable evolution of the U.S.-African relationship over many centuries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-plans-to-highlight-investment-partnership-during-africa-trip-/7882037.html	2024-11-30T00:15:09-08:00	
As US faces Iran threats, Trump’s security picks favor ‘maximum pressure’	Iran is likely high on the foreign policy agenda of the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. The Islamic Republic has engaged in a major escalation of conflict with U.S. ally Israel while advancing its nuclear program to the point it could rapidly produce enough fissile material for a bomb. VOA’s Michael Lipin looks at what Trump and his prospective team members have said should be done about these threats.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-us-faces-iran-threats-trump-s-security-picks-favor-maximum-pressure-/7882273.html	2024-11-29T19:39:39-08:00	
Explosion damages canal feeding Kosovo's main power plants	PRISTINA, KOSOVO — An explosion Friday evening damaged a canal in northern Kosovo supplying water to two coal-fired power plants that generate nearly all of the country's electricity, Prime Minister Albin Kurti said, blaming what he called 'a terrorist act' by neighboring Serbia. There were no immediate reports of injuries and the cause of the blast, which also impacted drinking water supplies, was not clear. Serbian officials did not respond to requests for comment, and Reuters found no immediate evidence of Belgrade's involvement. 'This is a criminal and terrorist attack with the aim to destroy our critical infrastructure,' Kurti said in a televised address. He said that some of the country could be without power if the problem is not fixed by morning. In a sign of ethnic tensions between the two Balkan countries, Kurti echoed Kosovo President Vjosa Osmani by blaming Serbian criminal gangs without providing proof. Earlier on Friday, Kosovo police announced increased security measures after two recent attacks where hand grenades were hurled at a police station and municipality building in northern Kosovo where ethnic Serbians live. It was not clear if the incidents were linked. Local media showed pictures of part of the canal destroyed and leaking water and a heavy police presence at the site. Faruk Mujka, the head of water company Ibar-Lepenci, told local news portal Kallxo that an explosive device was thrown into the canal and damaged the wall of a bridge. He said the water supply, which also feeds drinking water to the capital, Pristina, must be halted to fix the problem as soon as possible since it was the main channel for supplying Kosovo Energy Corporation, the country's main power provider. Independence for ethnic Albanian-majority Kosovo came in 2008, almost a decade after a guerrilla uprising against Serbian rule. However, tensions persist, mainly in the north where the Serb minority refuses to recognize Kosovo's statehood and still sees Belgrade as their capital. The EU's Kosovo ambassador, Aivo Orav, condemned the attack that he said was already 'depriving considerable parts of Kosovo from water supply.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/explosion-damages-canal-feeding-kosovo-s-main-power-plants-/7882268.html	2024-11-29T18:40:31-08:00	
Israeli strikes kill dozens in Gaza; Egypt to host Hamas leaders for ceasefire talks	cairo — Israeli military strikes killed at least 40 Palestinians overnight and on Friday in the Gaza Strip, medics said, as efforts to revive Gaza ceasefire talks received a boost with officials from the Palestinian group Hamas headed to Cairo for a new round of talks. Medics said they had recovered 19 bodies of Palestinians killed in northern areas of Nuseirat, one of the enclave's eight long-standing refugee camps. Later Friday, an Israeli airstrike killed at least 10 Palestinians in a house in Beit Lahiya in northern Gaza, medics said. Others were killed in the northern and southern areas of the Gaza Strip, medics added. There was no fresh statement by the Israeli military on Friday, but on Thursday it said its forces were continuing to 'strike terror targets as part of the operational activity in the Gaza Strip.' Israeli tanks entered northern and western areas of Nuseirat on Thursday. They withdrew from northern areas on Friday but remained active in western parts of the camp. The Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said teams were unable to respond to distress calls from residents trapped in their homes. Dozens of Palestinians returned on Friday to areas where the army had retreated to check on damage to their homes. Medics and relatives covered bodies, including of women, that lay on the road with blankets or white shrouds and carried them away on stretchers. 'Forgive me, my wife, forgive me, my Ibtissam, forgive me, my dear,' one grief-stricken man said through tears beside her corpse, laid out on a stretcher on the ground. Drone reportedly kills ICU leader Medics said an Israeli drone on Friday had killed Ahmed Al-Kahlout, head of the Intensive Care Unit at Kamal Adwan Hospital in Beit Lahiya, on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip, where the army has been operating since early October. Contacted by Reuters, the Israeli military said it was unaware of a strike occurring at that location or time. Kamal Adwan Hospital is one of three medical facilities on the northern edge of the Gaza Strip that barely function now because of shortages of medical, fuel, and food supplies. Most of its medical staff have been detained or expelled by the Israeli army, health officials say. The Palestinian civil emergency service, Hamas and the Palestinian official news agency WAFA put the number of Palestinians killed in two Israeli strikes in Beit Lahiya in the past 24 hours at 70. There was no immediate confirmation of the figure by the local health ministry. In the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas called for an immediate ceasefire in Gaza and accused Israel of 'using the weapon of starvation against the people (in northern Gaza) to displace them from their land and homes.' The Israeli army said forces operating in Beit Lahiya, Beit Hanoun and Jabalia since October 5 aimed to prevent Hamas militants from regrouping and waging attacks from those areas. Residents said the army was depopulating the towns of Beit Lahiya and Beit Hanoun as well as the Jabalia refugee camp. Late on Friday, two Hamas officials told Reuters a Hamas delegation would arrive in Cairo on Saturday for talks with Egyptian officials. The visit comes days after the U.S. said it would begin new efforts with Qatar, Egypt and Turkey to revive Gaza ceasefire talks. Biden pushes for ceasefire Months of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza have yielded scant progress, and negotiations are now on hold. A ceasefire in the parallel conflict between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, took effect before dawn on Wednesday, stopping hostilities that had escalated sharply in recent months and had overshadowed the Gaza conflict. Hamas and Hezbollah are both U.S.-designated terror organizations. Announcing the Lebanon accord on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said he would now renew his push for a ceasefire agreement in Gaza and he urged Israel and Hamas to seize the moment. The Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities 13 months ago, triggering the war. They killed about 1,200 people and captured more than 250 hostages, Israel has said. Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 44,300 people and displaced nearly all the enclave's population at least once, Gaza officials say. Vast swaths of the territory are in ruins.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-strikes-kill-dozens-in-gaza-egypt-to-host-hamas-leaders-for-ceasefire-talks-/7882261.html	2024-11-29T18:35:10-08:00	
Canadian news publishers sue OpenAI over alleged copyright infringement	OTTAWA, ONTARIO, CANADA — A coalition of Canadian news publishers, including The Canadian Press, Torstar, Globe and Mail, Postmedia and CBC/Radio-Canada, has filed a lawsuit against OpenAI for using news content to train its ChatGPT generative artificial intelligence system. The outlets said in a joint statement on Friday that OpenAI regularly breaches copyright by scraping large amounts of content from Canadian media. 'OpenAI is capitalizing and profiting from the use of this content, without getting permission or compensating content owners,' the statement said. The publishers argue that OpenAI practices undermine the hundreds of millions of dollars invested in journalism, and that content is protected by copyright. 'News media companies welcome technological innovations. However, all participants must follow the law, and any use of intellectual property must be on fair terms,' the statement said. Generative AI can create text, images, videos and computer code based on a simple prompt, but the systems must first study vast amounts of existing content. OpenAI said in a statement that its models are trained on publicly available data. It said they are 'grounded in fair use and related international copyright principles that are fair for creators and support innovation.' The company said it collaborates 'closely with news publishers, including in the display, attribution and links to their content in ChatGPT search' and offers outlets 'easy ways to opt out should they so desire.' This is the first such case in Canada, though numerous lawsuits are underway in the United States, including a case by The New York Times against OpenAI and Microsoft. Some news organizations have chosen to collaborate rather than fight with OpenAI by signing deals to get compensated for sharing news content that can be used to train its AI systems. The Associated Press is among the news organizations that have made licensing deals over the past year with OpenAI. Others include The Wall Street Journal and New York Post publisher News Corp., The Atlantic, Axel Springer in Germany and Prisa Media in Spain, France's Le Monde newspaper and the London-based Financial Times. Canada has passed a law requiring Google and Meta to compensate news publishers for the use of their content but has previously declined to say whether the Online News Act should apply to use by AI systems. In response to that legislation, Meta pulled news from its platforms in Canada, while Google has reached a deal to pay $100 million Canadian ($71 million) to Canadian news outlets.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canadian-news-publishers-sue-openai-over-alleged-copyright-infringement-/7882248.html	2024-11-29T17:38:57-08:00	
Who were the prisoners in US-China swap?	washington — This week’s rare prisoner swap between the United States and China saw each side claim victory and accuse the other of wrongfully detaining its citizens, while Beijing has kept quiet about the identities of the returned Chinese. China confirmed the repatriation of at least three Chinese nationals convicted of espionage and other crimes in the U.S. Among them was an individual whom Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Mao Ning, speaking at a regular briefing Thursday, described as 'a fugitive who fled to the U.S. many years ago.' Some media reports indicated four individuals were returned to China. Mao did not name those who were returned and did not confirm a prisoner swap, or the release of any Americans detained in China. But media reports, including one from the Financial Times, cited unnamed U.S. government officials as saying three Americans were exchanged for three Chinese. Released Chinese Xu Yanjun Though U.S. officials have not confirmed their identities, NBC News cited unnamed U.S. officials as saying the prisoner swap included Xu Yanjun, a Chinese intelligence officer sentenced to 20 years in prison for attempting to steal aviation trade secrets from GE Aviation. Records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons show that Xu's status is now listed as 'not in federal custody.' Ji Chaoqun NBC reported that those returned to China also included Ji Chaoqun, a naturalized U.S. citizen convicted in 2022 of providing classified defense information to Chinese intelligence. Jin Shanlin The Financial Times on Thursday reported the third Chinese released was Jin Shanlin, a former doctoral student at Southern Methodist University in northern Texas, who was sentenced in 2021 for possessing and distributing child pornography, with his sentence set to end in 2027. Records from the Federal Bureau of Prisons also show Jin’s status as 'not in federal custody.' Jin's case has sparked controversy because of his crime and his family's alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party. The FBI testified that his family had 'important political connections,' The Dallas Morning News reported in 2022, raising questions about why he was chosen for the exchange over other Chinese nationals in U.S. custody. Released Americans The White House National Security Council said Wednesday in a statement that it had secured the release of three Americans it said were 'wrongfully detained' in China, though it did not confirm a prisoner swap. Their detentions had drawn international condemnation. Mark Swidan Swidan, a Texas businessman, was arrested in 2012 in Dongguan. Despite a lack of direct evidence — no drugs or incriminating records were ever found — he was sentenced to death for drug trafficking but granted a reprieve in 2019. His mother, Katherine Swidan, led a tireless campaign for his release. 'I feared I would never see my son again,' she told VOA, recounting his years in a Guangdong prison marked by overcrowding, intense heat and deteriorating health. Kai Li Li, a Chinese American businessman, was arrested in 2016 in Shanghai on charges of stealing state secrets. His family has consistently denied the allegations, calling his 10-year sentence politically motivated. 'We thank President [Joe] Biden for prioritizing my father’s case,' said his son, Harrison Li. 'But we also urge the administration to stand firm against such detentions in the future.' John Leung Leung, 79, a Hong Kong-based American citizen, was arrested in 2021 on espionage charges. His case saw minimal public advocacy, and his family remained largely silent throughout his detention. John Kamm, founder of the San Francisco-based rights group Dui Hua, meaning 'dialogue' in Chinese, said his organization played a role in the prisoner swap in negotiations that took years to complete. 'We submitted 54 lists with Mark Swidan’s name to the Chinese government and received 10 responses,' Kamm told VOA Mandarin. 'The process was arduous but ultimately effective.' A spokesperson for the National Security Council hailed the release of the three Americans as a significant diplomatic achievement for Biden, emphasizing that all Americans classified as 'wrongfully detained Americans' in China have now been brought home. While the move brought relief to the families of the freed Americans, it has sparked concerns about its implications for U.S.-China relations and the growing trend of 'hostage diplomacy.' Kamm cautioned against declaring the issue resolved. 'There are at least 200 American citizens under coercive measures in China. Many face exit bans or detentions with little transparency,' he said. Critics like Peter Humphrey, a former detainee in China and a nonresident associate at Harvard University’s Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies, argue that no Americans held in China should be considered normal prisoners. He noted to VOA Mandarin that China’s legal processes are fundamentally flawed, as prisoners do not have fair and transparent trials. 'They have never had a trial where they were able to defend themselves properly and freely. They were under tremendous pressure in detention cells, and that pressure amounts to torture,' Humphrey said. Humphrey called this week’s prisoner swap 'capitulation to hostage diplomacy' and warned it could incentivize Beijing to detain more Americans. Diplomatic balancing act The prisoner exchange occurred amid strained U.S.-China relations, with both nations navigating a complex mix of strategic competition and occasional cooperation, and just weeks before President-elect Donald Trump is to return to the White House promising to impose hefty tariffs on Beijing. The U.S. on Wednesday lowered its travel advisory for China from Level 3 ('Reconsider Travel') to Level 2 ('Exercise Increased Caution'), raising questions about the advisory's role in the negotiations. Kamm told VOA, 'The lowering of the travel warning was part of the deal, as I understand it.' Humphrey expressed concerns about the change in travel advisory. 'China did not suddenly become safer for Americans, or any other foreigners actually, to travel to China,' he told VOA. 'It has not become safer.' Bo Gu contributed to this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-were-the-prisoners-in-us-china-swap-/7882232.html	2024-11-29T17:27:53-08:00	
Canada's Trudeau arrives in Florida for Trump meeting	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has arrived in Palm Beach, Florida, ahead of a meeting with U.S. President-elect Donald Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort, according to media reports. Trudeau's public itinerary does not list a scheduled visit to Florida. Neither Trudeau's office nor Trump's representatives immediately responded to requests for comment. Canada's Globe and Mail newspaper, citing two unidentified sources, reported that Trudeau was in Florida to meet with Trump. CNN, citing a source, later reported that Trump was going to have dinner with Trudeau on Friday night at his Mar-a-Lago resort. Canada's Public Safety Minister Dominic LeBlanc is traveling with Trudeau, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Trump threatened Monday to impose a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico until the countries clamped down on drugs, particularly fentanyl, and migrants crossing the border. Officials from Mexico, Canada and China, along with major industry groups, have warned that the hefty tariffs threatened by Trump would harm the economies of all countries involved, cause inflation to spike and damage job markets. Any hit to the Canadian economy would add to Trudeau's woes at a time when his popularity has sunk in part due to a slowing economy and a rapid surge in the cost of living over the past few years. Polls show Trudeau's Liberals would lose to the opposition Conservative party in an election that must be held by late October 2025. Trudeau this week pledged to stay united against Trump's tariffs threat and called a meeting with the premiers of all 10 Canadian provinces to discuss U.S. relations. Canada is the world's fourth-largest oil producer and sixth-largest natural gas producer. The vast majority of its 4 million barrels per day of crude exports go to the U.S. Trump's plan does not exempt crude oil from the trade penalties, two sources familiar with the plan told Reuters on Tuesday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-s-trudeau-arrives-in-florida-for-trump-meeting-/7882217.html	2024-11-29T17:01:29-08:00	
Moody's downgrades Hungary outlook on institutional 'weaknesses'	washington — The U.S. ratings agency Moody's downgraded its outlook for Hungary's government debt Friday citing 'institutional and governance weaknesses' and concerns its antagonistic relationship with the EU could have financial consequences. Hungary is a recipient of substantial amounts of funding from the European Union, which are conditional on meeting certain criteria, including adherence to the rule of law. The country's nationalist prime minister, Viktor Orban, has clashed with Brussels on a range of issues in recent years, some of which could see it lose out on those EU funds, Moody's indicated in a note explaining its decision. 'Our decision to change the outlook to negative (from stable) reflects downside risks related to the quality of Hungary's institutions and governance,' Moody's analysts wrote in a note explaining their decision. What that means, they said, is that Hungary could ultimately lose out on a 'substantial' amount of EU money 'because it does not meet the conditions for the release of these funds.' 'In turn, this could lower trend GDP growth and weaken fiscal and debt metrics,' they added. In the same note, Moody's affirmed Hungary's investment grade foreign- and local-currency credit rating of Baa2. Moody's said that the total EU funds allocated to Hungary were equivalent to around 3.4% of economic output per year. Given the ongoing 'difficult negotiations' between Hungary and the EU, Moody's noted there were 'elevated risks that Hungary will miss out on a substantial amount' of some of that funding.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7882207.html	2024-11-29T16:22:26-08:00	
Georgian protesters clash with police for 2nd night after EU talks suspended	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Thousands of demonstrators protesting the Georgian government's decision to suspend negotiations to join the European Union rallied outside the parliament and clashed with police for a second straight night Friday. The night before, police used water cannons, pepper spray and tear gas to disperse protesters who took to the streets of Tbilisi, the Georgian capital, after Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze of the ruling Georgian Dream party announced the suspension. The interior ministry said it detained 43 people during the protests. On Friday evening, protesters again swarmed the parliament, with some trying to break the metal gates to the building. Riot police used water cannons to push them away from the building and later moved to force them farther back along Rustaveli Avenue, the city's main boulevard. Some of the protesters used garbage bins and benches to try to build barricades. Clashes between police and protesters also erupted late Friday in the Black Sea port of Batumi. Georgian Dream's disputed victory in the October 26 election, which was widely seen as a referendum on the country's aspirations to join the European Union, has sparked massive demonstrations and led to an opposition boycott of the parliament. The opposition said the vote was rigged under the influence of Russia, which seeks to keep Georgia in its orbit. President Salome Zourabichvili joined protesters Thursday after accusing the government of declaring 'war' on its own people. In Friday's address to the nation, Zourabichvili urged police not to use force against protesters. The Georgian president, who has a largely ceremonial role, has declared that the ruling party rigged the election with the help of Russia, Georgia's former imperial master. The government's announcement that it was suspending negotiations to join the EU came hours after the European Parliament adopted a resolution that condemned last month's vote as neither free nor fair, representing yet another manifestation of the continued democratic backsliding 'for which the ruling Georgian Dream party is fully responsible.' European election observers said October's vote took place in a divisive atmosphere marked by instances of bribery, double voting and physical violence. The EU granted Georgia candidate status in December 2023 on the condition that it meet the bloc's recommendations but put its accession on hold and cut financial support earlier this year after the passage of a 'foreign influence' law widely seen as a blow to democratic freedoms. EU lawmakers urged for a rerun of the parliamentary vote within a year under thorough international supervision and by an independent election administration. They also called on the EU to impose sanctions and limit formal contacts with the Georgian government. The Georgian prime minister fired back, denouncing what he described as a 'cascade of insults' from the EU politicians and declaring that 'the ill-wishers of our country have turned the European Parliament into a blunt weapon of blackmail against Georgia, which is a great disgrace for the European Union.' 'We will continue on our path toward the European Union; however, we will not allow anyone to keep us in a constant state of blackmail and manipulation, which is utterly disrespectful to our country and society,' Kobakhidze said. 'We must clearly show certain European politicians and bureaucrats, who are completely devoid of European values, that they must speak to Georgia with dignity, not through blackmail and insults.' Kobakhidze also said Georgia would reject any budgetary grants from the EU until the end of 2028. Critics have accused Georgian Dream — established by Bidzina Ivanishvili, a shadowy billionaire who made his fortune in Russia — of becoming increasingly authoritarian and tilted toward Moscow. The party recently pushed through laws like those used by the Kremlin to crack down on freedom of speech and LGBTQ+ rights. The EU suspended Georgia's membership application process indefinitely in June, after parliament passed a law requiring organizations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad to register as 'pursuing the interest of a foreign power,' similar to a Russian law used to discredit organizations critical of the government.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgian-protesters-clash-with-police-for-2nd-night-after-eu-talks-suspended-/7882026.html	2024-11-29T15:54:16-08:00	
North Korea: Russia has right to exercise self-defense against Ukraine	seoul — North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has told the Russian defense minister that Ukraine's use of long-range weapons is the result of direct military intervention by the United States and that Moscow is entitled to fight in self-defense, state media said Saturday. The state-run Korean Central News Agency said Kim met Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov on Friday, and it quoted the North Korean leader as saying, 'The U.S. and the West made Kyiv authorities attack Russia's territory with their own long-range strike weapons.' Russia should take action to make 'hostile forces pay the price,' Kim said. 'The DPRK government, army and people will invariably support the policy of the Russian Federation to defend its sovereignty and territorial integrity from the imperialists' moves for hegemony,' KCNA quoted Kim as saying. DPRK is short for North Korea's official name, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Kim pledged to expand ties with Russia in all areas, including military affairs, under the comprehensive strategic partnership he signed with Russian President Vladimir Putin in June, which includes a mutual defense agreement, KCNA said. Moscow and Pyongyang have dramatically advanced ties since their leaders held a summit in September 2023 in Russia, and the North has since shipped to Russia more than 10,000 containers of ammunition, as well as self-propelled howitzers and multiple rocket launchers, according to South Korea's spy agency. KCNA made no mention of whether Kim and Belousov discussed North Korea's deployment of troops to Russia. South Korea's spy agency has said that North Korea has sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia and that they have been moved to the front lines, including the Kursk region, where Russian forces are trying to expel Ukrainian forces. Ukraine has fired U.S. ATACMS missiles to strike Russian territory after the administration of U.S. President Joe Biden gave permission to use them for such an attack this month. Russia in turn unleashed attacks against Ukraine's military and energy infrastructures, saying they were made in response to the use of U.S. medium-range missiles. Belousov separately held talks with North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol and said the partnership pact signed by Kim and Putin would contribute to maintaining the balance of power in Northeast Asia. Kim personally attended a reception hosted by the defense ministry for Belousov's delegation, KCNA said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-russia-has-right-to-exercise-self-defense-against-ukraine-/7882032.html	2024-11-29T15:33:11-08:00

Kremlin critic convicted again, handed new prison term for opposing war in Ukraine	TALLINN, ESTONIA — Imprisoned Kremlin critic Alexei Gorinov was convicted again on Friday for opposing Russia's war in Ukraine and handed a three-year prison term. A swift, three-day trial against Gorinov, once a low-profile activist, underscored Moscow's intolerance of any dissenting voices. Gorinov, a 63-year-old former member of a Moscow municipal council, is already serving a seven-year prison term for public criticism of the full-scale invasion. Taking into account his previous conviction and sentence, a court in Russia's Vladimir region ordered him to serve a total of five years in a maximum-security prison, a facility with stricter conditions than the one he's currently in. Russia's independent news site Mediazona quoted Gorinov's lawyer as saying that it means he will spend a year more behind bars compared to his previous sentence. Gorinov was first convicted in July 2022, when a court in Moscow sentenced him to seven years in prison for 'spreading false information' about the Russian army at a municipal council meeting. Gorinov allegedly voiced skepticism about a children’s art competition in his constituency while saying that 'every day children are dying' in Ukraine. He was the first known Russian sent to prison under a 2022 law that essentially bans any public expression about the war that deviates from the official narrative. His arrest, conviction and imprisonment has shocked many. In written comments to The Associated Press from behind bars in March 2023, Gorinov said that 'authorities needed an example they could showcase to others (of) an ordinary person, rather than a public figure.' Authorities launched a second case against him last year, according to his supporters. He was accused of 'justifying terrorism' in conversations with his cellmates about Ukraine’s Azov battalion, which Russia outlawed as a terrorist organization, and the 2022 explosion on the Crimean bridge, which Moscow deemed an act of terrorism. Gorinov vehemently rejected the accusations Wednesday, independent news site Mediazona reported. It quoted him as telling the court that he merely said the annexed Crimean Peninsula was Ukrainian territory and called Azov a part of the Ukrainian army. Gorinov’s trial began Wednesday in the Vladimir region, where he is serving time stemming from his previous conviction. Photos from the courtroom, published by Mediazona, showed a weary Gorinov in the defendant’s cage, with a hand-drawn peace symbol on a piece of paper covering his prison badge. He held a hand-written placard saying: 'Stop killing. Let’s stop the war.' He had part of a lung removed before prison and has struggled with respiratory illnesses behind bars. In his closing statement in court on Friday, Gorinov remained defiant and once again condemned the Russian authorities for the war in Ukraine. 'My guilt is that I, as a citizen of my country, allowed this war to happen and could not stop it,' Mediazona quoted him as saying. 'But I would like my guilt and responsibility to be shared with me by the organizers, participants, supporters of the war, as well as the persecutors of those who advocate peace. I continue to live with the hope that this will happen someday. In the meantime, I ask those who live in Ukraine and my fellow citizens who suffered from the war to forgive me,' Gorinov said. According to OVD-Info, a prominent rights group that tracks political arrests, some 1,100 people have been implicated in criminal cases over their anti-war stance since February 2022. A total of 340 of them are currently behind bars or have been involuntarily committed to medical institutions.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kremlin-critic-convicted-again-handed-new-prison-term-for-opposing-war-in-ukraine-/7881849.html	2024-11-29T12:18:04-08:00	
Iran to begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges, UN watchdog says	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran will begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges at its two main nuclear facilities at Fordo and Natanz, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said Friday, further raising tensions over Tehran's program as it enriches at near weapons-grade levels. The notice from the International Atomic Energy Agency only mentioned Iran enriching uranium with new centrifuges to 5% purity, far lower than the 60% it currently does — likely signaling that it still wants to negotiate with the West and the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump. However, it remains unclear how Trump will approach Iran once he enters office, particularly as it continues to threaten to attack Israel amid its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and just after a ceasefire started in its campaign in Lebanon. Trump withdrew America from the accord in 2018. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not respond to a request for comment over the IAEA's report. Tehran had threatened to rapidly advance its program after the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemned Iran at a meeting in November for failing to cooperate fully with the agency. In a statement, the IAEA outlined the plans Iran informed it about, which include feeding uranium into some 45 cascades of its advanced IR-2M, IR-4 and IR-6 centrifuges. Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. Each of these advanced classes of centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran’s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country’s atomic program. The IAEA did not elaborate on how many machines would be in each cascade, but Iran has put around 160 centrifuges into a single cascade in the past. It's unclear if Iran has begun feeding the uranium yet into the centrifuges. Tehran so far has been vague about its plans. But starting the enrichment at 5% gives Tehran both leverage at negotiations with the West and another way to dial up the pressure if they don't like what they hear. Weapons-grade levels of enrichment are about 90%. Since the collapse of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers following the United States’ unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, it has pursued nuclear enrichment just below weapons-grade levels. U.S. intelligence agencies and others assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program. The U.S. State Department said in a statement to The Associated Press it was 'deeply concerned with Iran’s announcement that it is choosing the path of continued escalation as opposed to cooperation with the IAEA.' 'Iran’s continued production and accumulation of uranium enriched up to 60% has no credible civilian justification,' it added. Iran, as a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has pledged to allow the IAEA to visit its atomic sites to ensure its program is peaceful. Tehran also had agreed to additional oversight from the IAEA as part of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw sanctions lifted in exchange for drastically limiting its program. However, for years Iran has curtailed inspectors’ access to sites, while also not fully answering questions about other sites where nuclear material has been found in the past after the deal's collapse. Iranian officials in recent months, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Masoud Pezeshkian, had signaled a willingness to negotiate with the West. But Iran also has launched two attacks on Israel amid the war. Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian diplomat, said in a post on the social platform that he met with EU diplomat Enrique Mora, criticizing Europe as being 'self-centered' while having 'irresponsible behavior.' 'With regard to the nuclear issue of Iran, Europe has failed to be a serious player due to lack of self-confidence and responsibility,' Gharibabadi wrote. For his part, Mora described having a 'frank discussion' with Gharibabadi and another Iranian diplomat. Those talks included 'Iran’s military support to Russia that has to stop, the nuclear issue that needs a diplomatic solution, regional tensions (important to avoid further escalation from all sides) and human rights,' he wrote on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-to-begin-enriching-uranium-with-thousands-of-advanced-centrifuges-un-watchdog-says-/7881801.html	2024-11-29T11:34:48-08:00	
Ukraine asks NATO for membership invite next week, letter shows	Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha has urged his NATO counterparts to issue an invitation at a meeting in Brussels next week to Kyiv to join the Western military alliance, according to the text of a letter seen by Reuters on Friday. The letter reflects Ukraine's renewed push to secure an invitation to join NATO, which is part of a 'victory plan' outlined last month by President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to end the war triggered by Russia's 2022 invasion. Ukraine says it accepts that it cannot join the alliance until the war is over but extending an invitation now would show Russian President Vladimir Putin that he could not achieve one of his main goals — preventing Kyiv from becoming a NATO member. 'The invitation should not be seen as an escalation,' Sybiha wrote in the letter. 'On the contrary, with a clear understanding that Ukraine's membership in NATO is inevitable, Russia will lose one of its main arguments for continuing this unjustified war,' he wrote. 'I urge you to endorse the decision to invite Ukraine to join the Alliance as one of the outcomes of the NATO Foreign Ministerial Meeting on 3-4 December 2024.' NATO diplomats say there is no consensus among alliance members to invite Ukraine at this stage. Any such decision would require the consent of all NATO's 32 member countries. NATO has declared that Ukraine will join the alliance and that it is on an 'irreversible' path to membership. But it has not issued a formal invitation or set out a timeline. Olga Stefanishyna, Ukraine's deputy prime minister in charge of NATO affairs, said Kyiv understood that the consensus for an invitation to join NATO 'is not yet there' but the letter was meant to send a strong political signal. 'We have sent a message to the allies that invitation is not off of the table, regardless of different manipulations and speculations around that,' she told Reuters. In his letter, Sybiha argued an invitation would be the right response 'to Russia's constant escalation of the war it has unleashed, the latest demonstration of which is the involvement of tens of thousands of North Korean troops and the use of Ukraine as a testing ground for new weapons.' In recent days, however, diplomats have said they do not see any changes of stance among NATO countries, particularly as they await the Ukraine policy of the United States — the alliance's dominant power — under the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-asks-nato-for-membership-invite-next-week-letter-shows/7881774.html	2024-11-29T11:26:30-08:00	
At least 100 people missing after boat capsizes in northern Nigeria	ABUJA, NIGERIA — At least 100 people, most of them women, were missing after a boat transporting them to a food market capsized along the River Niger in northern Nigeria, authorities said Friday. The boat was taking the passengers from Kogi state along the river to neighboring Niger early Friday when it capsized, Niger State Emergency Management Agency spokesperson Ibrahim Audu told The Associated Press. At least eight people were confirmed dead at the scene while local divers were trying to rescue others, the local Channels Television reported, citing witness accounts. Authorities have not confirmed what caused the sinking. However, local media reported that the boat was carrying more than 200 passengers, suggesting it might have been overloaded. Overcrowding in vehicles is common in remote parts of Nigeria where the lack of good roads leaves many with no alternative routes. Officials in Kogi are yet to locate the exact location of the incident and were seeking assistance from other agencies, according to Justin Uwazuruonye, who oversees Nigeria’s National Emergency Management Agency operations in the state. Such deadly incidents are increasingly becoming a source of concern in Nigeria, Africa’s most-populous country, as authorities struggle to enforce safety measures and regulations for water transportation. Most of the accidents have been attributed to overcrowding and the lack of maintenance of the boats, often built locally to accommodate as many passengers as possible in defiance of safety measures. Authorities have not been able to enforce the use of life jackets on such trips, often because of lack of availability or cost.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-100-people-missing-after-boat-capsizes-in-northern-nigeria/7881713.html	2024-11-29T10:20:08-08:00	
SunFed recalls cucumbers in US, Canada due to potential salmonella	Cucumbers shipped to 13 U.S. states and five Canadian provinces have been recalled because of potential salmonella contamination, the Food and Drug Administration said this week. SunFed Produce, based in Arizona, recalled the cucumbers sold between October 12 and November 26, the FDA said Thursday. No illnesses were immediately reported. People who bought cucumbers during the window should check with the store where they purchased them to see if the produce is part of the recall. Wash items and surfaces that may have been in contact with the produce using hot, soapy water or a dishwasher. Salmonella can cause symptoms that begin six hours to six days after ingesting the bacteria and include diarrhea, fever and stomach cramps. Most people recover without treatment within a week, but young children, people older than 65 and those with weakened immune systems can become seriously ill. Earlier this summer, a separate salmonella outbreak in cucumbers sickened 450 people in the United States.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sunfed-recalls-cucumbers-in-us-canada-due-to-potential-salmonella/7881652.html	2024-11-29T09:40:13-08:00

Notre Dame Cathedral unveils new interior 5 years after devastating fire	After more than five years of frenetic reconstruction work, Notre Dame Cathedral showed its new self to the world Friday, with rebuilt soaring ceilings and creamy good-as-new stonework erasing somber memories of its devastating fire in 2019. Images broadcast live of a site visit by French President Emmanuel Macron showed the inside of the iconic cathedral as worshippers might have experienced it back in medieval times, its wide, open spaces filled with bright light on a crisp and sunny winter’s day that lit up the vibrant colors of the stained-glass windows. Outside, the monument is still a construction site, with scaffolding and cranes. But the renovated interior — shown in its full glory Friday for the first time before the public is allowed back in on December 8 — proved to be breathtaking. Stonemasons fixed the ripped-open ceilings Gone are the gaping holes that the blaze tore into the vaulted ceilings, leaving charred piles of debris. New stonework has been carefully pieced together to repair and fill the wounds that had left the cathedral's insides exposed to the elements. Delicate golden angels look on from the centerpiece of one of the rebuilt ceilings, soaring again above the transept. The cathedral's bright, cream-colored limestone walls look brand new, cleaned not only of dust from the fire but also of grime that had accumulated for centuries. The cathedral attracted millions of worshippers and visitors annually before the April 15, 2019, fire forced its closure and turned the monument in the heart of Paris into a no-go zone except to artisans, architects and others mobilized for the reconstruction. Macron entered via the cathedral’s giant and intricately carved front doors and stared up at the ceilings in wonder. He was accompanied by his wife, Brigitte, the archbishop of Paris and others. Techniques new and old deployed Powerful vacuum cleaners were used to first remove toxic dust released when the fire melted the cathedral's lead roofs. Fine layers of latex were then sprayed onto the surfaces and removed a few days later, taking dirt away with them. Cleaning gels were also used on some walls that had been painted, removing many years of accumulated dirt and revealing their bright colors once again. Carpenters worked by hand like their medieval counterparts as they hewed giant oak beams to rebuild the roof and spire that collapsed like a flaming spear into the inferno. The beams show the marks of the carpenters' handiwork, with dents made on the woodwork by their hand axes. Some 2,000 oak trees were felled to rebuild roof frameworks so dense and intricate that they are nicknamed 'the forest.' Sneak peek ahead of reopening Macron's visit kicked off a series of events ushering in the reopening of the 12th-century Gothic masterpiece. Macron will return on December 7 to deliver an address and attend the consecration of the new altar during a solemn Mass the following day. Macron's administration is hailing the reconstruction as a symbol of national unity and French can-do.	https://www.voanews.com/a/notre-dame-cathedral-unveils-new-interior-5-years-after-devastating-fire-/7881541.html	2024-11-29T09:08:16-08:00	
Paraguay vows to uphold Taiwan ties amid growing Chinese influence in Latin America	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Paraguayan Foreign Minister Ruben Dario Ramirez Lezcano said Friday the country remains committed to diplomatic ties with Taiwan despite farm sector calls for it to switch to having formal relations with China. At the same time, Ramirez Lezcano said his government is open to establishing trade and other relations with Beijing as long as it would not have to break off its ties with Taiwan. Paraguay is one of only 12 countries maintaining diplomatic relations with Taiwan — and the only one in South America. 'Paraguay is open to establishing diplomatic, consular or commercial relations with China without conditions,' Ramirez Lezcano told VOA and five other U.S. news organizations. 'We are still committed to supporting the Taiwan government, and we don’t accept any condition to break our relations with Taiwan,' he said. Paraguay has been seeking to gain access to the Chinese market though a trade deal between Beijing and the South American Common Market, known by its Spanish initials Mercosur, which includes countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and Uruguay as well as Paraguay. 'Our position with China is one of total openness,' said Paraguayan President Santiago Pena during an August interview with Reuters. 'We are in favor of advancing trade agreements.' However, talks toward a China-Mercosur trade deal have so far been frustrated by disagreements among the Mercosur members and China’s insistence that any country seeking relations with Beijing must renounce its diplomatic recognition of Taiwan. 'Principles and values' matter, too Ramirez Lezcano reiterated Friday that economic benefit is not the only consideration for Paraguay when deciding whether to maintain diplomatic relations with any country. 'The most important factors are principles and values, rather than just trade and money,' he said. Analysts say Paraguay’s recognition of Taiwan is not the only obstacle to a China-Mercosur trade deal. There are also fears by some countries within the bloc about overreliance on China and the impact that a deal would have on their own industries. Kung Kwo-Wei, a Latin American affairs expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, noted that Brazil imposed new tariffs In October on Chinese and other Asian imports such as iron, steel and fiber, describing the move as an effort to combat dumping and protect Brazil’s domestic industries. 'Mercosur can only sign a free-trade agreement with China if all member states approve the proposal, but so far, there is no consensus among all member states because Brazil remains cautious about the move,' said Su Yen-pin, an expert on Latin American affairs at National Chengchi University in Taiwan. 'Since Paraguay has repeatedly said it won’t sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan in exchange for signing trade deals with China, that makes it impossible for Mercosur to approve the free-trade agreement with China anytime soon,' he told VOA by phone. China has repeatedly emphasized that Taiwan is an inalienable part of China and urged Paraguay to 'follow the trend of history.' 'We hope the government and leader of Paraguay will follow the trend of history, meet the aspiration of its people, stand on the right side of history as early as possible, join the overwhelming majority of the international community, and make the right decision that serves the fundamental and long-term interests of the country,' Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters in August. Trade with Taiwan While Paraguay is unlikely to sign trade deals with China anytime soon, experts say Taiwan faces pressure to increase its imports from Paraguay and its investments there. 'Members of the Paraguayan Congress tend to discuss the benefits for Paraguay to maintain ties with Taiwan, and there is an increasing sense among Paraguay’s agricultural businesses that they are losing a lot of economic benefits from maintaining ties with Taiwan,' said Fabricio Fonseca, an assistant professor of diplomacy at Taiwan’s National Chengchi University. He said that while Taiwan continues to increase its imports of beef and other agricultural products from Paraguay, farmers in other Mercosur states want the greater access to the China market a trade deal would offer, contributing to the pressure on the Paraguayan government. 'Every once in a while, not only during election cycles, we see these push to discuss the topic of Paraguay’s relations with Taiwan in the Congress, and this will continue to affect bilateral ties between Taiwan and Paraguay,' Fonseca told VOA by phone. Paraguay has also been seeking more Taiwanese investment. Ramirez Lezcano said Asuncion is trying to attract more Taiwanese investments in the high-tech sector. 'Taiwan is establishing an industrial park in Paraguay, and we are working to establish a technological ecosystem with Taiwanese companies,' he told the reporters Friday. While Taiwan has sent several trade delegations to Paraguay in recent years, some Taiwanese analysts say the number of Taiwanese businesses investing in Paraguay remains limited. 'Paraguay is geographically far from Taiwan, and Taiwanese businesses often think it’s difficult to ensure a smooth industrial technology transfer to Paraguay,' Kung Kwo-Wei, a Latin American affairs expert at Tamkang University in Taiwan, told VOA by phone. Despite Taiwan’s limited private sector investment in Paraguay, Kung said the United States and Taiwan are working together to help Paraguay expand its private sector. 'In 2021, Taiwan and the U.S. worked with Paraguay to bolster growth in its renewable energy and electric vehicle sector, and the three countries also jointly established several small business development centers,' he said. Despite the challenges, Su in Taiwan said Paraguay’s ruling Colorado Party is unlikely to make a major shift. 'Unless there is a regime change in Paraguay’s next election, there won’t be too many opportunities for China to influence the diplomatic ties between Taipei and Asunción,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/paraguay-vows-to-uphold-taiwan-ties-amid-growing-chinese-influence-in-latin-america/7881481.html	2024-11-29T08:40:33-08:00

Russia’s war in Ukraine inspires exiled journalist to found media startup	PRAGUE — Lola Tagaeva has no problem acknowledging that she is not an easy boss. But when you’re running a startup news outlet from exile while your home country is at war, a steely demeanor can be an asset. 'I think it’s incredibly tough to work with me,' Tagaeva said with pride, when we met at a Prague cafe on a rainy October morning. Tagaeva asks her reporters 'to travel to the future,' she said, and to figure out what stories haven’t been told yet. 'We have to be two steps ahead,' she said. That outlook is what helped put the outlet she founded — Verstka — on the map in such a short period of time. Tagaeva founded the news website from exile shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. The outlet now reaches millions of people each month and has grown into a major player in the independent Russian media landscape. Originally from the Siberian city of Novosibirsk, Tagaeva left Russia for Prague in 2019 — not because of safety concerns over her work, but because of her daughter. 'I never wanted to move, actually, but when I gave birth to her, I understood that I wanted her to grow up in a free place,' Tagaeva said. Tagaeva had worked at top Russian independent outlets, including Novaya Gazeta and TV Rain. But after years of hoping that her work would bring change to Russia, only to see the country become more authoritarian, she was burned out. 'Every day was news from [an] apocalypse,' Tagaeva said. Tagaeva’s break from journalism lasted about three years. When Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the journalist knew that many more stories would need to be told and that the Kremlin would embark on a harsher crackdown on independent media. 'I started to feel some kind of responsibility,' she said. So, she founded Verstka. Verstka is Russian for 'layout,' like the layout of a newspaper’s front page. The outlet started in April 2022 and now reaches millions of people each month, about 70% of whom are inside Russia, according to Tagaeva. Verstka’s success is at least partly a product of the time in which it was founded, when Russian journalists were figuring out how to reinvent themselves during war and as a media crackdown forced them into exile, according to Karol Luczka, who covers eastern Europe at the International Press Institute in Vienna. 'They [Verstka’s staff] were able to enter the mainstream of big, Russian independent media without being big and while being very new,' Luczka told VOA. Tagaeva points to Verstka’s commitment to distribution as a main driver behind the outlet’s early success. She had key staff on board even before the outlet was officially founded, Tagaeva said. 'We didn’t have money. We didn’t have staff. But I already had a director of marketing,' Tagaeva said. Like many Russian news outlets, the social media platform Telegram is Verstka’s primary hub. 'I don’t believe in media without good distribution, because it’s not a private blog,' Tagaeva said. 'If I’m not able to distribute what you wrote, we don’t need it.' Perhaps more important than distribution is Tagaeva’s commitment to covering underreported issues. Instead of daily news, Verstka focuses on deeply reported features and investigations — the kinds of stories that readers can’t easily get anywhere else. The outlet was one of the first to report on Russia abducting Ukrainian children. Kyiv estimates that 20,000 Ukrainian children have been taken since the invasion. The International Criminal Court has issued arrest warrants for Russian President Vladimir Putin and children’s commissioner Maria Lvova-Belova on war crimes charges related to the practice. Moscow says that it has protected vulnerable children from the war zone and that it does not recognize the ICC. The opportunity to produce stories of that weight is what convinced journalist Anna Ryzhkova to work at Verstka. 'I have zero questions about the importance of the work we do,' Ryzhkova told VOA. The priority is stories that are 'impossible not to pay attention to,' she said. Ryzhkova reported for various outlets in Russia before leaving for Georgia shortly after the war began. She has worked at Verstka since it was founded and moved to Prague in 2023. Ryzhkova acknowledges that Tagaeva’s standards are high. But Ryzhkova said she knows that is why Verstka has succeeded in a generally difficult media landscape. 'It’s like an illness. At first, you might not feel really comfortable with the pace of work, but then you just become a part of it,' Ryzhkova said. 'What Lola demands from us is something that we actually demand from ourselves now.' Tagaeva believes that when outlets feel too comfortable, they don’t push themselves, saying, 'There is always space to develop yourself.' In just a couple years, her outlet has expanded from three to about 50 employees — some of whom are still reporting anonymously from inside Russia. But as the third anniversary of the invasion approaches, Tagaeva is concerned that the repressive environment in Russia will hamper the next generation of journalists. 'This, I’m afraid, will be the most dangerous issue for us,' Tagaeva said. Since Russia invaded Ukraine, Moscow has imposed harsh laws and punishments on journalists who don’t follow the Kremlin’s narrative. For journalists still in the country, 'you have to shut up, or you have to go to prison,' Tagaeva said. Although Tagaeva didn’t leave her home because of her work, it’s the main reason that she can’t return anytime soon. She and Verstka have been labeled foreign agents by the Russian government. Tagaeva expects Verstka to eventually be labeled an undesirable organization, like many other independent Russian news outlets. That designation would ban Verstka’s operations in Russia and open up Verstka staffers and sources to fines, criminal charges and jail time. But she remains committed to reporting. And her experience running an outlet has reframed for Tagaeva what it means to have impact. 'We’re not changing the world, but we’re helping people to see the reality,' she said. 'And I think it’s enough for us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-war-in-ukraine-inspires-exiled-journalist-to-found-media-startup/7881408.html	2024-11-29T07:49:49-08:00	
Syria insurgents breach second largest city of Aleppo, fighters and war monitor say	BEIRUT — Insurgents breached Syria’s second-largest city Aleppo after blowing up two car bombs on Friday and were clashing with government forces on the city's western edge, according to a Syria war monitor and fighters. It was the first time the city has been attacked by opposition forces since 2016, when they were ousted from Aleppo's eastern neighborhoods following a grueling military campaign in which Syrian government forces were backed by Russia, Iran and its allied groups. Witnesses in Aleppo city said residents have been fleeing neighborhoods on the western edge of the city because of missiles and exchanges of fire. The government did not comment on insurgents breaching city limits. Syria's Armed Forces said in a statement Friday it has been clashing with insurgents in the countryside around Aleppo and Idlib, destroying several of their drones and heavy weapons. It vowed to repel the attack and accused the insurgents of spreading false information about their advances. Thousands of insurgents have been advancing toward Aleppo city since a shock offensive they launched on Wednesday, seizing several towns and villages along the way. The offensive came as Iran-linked groups, who had backed Syrian government forces since 2015, have been preoccupied with their own battle at home. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a war monitor, said the insurgents blew up two car bombs at the city’s western edge on Friday. An insurgent commander issued a recorded message posted on social media calling on the city's residents to cooperate with the advancing forces. Turkey state-run Anadolu Agency reported that the opposition insurgents entered Aleppo city center Friday. It said the insurgents 'broke through the defense lines of the regime forces along the Hamdaniyya, New Aleppo, and Zahra axis on the outskirts of the city.' It added the insurgents now control approximately 70 locations in Aleppo and Idlib provinces. Syria’s state media reported earlier Friday that projectiles from insurgents landed in the student accommodations at Aleppo's university in the city center, killing four people, including two students. Public transportation to the city had also been diverted from the main highway linking Aleppo to the capital Damascus to avoid clashes, the report said. Fighters also advanced on the town of Saraqab, in northwestern Idlib province, a strategic area that would secure supply lines to Aleppo. This week's advances were one of the largest by opposition factions, led by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, and come after weeks of low simmering violence. It is most intense fighting in northwestern Syria since 2020, when government forces seized areas previously controlled by opposition fighters. Syria’s Armed Forces said the insurgents are violating a 2019 agreement that de-escalated fighting in the area, which has been the last remaining opposition stronghold for years. The war monitor Observatory said dozens of fighters from both sides have been killed in the battles that started Wednesday. The insurgents have seized control of more than 50 villages in their advance, which seem to have caught the government forces unprepared. Hezbollah, the lead group in an Iran-linked alliance that has backed Syria's government, has been locked in a war with Israel that escalated since September. A cease-fire was announced Wednesday, the day the Syrian opposition factions announced their offensive. Israel has also escalated its attacks against Hezbollah and Iran-linked targets in Syria during the last 70 days. 'Hezbollah was the main force in the government’s control of the city,' said Rami Abdurrahman, head of the Observatory. The insurgents reported earlier Friday that fighters had wrested control of the Scientific Research Center neighborhood, about 4 kilometers from the western outskirts of Aleppo city. Government-linked media denied the insurgents have seized it. The Associated Press was not able to immediately verify the claims. Insurgents posted videos online showing they were using drones in their advance, a new weapon they had not had previously in the earlier stages of their confrontation with government forces. It was not clear to what extent the drones were used on the battleground. Turkey’s Anadolu Agency, reporting from Idlib, said insurgents attacked a military airbase southeast of Aleppo city with drones early Friday, destroying a helicopter. It said the opposition groups seized heavy weapons, depots and military vehicles belonging to the government forces during their advance. Aid groups said the fighting has displaced thousands of families and forced some services to be suspended. The opposition fighters said their offensive will allow the return of thousands of displaced people who were forced to flee government bombardment in recent weeks. The 2016 battle for Aleppo was a turning point in the war between Syrian government forces and rebel fighters since the 2011 protests against Bashar Assad’s rule turned into an all-out war. Russia and Iran and its allied groups had helped Syrian government forces reclaim control of all of Aleppo that year, after a grueling military campaign and a siege that lasted for weeks. Turkey has been a main backer of an array of opposition forces and its troops have established military presence in parts of northwestern Syria. Separately and largely in the east of Syria, the United States has supported Syrian Kurdish forces fighting Islamic State militants.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-insurgents-breach-second-largest-city-of-aleppo-fighters-and-war-monitor-say-/7881390.html	2024-11-29T07:07:39-08:00	
Ireland votes as incumbents hope to cling to power	DUBLIN — Ireland is voting Friday in a parliamentary election that will decide the next government — and will show whether Ireland bucks the global trend of incumbents being ousted by disgruntled voters after years of pandemic, international instability and cost-of-living pressures. Ireland’s 3.8 million voters are selecting 174 lawmakers to sit in the Dail, the lower house of parliament. Here’s a look at the parties, the issues and the likely outcome. Who’s running? The outgoing government was led by the two parties that have dominated Irish politics for the past century: Fine Gael and Fianna Fail. They have similar center-right policies but are longtime rivals with origins on opposing sides of Ireland’s 1920s civil war. After the 2020 election ended in a virtual dead heat, they formed a coalition, agreeing to share Cabinet posts and take turns as taoiseach, or prime minister. Fianna Fail leader Micheal Martin served as premier for the first half of the term and was replaced by Fine Gael’s Leo Varadkar in December 2022. Varadkar unexpectedly stepped down in March, passing the job to current Taoiseach Simon Harris. Opposition party Sinn Fein achieved a stunning breakthrough in the 2020 election, topping the popular vote, but was shut out of government because Fianna Fail and Fine Gael refused to work with it, citing its leftist policies and historic ties with militant group the Irish Republican Army during three decades of violence in Northern Ireland. Under Ireland’s system of proportional representation, each of the 43 constituencies elects multiple lawmakers, with voters ranking their preferences. That makes it relatively easy for smaller parties and independent candidates with a strong local following to gain seats. This election includes a large crop of independent candidates, ranging from local campaigners to far-right activists and reputed crime boss Gerry 'the Monk' Hutch. What are the main issues? As in many other countries, the cost of living — especially housing — has dominated the campaign. Ireland has an acute housing shortage, the legacy of failing to build enough new homes during the country’s 'Celtic Tiger' boom years and the economic slump that followed the 2008 global financial crisis. 'There was not building during the crisis, and when the crisis receded, offices and hotels were built first,' said John-Mark McCafferty, chief executive of housing and homelessness charity Threshold. The result is soaring house prices, rising rents and growing homelessness. After a decade of economic growth, McCafferty said 'Ireland has resources' — not least $13.6 billion in back taxes the European Union has ordered Apple to pay it — 'but it is trying to address big historic infrastructural deficits.' Tangled up with the housing issue is immigration, a fairly recent challenge to a country long defined by emigration. Recent arrivals include more than 100,000 Ukrainians displaced by war and thousands of people fleeing poverty and conflict in the Middle East and Africa. This country of 5.4 million has struggled to house all the asylum-seekers, leading to tent camps and makeshift accommodation centers that have attracted tension and protests. A stabbing attack on children outside a Dublin school a year ago, in which an Algerian man has been charged, sparked the worst rioting Ireland had seen in decades. Unlike many European countries, Ireland does not have a significant far-right party, but far-right voices on social media seek to drum up hostility to migrants, and anti-immigrant independent candidates are hoping for election in several districts. The issue appears to be hitting support for Sinn Fein, as working-class supporters bristled at its pro-immigration policies. What’s the likely outcome? Opinion polls suggest voter support is split into five roughly even chunks — for Fine Gael, Fianna Fail, Sinn Fein, several smaller parties and an assortment of independents. Fine Gael has run a gaffe-prone campaign, Fianna Fail has remained steady in the polls and Sinn Fein says it has momentum but is unlikely to win power unless the other parties drop their opposition to working with it. Analysts say the most likely outcome is another Fine Gael-Fianna Fail coalition, possibly with a smaller party or a clutch of independents as kingmakers. 'It’s just a question of which minor group is going to be the group that supports the government this time,' said Eoin O’Malley, a political scientist at Dublin City University. 'Coalition-forming is about putting a hue on what is essentially the same middle-of-the-road government every time.' When will results be known? Polls opened at 7 a.m. Friday and close at 10 p.m., when an exit poll will give the first hints about the result. Counting ballots begins Saturday morning. Full results could take several days, and forming a government days or weeks after that. Prime Minister Harris, who cast his vote in Delgany, south of Dublin, said Irish voters and politicians have 'got a long few days ahead of us.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ireland-votes-as-incumbents-hope-to-cling-to-power/7881381.html	2024-11-29T06:59:45-08:00	
3 dead, 90,000 displaced as Malaysia prepares for worst floods in decade	KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA — Malaysia is preparing for its worst floods in a decade after heavier-than-expected monsoon rains caused severe flooding that killed three people and displaced more than 90,000. The National Disaster Command Center online portal said Friday that 94,778 people from more than 28,000 families across nine states were evacuated to 527 temporary shelters. The northeastern state of Kelantan, bordering Thailand, was the worst affected, with 63,761 people evacuated from their homes, followed by neighboring Terengganu with 22,511. Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said Friday that all Cabinet ministers were barred from going on vacation. He said they have been instructed to help in flood-prone areas. 'All ministers have been told to go to the ground. Yes, leave has been frozen for them,' Anwar was quoted as saying by national Bernama news agency. His deputy, Ahmad Zahid Hamidi, who heads the disaster response, said Thursday that floods this year were expected to be worse than 2014, when more than 250,000 people were displaced and 21 killed. He was cited by local media as saying that the weather forecast indicated heavy rainfall next month would likely affect more states. Zahid was quoted by the New Straits Times newspaper as saying that government agencies were prepared to tackle the disaster. Nearly 83,000 personnel and thousands of rescue boats, four-wheel vehicles and life jackets as well as 31 helicopters are ready, he said. The government has also identified 8,481 temporary evacuation centers nationwide that can accommodate over two million people, he said. 'Given the severity of the situation, all parties have been mobilized to ensure the safety and welfare of flood victims,' he was quoted as saying by the national Bernama news agency. Floods are common in parts of Malaysia during the annual monsoon season, which starts in November and could last until March. The Meteorological Department has said the country can expect between five and seven episodes of heavy rainfall during that period.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dead-90-000-displaced-as-malaysia-prepares-for-worst-floods-in-decade/7881358.html	2024-11-29T06:45:30-08:00	
Family returns to Lebanon to find a crater where their 50-year-old home once stood	BAALBEK, Lebanon — In eastern Lebanon's city of Baalbek, the Jawhari family gathered around a gaping crater where their home once stood, tears streaming as they tried to make sense of the destruction. 'It is heart-breaking. A heartache that there is no way we will ever recover from,' said Lina Jawhari, her voice breaking as she hugged relatives who came to support the family. 'Our world turned upside down in a second.' The home, which was a gathering place for generations, was reduced to rubble by an Israeli airstrike on November 1, leaving behind shattered memories and twisted fragments of a once-vibrant life. The family, like thousands of Lebanese, were returning to check on their properties after the U.S.-mediated cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah went into effect early Wednesday. Intense Israeli airstrikes over the past two months leveled entire neighborhoods in eastern and southern Lebanon, as well as the southern suburbs of Beirut, which are predominantly Shiite areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a strong base of support. Nearly 1.2 million people have been displaced. The airstrikes have left a massive trail of destruction across the country. A photo of the Jawhari family's home — taken on a phone by Louay Mustafa, Lina’s nephew — is a visual reminder of what had been. As the family sifted through the rubble, each fragment recovered called them to gather around it. A worn letter sparked a collective cheer, while a photo of their late father triggered sobs. Reda Jawhari had built the house for his family and was a craftsman who left behind a legacy of metalwork. The sisters cried and hoped to find a piece of the mosque-church structure built by their father. Minutes later, they lifted a mangled piece of metal from the debris. They clung to it, determined to preserve a piece of his legacy. 'Different generations were raised with love ... Our life was music, dance, dabke [traditional dance]. This is what the house is made up of. And suddenly, they destroyed our world. Our world turned upside down in a second. It is inconceivable. It is inconceivable,' Lina said. Despite their determination, the pain of losing their home and the memories tied to it remains raw. Rouba Jawhari, one of four sisters, had one regret. 'We are sad that we did not take my mom and dad’s photos with us. If only we took the photos,' she said, clutching an ID card and a bag of photos and letters recovered from the rubble. 'It didn’t cross our mind. We thought it’s two weeks and we will be back.' The airstrike that obliterated the Jawhari home came without warning, striking at 1:30 p.m. on what was otherwise an ordinary Friday. Their neighbor, Ali Wehbe, also lost his home. He had stepped out for food a few minutes before the missile hit and rushed back to find his brother searching for him under the rubble. 'Every brick holds a memory,' he said, gesturing to what remained of his library. 'Under every book you would find a story.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/family-returns-to-lebanon-to-find-a-crater-where-their-50-year-old-home-once-stood-/7881347.html	2024-11-29T06:44:05-08:00	
Iran to enrich uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges, UN says	Iran will begin enriching uranium with thousands of advanced centrifuges at its two main nuclear facilities at Fordo and Natanz, the United Nations' nuclear watchdog said Friday, further raising tensions over Tehran's program as it enriches at near weapons-grade levels. The notice from the International Atomic Energy Agency mentioned Iran enriching uranium with new centrifuges to only 5% purity, far lower than the 60% it currently does — likely signaling that it still wants to negotiate with the West and the incoming administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. However, it remains unclear how Trump will approach Iran once he enters office, particularly as Iran continues to threaten to attack Israel amid Israel’s war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip and just after a ceasefire started with Hezbollah in Lebanon. Iran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment over the IAEA's report. Tehran had threatened to rapidly advance its program after the Board of Governors at the IAEA condemned Iran at a meeting in November for failing to cooperate fully with the agency. In a statement, the IAEA outlined the plans Iran informed it of, which include feeding uranium into multiple cascades of its advanced IR-2M, IR-4 and IR-6 centrifuges. Cascades are a group of centrifuges that spin uranium gas together to more quickly enrich the uranium. Each of these advanced classes of centrifuges enrich uranium faster than Iran’s baseline IR-1 centrifuges, which have been the workhorse of the country’s atomic program. The IAEA did not elaborate on how many machines would be in each cascade, but Iran has put around 160 centrifuges into a single cascade in the past. It's unclear if Iran has begun feeding the uranium yet into the centrifuges. Tehran so far has been vague about its plans. But starting the enrichment at 5% gives Tehran leverage at negotiations with the West and another way to dial up the pressure if they don't like what they hear. Weapons-grade levels of enrichment are around 90%. Since the collapse of Iran’s 2015 nuclear deal with world powers following the United States’ unilateral withdrawal from the accord in 2018, it has pursued nuclear enrichment just below weapons-grade levels. U.S. intelligence agencies and others assess that Iran has yet to begin a weapons program. Iran, as a signatory to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has pledged to allow the IAEA to visit its atomic sites to ensure its program is peaceful. Tehran also had agreed to additional oversight from the IAEA as part of the 2015 nuclear deal, which saw sanctions lifted in exchange for drastically limiting its program. However, for years Iran has curtailed inspectors’ access to sites while also not fully answering questions about other sites where nuclear material has been found in the past after the deal's collapse. Iranian officials, including Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, had signaled in recent months a willingness to negotiate with the West. But Iran also has launched two large-scale missile attacks on Israel amid the war. Kazem Gharibabadi, an Iranian diplomat, said in a post on a social media platform that he met with EU diplomat Enrique Mora and criticized Europe as being 'self-centered' while having 'irresponsible behavior.' 'With regard to the nuclear issue of Iran, Europe has failed to be a serious player due to lack of self-confidence and responsibility,' Gharibabadi wrote. For his part, Mora described having a 'frank discussion' with Gharibabadi and another Iranian diplomat. Those talks included 'Iran’s military support to Russia that has to stop, the nuclear issue that needs a diplomatic solution, regional tensions (important to avoid further escalation from all sides) and human rights,' he wrote on X.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-to-enrich-uranium-with-thousands-of-advanced-centrifuges-un-says/7881339.html	2024-11-29T06:37:15-08:00	
Russian defense minister visits North Korea for talks with military and political leaders	SEOUL, South Korea — Russian Defense Minister Andrei Belousov arrived in North Korea on Friday for talks with North Korean military and political leaders as the countries deepen their cooperation over Russia’s war in Ukraine. In announcing the visit, Russia’s Defense Ministry didn’t say whom Belousov would meet or the purpose of the talks. North Korean state media didn’t immediately confirm the visit. Belousov, a former economist, replaced Sergei Shoigu as defense minister in May after Russian President Vladimir Putin started a fifth term in power. Photos released by the Defense Ministry showed Belousov walking alongside North Korean Defense Minister No Kwang Chol on a red carpet at Pyongyang airport. North Korean military officials were seen clapping under a banner that read, 'Complete support and solidarity with the fighting Russian army and people.' Belousov noted after his arrival that military cooperation between the countries is expanding. He applauded a strategic partnership agreement signed by Putin and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un following their June meeting in Pyongyang, which he said is aimed at reducing tensions by maintaining a 'balance of power' in the region and lowering the risk of war, including with nuclear weapons. The June meeting demonstrated the 'highest level of mutual trust' between the leaders, Belousov said, and 'also the mutual desire of our countries to further expand mutually beneficial cooperation in a complex international environment.' North Korean Defense Minister No also praised the expanding cooperation between the countries’ militaries and reiterated North Korea’s support for Russia’s war in Ukraine, describing it as a 'just struggle to protect the country’s sovereign rights and security interests.' The visit comes days after South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol met with a Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov in the South Korean capital, Seoul, and called for the two countries to formulate countermeasures in response to North Korea’s dispatch of thousands of troops to Russia to help its fight against Ukraine. Kim in recent months has prioritized relations with Russia as he tries to break out of isolation and strengthen his international footing, embracing the idea of a 'new Cold War.' The United States and its allies have said North Korea has sent more than 10,000 soldiers to Russia in recent weeks and that some of those troops were engaging in combat. North Korea has also been accused of supplying artillery systems, missiles and other military equipment to Russia that may help Putin further extend an almost three-year war. There are also concerns in Seoul that North Korea, in exchange for its troops and arms supplies, could receive Russian technology transfers that could improve its nuclear weapons and missile programs. 'The Russian defense minister doesn’t visit North Korea just to celebrate bilateral ties,' said Leif-Eric Easley, a professor at Ewha University in Seoul. 'This visit indicates Putin and Kim’s military cooperation in violation of international law is about to increase further.' Yoon’s national security adviser, Shin Wonsik, said in a TV interview last week that Seoul believes that Russia has provided air defense missile systems to North Korea in exchange for sending its troops. Shin said Russia also appears to have given economic assistance to North Korea and various military technologies, including those needed for the North’s efforts to build a reliable space-based surveillance system, which Kim has stressed is crucial for enhancing the threat of nuclear-capable missiles targeting South Korea. Shin didn’t say whether Russia has already transferred sensitive nuclear weapons and ballistic missile technologies to North Korea. Yoon’s office hasn’t said whether the two governments discussed the possibility of South Korea supplying weapons to Ukraine in his talks with Umerov. Since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, South Korea has joined U.S.-led sanctions against Moscow and provided humanitarian and financial support to Kyiv. But it has avoided directly supplying arms, citing a longstanding policy of not giving lethal weapons to countries actively engaged in conflicts. Yoon has said his government will take phased countermeasures, linking the level of its response to the degree of Russian-North Korean cooperation. It wasn’t immediately clear whether Belousov will meet with Kim, the North Korean leader. Last year, Kim hosted a Russian delegation led by then-Defense Minister Shoigu and gave him a personal tour of a North Korean arms exhibition, in what outside critics likened to a sales pitch. That event came weeks before Kim traveled to Russia for talks with Putin which sped up military cooperation between the countries. During another meeting in Pyongyang in June this year, Kim and Putin signed a pact stipulating mutual military assistance if either country is attacked, in what was considered the two countries’ biggest defense deal since the end of the Cold War. The Russian report about Belousov’s visit came as South Korea scrambled fighter jets to repel six Russian and five Chinese warplanes that temporarily entered the country’s air defense identification zone around its eastern and southern seas, according to the South’s Joint Chiefs of Staff. It said the Russian and Chinese planes did not breach South Korea’s territorial airspace. South Korea’s Defense Ministry said it held telephone calls with Chinese and Russian defense attaches based in Seoul to protest the flights and urge the countries to prevent recurrences.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-defense-minister-visits-north-korea-for-talks-with-military-and-political-leaders-/7881323.html	2024-11-29T06:28:17-08:00	
Some Zimbabwean farmers turn to maggots to survive drought and thrive	NYANGAMBE, ZIMBABWE — At first, the suggestion to try farming maggots spooked Mari Choumumba and other farmers in Nyangambe, a region in southeastern Zimbabwe where drought wiped out the staple crop of corn. After multiple cholera outbreaks in the southern African nation resulting from extreme weather and poor sanitation, flies were largely seen as something to exterminate, not breed. 'We were alarmed,' Choumumba said, recalling a community meeting where experts from the government and the United States Agency for International Development, or USAID, broached the idea. People had flocked to the gathering in hope of news about food aid. But many stepped back when told it was about training on farming maggots for animal feed and garden manure. 'People were like, ‘What? These are flies. Flies bring cholera,’' Choumumba said. A year later, the 54-year-old walks with a smile to a smelly cement pit covered by wire mesh where she feeds rotting waste to maggots — her new meal ticket. After harvesting the insects about once a month, Choumumba turns them into protein-rich feed for her free-range chickens that she eats and sells. Up to 80% of chicken production costs were gobbled up by feed for rural farmers before they took up maggot farming. Many couldn’t afford the $35 charged by stores for a 50-kilogram (110-pound) bag of poultry feed, said Francis Makura, a specialist with a USAID program aimed at broadening revenue streams for farmers affected by climate change. But maggot farming reduces production costs by about 40%, he said. Black soldier fly The maggots are offspring of the black soldier fly, which originates in tropical South America. Unlike the house fly, it is not known to spread disease. Their life cycle lasts just weeks, and they lay between 500 and 900 eggs. The larvae devour decaying organic items — from rotting fruit and vegetables to kitchen scraps and animal manure — and turn them into a rich protein source for livestock. 'It is even better than the crude protein we get from soya,' said Robert Musundire, a professor specializing in agricultural science and entomology at Chinhoyi University of Technology in Zimbabwe, which breeds the insects and helps farmers with breeding skills. Donors and governments have pushed for more black soldier fly maggot farming in Africa because of its low labor and production costs and huge benefits to agriculture, the continent’s mainstay that is under pressure from climate change and Russia’s war in Ukraine. In Uganda, the maggots helped plug a fertilizer crisis caused by the war in Ukraine. In Nigeria and Kenya, they are becoming a commercial success. In Zimbabwe The Zimbabwean government and partners piloted it among farmers struggling with securing soya meal for their animals. A World Bank-led project later used it as a recovery effort for communities affected by a devastating 2019 cyclone. Now it is becoming a lifesaver for some communities in the country of 15 million people where repeated droughts make it difficult to grow corn. It's not clear how many people across the country are involved in maggot-farming projects. At first, 'a mere 5%' of farmers that Musundire, the professor, approached agreed to venture into maggot farming. Now that’s up to 'about 50%,' he said, after people understood the protein benefits and the lack of disease transmission. The 'yuck factor' was an issue. But necessity triumphed, he said. With the drought decimating crops and big livestock such as cattle — a traditional symbol of wealth and status and a source of labor — small livestock such as chickens are helping communities recover more quickly. 'They can fairly raise a decent livelihood out of the resources they have within a short period of time,' Musundire said. Reduces waste, too It also helps the environment. Zimbabwe produces about 1.6 million tons of waste annually, 90% of which can be recycled or composted, according to the country’s Environmental Management Agency. Experts say feeding it to maggots can help reduce greenhouse emissions in a country where garbage collection is erratic. At a plot near the university, Musundire and his students run a maggot breeding center in the city of 100,000 people. The project collects over 35 metric tons a month in food waste from the university’s canteens as well as vegetable markets, supermarkets, abattoirs, food processing companies and beer brewers. 'Food waste is living, it respires and it contributes to the generation of greenhouse gases,' Musundire said. According to the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization, food loss — which occurs in the stages before reaching the consumer — and food waste after sale account for 8% to 10% of greenhouse gas emissions globally, or about five times that of the aviation sector. The university project converts about 20 to 30 metric tons of the waste into livestock protein or garden manure in about two weeks. Choumambo said people often sneer as she goes around her own community collecting banana peels and other waste that people toss out at the market and bus station. 'I tell them we have good use for it, it is food for our maggots,' she said. She still has to contend with 'ignorant' people who accuse maggot farmers of 'breeding cholera.' But she cares little about that as her farm begins to thrive. ‘Sweet smell of food’ From bare survival, it is becoming a profitable venture. She can harvest up to 15 kilograms (about 33 pounds) of maggots in 21 days, turning out 375 kilograms (826.7 pounds) of chicken feed after mixing it with drought-tolerant crops such as millets, cowpeas and sunflower and a bit of salt. Choumambo sells some of the feed to fellow villagers at a fraction of the cost charged by stores for traditional animal feed. She also sells eggs and free-range chickens, a delicacy in Zimbabwe, to restaurants. She's one of 14 women in her village taking up the project. 'I never imagined keeping and surviving on maggots,' she said, taking turns with a neighbor to mix rotting vegetables, corn meal and other waste in a tank using a shovel. 'Many people would puke at the sight and the stench. But this is the sweet smell of food for the maggots, and for us, the farmers.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/some-zimbabwean-farmers-turn-to-maggots-to-survive-drought-and-thrive/7881318.html	2024-11-29T06:23:30-08:00	
Ukrainian energy workers carry out repairs despite Russia's pounding of country's power grid	On a bright winter day, workers at a Ukrainian thermal power plant repair its heavily damaged equipment as drops of water from melted snow leak through gaping holes in its battered roof. Several weeks earlier, the facility was targeted by a Russian air attack that left scorch marks, shrapnel scars on the walls, and missile fragments scattered across the production floor. 'This is our life now. Workers at a thermal power plant that’s supposed to produce electricity are walking on frozen floors and using firewood to keep warm,' Oleksandr, 52, head of the Production Management Department, told The Associated Press. He spoke on condition that only his first name be used, citing security concerns. Repeated Russian strikes on infrastructure have seriously impacted Ukraine's energy sector often resulting in rolling blackouts across the country. On Thursday, Moscow launched another large-scale air attack. Ukrainian authorities said nearly 200 drones and missiles targeted infrastructure, disrupting power supply to more than a million people. The scale of the ongoing work to fix the sector is huge. Since the start of Russia’s full-scale invasion in 2022, the G7 and other allied countries have allocated more than $4 billion in energy assistance to Ukraine, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said in September. Oleksandr, who works at the power plant operated by Ukraine’s largest private energy company, DTEK, says since the station was first attacked in November 2022, it has been unable to return to full capacity due to continuous strikes that have left critical equipment in ruins. The exact location of the plant visited by the AP, details on the damage and even workers’ last names cannot be disclosed for fear this information could help Russia coordinate future attacks. DTEK operated around 20% of Ukraine’s electricity production before the full-scale invasion, but this figure dropped to 12% since the war broke out. The company says its facilities have been attacked by Russia almost 200 times since 2022. They also say nearly 90% of the company’s infrastructure was destroyed or suffered damage and that was before Russia launched its large-scale attack on November 17. Oleksandr says he expects repairs at the station to continue through the winter into next year, and potentially far beyond. Repair efforts at the plant are further complicated by the fact that some critical equipment was manufactured in the Soviet Union and finding parts is now difficult. To mitigate this, some former Soviet countries who are now Ukraine’s allies have helped supply equipment. 'Potentially, Western countries could also help us with equipment, but their power grids have different characteristics,' Oleksandr said. Only half of DTEK’s generating capacities have been restored since the first attacks on its plants in November 2022 until the latest large-scale strike. Earlier this week, the European Commission and the U.S. government announced a donation of $112 million in equipment and construction materials to help DTEK prepare for the winter. With the war in its third year, staff at DTEK’s plant have adapted to the grim reality of their day-to-day existence. They know the protocols by heart. Not everyone can take shelter during an air alert. A minimal crew must remain in the control room to oversee operations, putting themselves at risk of a direct strike. 'You have to sit and wait while monitoring the trajectories of whatever was fired, but the power units keep working so we cannot just leave, we stay in the control room,' said Dmytro, 41, a power unit operator at the plant. Despite the challenges, Dmytro and his colleagues press on, driven by a mission to keep the lights on in their town and region over the winter months. 'Who’ll do it, if not us? I also have family waiting for me at home, but if we all leave and the equipment breaks down, the responsibility will be on our shoulders, the entire city will lose electricity and heating,' he said. 'Some are risking [their lives] at the frontline, while we here have our own energy front.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-energy-workers-carry-out-repairs-despite-russia-s-pounding-of-country-s-power-grid-/7881304.html	2024-11-29T06:13:46-08:00	
Landslide triggered by rain in Indonesia's Sumatra island kills 9 people in tourist bus	SIBOLANGIT, Indonesia — Rescuers recovered two more bodies from a tourist bus hit by a landslide triggered by torrential rains on Indonesia’s Sumatra island, bringing the death toll from the incident to nine, officials said. At least 20 people have died in other landslides and floods in the region this week. Rescuers recovered the bodies from the bus, which was covered by trees, mud and rocks from the landslide on the road from Medan city to Berastagi in North Sumatra province, officials said late Thursday. The road is the main route from the capital, Medan, to other districts in the region. The bus was among vehicles that had been cut off by previous landslides along the road since Wednesday morning. More than 10 people were also injured and were taken to a hospital in Medan city. Muji Ediyanto of the North Sumatra Regional Police said in a video message distributed by Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency on Thursday that some vehicles and their passengers remained trapped between landslides along the road. 'It will take at least two days to evacuate them from the landslides. Several vehicles are still trapped by debris from the landslides. There also are fallen trees at several points and the vehicles have not been able to get out of those locations,' Ediyanto said. Earlier this week, 20 people died from flash floods and landslides at four locations in the mountains of North Sumatra province, including in Karo regency, which is less than 20 kilometers (12 miles) from the most-recent landslides. Seasonal rains from around October through to March frequently cause flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/landslide-triggered-by-rain-in-indonesia-s-sumatra-island-kills-9-people-in-tourist-bus-/7881273.html	2024-11-29T05:47:08-08:00	
Over a year after Wagner Group leader’s death, Russian mercenaries aren’t going away	When Russian businessman Yevgeny Prigozhin was killed in an August 2023 plane crash, many analysts said his death could mark the end of the Wagner Group, the private military company he co-founded that provided thousands of Russian mercenaries for Moscow’s initiatives and other interests abroad. But more than a year later, the picture of Russian mercenary activities has only grown more complicated, researchers say. Before Prigozhin’s death, Wagner’s mercenaries had fought in conflicts around the world –– from Ukraine to the Middle East and Africa –– and helped Russia to spread its influence far beyond its borders. Along the way, Wagner faced allegations of murdering African civilians and committing war crimes. Then, in June 2023, Prigozhin launched an unexpected insurrection against Russian authorities over their handling of the war in Ukraine. His mercenaries captured the city of Rostov-on-Don and marched on toward Moscow. Prigozhin stood down only after the president of Belarus, Alexander Lukashenko, mediated a deal. After such brazen insubordination, many were unsurprised when Prigozhin died in a plane crash less than two months later. But predictions that the Wagner Group’s activities would die with him have proven to be untrue. Wagner Group fighters are still active in the Central African Republic and Mali. In other countries like Niger, it has been replaced by Africa Corps, a successor organization subordinate to Russia’s defense ministry. In other cases, different Russian militarized structures have picked up the Wagner name and symbols. What is clear to analysts is that Russian mercenaries are not going away. If anything, the future of Russian private military companies will be 'more sustainable and less spectacular' according to Jack Margolin, an independent researcher who recently published a book on the Wagner Group. Since Prigozhin’s death, Russia has 'really effectively created infrastructure and incentive structures in order to draw in former [Wagner] fighters and build this system of semi-formal forces,' he told VOA. Ties with the Russian state The Wagner Group’s activities around the world have always been intertwined with Russian foreign policy, but the exact nature of that connection is a subject of debate among experts. Margolin notes that Wagner co-founder Dmitry Utkin –– who also died in the August 2023 plane crash –– served in the special forces of Russia’s foreign intelligence agency, commonly called the GRU. Around 2014, he and Prigozhin founded the Wagner Group, which was initially small. That same year, Wagner took part in the illegal Russian annexation of Ukraine’s Crimean peninsula. Later, the mercenaries were dispatched to the pseudo-state Russia propped up in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk. During this period, there is ample evidence that Wagner actively cooperated with the Russian defense ministry –– in part because Ukraine intercepted Wagner conversations with Russian officers. But when Wagner operations moved beyond Ukraine, the picture grew more complicated. Experts differ on how to interpret it. Maria Kucherenko leads Russian studies at the Ukraine-based Come Back Alive Initiatives Center. She believes that Wagner was created by Russian military intelligence and remains under its control. For this reason, she views the post-Prigozhin changes in the mercenary corps as largely superficial. 'Only the surnames of the GRU generals in charge have changed,' she said. Other analysts paint a more complex picture of Wagner’s ties with the Russian state. Margolin sees a greater degree of freedom in Wagner’s past activities. 'They acted in the GRU’s interest. They coordinated with the GRU. All of Wagner's operations abroad were supported by logistics that were owned by the Ministry of Defense,' he said. 'But at the same time, they were still able to determine in this local context exactly what they wanted to do.' John Lechner, a researcher who will publish a book on Wagner in March, believes the mercenary corps’ relationship with the Russian state heavily depended on the country where it was operating. In Ukraine and Syria, where the mercenaries backed the government of Bashar al-Assad, Wagner actively collaborated with the Russia’s defense ministry. But in sub-Saharan Africa, where the Russian state had a very limited presence, Wagner was able to decide what Russia’s national interests were, Lecher said in an interview. Wagner wasn’t 'just a shadowy arm of the Kremlin pursuing the Kremlin’s interests; they were creating them,' he said. What next? Since Prighzoin’s death, Wagner has undergone significant changes –– although analysts disagree about how fundamental they are. Russian journalist Ilya Barabanov, who coauthored a Russian-language history of Wagner, believes that the old private military company essentially no longer exists. 'Over the last year and a half, we’ve seen Prigozhin’s empire being broken apart,' he told VOA. 'Some [parts] are going to the Ministry of Defense. Some are going to the Russian National Guard. Some are going to Chechnya’s Akhmat special forces.' The original Wagner, meanwhile, continues to operate only in the Central African Republic, Mali, and Belarus. Despite these changes, the dissolution of Wagner is going more slowly than expected because the Kremlin is too busy waging war in Ukraine, Barabanov added. Margolin emphasizes that Russia’s successor mercenary structures won’t function the same way Wagner did. The Wagner Group stood out for its risk appetite and relative independence from the Russian government. In the Central African Republic, it was Wagner that decided to transition from a strategy of defending the capital of Bangui and the country’s political elite to a more aggressive battle with insurgents, he notes. Wagner also decided with whom it would do business. In contrast, Africa Corps and other successor companies are much more risk-averse and more actively coordinate their activities with Russian military intelligence, Margolin said. Lechner notes that efforts to replace Wagner have been more successful in some places than others. Starting in 2019, Wagner mercenaries fought in Libya on the side of rebel general Khalifa Haftar. But in October 2020, he signed a ceasefire with the United Nations-backed Libyan government. Because active fighting had stopped, Russia had little trouble replacing Wagner there with Africa Corps, Lechner said. In Mali, Wagner mercenaries are engaged in pitched battles with Tuareg separatists and Islamist fighters in the country’s north. In late July, dozens of Russian fighters were killed in an ambush near the town of Tinzaouaten. Lechner suggests that in the future there will be multiple 'mini-Prigozhins' in charge of Russian military companies, but not one individual with 'all of the political clout and business interests that Prigozhin had come to represent.' Both Margolin and Lechner agree that, while Wagner is no longer officially fighting in Ukraine, its influence on that conflict has been significant. Journalists have often pointed out Wagner’s usage of so-called 'meat storms,' when the company was willing to sacrifice waves of men to wear down Ukrainian forces. The tactic was particularly noticeable during the 2022-23 battle for the Ukrainian city of Bakhmut, which Russia eventually razed and captured. But Wagner also gained military experience in the Middle East and Africa that the official Russian military is now applying in Ukraine: for example, devolving command authority to lower echelons and small unit tactics, Margolin said. 'Wagner has in many ways achieved the thing that Prigozhin said was necessary during the siege of Bakhmut, which was that the Russian armed forces needed to become more like Wagner to be more effective,' he told VOA. Lechner refers to it as the 'Wagnerization of the Russian military.' Resisting Russian mercenaries abroad Regardless of exactly what structures succeed Wagner, Russian mercenary activities will likely continue to worry Western governments. Experts say it will be difficult to push back against their influence abroad. Ukrainian researcher Kucherenko believes that the U.S., European countries, Ukraine, and other partners must join forces to counteract Russian mercenaries. But she suggests they must look higher in the command structure. 'We need to evaluate them as representatives of the GRU itself,' she said. She suggests directing particular attention to Yunus-bek Yevkurov, Russia’s deputy defense minister, and Major General Andrei Averyanov, the reported former commander of a secretive military intelligence unit that has conducted assassinations abroad. Both men now are reputed to play key roles in Africa Corps. Margolin suggests that, among other efforts, the U.S. should focus on export controls to limit the mercenaries’ access to military technologies, especially drone technologies, which played a key role in Wagner’s activities in Ukraine. He also suggests that Western governments should be cautious about propping up African regimes with poor human rights records and entrenched corruption, despite any fears that Russia will rush in if they do not. In fact, engaging with such governments feeds popular anger against the West, which in turn provides 'fertile ground for organizations like Wagner to take root,' Margolin said. Lechner notes that Wagner expanded its presence in Africa as Western powers exited the continent. For example, France withdrew its forces from the Central African Republic in 2016 amid a civil war in the country. Wagner stepped in to provide security for the country’s leadership. 'I don't think there is any interest for the United States to put troops on the ground in Africa to be perfectly honest,' Lechner said. Short of that, he said, 'I'm not exactly sure what [Western powers] can offer.' Russian mercenaries have few similar competitors in the region. Though China is active in Africa, its activities are mainly focused on large economic investments. Even Wagner’s business activities have mostly not placed it in conflict with China. Russian journalist Barabanov suggests there is one more factor that will play a key role in determining the future of Russian mercenaries: Russia’s war against Ukraine. If that conflict ends, then 'the Russian government will have a huge human resource of veterans who fought in this war,' he said, 'and they can probably be used in other, far-off conflicts.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-a-year-after-wagner-group-leader-s-death-russian-mercenaries-aren-t-going-away/7881045.html	2024-11-29T02:56:46-08:00	
Israeli tanks retreat from central Gaza camp; medics say 30 killed	CAIRO — Israeli military strikes killed at least 30 Palestinians overnight in the Gaza Strip, most of them in the Nuseirat camp at the center of the enclave, medics said on Friday after some tanks pulled back from an area they had raided. Medics said they had recovered 19 bodies of Palestinians killed in the northern areas of Nuseirat, one of the enclave's eight long-standing refugee camps. Some tanks remained active in the western area of the camp and the Palestinian Civil Emergency Service said teams were unable to respond to distress calls from residents trapped inside their houses. The rest were killed in the northern and southern areas of the Gaza Strip, medics added. There was no fresh statement by the Israeli military on Friday, but on Thursday it said its forces were continuing to 'strike terror targets as part of the operational activity in the Gaza Strip.' Meanwhile, the Israeli authorities released around 30 Palestinians whom it had detained during the ongoing offensive in Gaza in the past months. The released people arrived at a hospital in southern Gaza for medical checkups, medics said. Freed Palestinians, detained during the war, have complained of ill treatment and torture in Israeli detention after they were released. Israel denies torture. Months of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire in Gaza have yielded scant progress, and negotiations are now on hold. A ceasefire in the parallel conflict between Israel and Lebanon's Hezbollah, an ally of Hamas, took effect before dawn on Wednesday, bringing a halt to hostilities that had escalated sharply in recent months and had overshadowed the Gaza conflict. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed nearly 44,200 people and displaced nearly all the enclave's population at least once, Gaza officials say. Vast swathes of the territory are in ruins. The Hamas-led militants who attacked southern Israeli communities 13 months ago, triggering the war, killed some 1,200 people and captured more than 250 hostages, Israel has said. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-tanks-retreat-from-central-gaza-camp-medics-say-30-killed/7881136.html	2024-11-29T02:55:57-08:00	
China court jails journalist for 7 years on spy charges, family says	BEIJING/HONG KONG — A Beijing court sentenced veteran Chinese state media journalist Dong Yuyu on Friday to seven years in prison for espionage, his family said in a statement, calling the verdict a grave injustice. Police in the Chinese capital detained the 62-year-old former Guangming Daily editor and journalist in February 2022 while he was lunching with a Japanese diplomat, the U.S. National Press Club said in a statement. He was later charged with espionage. 'Sentencing Yuyu to seven years in prison on no evidence declares to the world the bankruptcy of the justice system in China,' Dong's family said in a statement provided to Reuters. 'Today's verdict is a grave injustice not only to Yuyu and his family but also to every freethinking Chinese journalist and every ordinary Chinese committed to friendly engagement with the world.' The family added that in the court judgment, Japanese diplomats whom Dong met were 'specifically named as agents of an 'espionage organization,' which is the Japanese embassy in Beijing.' Dong's conviction implied every Chinese citizen would be 'expected to know that the Chinese government may consider those embassies to be 'espionage organizations',' it said, causing a chilling effect. Police guarded the court on Friday, with seven police cars parked nearby, and journalists were asked to leave the area. A U.S. diplomat said they had been barred from attending the hearing. Dong has been detained in a Beijing prison since a closed-court hearing in July 2023, the press club said in September. 'Chinese authorities must reverse this unjust verdict, and protect the right of journalists to work freely and safely in China,' said Beh Lih Yi, Asia program manager at the Committee to Protect Journalists. 'Dong Yuyu should be reunited with his family immediately.' Dong regularly had in-person exchanges with diplomats from various embassies and journalists. The Japanese diplomat he met, one of two he had regularly met in the past, was also detained for several hours, spurring a complaint from Japan's foreign ministry. At the time, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said the diplomat was engaged in activities 'inconsistent with their capacity' in China. The diplomat was later released. A Nieman Fellow at Harvard University in 2007, Dong was a visiting scholar and visiting professor at Keio University and Hokkaido University in Japan, his family said in a statement in April 2023. He joined the Guangming Daily, affiliated to the ruling Communist Party, in 1987, after graduating from Peking University law school, and was the deputy editor of its commentary section. He wrote opinion articles in Chinese media and liberal academic journals on topics from legal reforms to social issues and co-edited a book promoting the rule of law in China. His articles advocated moderate reforms while avoiding direct criticism of President Xi Jinping. His family had initially kept news of his detention private in the hope that charges could be reduced or dropped, but were told in March 2023 that he would stand trial, they said in their statement. Non-government bodies (NGOs) advocating press freedom have called for his release, with more than 700 journalists, academics and NGO workers signing an online petition for him to be freed. 'Dong Yuyu is a talented reporter and author whose work has long been respected by colleagues,' said Ann Marie Lipinski, curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard. 'We stand with many in hoping for his release and return to his family.' In February, a Beijing court handed a suspended death sentence to Australian writer and pro-democracy blogger, Yang Hengjun, on espionage charges.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-court-jails-journalist-for-7-years-on-spy-charges-family-says/7881082.html	2024-11-28T23:03:30-08:00	
Putin threatens Kyiv with new hypersonic cruise missile	Russian President Vladimir Putin Thursday threatened to strike 'decision-making centers in the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv, with Russia’s new Oreshnik hypersonic cruise missiles, after pounding Ukrainian energy infrastructure and cutting off power to more than one million people across the country. 'We do not rule out the use of Oreshnik against the military, military-industrial or decision-making centers, including in Kyiv,' Putin told a news conference in the Kasakh capital, Astana. He said he launched Thursday’s drone and missile attack against Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in response to Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with U.S. medium-range ATACMS missiles. The attack marked Russia’s second big attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this month. Officials said it was the 11th major strike on Ukraine’s energy system since March. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Moscow of a 'despicable escalation,' saying it had used cruise missiles with cluster munitions. The attack marks Russia’s second big attack on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure this month. Officials said it was the 11th major strike on Ukraine’s energy system since March. Russian President Vladimir Putin said Moscow launched the attack in response to Ukrainian strikes on Russian territory with U.S. medium-range ATACMS missiles. Putin also said Russia’s future targets could include 'decision-making centers' in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. Ukraine called on the international community to respond to Putin’s threats to target government centers in Kyiv. 'We expect those countries that have urged everyone to avert the expansion of the war to react to the statements voiced by Putin today,' Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said. In addition to the more than 1 million people who lost power in the aftermath of the strikes, millions more had their existing schedule of rolling power cuts escalated. The Ukrainian air force said Russia used 91 missiles and 97 drones in the assault. The air force said 12 of those hit their targets, the majority of which were energy and fuel facilities. All missiles or drones aimed at Kyiv were brought down, officials said. 'The enemy is using a large number of missiles and drones. Their massive use in certain areas often exceeds the number of means of [air defense] cover,' the air force said in a statement. In the Lviv region, 523,000 subscribers lost electricity, regional head Maksym Kozytsky said on social media. The region, in the western part of the country, borders Poland. Directly north of the Lviv region, 215,000 customers lost power in the region of Volyn, and 280,000 lost power in the neighboring Rivne region, their governors said. 'Energy infrastructure is once again targeted by the enemy’s massive strike,' Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote on Facebook. Ukrenergo, the national electrical grid operator, introduced emergency power cuts amid the attack, Galushchenko said. Officials told Reuters that several nuclear power units were disconnected from the network during the attacks. Private power company DTEK said the power cuts impacted Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions. Some regional officials said water service was also affected by the airstrikes. The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andrii Yermak, said in a Telegram post that Russia had stockpiled missiles to strike Ukrainian infrastructure and wage war against civilians during the cold season, The Associated Press reported. The three-year anniversary of Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine is looming, and Russian ground forces are advancing at their fastest pace in two years. On Thursday, Ukraine’s Foreign Ministry urged its partners to accelerate the delivery of military aid, saying that was more important than drafting more men. 'We are now in the situation when we need more equipment to arm all the people that have already been mobilized, and we think the first priority is to send quicker, faster military aid,' Tykhyi, the spokesperson for Ukraine’s foreign ministry, told reporters in Kyiv. The statement comes one day after a senior U.S. official said Wednesday that Ukraine should consider lowering the age of military service for its soldiers from 25 years old to 18 in order to replace those lost on the battlefield. On Thursday, the Ukrainian president’s chief of staff Andriy Yermak said Ukraine is ready to host a second global summit aimed at ending Russia’s invasion in the 'nearest future,' according to local media. Kyiv hosted its first 'peace summit' in June in Switzerland. Russia was not invited. Speaking in Kazakhstan on Thursday, Putin said there were no preconditions to start talks with Ukraine on a possible peace deal, but that terms he set out in June for the deal remained the same. In June, Putin said Russia would end the war only if Kyiv agreed to drop its NATO ambitions and hand over four entire Ukrainian provinces claimed by Moscow. Kyiv rejected those demands as amounting to surrender. Some information in this report came from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/putin-threatens-kyiv-with-new-hypersonic-cruise-missile-/7881061.html	2024-11-28T21:33:27-08:00	
What Black Friday's history tells us about holiday shopping in 2024	NEW YORK — The holiday shopping season is about to reach full speed with Black Friday, which kicks off the post-Thanksgiving retail rush this week. The annual sales event no longer creates the midnight mall crowds or doorbuster mayhem of recent decades, in large part due to the ease of online shopping and habits forged during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hoping to entice equivocating consumers, retailers already have spent weeks bombarding customers with ads and early offers. Still, whether visiting stores or clicking on countless emails promising huge savings, tens of millions of U.S. shoppers are expected to spend money on Black Friday itself this year. Industry forecasts estimate that 183.4 million people will shop in U.S. stores and online between Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday, according to the National Retail Federation and consumer research firm Prosper Insights & Analytics. Of that number, 131.7 million are expected to shop on Black Friday. At the same time, earlier and earlier Black Friday-like promotions, as well as the growing strength of other shopping events (hello, Cyber Monday), continue to change the holiday spending landscape. Here's what you need to know about Black Friday's history and where things stand in 2024. When is Black Friday in 2024? Black Friday falls on the Friday after Thanksgiving each year, which is November 29 this year. How old is Black Friday? Where does its name come from? The term 'Black Friday' is several generations old, but it wasn't always associated with the holiday retail frenzy that we know today. The gold market crash of September 1869, for example, was notably dubbed Black Friday. The phrase's use in relation to shopping the day after Thanksgiving, however, is most often traced to Philadelphia in the mid-20th century — when police and other city workers had to deal with large crowds that congregated before the annual Army-Navy football game and to take advantage of seasonal sales. 'That’s why the bus drivers and cab drivers call today 'Black Friday.' They think in terms of headaches it gives them,' a Gimbels department store sales manager told The Associated Press in 1975 while watching a police officer try to control jaywalkers the day after Thanksgiving. Earlier references date back to the 1950s and 1960s. Jie Zhang, a professor of marketing at the University of Maryland’s Robert H. Smith School of Business, points to a 1951 mention of 'Black Friday' in a New York-based trade publication — which noted that many workers simply called in sick the day after Thanksgiving in hopes of having a long holiday weekend. Starting in the 1980s, national retailers began claiming that Black Friday represented when they went from operating in the red to in the black thanks to holiday demand. But since many retail companies now operate in the black at various times of the year, this interpretation should be taken with a grain of salt, experts say. How has Black Friday evolved? In recent decades, Black Friday became infamous for floods of people in jam-packed stores. Endless lines of shoppers camped out at midnight in hopes of scoring deep discounts. But online shopping has made it possible to make most, if not all, holiday purchases without ever stepping foot inside a store. And while foot traffic at malls and other shopping areas has bounced back since the start of the pandemic, e-commerce isn't going away. November sales at brick-and-mortar stores peaked more than 20 years ago. In 2003, for example, e-commerce accounted for 1.7% of total retail sales in the fourth quarter, according to Commerce Department data. Unsurprisingly, online sales make up a much bigger slice of the pie today. For last year's holiday season, e-commerce accounted for about 17.1% of all nonadjusted retail sales in the fourth quarter, Commerce Department data show. That's up from 12.7% seen at the end of 2019. Beyond the rise of online shopping, some big-ticket items that used to get shoppers in the door on the Black Friday — like a new TV — are significantly cheaper than they were decades ago, notes Jay Zagorsky, a clinical associate professor at Boston University’s Questrom School of Business. 'There is less need to stand in line at midnight when the items typically associated with doorbuster sales are now much cheaper,' Zagorsky told The Associated Press via email. He pointed to Bureau of Labor Statistics data that show the average price for a TV has fallen 75% since 2014. While plenty of people will do most of their Black Friday shopping online, projections from the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights indicated that most Black Friday shoppers (65%) still planned to shop in stores this year. Black Friday ‘month’ and the rise of Cyber Monday It's no secret that Black Friday sales don't last just 24 hours anymore. Emails promising holiday deals now start arriving before Halloween. 'Black Friday is no longer the start of the holiday shopping season. It has become the crescendo of the holiday shopping season' during what now feels like 'Black Friday month,' Zhang said. Some retailers have updated their official marketing to refer to 'Black Friday week.' Retailers trying to get a head start on the competition and to manage shipping logistics helps explain the rush, Zhang said. Offering early holiday deals spreads out purchases, giving shippers more breathing room to complete orders. Zhang therefore doesn't expect the five fewer days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year to cause significant strain because retailers would have taken them into account. Linking pre-Thanksgiving sales with Black Friday is also a marketing technique since it's a name consumers recognize and associate with big, limited-time bargains, Zhang said. Multiple post-Thanksgiving sales events keep shoppers enticed after Black Friday, including Small Business Saturday and Cyber Monday, which the National Retail Federation's online arm designated in 2005. U.S. consumers spent a record $12.4 billion on Cyber Monday in 2023, and $15.7 million per minute during the day's peak sales hour, according to Adobe Analytics. On Black Friday, they spent $9.8 billion online, Adobe Analytics said. Enough people still enjoy shopping in person after Thanksgiving that the activity is unlikely to become extinct, Boston University's Zagorsky said. While Black Friday's significance 'is being slightly diminished' over time, the shopping event is still 'a way to connect with others,' he said. 'This social aspect is important and will not disappear, ensuring that Black Friday is still an important day for retailers.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/what-black-friday-s-history-tells-us-about-holiday-shopping-in-2024/7878886.html	2024-11-28T19:52:51-08:00	
Chad ends defense cooperation agreement with France	N'DJAMENA, chad — Chad's government said Thursday that it had ended its defense cooperation pact with France, a move that could see French troops leave the Central African country. In a statement, Chad's foreign ministry said the country, a key Western ally in the fight against Islamic militants in the region, wanted to fully assert its sovereignty after more than six decades of independence. It said the decision to end the defense cooperation agreement revised in 2019 would enable it to redefine its strategic partnerships. Chad has cooperated closely with Western nations' military forces in the past, but it has moved closer to Russia in recent years. The decision is another nail in the coffin of France's historic and colonial role in West and Central Africa after being forced to pull its troops out of Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso following military coups. The military juntas have since turned to Russia, which has mercenaries deployed across the Sahel region - a band of countries stretching from Africa's northwest to northeast coasts - and has been fostering closer ties with Chad's President Mahamat Deby. 'In accordance with the terms of the accord, Chad will respect the modalities of the termination, including the necessary deadlines, and will collaborate with French authorities to ensure a harmonious transition,' the statement said. The French foreign ministry was not immediately available for comment. France's foreign minister, Jean-Noel Barrot, on Thursday visited Chad's border with Sudan. There were no indications that Paris had been given advance notice of the decision, although a French envoy to President Emmanuel Macron this week handed in a report with proposals on how France could reduce its military presence in Chad, Gabon and Ivory Coast, where it has deployed thousands of troops for decades. France has around 1,000 troops as well as warplanes stationed in Chad. In a further blow to France, Senegal's President Bassirou Diomaye Faye said in an interview with French state TV on Thursday that it was inappropriate for French troops to maintain a presence in his country. He stopped short of saying if or when French troops would be asked to leave, but he said Paris would be the first to know. Around 350 French troops are based in Senegal. The statement by Chad's foreign ministry said the decision to end the nation's defense partnership with France should in no way undermine the friendly relations between the two countries. Earlier this year, Chad ordered a small contingent of U.S. special operations to leave the country. In September, the U.S. said it was in talks for them to return. The Pentagon did not respond to a request for comment on whether it has a presence in Chad.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chad-ends-defense-cooperation-agreement-with-france/7881027.html	2024-11-28T18:54:00-08:00	
Canada sues Google, alleges anticompetitive practices in online ads	toronto — Canada's antitrust watchdog said Thursday that it was suing Google over alleged anticompetitive conduct in the tech giant's online advertising business and that it wanted the company to sell off two of its ad tech services and pay a penalty. The Competition Bureau said such action was necessary because an investigation into Google found that the company unlawfully tied together its ad tech tools to maintain its dominant market position. The matter is now headed for the Competition Tribunal, a quasi-judicial body that hears cases brought forward by the competition commissioner about noncompliance with the Competition Act. The bureau is asking the tribunal to order Google to sell its publisher ad server, DoubleClick for Publishers, and its ad exchange, AdX. It estimates Google holds a market share of 90% in publisher ad servers, 70% in advertiser networks, 60% in demand-side platforms and 50% in ad exchanges. This dominance, the bureau said, has discouraged competition from rivals, inhibited innovation, inflated advertising costs and reduced publisher revenues. 'Google has abused its dominant position in online advertising in Canada by engaging in conduct that locks market participants into using its own ad tech tools, excluding competitors and distorting the competitive process,' Matthew Boswell, commissioner of competition, said in a statement. Google, however, maintains the online advertising market is a highly competitive sector. Dan Taylor, Google's vice president of global ads, said in a statement that the bureau's complaint 'ignores the intense competition where ad buyers and sellers have plenty of choice.' The statement added that Google intends to defend itself against the allegation. U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade. The proposed breakup, floated in a 23-page document filed this month by the U.S. Department of Justice, calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-sues-google-alleges-anticompetitive-practices-in-online-ads/7881017.html	2024-11-28T18:11:35-08:00

Liberia's warlord-turned-senator Prince Johnson dies at 72	MONROVIA, LIBERIA — Prince Johnson, the Liberian former warlord and senator whose brutal tactics shocked the world, has died at the age of 72, authorities said Thursday. Johnson, who infamously videotaped himself drinking Budweiser as his men cut off the ears of the nation's former president, remained active in politics after the civil war ended and was elected senator in 2006. He died on Thursday at a local hospital in Paynesville, a suburb of Monrovia, said Siafa Jallah, deputy director of press relations at the Liberian senate. Liberia's civil wars, marked by mass killings, torture and sexual violence, killed an estimated 250,000 people between 1989 and 2003. Johnson was named one of the 'most notorious perpetrators' by the country's post-war truth and reconciliation committee, and was accused of killing, extortion, massacre, torture and rape among other charges. Neither Johnson nor the other seven people that the committee listed as leaders of warring factions were ever tried in Liberia. But a handful were convicted overseas, including Charles Taylor, a former president, who is serving a 50-year-sentence in the United Kingdom. Mohammed Jabbateh, a rebel commander who witnesses said killed civilians and ordered his soldiers to rape young girls, was sentenced to 30 years in the U.S. Earlier this year, President Joseph Boakai signed an executive order to create a long-awaited war crimes court to deliver justice to the civil wars' victims, but the court hasn't begun operating. Adama Dempster, a Liberian human rights advocate, expressed regret that Johnson was unable to testify before the proposed tribunal before he died. 'It's sad and has a deep meaning for an accountability process,' he said. In 1990, the then-38-year-old Johnson led a rebel faction that invaded Monrovia, captured former President Samuel Doe and tortured him in front of a rolling camera. Johnson is seen kicking back in a chair, his feet up on a table and a bottle of beer in one hand. He taunts the former ruler as his men strip the president to his underwear then cut off his ears, as blood streams down his temple. The president later died, and according to one witness' testimony in front of the nation's truth and reconciliation commission, Johnson later showed off Doe's head on a platter. After the end of the war, Johnson became a born-again Christian and ordained preacher, before being elected senator representing Nimba County. The country banned the sale of Doe's notorious torture tape that had once been widely available at streetside stalls.	https://www.voanews.com/a/liberia-s-warlord-turned-senator-prince-johnson-dies-at-72/7881010.html	2024-11-28T17:42:49-08:00

Democratic lawmakers from Connecticut report Thanksgiving bomb threats	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — At least five Democratic members of Congress from Connecticut were targeted by bomb threats on their homes Thursday, the lawmakers or their offices said. Senator Chris Murphy and Representatives Jim Himes, Joe Courtney, John Larson and Jahana Hayes all reported being the subject of such threats. Police who responded said they found no evidence of explosives on the lawmakers' properties. There was no immediate word whether Representative Rosa DeLauro, the fifth Democratic House member from the state, and Connecticut's other Democratic senator received threats. The bomb threats against Democrats came a day after a number of President-elect Donald Trump's Cabinet picks and appointees reported that they had received such threats, as well as 'swatting attacks,' in which perpetrators initiate an emergency law enforcement response against a victim under false pretenses. Murphy's office said his Hartford home was the target of a bomb threat, 'which appears to be part of a coordinated effort involving multiple members of Congress and public figures.' Hartford Police and U.S. Capitol Police determined there was no threat. Hayes said the Wolcott Police Department informed her Thursday morning that it had received 'a threatening email stating a pipe bomb had been placed in the mailbox at my home.' State police, U.S. Capitol Police, and the House sergeant at arms were notified, Wolcott and state police responded, 'and no bomb or explosive materials were discovered.' Courtney's Vernon home received a bomb threat while his wife and children were there, his office said. Himes said he was told of the threat against his home during a Thanksgiving celebration with his family. The U.S. Capitol Police, and Greenwich and Stamford police departments responded. Hines extended his family's 'utmost gratitude to our local law enforcement officers for their immediate action to ensure our safety.' Echoing other lawmakers who were threatened, he added: 'There is no place for political violence in this country, and I hope that we may all continue through the holiday season with peace and civility.' Larson said Thursday that East Hartford Police responded to a bomb threat against his home. The threats follow an election season marked by violence. In July, a gunman opened fire at a Trump rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, grazing his ear and killing one of his supporters. The Secret Service later thwarted a subsequent assassination attempt at Trump's West Palm Beach, Florida, golf course when an agent spotted the barrel of a gun poking through a perimeter fence while Trump was golfing. Among those who received threats Wednesday were New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, Trump's pick to serve as the next ambassador to the United Nations; Matt Gaetz, Trump's initial pick to serve as attorney general; Oregon Rep. Lori Chavez-DeRemer, whom Trump chose to lead the Department of Labor, and former New York congressman Lee Zeldin, who has been tapped to lead the Environmental Protection Agency.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democratic-lawmakers-from-connecticut-report-thanksgiving-bomb-threats/7881000.html	2024-11-28T17:25:48-08:00

Venezuelan bill codifies economic sanctions as crimes against humanity	CARACAS, Venezuela — Venezuelan lawmakers on Thursday approved a bill that codifies economic sanctions, like those imposed by the United States, as crimes against humanity and allows the prosecution of anyone who expresses support for the measures. The bill, approved by the unicameral National Assembly, implicitly targets leading opposition leaders, many of whom have supported economic sanctions as a means to pressure the government into negotiations. The measure bans supporters of economic sanctions from running for office and allows authorities to prosecute them in absentia and seize their property. 'The unilateral coercive measures and other restrictive or punitive measures adopted against the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela constitute a crime against humanity, within the framework of a systematic and widespread attack against the civilian population,' the bill, as read during Thursday's session, states. A conviction under the bill would carry a sentence of at least 25 years in prison. The approval comes one day after the White House announced it had imposed sanctions on 21 individuals it accused of undermining Venezuela's July presidential election. It also followed the decision by the U.S. House of Representatives last week to pass a bill that would block the federal government from contracting with any company doing business with the government of President Nicolas Maduro. The measure is the latest effort by Venezuela's ruling party to silence dissent after the July election, which Maduro and former diplomat Edmundo Gonzalez both claim to have won. Vote counts not provided Venezuela's National Electoral Council, which is stacked with Maduro loyalists, declared Maduro the winner hours after polls closed on July 28. But unlike previous presidential elections, electoral authorities did not provide detailed vote counts. Meanwhile, the main opposition coalition collected tally sheets from 80% of the nation's electronic voting machines, posted them online and said the voting records showed Gonzalez won the election with twice as many votes as Maduro. Anti-government protests erupted nationwide the day after the election, drawing repression from state security forces, which arrested more than 2,200 people, including political leaders, lawyers, poll workers, election volunteers and protesters, both minors and adults. Gonzalez left Venezuela in September for exile in Spain after a warrant was issued for his arrest in connection with an investigation into the publishing of the vote tally sheets, while opposition leader Maria Corina Machado has been hiding for months at an undisclosed location. Machado last year won the presidential primary organized by the main opposition coalition. But Maduro's government kept her off the July 28 ballot via an administrative decision that concluded she could not run for office because she allegedly sought the broad economic sanctions the U.S. imposed last decade in an effort to topple Maduro. The sanctions crippled Venezuela's crucial oil sector. Machado's handpicked substitute was also barred from representing the Unitary Platform opposition coalition. That prompted the faction's leadership to choose Gonzalez as candidate. Last week, Venezuela's Attorney General's Office announced a new investigation against Machado. Her comments in favor of the U.S. House bill, according to a statement from the prosecutor's office, 'constitute the commission of crimes of treason against the country,' conspiracy with foreign countries and association. Machado rejected the accusations in a video she posted Thursday on social media. 'Let them accuse us of treason against the country the day we stand by with our arms crossed, when we believe that there is nothing more to fight for,' she said in a video showing images from this year's presidential campaign. 'In that moment, accuse us of betraying the country ... resigning ourselves would be a betrayal.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuelan-bill-codifies-economic-sanctions-as-crimes-against-humanity/7880978.html	2024-11-28T16:04:14-08:00	
Syria rebels, allies cut key highway as escalating fighting kills around 200	BEIRUT — Rebel fighters cut the Damascus to Aleppo highway on Thursday during an offensive that a monitor says killed around 200 people, including civilians hit by Russian air force strikes. A day earlier, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and allied factions launched a surprise attack on government-held areas of northern Aleppo province, triggering the fiercest fighting in years, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. HTS is listed as a terrorist organization by the U.S. and Turkey. The toll in ongoing battles 'has risen to 182, including 102 fighters from HTS,' 19 from allied factions 'and 61 regime forces and allied groups,' the Observatory said. 'Russian airstrikes on the Aleppo countryside killed 19 civilians on Thursday,' said Rami Abdel Rahman, who heads the Observatory, adding that another civilian had been killed in Syrian army shelling a day earlier. Russia is a close ally of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and first intervened in Syria's civil war in 2015, turning the momentum of the conflict in favor of the president, whose forces once controlled only a fifth of the country. HTS and its allied factions, including groups backed by Turkey, 'cut off the Damascus-Aleppo international M5 highway ... in addition to controlling the junction between the M4 and M5 highways,' the Britain-based monitor said. It has a network of sources inside Syria. The U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said 'more than 14,000 people – nearly half are children – have been displaced' by the violence. Syria has been gripped by civil war for more than a decade, although the intensity of the conflict had decreased in recent years. 'This operation aims to repel the sources of fire of the criminal enemy from the front lines,' Mohamed Bashir, who heads HTS's so-called salvation government, said during a press conference. Analyst Nick Heras of the New Lines Institute for Strategy and Policy said the rebels were 'trying to preempt the possibility of a Syrian military campaign in the region of Aleppo,' which Russian and Syrian government airstrikes against rebel areas have been preparing for. With some Turkey-backed factions joining the offensive, 'Ankara is sending a message to both Damascus and Moscow to back down from their military efforts in northwest Syria,' he said. In addition to Russia, Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has been backed in the civil war by Iran and allied militant groups, including Lebanon's powerful Hezbollah. During more than two months of war with Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israel intensified its strikes on Iran-backed groups in Syria, including Hezbollah. Rebel forces 'are in a better position to take and seize villages than Russian-backed Syrian government forces, while the Iranians are focused on Lebanon,' Heras said. The Syrian rebels and their allies launched their attack the day the Lebanon-Israel truce came into effect. HTS, led by al-Qaida's former Syria branch, controls swaths of the northwest Idlib area as well as small parts of neighboring Aleppo, Hama and Latakia provinces. An AFP correspondent reported heavy, uninterrupted clashes east of the city of Idlib since Wednesday morning, including airstrikes. A military statement carried by state news agency SANA said that 'armed terrorist organizations grouped under so-called 'Nusra terrorist front' present in Aleppo and Idlib provinces launched a large, broad-fronted attack' Wednesday morning. It said the attack with 'medium and heavy weapons targeted safe villages and towns and our military sites in those areas.' The army 'in cooperation with friendly forces' confronted the attack 'which is still continuing,' inflicting 'heavy losses' on the armed groups, the military statement said, without reporting army losses. Syria's conflict broke out after Assad crushed anti-government protests in 2011. It spiraled into a complex conflict that has drawn in foreign armies and rebels. It has killed more than 500,000 people, displaced millions and battered the country's infrastructure and industry. The Idlib region is subject to a ceasefire — repeatedly violated but which had largely been holding — brokered by Turkey and Russia after a Syrian government offensive in March 2020.	https://www.voanews.com/a/syria-rebels-allies-cut-key-highway-as-escalating-fighting-kills-around-200-/7880717.html	2024-11-28T15:02:57-08:00	
Botswana joins Belgium as center for diamond certification	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Botswana has been added as a second center, in addition to Belgium, to verify the origin of rough diamonds meant for export to the Group of Seven leading industrialized countries, the nation’s presidency announced Thursday. African producers had complained that making Belgium the sole verification center led to disruptions in the global diamond supply chain, as the G7 moved to stop the flow of gems mined in Russia. A statement by the office of the president said Botswana was granted permission to set up a verification center following 'intensive' discussions with the G7 Diamond Technical Team. The announcement comes as President Duma Boko and Minister of Minerals Bogolo Kenewendo returned Thursday from a diamond conference in Brussels. Kenewendo told state television it is logical to grant Botswana, the world’s second-largest producer of diamonds, the right to certify rough stones. She said that Botswana has a track record in verification and certification, together with other countries under the Kimberley Process. The Kimberley Process is a trade regime that certifies rough diamond exports entering the global market, but it has been criticized for failing to do enough to keep out diamonds from conflict zones. Diamond-producing countries such as Angola and Namibia should be recognized verifiers because they have prepared through the Kimberley Process, Kenewendo said. To sanction Russian diamonds, the G7, at the start of the year, proposed that all stones destined for export to their member countries be routed through Antwerp, Belgium, to verify their origin. African producers, led by Botswana, protested, saying the move caused disruptions to the global supply chain due to delays and added costs. Belgian-based diamond industry researcher Hans Merket said the addition of Botswana as a verification center will allow more flexibility. 'Botswana appears to be something of a test case with the G7 Diamond Technical Team already explicitly referencing Namibia and Angola as potential future certification nodes,' Merket said. 'By diversifying the certification points, this approach could establish a more balanced and inclusive framework for the G7 certification scheme aligning more closely with the global dynamics of the global supply chain,' he said. 'Moreover, it can also help pave the way for stricter controls and higher ethical standards in the diamond sector, particularly as the Kimberley Process certification scheme faces increasing criticism for its declining credibility and leniency,' Merket said. Jaff Bamenjo, coordinator of the Kimberley Process Civil Society Coalition, said more African diamond producers should be added as verification centers because the addition of only Botswana will not resolve supply chain disruptions. 'African diamond producing countries are suffering from a problem they did not create,' Bamenjo said. Botswana’s export certification center is expected to be operational early next year.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7880691.html	2024-11-28T14:30:53-08:00	
Namibia extends voting again in close elections	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — Namibia extended voting for a second time Thursday with the opposition crying foul after logistical failures prevented many people from casting their ballots in the closely fought election. With the ruling party facing its strongest challenge yet, opposition parties called for a halt to the vote counting and said they had lost confidence in the process. The polls are a key test for the liberation-era South West Africa People's Organization party that has governed the mineral-rich country since independence 34 years ago. But SWAPO is being challenged by a younger generation of voters frustrated by high unemployment and enduring inequalities. About 1.5 million people in the sparsely populated desert nation were registered to vote in Wednesday's presidential and legislative elections. Many were still in line when polls were scheduled to close at 9 p.m. Wednesday, some saying they were in line for 12 hours. The Electoral Commission of Namibia kept some polling stations open overnight into Thursday and allowed others to begin ballot counting. The disarray led to angry complaints from opposition parties, which suggested there may have been an attempt to limit voting amid a strong showing for the parties challenging SWAPO's grip on power. The Electoral Commission said it had decided to keep 36 polling stations open on Friday and Saturday in response to the criticism and to accommodate anyone who had not been able to cast their ballot. It acknowledged a range of problems that held up voting, including a shortage of ballot papers because of higher-than-expected turnout and the overheating of tablets used to verify voters. In some cases, mobile voting teams left areas with voters still in the queues, it said. The main opposition party, Independent Patriots for Change, led the calls for a halt in the process. 'We have a reason to believe that the [Electoral Commission] is deliberately suppressing voters and deliberately trying to frustrate voters from casting their vote,' said IPC official Christine Aochamus. The smaller Namibia Economic Freedom Fighters opposition party said it wanted the vote to annulled. 'This election process was not free,' said representative Saddam Amushelelo. 'We are not going to accept the election results.' The IPC's leader, former dentist and lawyer Panduleni Itula, is perhaps the strongest challenger to SWAPO's candidate, Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who could become the first woman to lead the country. Analysts have said Nandi-Ndaitwah, 72, would be forced into a second round if she does not win more than half of the votes. The long queues were 'a signal that people really want a change,' said Ndumba Kamwanyah, lecturer in the Department of Human Sciences at the University of Namibia. 'For me, it seems it's not good news for the incumbent party,' he told AFP. Some voters had given up after standing in line for hours in the sun and before voting was first extended on Wednesday night, said Maria Nambahu, who waited five hours to cast her ballot. 'It should have been better organized,' the 25-year-old said. 'That makes it unfair.' Edison Bernardo, a 25-year-old financial assistant, said there should be a rerun. 'People did not vote; many left the line,' he told AFP. 'If this is the actual election, there will definitely be riots.' Namibia is a major uranium and diamond exporter, but not many of its nearly 3 million people have benefited from that wealth in terms of improved infrastructure and job opportunities, analysts say. Around 42% of Namibia's registered voters are younger than 35, the election authority says.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-extends-voting-again-in-close-elections/7880677.html	2024-11-28T13:51:16-08:00	
One of two damaged Baltic Sea cables back online, operator says	stockholm — One of two Baltic subsea cables that were damaged earlier this month in a suspected sabotage is back online, a spokesman for operator company Arelion said. The cable connecting Sweden and Lithuania was repaired as of Thursday and traffic had resumed at full capacity, spokesman Martin Sjogren said. Two subsea cables, the other linking Finland and Germany, were damaged in less than 24 hours on November 17-18, prompting German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to say he assumed it was sabotage. Undersea cables transmit nearly all the world's internet data traffic and are considered critical infrastructure because they are the communication backbone between countries. Investigators have zeroed in on Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3, and Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said the country sent a formal request to China seeking cooperation to help clarify what happened when the undersea cables were damaged in the Baltic Sea. 'We are cooperating with Swedish police in their investigation of our damaged cable,' Sjogren said. 'It’s very difficult to secure the entire subsea infrastructure but the international cooperation between authorities, military and companies is working very well,' he said. Arelion, once part of telecom company Telia, owns 75,000 kilometers of fiber network. Finland's Cinia, which owns the other cable, has also started repair work and estimated completion by the end of this month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-of-two-damaged-baltic-sea-cables-back-online-operator-says-/7880673.html	2024-11-28T13:37:43-08:00

In wake of G20, Gulf states boost ties to Brazil, Latin America	Middle East analysts are welcoming a series of agreements concluded during the recent summit in Brazil of the 20 biggest economies, saying they open new avenues for Gulf Cooperation Council states to strengthen economic relations with emerging markets across Latin America. Among other developments, Crown Prince Khaled bin Mohamed bin Zayed of the United Arab Emirates signed a memorandum of agreement with Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. It is designed to establish a joint mechanism 'aimed at promoting UAE investments in strategic sectors in Brazil,' according to the Abu Dhabi news site Gulf News. A second memorandum of agreement between the foreign ministries of the two countries called for unspecified cooperation in Africa, Gulf News said. Saudi Arabia, for its part, concluded a memorandum of agreement establishing a Saudi-Brazilian Coordination Council that is intended to foster cooperation across sectors that include economic, diplomatic and strategic, according to the Saudi Press Agency. The agreements build on well-established ties between the Gulf Cooperation Council states and Brazil, a major agricultural exporter whose efforts to address global food insecurity align with the GCC’s need to secure vital agricultural imports, including meat, cereals and coffee. The Gulf countries, for their part, are well positioned to provide Brazil with phosphate, aluminum and oil. Brazil is already the GCC’s largest trading partner in Latin America, followed by Mexico and Argentina. In 2022, more than 70% of Brazil’s exports to Arab countries consisted of agricultural products such as meat and grains. Zubair Iqbal, a nonresident scholar at the Middle East Institute and former International Monetary Fund official, told VOA that Brazil offers the GCC states promising opportunities for trade and investment. But he noted that tangible progress toward enhanced GCC-Latin American cooperation remains largely reliant on bilateral agreements rather than multination initiatives, limiting their impact. 'While there have been general exhortations for furthering trade relations, specific responses will be a function of bilateral agreements,' he said. 'Prospects for more trade and increased investment remain strong, especially with Brazil. However, it will depend upon national interests and alternative options.' According to the latest available data for 2022, GCC countries, particularly the UAE and Saudi Arabia, have increasingly expanded their investment footprint in Latin America, totaling $4 billion between 2016 and 2021. The UAE’s sovereign wealth fund, Mubadala, has been a key player, with investments exceeding $5 billion in Brazil since the early 2010s. Notable projects include an oil refinery, a toll road and collaborations with Brazil’s largest biofuel producer. Mubadala has plans to invest an additional $1 billion annually in Brazil. UAE-based JFR Investments, owned by an Angolan businessman, has meanwhile signed significant mining agreements since 2022 with companies in Brazil and Peru. And Dubai-based DP World manages port infrastructure across Latin America. Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund is also deepening its ties in Latin America. In June 2024, PIF hosted a conference in Rio de Janeiro, where it announced $15 billion in planned projects for Brazil. In August 2023, Saudi Investment Minister Khalid Al-Falih toured seven Latin American nations to explore opportunities in sectors such as mining, food processing, agriculture, transport, health care, entertainment, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology. Prior Saudi investments in the region include the acquisition by Saudi Aramco of Chilean fuel retailer Esmax and a $500 million investment by the Saudi Fund for Development in an Argentine gas pipeline. Kevin Funk, a political economist specializing in Latin America, told VOA that Brazilian companies are meanwhile showing greater interest in investing in the Gulf as the region diversifies its economy away from dependence on oil. There is now an array of large and small Brazilian businesses operating in the Gulf countries, and in numerous sectors, including food, clothing and cosmetics, Funk said. Among them is Sao Paulo-based JBS, the world's largest meat processor, which has established a significant presence in the Gulf. 'Yet the fundamentals of the interregional commercial relationship remain largely constant, with Brazil and certain other Latin American countries mostly exporting primary products such as agricultural goods and minerals to the region, while mainly importing fossil fuels and fertilizers,' he said. Brazil's reliance on Gulf fertilizers has grown, partly due to supply chain disruptions caused by Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. However, domestic challenges in Latin America — such as slow economic growth, political instability and inequality — have limited the region's ability to prioritize interregional ties, Funk said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-wake-of-g20-gulf-states-boost-ties-to-brazil-latin-america/7880570.html	2024-11-28T12:03:00-08:00	
Protests erupt in Georgia after government halts EU application until 2028	TBILISI, GEORGIA — Georgia's ruling party said on Thursday that the country would suspend talks on European Union accession until 2028, while also refusing budgetary grants from Brussels, effectively halting its application to join the bloc, a long-standing national goal. In response, thousands of pro-EU protesters blocked streets in the capital, while the country's figurehead president accused the government of declaring war on its own people with the move. The Georgian Dream governing bloc accused the EU of 'a cascade of insults,' saying in a statement it was using the prospect of accession talks to blackmail the country and to 'organize a revolution in the country.' As a result, it said, 'We have decided not to put the issue of opening negotiations with the European Union on the agenda until the end of 2028. Also, we refuse any budgetary grant from the European Union until the end of 2028.' The South Caucasus country of 3.7 million has the aim of EU accession written into its constitution and has traditionally been among the most pro-Western of the Soviet Union's successor states. Georgia's relations with Brussels have deteriorated sharply in recent months amid EU allegations of authoritarianism and pro-Russian tendencies. The EU had already said that Georgia's application is frozen. Georgian Dream says that it is not pro-Russian and that it is committed to democracy and integration with the West. It says it wants to join the EU eventually but has repeatedly engaged in diplomatic feuds with Brussels in recent years while deepening ties with neighboring Russia. There was no immediate formal comment from the EU on Georgian Dream's statement. But an EU official said the impact of Thursday's move was huge, adding that the government was doing what the EU had feared and had hoped it would not. Opinion polls show that around 80% of Georgians support EU membership, and the bloc's flag flies alongside the national flag outside virtually all government buildings in the country. Georgia's pro-Western opposition reacted to Georgian Dream's announcement with fury, while several thousand protesters massed outside parliament and the ruling party's headquarters, blocking roads. Local media reported that protests erupted in several provincial cities. Giorgi Vashadze, a prominent opposition leader, wrote on Facebook: 'the self-proclaimed, illegitimate government has already legally signed the betrayal of Georgia and the Georgian people.' President Salome Zourabichvili, a pro-EU critic of Georgian Dream whose powers are mostly ceremonial, said the ruling party had 'declared not peace, but war against its own people, its past and future.' Zourabichvili's term ends in December, and Georgian Dream has nominated a former lawmaker with hard-line anti-Western views to replace her. The opposition says that an October election, in which official results gave the Georgian Dream bloc almost 54% of the vote, was fraudulent and have refused to take their seats. Western countries have called for a probe into alleged violations. Georgian Dream and the country's election commission say the election was free and fair. Earlier on Thursday, Georgian Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze told journalists that EU membership might harm Georgia's economy, as it would require Tbilisi to cancel visa-free agreements and trade deals with other countries. The EU gave Georgia candidate status in December 2023 but has said that a raft of laws passed by Georgian Dream since, including curbs on 'foreign agents' and LGBTQ rights, are authoritarian, Russian-inspired and obstacles to EU membership. Foreign and domestic critics of Georgian Dream say the party, which is seen as dominated by its billionaire founder, ex-Prime Minister Bidzina Ivanishvili, is steering Georgia back toward Moscow, from which it gained independence in 1991. Russia and Georgia have had no formal diplomatic relations since a five-day war in 2008 but have had a limited rapprochement recently, with Moscow lifting a ban on flights to Georgia and scrapping a stringent visa regime for Georgians working in Russia. Opinion polls show most Georgians dislike Russia, which continues to back two breakaway Georgian regions and defeated Tbilisi in the 2008 war. Russian President Vladimir Putin, speaking on Thursday on a visit to Kazakhstan, praised the 'courage and character' he said Georgian authorities had shown in passing the law on foreign agents, which domestic critics have likened to Russian legislation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/protests-erupt-in-georgia-after-government-halts-eu-application-until-2028/7880594.html	2024-11-28T11:55:30-08:00	
Amnesty International says Nigerian police killed 24 in crackdown on August protests	Abuja, Nigeria — Human rights group Amnesty International on Thursday said its investigation into Nigerian authorities' crackdown on anti-government protests in August showed state officials killed at least 24 protesters and detained more than 1,200 others. Amnesty's findings come amid growing concerns of a shrinking civic space in Nigeria. A 34-page document report released by Amnesty International Thursday was based on eyewitness testimony and interviews with medical workers and families and friends of the victims. Amnesty said Nigerian police used excessive force on demonstrators who had gathered to protest the soaring cost of living. It said police killed at least 24 people, including two children. The casualties were recorded across Borno, Kaduna, Kano, Katsina, Jigawa and Niger states. According to the report, police fired live rounds at close range targeting the victims' heads and torsos, while some other victims were suffocated by the indiscriminate use of tear gas. Isa Sanusi, Amnesty's Nigerian country director, believes the actual death toll could be much higher. 'Even today as we're launching this report in Kano, many families were coming out to tell us that their children are missing and many are believed to have been killed or be in secret detention. Therefore, the whole issue is far broader than what we have talked about in that report. This just goes to show that Nigerian authorities are not ready to accept the fact that the people have the right to peaceful protest,' he said. The August protests, which organizers called 'Ten Days of Rage,' were in response to the soaring cost of living many believed was caused in part by President Bola Tinubu’s reforms, including the removal of fuel subsidies. Nigerian police authorities have not responded to Amnesty's allegations, but have previously denied using live bullets to quell the demonstrations. A national police spokesman did not take VOA's calls for comment. Nigeria has a long history of police brutality despite repeated promises to be more accountable. During the protests in August, heads of security agencies held an emergency meeting and the chief of Defense Staff, General Christopher Musa, addressed journalists. 'None of us here is happy to hear any Nigerian is injured for whatever reason. It's our duty the protect Nigerians. We're going to remain focused, committed, we're going to respect human rights, the rights of everyone who's lawfully performing his task or duty. But we will not relent in pursuing those that have continued to encourage unconstitutional takeover of government or subversion or those ones that are into vandalism or destruction of lives and property,' he said. Amnesty's report comes amid growing concern by human rights groups that Nigerian authorities are trying to stifle political dissent. Sanusi said authorities are not serious about stopping the use of excessive force. 'The lack of accountability, the denial of the killings by the police and other government officials are just signs of the fact that impunity is still reigning in Nigeria and that has to stop. It happened during End SARS protests. We have consulted them to ask for their comment and they didn't say anything. What we want them to do is to hold those responsible of those killings to account,' he said. In October 2020, police brutality sparked massive protests against the Special Anti- Robbery Squad or SARS unit of the police. The protests ended in a deadly shooting at the Lekki toll gate in Lagos.	https://www.voanews.com/a/amnesty-international-says-nigerian-police-killed-24-in-crackdown-on-august-protests/7880554.html	2024-11-28T11:20:57-08:00	
Drone sightings over US bases prompt British troop deployments	LONDON — British and American authorities are investigating after several drones were spotted in recent days flying over four U.S. military bases in England. Britain has deployed dozens of troops around the bases amid concerns the overflights could be acts of deception or sabotage by an adversary such as Russia. In a statement issued Wednesday, U.S. Air Forces in Europe said that 'small unmanned aerial systems continue to be spotted in the vicinity of and over Royal Air Force Lakenheath, RAF Mildenhall, RAF Feltwell and RAF Fairford since Nov. 20.' It said the number of drones sighted has fluctuated and has ranged in size and configurations. 'To date, installation leaders have determined that none of the incursions impacted base residents, facilities or assets. The air force is taking all appropriate measures to safeguard the aforementioned installations and their residents,' the statement said. RAF Lakenheath in the east of England is home to the U.S. Air Force 48th Fighter Wing, a cornerstone of its combat capability in Europe and home to several F-35 stealth fighter jets, among other aircraft. Four American B-52 strategic bombers are currently based at RAF Fairford in the west of the country. The Pentagon said this week it is actively monitoring the situation. 'The bottom line is it's something that we're going to take seriously. We're continuing to look into it. But as of right now, [it] has not had any significant mission impact,' Pentagon spokesperson Major General Patrick Ryder told reporters Tuesday, adding that small drones have become 'relatively common now across the landscape.' Britain has deployed about 60 soldiers around the U.S. bases. British Defense Minister Maria Eagle said they are using 'multilayered force protection measures.' 'We will be making sure that anybody that we manage to catch for engaging in this behavior is shown the full force of the law,' Eagle told lawmakers Wednesday. The nature of the sightings suggests the drones are not being operated by hobbyists, said David Dunn, a professor of international politics at Britain’s University of Birmingham, who has written extensively on the dangers posed by drones. 'It's particularly alarming in this context that actually talked about there [being] several different sizes of drones. It does seem to be a coordinated and planned activity. The most obvious thing is that these are disruptive practices and that they actually force the airfield to operate in a different way, to suspend air operations,' Dunn told VOA. The drones can also be used for other purposes. 'They can gather intelligence on how many planes are operating, where they're based, what the movements are. And, actually, they can also do that for individuals,' Dunn said. Drones have been sighted above the U.S. base at RAF Feltwell, which primarily serves as living quarters for U.S. military personnel — a 'particularly sinister' development, according to Dunn. 'Because in an age where you have highly sophisticated fifth-generation aircraft that operate stealthily and invisibly in the electronic spectrum when they're flying — and are highly protected on the airbase in hardened aircraft shelters — the most vulnerable part of the overall system is actually the aircrew,' Dunn told VOA. 'And so, if you can identify where they live by following them home onto their married quarters, you can identify where you can actually break the weakest part of that chain,' he said. The Times of London newspaper reported that authorities have not ruled out Russia as the culprit. Dunn said there’s evidence of Moscow seeking to step up hybrid attacks, meaning a nonmilitary form of warfare that can still be destructive. 'Whether that be the disruption of undersea cables or of incendiary parcels being sent to the city I live in, Birmingham — there was an incendiary parcel found in Birmingham airport. There’s another [example] of a warehouse being burned down, which stored material going to Ukraine. These things are typically, it seems, done at third party, whereby the Russian state, it seems, has employed criminals in the U,K.,' Dunn said. The Russian Embassy in London had not responded to VOA requests for comment by the time of publication. Moscow has previously denied any involvement in hybrid attacks on the West.	https://www.voanews.com/a/drone-sightings-over-us-bases-prompt-british-troop-deployments/7880539.html	2024-11-28T11:17:27-08:00	
Three Americans arrive in Texas following prisoner swap with China	Three American citizens jailed for years in China arrived in the United States late Wednesday as part of a prisoner swap between Washington and Beijing. The swap, which the White House announced earlier Wednesday, marked a rare diplomatic agreement between the United States and China as U.S. President Joe Biden’s tenure comes to a close. Beijing announced Thursday that the United States has returned four people to China, including at least three Chinese citizens whom Beijing said were held for 'political purposes.' The fourth was an individual sought by Beijing for crimes who had been living in the United States. The Chinese government did not identify the four people. The three Americans released in the swap — Mark Swidan, Kai Li and John Leung — landed Wednesday night at a military base in San Antonio, Texas. Biden told reporters Thursday morning that he has spoken to all of them. 'I’m really happy they are home,' he said. All three Americans had been designated as wrongfully detained. Swidan was facing a death sentence on drug charges, and Li and Leung were jailed on espionage charges. In a separate but connected move, the State Department Wednesday lowered its travel warning to China to 'level two' from 'level three,' now advising American citizens to 'exercise increased caution' when traveling to China. Previously, the State Department advised Americans to 'reconsider travel' to China, partially due to the risk of wrongful detention of Americans. The prisoner swap comes two months after China released David Lin, a Christian pastor from California who had spent nearly 20 years jailed in China after being convicted of contract fraud. And in August, the United States engaged in a separate historic prisoner swap. That one, between the United States and Russia, included the release of American journalists Alsu Kurmasheva and Evan Gershkovich, as well as ex-U.S. Marine Paul Whelan and U.S. permanent resident and Russian opposition leader Vladimir Kara-Murza. Some information in this report came from the Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/three-americans-arrive-in-texas-following-prisoner-swap-with-china-/7880557.html	2024-11-28T11:13:35-08:00	
Pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai tells court overthrowing CCP 'impossible'	washington — Jailed pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai dismissed as 'impossible' the idea that the Chinese government could be overthrown, during testimony in his much-condemned Hong Kong national security trial on Thursday, as foreign governments continue to call for his immediate release. 'To think about overthrowing the CCP [Chinese Communist Party], I think it’s out of the dimension of any discussion. It’s impossible,' Lai said. 'Do you think sanctions [and] blockade would overthrow the CCP? It’s more than ridiculous,' Lai told the court. The 77-year-old British national made the statements during what was his sixth day of testimony in a high-profile national security trial that rights groups and foreign governments have rejected as politically motivated. Lai stands accused of collusion with foreign forces and sedition under a Beijing-imposed national security law. He rejects the charges but, if convicted, faces life in prison. The founder of the now-shuttered Apple Daily newspaper has been held in solitary confinement since late 2020. Lai’s national security trial — which is taking place before three government-appointed judges, rather than a jury — began nearly one year ago and was initially estimated to last about 80 days. During his testimony, Lai has maintained that he never lobbied for international sanctions on Hong Kong. But he said international support would be the 'salvation' of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy movement and could protect the city 'from the encroachment of China on our freedom.' Describing his thinking at the time, Lai told the court that the 2019 pro-democracy movement could have garnered the international community’s support by conducting demonstrations 'peacefully and rationally.' 'If we conduct our demonstration on a moral high ground and people sympathize with us, I think this is the greatest lobbying we can have,' Lai said in his testimony. A chorus of rights groups and foreign governments, including the United States, have repeatedly called for Lai’s immediate release. On Thursday, the European Parliament passed an urgent resolution calling for the publisher’s release. The measure, which passed by an overwhelming majority, marks the first time that the newly reconstituted European Parliament has considered Lai’s case and the situation in Hong Kong. EU Commissioner Helena Dalli said Lai’s trial 'is emblematic of the erosion of democracy and freedom in Hong Kong.' Lai’s international legal team welcomed the resolution. Caoilfhionn Gallagher, the head of the international legal team, said in a statement that Hong Kong’s treatment of Lai 'flies in the face' of European values. 'He shouldn’t spend a second more in prison,' Gallagher told VOA last week. 'This is a trial which should never have happened in the first place, under a law which should not exist.' The European resolution also called for the release of Chung Pui-kuen, one of two editors-in-chief at the new-defunct Stand News sentenced for sedition in a case widely viewed as politically motivated. Hong Kong’s Security Bureau did not immediately reply to a VOA email requesting comment for this story. But in a more than 700-word statement to VOA last week, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said it was 'inappropriate' to comment on the case because legal proceedings are ongoing. The spokesperson said that Hong Kong 'rejected any fact-twisting remarks and baseless smears against the legal system and safeguarding of rights and freedom in Hong Kong.' Hong Kong authorities have previously denied that Lai’s trial is unfair. Lai began his testimony on November 20, just one day after 45 pro-democracy activists in Hong Kong were sentenced to as much as 10 years in prison under a national security law. In testimony last week, Lai said he had advocated for 'peaceful resistance' against rising Chinese repression in Hong Kong through his commentaries published in Apple Daily. He noted that he tried to 'reduce violence' during the city’s pro-democracy protests in 2019. Lai also was questioned about the establishment of Apple Daily’s English online edition in May 2020, shortly before the national security law came into effect. Lai said a 'sense of crisis' drove him to believe that the new edition would help Hong Kong by encouraging foreign lawmakers to 'take notice of our situation' and 'voice out their concerns' to Beijing. Apple Daily closed in 2021 after authorities jailed its staff, raided its office, and froze its assets worth millions of dollars. Earlier this week, Lai rebutted the testimony of prosecution witness Cheung Kim-hung, the former CEO of Apple Daily’s parent company Next Digital. Lai said he never discussed sanctions with Cheung and accused Cheung of falsifying testimony. Also this week, Lai testified that he did not give editorial directions during 'lunch box meetings.' Earlier in November, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention determined that Lai is unlawfully and arbitrarily detained in Hong Kong and has called for his immediate release. A one-time billionaire, Lai could have fled Hong Kong, but he instead chose to stay and stand up for freedom in Hong Kong, according to his son Sebastien. 'His actions speak louder than words. And he has done all these brave and incredible things in defense of freedom for the people of Hong Kong, and they’re criminalizing him for it,' Sebastien Lai told VOA last week. Jimmy Lai’s international legal team has expressed concern about the conditions in which the publisher is being held, including prolonged solitary confinement and no access to specialized medical care for diabetes. Even as Jimmy Lai’s physical health has declined, 'his spirit is holding strong. His mind is holding strong,' Sebastien Lai told VOA last week. Jimmy Lai’s international legal team expects the trial to continue into 2025.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pro-democracy-publisher-jimmy-lai-tells-court-overthrowing-ccp-impossible-/7880495.html	2024-11-28T10:38:29-08:00

Landslide triggered by rain in Indonesia kills at least 7 people	SIBOLANGIT, INDONESIA — A landslide triggered by torrential rains in Indonesia’s Sumatra island killed at least seven people, officials said on Thursday, adding to the death toll from landslides in the region this week. Rescuers recovered the bodies of the victims, including a driver and passengers, from a tourist bus that was covered by trees, mud and rocks on the road from the capital, Medan, to Berastagi in Indonesia’s North Sumatra province. The route is the main access from Medan to other districts. The bus was among vehicles that had been cut off by landslides on the road since Wednesday morning. More than 10 people were also injured and have been evacuated to the hospital in Medan. Muji Ediyanto, traffic director of the North Sumatra Regional Police, said in a video message distributed by Indonesia's National Search and Rescue Agency on Thursday said that some vehicles remain trapped between the landslide locations along that road. 'It will take at least two days to evacuate them from the landslide. Several vehicles are still trapped by piles [from the] landslides. There are also fallen trees at several points ... and the vehicles have not been able to get out of the locations,' Ediyanto said. Earlier this week, 20 people died after flash floods and landslides at four locations in the mountainsides of North Sumatra province, including in Karo regency, which is located less than 20 kilometers from the most-recent landslide location. Seasonal rains from around October through to March frequently cause flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/landslide-triggered-by-rain-in-indonesia-kills-at-least-7-people/7880285.html	2024-11-28T08:06:26-08:00

Pakistan charges journalist with terrorism for reporting on protest	ISLAMABAD — Pakistani police Wednesday arrested and charged a prominent journalist investigating claims of casualties during a government crackdown on opposition protesters in the capital, Islamabad, earlier this week, drawing strong condemnation from media freedom advocates. Relatives and colleagues said Matiullah Jan was picked up outside a hospital in the capital just before midnight along with colleague Saqib Bashir while they were collecting data about 'the dead bodies.' Bashir told reporters Thursday that he was freed and dropped off on a street three hours later. Jan, who hosts a political talk show on television and runs his own YouTube channel with nearly 400,000 subscribers, is a known critic of Pakistan’s military for its alleged meddling in governance matters. Asif Ali, the police officer complainant in the case, told VOA that the journalist detainee was charged with terrorism, assaulting law enforcement personnel and possessing narcotics. While in police custody Thursday, Jan vehemently denied the charges against him. 'This is all fake, funny and fabricated. I don’t even smoke a cigarette,' he said, adding that his efforts to collect details about the protesters’ deaths led to his arrest. 'We are not afraid and will continue to pursue our work,' he said. Bashir told VOA that they were in the process of 'collecting data on the casualties' when men wearing black uniforms blindfolded and forcibly pushed them into a vehicle in the parking area of the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences in Islamabad. Media advocacy groups and human rights activists denounced the police action and expressed 'grave alarm' over the incident. The independent Human Rights Commission of Pakistan demanded Jan's immediate and unconditional release. 'This authoritarian tactic to silence journalists must cease,' the commission said. The Committee to Protect Journalists noted that Jan’s arrest followed his coverage of a protest march by the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf political party. 'We call for a swift and impartial investigation into the incident and accountability for all perpetrators,' the CPJ said on X. 'Complete impunity persists for Jan's previous abduction in 2020,' the global watchdog wrote, referring to a brief abduction of the journalist four years ago, reportedly by Pakistani intelligence operatives. Pakistan’s intelligence agencies never responded to the allegation. Hours before he was arrested Wednesday, Jan said on his television program that security forces had used firearms to disperse opposition protesters, causing several fatalities and bullet injuries to dozens more. He cited data from hospital sources and accused the government of hiding the truth by pressuring hospital staff not to reveal any details to the media. Jan also questioned government claims that several law enforcement personnel had died after being run over by a vehicle in the protesters' convoy on Monday when thousands of supporters of jailed former prime minister Imran Khan stormed Islamabad to stage a sit-in demonstration to demand his release. The journalist aired an interview on his YouTube channel with a witness, who was also a relative of one of the deceased men. The witness said the vehicle belonged to paramilitary forces who were retreating from the protest site after running out of tear gas shells when they crashed into a crowd of security personnel and demonstrators. Social media video supported the account. On Tuesday night, authorities cut off power before unleashing a sweeping crackdown on several PTI supporters, with multiple foreign media outlets, journalists and residents in nearby neighborhoods reporting heavy tear gas shelling and intense gunfire by paramilitary forces directed at the rally. The government announced early Wednesday that the security action had dispersed protesters and reopened roads linking Islamabad with the rest of the country after a four-day lockdown. The PTI has said that as many as 40 people died, accusing security forces of opening fire directly at the rally. However, the opposition party has provided information about only eight victims so far, indicating that they are still gathering details about others. Pakistani Information Minister Attaullah Tarrar and capital police officials maintained that security forces employed tear gas and rubber bullets in response to the protests, dismissing allegations that live ammunition was used. Furthermore, they denied claims that the crackdown resulted in civilian casualties.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-charges-journalist-with-terrorism-for-reporting-on-protest/7880155.html	2024-11-28T06:34:29-08:00

Taiwan president sets to leave for Pacific tour amid growing Chinese pressure	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan President Lai Ching-te will kick off on Saturday a week-long overseas trip to visit the island’s three diplomatic allies in the Pacific region, marking his first diplomatic tour since taking office in May. The visit will include stops in the Marshall Islands, Tuvalu, and Palau, as well as stopovers in U.S. territories such as Hawaii and Guam. It comes as China continues to expand its influence in the Pacific region. Analysts say the trip can help consolidate Taiwan’s diplomatic ties with the three Pacific Island countries. 'The Pacific Islands region has been the site of intense geopolitical competition in recent years and we have seen three of Taiwan’s original diplomatic partners [in the region, including Solomon Islands, Kiribati, and Nauru,] switching recognition to China since 2019,' said Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands program at Lowy Institute in Australia. He said as China continues to use 'a range of coercive tactics and incentives' to pressure Taiwan’s remaining diplomatic allies in the Pacific to switch recognition to Beijing, Lai’s trip will play an important role in delivering Taiwan’s commitments to these three countries. 'As the number of countries recognizing Taiwan becomes fewer, each diplomatic partner becomes more important for Taiwan,' Sora told VOA in a video interview. Palauan President Surangel Whipps Jr., who was re-elected earlier this month, said the Chinese government had tried to use tourism to incentivize him to sever diplomatic ties with Taiwan. 'The Chinese ambassador to Cambodia once called me to say that China had more tourists than Taiwan so I should denounce Taiwan and go with China because that would get me millions of tourists and the Chinese would also build new hotels that Palau needs,' Whipps Jr. told VOA during an interview in Palau last month. China views Taiwan as an inalienable part of its territory that must one day be reunited with mainland China. Beijing also opposes any form of official interaction between Taiwan and other countries. In response to Lai’s upcoming trip, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said if Lai attempts to use the trip to provoke China it 'will lead nowhere.' 'We urge relevant countries to see clearly the trend of history at an early date, and make the right decision that truly serves their fundamental and long-term interests,' Lin Jian said during a regular press conference on November 22. Reuters news agency reported on Wednesday that China may launch a new round of military drills near Taiwan as a response to Lai’s Pacific tour, citing unnamed Taiwanese and regional security officials. In response to the report, Taiwanese Foreign Minister Lin Chia-lung on Thursday urged China not to 'overreact' to Lai’s trip to the Pacific. On the same day, Taiwan’s military held an early morning air defense drill to test its response and engagement procedures. Focus on maritime security and public health Lai will be accompanied by key cabinet members overseeing maritime affairs and public health during the trip. Experts say since maritime surveillance, maritime domain awareness, and public health are all critical issues for Pacific Island nations, the makeup of Lai’s delegation suggests Taiwan has identified these issues as areas where Taiwan can contribute. 'Maritime domain security is such an important topic for Palau and Marshall Islands, as Palau’s president Surangel Whipps Jr. talked about incursions into Palau’s territorial waters by Chinese research vessels on several occasions, and it seems that Taiwan thinks it can play a role [in that space,]' said Henryk Szadziewski, an expert on Pacific affairs at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. In addition to maritime security and health, Szadziewski says climate financing and economic livelihoods are also areas in which Taiwan can support its Pacific allies. 'The Marshall Islands and Tuvalu are significantly under threat from the climate crisis and I think Taiwan can help with the climate financing that the region sorely needs,' he told VOA by phone. Palau and Marshall Islands both receive significant economic support from the U.S. under the Compacts of Free Association, or COFA. Australia is also assisting Tuvalu in climate adaptation through the Falepili Union treaty, which would allow Tuvalu citizens to live in Australia under a special visa. Under COFA, the U.S. provides economic aid worth billions of dollars, while Palau, the Marshall Islands, and the Federated States of Micronesia give the U.S. exclusive military access to their land, water, and airspace, as well as the right to deny China access to their ports and territorial waters. Since Palau and the Marshall Islands are both part of the Second Island Chain, which plays a key role in connecting the U.S. forces in Hawaii and Guam, analysts say ensuring these countries have strong defense and security relationships with Washington and Taiwan is strategically important to the U.S. Sora in Australia said since these agreements make Washington and Canberra the main development partners for Taiwan’s three Pacific allies, it creates 'a permissive environment' that allows Taiwan to contribute to larger development projects in those countries. 'Taiwan can provide targeted, effective, and useful assistance but it’s not relied upon as the main development partner. It’s very important that the larger countries are also involved in those countries,' he told VOA. However, other experts say Taiwan should still avoid purely counting on support from the U.S. and Australia to maintain ties with Pacific allies. 'The willingness for the U.S. and Australia to burden share in these Pacific countries certainly benefits Taiwan now, but Taiwan needs to develop a strategy if both governments opt to focus their attention elsewhere,' Timothy Rich, a political scientist at Western Kentucky University, told VOA in a written response. Since China has redirected large amounts of aid to the Pacific since 2022, making it the second largest donor in the region, analysts say Beijing will keep looking for opportunities to influence Taiwan’s Pacific allies. 'China will be looking for opportunities to persuade these countries to adopt a relationship with Beijing in preference to one with Taiwan, and they will use a combination of carrots and sticks to achieve this goal,' Tess Newton Cain, an adjunct associate professor at Griffith Asia Institute in Australia, told VOA in a video interview. To cope with China’s ongoing attempt to drive a wedge between Taiwan and its Pacific allies, Sora said Taipei should 'consistently be present in terms of its activities on the ground and in terms of servicing the political relationship.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-president-sets-to-leave-for-pacific-tour-amid-growing-chinese-pressure/7880070.html	2024-11-28T05:50:25-08:00	
Senior Chinese military official Miao Hua under investigation, defense ministry says	BEIJING — China said on Thursday a top-ranking military official had been suspended and was under investigation for 'serious violations of discipline,' and denied reports Defense Minister Dong Jun was being investigated for corruption. The suspended officer, Admiral Miao Hua, served on the ruling Central Military Commission, China's highest-level military command body, and was stationed in the coastal province of Fujian when President Xi Jinping worked there as a local official, according to his official biography. Miao, 69, who began his career in the army, has been the military's leading political officer given his role on the six-person commission, which is headed by Xi. A defense ministry spokesperson, Wu Qian, who briefed reporters at a monthly press conference in Beijing, provided no further details. China's military has undergone a sweeping anti-corruption purge since last year, with at least nine People's Liberation Army generals and a handful of defense industry executives removed from the national legislative body. Wu said media reports that Dong had been sidelined by an investigation were 'sheer fabrication' spread by rumor-mongers with evil motivations. The Financial Times reported this week that Dong was being investigated as part of the wide-ranging anti-corruption investigation, citing current and former U.S. officials. Two U.S. officials told Reuters they believed Dong was being investigated for corruption. Another urged caution about that conclusion. Dong had declined last week to meet U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin during a meeting of defense ministers in Laos, citing U.S. actions over Taiwan, a move the Pentagon chief said on Wednesday was unfortunate. Asked about the decision not to meet Austin, Wu cited Dong by name as saying the United States had been 'seriously undermining regional peace and stability.' Dong was appointed defense minister in December 2023, replacing Li Shangfu, who was removed after seven months. Li and his predecessor, Wei Fenghe, were expelled from the Communist Party in June for 'serious violations of discipline,' a euphemism for corruption. Many of those ousted earlier were from the Rocket Force - an elite arm of the PLA that oversees its most advanced conventional and nuclear missiles. Analysts said at the time that exposing deep-set graft could take time and potentially slow Xi's long-running military modernisation plans. Diplomats and analysts are watching closely for any signs the campaign could hamper ongoing military operations, commands and the PLA's diplomacy. China security scholar James Char said on Thursday that Miao was a Xi 'acolyte.' 'Clearly, Xi Jinping's trust in yet another of his uniformed subordinates has been misplaced,' said Char, of Singapore's S.Rajaratnam School of International Studies. 'If Miao Hua is eventually found guilty, the CMC Chairman himself probably failed to size up the extent of corruption among China's military elites.' The latest Pentagon report on China's military, issued in October 2023, said Miao 'may have ties' to Xi from his time in Fujian.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senior-chinese-military-official-miao-hua-under-investigation-defense-ministry-says/7880046.html	2024-11-28T05:00:14-08:00	
At least 13 dead after landslides bury 40 homes in villages in eastern Uganda	Nairobi — At least 13 people have died in eastern Uganda after landslides buried 40 homes in six villages, relief officials said Thursday. The Uganda Red Cross Society said 13 bodies have been recovered and the rescue effort is continuing. Local media reported that authorities expect the death toll could rise to 30. The landslides happened after heavy rains on Wednesday night in the mountainous district of Bulambuli, where landslides are common. The district is about 280 kilometers east of the capital, Kampala. A journalist in the area told The Associated Press that local officials said an excavator would be brought to assist in the rescue efforts, but the roads were covered in mud and the rain was still falling. The affected area is about 20 hectares, with homesteads and farmlands spread downhill. Photos and videos of people digging through mud in search of victims were shared on social media platforms. Some of the houses were completely covered by mud while others had merely a roof showing above mud. The Daily Monitor newspaper reported that most of the bodies recovered so far were those of children. The prime minister’s office issued a disaster alert on Wednesday stating that heavy rains across the country had cut off major roads. Two rescue boats capsized on Wednesday during a rescue mission on River Nile where Pakwach bridge was submerged.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-13-dead-after-landslides-bury-40-homes-in-villages-in-eastern-uganda-/7880034.html	2024-11-28T04:41:10-08:00	
Israel steps up bombing of central Gaza, strikes kill 17 people	Cairo — Israeli military strikes killed at least 17 Palestinians across the Gaza Strip on Thursday, medics said, as forces stepped up their bombardment of central areas and tanks pushed deeper into the north and south of the enclave. The escalation came a day after Israel and Iranian-backed Hezbollah started to observe a ceasefire in Lebanon, ending more than a year of hostilities and raising hopes among Palestinians in Gaza for a similar deal with Hamas, which rules the enclave. Six people were killed in two separate air strikes on a house and near the hospital of Kamal Adwan in Beit Lahiya in the northern Gaza Strip, while four others were killed when an Israeli strike hit a motorcycle in Khan Younis in the south. In Nuseirat, one of Gaza's eight historic refugee camps, Israeli planes carried out several air strikes, destroying a multi-story building and hitting roads outside mosques. At least seven were killed in those strikes, health officials said. Medics said at least two people, a woman and a child, were killed in tank shelling that hit western areas of Nuseirat, while an air strike killed five others in a house nearby. In Rafah, near the border with Egypt, tanks pushed deeper into the northwest area of the city, residents said. There has been no Israeli comment on the latest fighting. Israel's 13-month campaign in Gaza, with the avowed intent of eradicating Hamas militants, has killed nearly 44,200 people and displaced nearly all the enclave's population at least once, Gaza officials say. Vast swathes of the territory are in ruins. The war was launched in response to an attack by Hamas-led fighters who killed around 1,200 people and captured more than 250 hostages in Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, Israel has said. Ceasefire hopes in Gaza Months of efforts to negotiate a ceasefire have yielded scant progress, and negotiations are now on hold. Mediator Qatar has suspended its efforts until the sides are prepared to make concessions. A ceasefire in the parallel conflict between Israel and Hamas' Lebanese ally Hezbollah took effect before dawn on Wednesday, bringing a halt to hostilities that had escalated sharply in recent months and overshadowed the conflict in Gaza. Announcing the Lebanon accord on Tuesday, U.S. President Joe Biden said he would now renew his push for an elusive agreement in Gaza, urging Israel and Hamas to seize the moment. The Lebanon truce has made the sense of desperation and abandonment even more acute among Gaza's 2.3 million people. 'I hope a ceasefire will happen like it did in Lebanon... I just want to take my children to see my land, my house, to see what they did to us, I want to live in safety,' said Amal Abu Hmeid, a displaced woman in Gaza. 'God willing we will have a truce,' she said, sitting in the courtyard of a school sheltering displaced families in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. The courtyard was filled with dirt and water from where people did their laundry. Clothes were airing outside classrooms as children played nearby. '[Life] was beautiful [before the war]... Now there is nothing beautiful, it's all gone. Our houses are gone, our brothers are gone, and no one is left. Now we hardly get... one meal a day. We can’t even get bread,' Abu Hmeid told Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-steps-up-bombing-of-central-gaza-strikes-kill-17-people/7880000.html	2024-11-28T04:06:04-08:00	
Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade kicks off a century after its first trip through Manhattan	New York — A century after the first Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade, the annual holiday tradition kicks off Thursday in New York City with new Spider-Man and Minnie Mouse balloons, zoo and pasta-themed floats, performances from Jennifer Hudson and Idina Menzel, and more. This year’s star-studded lineup is a far cry from the parade’s initial incarnation, which featured floats showing scenes from Mother Goose, Red Riding Hood and the Wolf, Miss Muffet and the Spider, and other fairy tales. Some things remain the same, though. As in 1924, there will be plenty of marching bands and lots of clowns, followed by the grand finale of Santa Claus riding through Manhattan and ushering in the holiday season. This year's parade features 17 giant, helium-filled character balloons, 22 floats, 15 novelty and heritage inflatables, 11 marching bands, 700 clowns, 10 performance groups, award-winning singers and actors, and the WNBA champion New York Liberty. One new float will spotlight the Rao’s food brand, featuring a knight and a dragon in battle made with actual pasta elements. Another will celebrate the Bronx Zoo’s 125th anniversary with representations of a tiger, a giraffe, a zebra and a gorilla. 'The work that we do, the opportunity to impact millions of people and bring a bit of joy for a couple of hours on Thanksgiving morning, is what motivates us every day,' said Will Coss, Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade executive producer. The parade begins at 8:30 a.m. on Manhattan’s Upper West Side and ends 4 kilometers away around noon at Macy’s Herald Square flagship store on 34th Street, which serves as a stage and backdrop for performances. It'll happen rain or shine — the parade has only been canceled three times, from 1942 to 1944 during World War II — but organizers will be monitoring wind speeds throughout the festivities to make sure it's safe for the big balloons to fly. So far, the forecast calls for rain with temperatures in the upper-40s and winds around 16 kph, well within the acceptable range for letting Snoopy, Bluey and their friends soar. New York City law prohibits Macy’s from flying the full-size balloons if sustained winds exceed 37 kph or wind gusts are over 56 kph. The parade airs on NBC with hosts Savannah Guthrie, Hoda Kotb and Al Roker and streams on the network's Peacock service. Carlos Adyan and Andrea Meza will host a Spanish simulcast on Telemundo.	https://www.voanews.com/a/macy-s-thanksgiving-day-parade-kicks-off-a-century-after-its-first-trip-through-manhattan-/7879977.html	2024-11-28T03:27:35-08:00	
Israel says ceasefire with Hezbollah violated, fires on south Lebanon	BEIRUT — Israeli tank fire hit six areas in southern Lebanon on Thursday and the Israeli military said its ceasefire with Hezbollah was breached after what it called suspects, some in vehicles, arrived at several areas in the southern zone. A ceasefire between Israel and Lebanese armed group Hezbollah took effect Wednesday under a deal brokered by the U.S. and France, intended to allow people in both countries to start returning to homes in border areas shattered by 14 months of fighting. The Israeli military had urged residents of towns along the border strip not to return yet for their own safety. On Thursday morning, Israeli tank fire hit six areas within that border strip, state media and Lebanese security sources said. The rounds struck Markaba, Wazzani and Kfarchouba, Khiyam, Taybe and the agricultural plains around Marjayoun, all of which lie within 2 kilometers of the Blue Line demarcating the border between Lebanon and Israel. One of the security sources said two people were wounded in Markaba. Lebanese families displaced from their homes near the southern border have tried to return to check on their properties. But Israeli troops remain stationed within Lebanese territory in towns along the border and Reuters reporters heard surveillance drones flying over parts of southern Lebanon. There was no immediate comment on the tank rounds from Hezbollah or Israel, who had been fighting for over a year in parallel with the Gaza war. The agreement, a rare diplomatic feat in a region racked by conflict, ended the deadliest confrontation between Israel and the Iran-backed militant group in years. But Israel is still fighting its other arch foe, the Palestinian militant group Hamas, in the Gaza Strip. Hamas in and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Under the ceasefire terms, Israeli forces can take up to 60 days to withdraw from southern Lebanon but neither side can launch offensive operations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he had instructed the military not to allow residents back to villages near the border. Lebanon's speaker of parliament Nabih Berri, the top interlocutor for Lebanon in negotiating the deal, had said on Wednesday that residents could return home. Hezbollah has said its fighters 'remain fully equipped to deal with the aspirations and assaults of the Israeli enemy.' Its forces will monitor Israel's withdrawal from Lebanon 'with their hands on the trigger.' The group has been weakened by casualties and the killing of its leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah and other commanders by Israel.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-ceasefire-with-hezbollah-violated-fires-on-south-lebanon/7879959.html	2024-11-28T02:44:34-08:00	
Palestinian president names interim successor if he has to leave post	RAMALLAH, West Bank — Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas has named a temporary successor who would take over from him should he die or leave his post, addressing concerns of a possible power vacuum following his departure. In a statement released late on Wednesday, Abbas said the chairman of the Palestinian National Council should serve as interim president for no more than 90 days, during which presidential elections should be held. The current chairman of the Palestinians' top decision-making body is Rawhi Fattouh, 75, who also served briefly as a stop-gap leader following the death of Yasser Arafat in 2004. Abbas, 89, has been Palestinian president since 2005 and has had regular health problems in recent years, prompting repeated speculation on who might replace him when he finally stands aside. He does not have a deputy and a source told Reuters earlier this month that Saudi Arabia had pressed him to appoint one. Wednesday's announcement clears up uncertainty over what should happen when he dies, but Fattouh was not named as his deputy, meaning there was still no visibility on who might replace Abbas in the long term. Israel's Agriculture Minister Avi Dichter, a member of the inner security cabinet, told a group of foreign reporters this week that the Israeli army would take over the West Bank if someone from the militant group Hamas tried to become president. Abbas was elected to a four-year term in 2005, but no presidential ballot has been held since and he is now deeply unpopular, with a September opinion poll showing 89% of Palestinians in the West Bank wanted him to resign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/palestinian-president-names-interim-successor-if-he-has-to-leave-post/7879956.html	2024-11-28T02:36:45-08:00	
China-Cambodia effort nets 240 Chinese suspects in anti-fraud campaign	BEIJING — China repatriated 240 arrested Chinese gambling and fraud suspects from Cambodia on Thursday, with some 500 more expected to be escorted back, Chinese state media said, as Beijing stepped up a years-long effort to combat Chinese organized crime in Southeast Asia. The arrested group constituted the second batch China has chartered planes to repatriate from Cambodia after a first round in April when more than 680 were escorted back, China's national television broadcaster CCTV reported. As part of efforts to stem cross-border online gambling and fraud carried out through telecom networks, China periodically has partnered with neighbors such as Cambodia, Myanmar and the Philippines to nab Chinese suspects and have them brought back to China. The latest deportation follows a week after China and Myanmar dismantled large telecom fraud centers in northern Myanmar, with over 53,000 Chinese nationals arrested since a campaign to combat such fraud began last year. In September, China and Cambodia strengthened their cooperation against gambling and fraud, signing agreements to enhance law enforcement collaboration and fight Chinese organized crime in the Southeast Asian country. In 2019, Cambodia banned online gambling, targeting particularly Chinese-run operations that had sprung up in the southern coastal city of Sihanoukville. 'The public security authorities will continue to deepen law enforcement cooperation with relevant countries and regions, carry out focused crackdowns, resolutely dismantle gambling and fraud dens involving Chinese nationals, and firmly curb the high incidence of such crimes,' CCTV said. China has repatriated thousands of suspects under its covert global 'Operation Fox Hunt' operation launched a decade ago to fight corruption and economic crimes and has since recovered billions of dollars in assets, CCTV said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-cambodia-effort-nets-240-chinese-suspects-in-anti-fraud-campaign/7879952.html	2024-11-28T02:27:00-08:00	
Russian strikes pound energy infrastructure	Russian drones and missiles pounded Ukrainian energy infrastructure Thursday, cutting off power to more than 1 million people across the country, Ukrainian authorities said. 'As of now, 523,000 subscribers in the Lviv region are without electricity,' regional head Maksym Kozytsky said on social media. The region, in the western part of the country, borders Poland. Directly north of the Lviv region, 215,000 customers lost power in the region of Volyn, and in the neighboring Rivne region, governor Oleksandr Koval said 280,000 consumers were without power. 'Energy infrastructure is once again targeted by the enemy's massive strike,' Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko wrote on Facebook. Ukrenergo, the national electrical grid operator, introduced emergency power cuts amid the attack, Galushchenko said. Officials told Reuters that several nuclear power units were disconnected from the network during the attacks. Private power company DTEK said the power cuts impacted Kyiv, Odesa, Dnipropetrovsk and Donetsk regions. Some regional officials said water service also was affected by the airstrikes. The head of Ukraine’s presidential office, Andrii Yermak, said in a Telegram post that Russia had stockpiled missiles to strike Ukrainian infrastructure and wage war against civilians during the cold season, The Associated Press reported. Information from The Associated Press, Agence France-Presse and Reuters was used in the report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-strikes-pound-energy-infrastructure/7879948.html	2024-11-28T02:08:12-08:00	
Analysts say Vietnamese decree deepens control over social media	HO CHI MINH CITY, VIETNAM — A Vietnamese decree taking effect at end of December that increases requirements on social media platforms in the country to share user information is a continuation of Hanoi’s yearslong effort to control online activity, analysts and activists have told VOA. Decree 147, on the management, provision and use of internet services and information in cyberspace, promulgated earlier this month, will go into effect December 25. Along with adding regulations concerning online gaming, the decree says social media platforms operating in Vietnam must store user data locally, give user information to the government on demand, and take down what authorities consider illegal content within 24 hours. Users also will be required to use their phone number or ID before posting on sites including Facebook, the country's most popular social media platform, with more than 86 million users. Tran Anh Quan, a Vietnamese social activist living in exile, who asked that his location not be revealed, told VOA on November 22 that the new decree will make posting online more dangerous for those who wish to speak out. He said he believes the decree is aimed at dissidents who often post under pseudonyms. 'This decree is clearly aimed directly at Vietnamese social activists, democracy fighters and dissidents,' he wrote in Vietnamese over Telegram. 'Dissidents in Vietnam often use fake accounts, or do not verify their social media accounts, to avoid being fined by the police. But this decree requires users to verify their identities on social media. And those who express dissent will certainly be considered to have violated regulations for ‘bad’ or ‘anti-state’ content,' Quan wrote. A government official says the new decree will empower authorities to more efficiently oversee social media platforms in the country. Nguyen Tien Nam of the Communication Ministry's Cyber Security Department told state-run Vietnam Television that 'account identification helps authorities identify the real identity behind the account, providing good support for the investigation and handling of violations.' Phil Robertson, director of the nonprofit organization Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates, told VOA by email the same day that the decree will have a 'strong chilling effect on internet freedom.' 'Decree 147 will be an unmitigated disaster for freedom of expression and privacy rights for Vietnamese who use social media, especially when talking about anything that is remotely critical of the government,' he wrote. 'People will realize the government can use its surveillance capacity to immediately track what anyone says,' he added. Online policing Duy Hoang, executive director of the banned pro-democracy political party Viet Tan, told VOA that although the decree imposes new restrictions, Vietnamese authorities have been unveiling similar policies since social media took off in the country in the 2010s. 'It feels like déjà vu because ever since social media took off in Vietnam, the authorities have been trying to find ways to control it, to censor it, to expose users, and especially to limit social media,' he said by phone November 21. Along with putting its first cybersecurity law into effect in 2019, the government created Force 47 in 2017. Force 47 is a military cyber unit which is believed to have 10,000 members whose job is to push a pro-government agenda online and harass users who share views criticizing authorities or policies. Zachary Abuza, Southeast Asia expert and professor at the National War College in Washington, told VOA by phone November 22, that pro-government accounts using fake names will likely escape scrutiny under the new decree. 'It wants to end this cloak of anonymity,' Abuza said of the decree. 'But we also know that the government is going to abuse it, because a lot of those government accounts are trolls, so you know this is going to be applied unevenly.' Do Nguyen Mai Khoi, a Vietnamese singer and activist who has been living in the United States since leaving Vietnam for fear of arrest, told VOA that the new decree will enhance authorities’ ability to censor and jail dissidents. 'This decree only tightens freedom of speech in cyberspace and makes it easier for the government to control the internet, as they have been doing and continue to do,' she wrote over Signal on November 22. There are currently 180 jailed activists in Vietnam according to The 88 Project, a U.S.-based nonprofit advocating for human rights in Vietnam. A 2021 Amnesty International report said a growing proportion of prisoners of conscience in Vietnam are imprisoned because of online posts. According to the NGO, 41% of jailed dissidents were behind bars because of 'peaceful online speech.' 'Many people have been fined and imprisoned just because of their social media posts,' Mai Khoi said. Social platforms 'I'm sure that Meta, Google, and other social media will jump to obey any government orders for content takedowns, and in fact, they have been doing so for quite some time,' Robertson wrote. 'The days of internet company claims that they will resist unfair Vietnamese official demands are long over.' In a November 12 report, the international law firm Baker & McKenzie wrote that Decree 147 will significantly impact online platforms available in Vietnam. 'Given the complexity of this decree and to better prepare for the upcoming changes, companies are strongly encouraged to conduct risk and compliance gap assessments and legal analysis of the decree,' the report stated. Mai Khoi called on social media sites to adhere to their stated goals. 'I wanted to tell the social media companies that they should keep their promises to protect freedom of speech online, they shouldn’t follow the government’s requirements to violate privacy rights and human rights,' she wrote. Abuza, however, said that with such a large user base, social media companies have little incentive to push back against Vietnam's cyber laws. 'I just don't see Facebook, which sees Vietnam as such a lucrative market, being able to resist,' Abuza said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysts-say-vietnamese-decree-deepens-control-over-social-media/7879931.html	2024-11-28T01:36:10-08:00	
Wrongfully detained Americans return from China	Three U.S. citizens imprisoned by China were on their way home late Wednesday, U.S. officials said, culminating years of U.S. diplomatic efforts to free Americans Washington says were wrongfully detained by Beijing. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken said he spoke to Kai Li, Mark Swidan and John Leung 'as they traveled home to the United States just in time for Thanksgiving.' 'I told them how glad I was that they were in good health and that they’ll soon be reunited with their loved ones,' Blinken posted on X, formerly Twitter. The White House announced the release of the Americans on Wednesday. 'We are pleased to announce the release of Mark Swidan, Kai Li, and John Leung from detention in the People’s Republic of China,' a National Security Council spokesperson said in a statement. The development is a diplomatic win for President Joe Biden, who will be leaving office in January. With the men’s release, 'all of the wrongfully detained Americans' in China have been returned, the spokesperson added. Biden and his aides have raised the issue of the three Americans with Beijing repeatedly, according to U.S. officials. In his last in-person meeting on the sidelines of the annual Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in Peru earlier this month, Biden also spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping to press for their return. China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning said Thursday three Chinese nationals 'wrongfully imprisoned' by the United States had been returned to China. Mark Swidan had been held since 2012 and received the death sentence in 2019. He maintained his innocence. John Leung was sentenced last year to life in prison. A U.S. citizen who also holds permanent residency in Hong Kong, he was detained on April 15, 2021, by the local bureau of China’s counterintelligence agency in the southeastern city of Suzhou, according to The Associated Press. Kai Li, a naturalized U.S. citizen who owned an export business and worked in New York, was arrested after flying into Shanghai in September 2016. He was placed under surveillance, interrogated without a lawyer and accused of providing state secrets to the FBI. In 2018, he was sentenced to 10 years in prison for espionage, a charge that he has denied. The release comes just two months after China freed a Christian pastor from California, David Lin, who had been held since 2006. He was convicted of contract fraud. Revised travel warning On Wednesday, the State Department lowered its travel warning for China to 'reflect a shift to Level 2,' according to the department’s website. The current advisory warns travelers, 'Exercise increased caution when traveling to Mainland China due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws, including in relation to exit bans.' The alert had previously been at Level 3, telling Americans they should 'reconsider travel' to China in part because of the 'risk of wrongful detention' of Americans. VOA Senior White House Correspondent Patsy Widakuswara contributed to this report. Information from The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Press was also used in this report.	https://www.voanews.com/a/wrongfully-detained-americans-return-from-china/7879917.html	2024-11-28T00:57:11-08:00	
India's parliament suspended temporarily after row over allegations against Adani group	NEW DELHI — Both houses of Indian parliament were suspended temporarily on Thursday within minutes of opening as opposition lawmakers disrupted proceedings for the third day this week seeking a discussion on allegations against the Adani Group. U.S. authorities have accused Gautam Adani, his nephew Sagar Adani and managing director of Adani Green, Vneet S. Jaain, of being part of a scheme to pay bribes of $265 million to secure Indian solar power supply contracts, and misleading U.S. investors during fund raises there. 'We want a discussion on this in parliament. It is going to be the third day that we are demanding a reply from the prime minister' on the Adani issue, Manickam Tagore, a lawmaker from the main opposition Congress party, which has been leading the protests against the business group, told news agency ANI. Many of India's opposition parties accuse Prime Minister Narendra Modi and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) of favoring Adani and blocking investigations against him in India, accusations both have denied. Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, who has been a vocal critic of Adani, said Gautam Adani, 62, should be arrested. While the government has not made any comment on the indictment, Modi's BJP has said it had no reason to defend Adani, adding that the party was not against industrialists and considered them partners in nation-building efforts. 'Let him defend himself,' BJP spokesperson Gopal Krishna Agarwal said on Tuesday, adding that the law would take its course.	https://www.voanews.com/a/india-s-parliament-suspended-temporarily-after-row-over-allegations-against-adani-group/7879890.html	2024-11-27T23:43:59-08:00	
Taiwan holds air defense drill ahead of president's Pacific trip	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Taiwan's military held an early morning air defense drill on Thursday to test its response and engagement procedures, ahead of a trip by President Lai Ching-te at the end of the week to the Pacific that will include U.S. stopovers. China is likely to launch military drills in the coming days near Taiwan, using Lai's upcoming trip to the Pacific and scheduled U.S. transit as a pretext, according to assessments by Taiwan and regional security officials. China claims democratically governed Taiwan as its own territory and says Lai is a 'separatist.' Lai says only Taiwan's people can decide their future and has repeatedly offered talks with Beijing that have been rebuffed. Taiwan's air force command said in a statement that made no mention of Lai's overseas trip that for a two-hour period starting from 5 a.m. (2100 GMT Wednesday) aircraft, ships and missile systems were involved in an 'overall air defense battle plan exercise.' The drill was to 'strengthen the overall effectiveness of air defense operations and to test the response and engagement procedures of the air defense forces,' it added. 'In the face of changes in the enemy situation, we will continue to enhance defense resilience through various practical training to anticipate potential threats and challenges and ensure air defense security,' the command said. The defense ministry told Reuters separately that it was a regular drill carried out quarterly. Reuters correspondents in the northern Taipei suburbs reported seeing and hearing fighter jets in the skies as dawn broke. China has carried out two rounds of major war games around Taiwan so far this year, and on a daily basis flies aircraft and sends ships into the skies and waters around Taiwan. Taiwan has also complained of Chinese balloons flying near the island in what the government says is a pattern of harassment by Beijing. On Thursday, the ministry said the previous day it had spotted two Chinese balloons flying out at sea to the north of Taiwan, at distances of 111 kilometers and 163 kilometers from the port city of Keelung. Lai will leave on Saturday. A formal announcement of his U.S. stopovers could come as soon as Friday, according to sources. Late Wednesday, the presidential office said that if China were to use Lai's trip as an excuse to launch military exercises, 'it would be a blatant provocation of the status quo of peace and stability in the region.' The same day, China's government said such transit stops were 'essentially provocative acts that violate the one-China principle.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-holds-air-defense-drill-ahead-of-president-s-pacific-trip/7879882.html	2024-11-27T23:16:46-08:00	
In the Philippines, some progress for media rights, but risks remain	BANGKOK — Once the country with the worst record for securing justice in journalist killings, the Philippines is improving, say some experts. But more work is needed to protect reporters. When he assumed the presidency in 2022, Ferdinand Marcos Jr. pledged to 'support and protect the rights of the media.' In October 2022, he said, 'The nation counts on media in improving access to information and increasing awareness on issues that affect our country and the world.' In the past year, media analysts have seen some improvement. The suspected mastermind in a journalist killing from more than a decade ago was arrested; a court reversed an order forcing the media website Rappler to close; and earlier this month, Marcos appointed former journalist Joe Torres Jr. as head of the Presidential Task Force on Media Security. But outside the capital, community and radio journalists are at risk of threat or attack, experts say. Beh Lih Yi, head coordinator of the Asia program at the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, said the media group was encouraged by some 'positive developments' but believes the Marcos government could do more. 'Although the president has repeatedly vowed support for a free press, he has not backed up this change in tone with concrete action and reforms to create a more liberal and safe media climate,' she told VOA via email. 'Journalists in the Philippines still routinely face harassment, legal threats, arbitrary detention and even murder in retaliation for their work,' she said. The Philippines Presidential Office has not responded to VOA’s email requesting comment. Carlos Conde, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch and a former journalist, sees some signs of optimism under Marcos. One of the biggest changes from conditions under his predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, is that the Marcos administration is 'not confrontational at all in its public pronouncements about media and journalists,' Conde told VOA. 'That's kind of a major relief, and that's where the optimism comes from. And so, in that sense, it has improved,' he said. Under Duterte’s presidency from 2016 to 2022, he vilified journalists who were critical of his policies. Media were labeled fake news, and watchdogs documented dozens of incidents of attacks and threats against the press. At least 18 journalists were killed during his six-year presidency, according to CPJ data. Another issue for the country’s journalists is so-called 'red-tagging,' in which media and activists are accused — without evidence — by political figures, state security and others of being terrorists or communists. Those targeted are often people critical of government or political party policies. And being red tagged makes them a more prominent target for threats, harassment and violence, experts say. A report by Amnesty in October found the practice still happening under the new administration. Amnesty said the tactic has been used to target human rights activists, students and student journalists. Marcos has denied the government is involved in red tagging and said the National Task Force to End Local Communist Armed Conflict — an agency alleged to be involved in the red-tagging operations — will not be closed. But Conde hopes red tagging will stop under Torres. He will head the Presidential Task Force on Media Security, a government agency set up to protect media workers and promote press freedom. When he was a journalist, Torres wrote for outlets including The Manila Times and spoke with Conde on a YouTube podcast earlier this month about red tagging. '[Torres] made a promise that the office will no longer be red-tagging journalists or accusing them of having communist links and things like that. So, that is definitely something,' Conde told VOA. Some progress too has been made in the cases of journalists killed for their work. In September, former Palawan Governor Joel T. Reyes surrendered to authorities over the killing of environmental journalist Gerry Ortega, who was shot and killed in 2011. At the time, he was investigating apparent corruption involving Reyes, according to media watchdog Reporters Without Borders. Reyes is the suspected mastermind. The trial, scheduled to start in November, has been welcomed by media groups. 'The Philippines persistently fares poorly in CPJ's Global Impunity Index, an annual ranking which lists countries where killers of journalists go free,' CPJ’s Beh said via email. The Philippines ranks ninth in the impunity index. With Ortega, said Beh, 'his family is still waiting for full justice more than 13 years later.' While some improvements are seen in the capital, Jonathan de Santos, chair of the National Union of Journalists of the Philippines, said that for radio and community journalists, the risks are high. 'There is a perception that the press freedom situation has improved, and maybe it has in Metro Manila, but journalists in the regions, especially those from community and alternative media, are still under threat,' he told VOA. 'Apart from the safety and security aspects, radio journalists have also historically not been paid well, which is an added risk for them. Radio is also where a lot of hard-hitting commentary is done, which puts radio journalists at risk of retaliation,' he added. In October, radio journalist Maria Vilma Rodriguez was shot and killed near her home in Zamboanga City on Mindanao island. Police say the suspect was a relative of Rodriguez who had a land dispute with the 56-year-old. The Philippines ranks 134 out of 180 countries on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 shows the best media environment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/in-the-philippines-some-progress-for-media-rights-but-risks-remain/7879874.html	2024-11-27T22:59:59-08:00	
Thousands left queuing to vote in Namibia after scheduled polls close	WINDHOEK, NAMIBIA — Logistical issues on Wednesday left thousands of Namibians waiting in queues to vote in pivotal presidential and legislative elections, some for up to 12 hours, with polling stations staying open hours later than planned. The vote could usher in the desert nation's first woman leader even as her party, the ruling South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) faces the strongest challenge yet to its 34-year grip on power. Some voters told AFP they queued all day, blaming technical problems that included issues with voter identification tablets and insufficient ballot papers. 'It's absolutely disappointing,' said Reagan Cooper, a 43-year-old farmer among the hundred or so voters outside the town hall polling station in the capital, Windhoek. 'The voters have turned out, but the electoral commission has failed us,' Cooper told AFP. In the face of criticism from all the political parties, including SWAPO, the Electoral Commission of Namibia extended voting hours for 'no specified time,' according to Windhoek region ECN head Rakondjerua Kavari. Voting was halted for an hour at the Windhoek town hall site due to a lack of ballots, with applause welcoming the delivery of more waking sleepy, seated voters around 11:30 p.m. The last voter there cast his ballot more than four hours after the scheduled closing time -- 9 p.m. (1900 GMT) -- and vote counting then began almost immediately. According to Namibia's electoral law, those in queues before polls are scheduled to close should be allowed to vote. Petrus Shaama, chief officer of the ECN, said it was obligated to ensure voters could cast a ballot. But the main opposition party, the Independent Patriots for Change (IPC), blamed the ECN for the long lines and cried foul play. 'We have reason to believe that the ECN is deliberately suppressing voters and deliberately trying to frustrate voters from casting their vote,' said Christine Aochamus of the IPC. Armed with folding chairs and umbrellas to cope with the slow-moving lines and blazing sun, many Namibians spent half the day waiting to vote. At one polling station inside the University of Science and Technology in Windhoek, hundreds of people were still in line at 9:00 pm despite some having arrived at 6 a.m., an hour before polls opened. Polling site managers told AFP that problems with tablets used to check voters' identities using fingerprints included untimely updates, overheating and dead batteries. Unemployment SWAPO's candidate and current vice president, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, was one of the first to vote and called on Namibians 'to come out in their numbers.' An estimated 1.5 million people in the sparsely populated nation were registered to vote. SWAPO has governed since leading mineral-rich Namibia to independence from South Africa in 1990 but complaints about unemployment and enduring inequalities could force Nandi-Ndaitwah into an unprecedented second round. IPC leader Panduleni Itula, a former dentist and lawyer, said Wednesday he was optimistic he could 'unseat the revolutionary movement.' Itula, 67, took 29% of votes in the 2019 elections, losing to SWAPO leader Hage Geingob with 56%. It was a remarkable performance considering Geingob, who died in February, had won almost 87% five years before that. Namibia is a major uranium and diamond exporter but not many of its nearly 3 million people have benefitted from that wealth. 'There's a lot of mining activity that goes on in the country, but it doesn't really translate into improved infrastructure, job opportunities,' said independent political analyst Marisa Lourenco, based in Johannesburg. 'That's where a lot of the frustration is coming from, (especially) the youth,' she said. Unemployment among 15- to 34-year-olds is estimated at 46%, according to the latest figures from 2018, almost triple the national average. First-time voter and environmental health student Sophia Varela, 24, told AFP she was 'hoping for change' and 'jobs for the youth.' Second round For the first time in Namibia's recent history, analysts say a second voting round is a somewhat realistic option. That would take place within 60 days of the announcement of the first round of results due by Saturday. 'The outcome will be tight,' said self-employed Hendry Amupanda, 32, who queued since 9 p.m. the night before to cast his ballot. 'I want the country to get better and people to get jobs,' said Amupanda, wearing slippers and equipped with a chair, blanket and snacks. Marvyn Pescha, a self-employed consultant, said his father was part of SWAPO's liberation struggle and he was not going to abandon the party. 'But I want SWAPO to be challenged for better policies. Some opportunistic leaders have tarnished the reputation of the party, they misuse it for self-enrichment,' the 50-year-old said. While lauded for leading Namibia to independence, SWAPO is nervous about its standing after other liberation-era movements in the region have lost favor with young voters. In the past six months, South Africa's African National Congress lost its parliamentary majority and the Botswana Democratic Party was ousted after almost six decades in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/thousands-left-queuing-to-vote-in-namibia-after-scheduled-polls-close/7879872.html	2024-11-27T22:32:47-08:00	
Biggest November snowstorm in 52 years hits Seoul, grounds flights	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — The biggest November snowstorm to hit South Korea's capital in more than a half century blanketed the capital Wednesday, grounding hundreds of flights, disrupting commuter traffic and leaving at least two dead. South Korea's weather agency said 20 to 26 centimeters of snow fell in northern areas of Seoul and nearby areas. The agency said it was the heaviest snowstorm Seoul has experienced in November in 52 years. A storm on November 28, 1972, dumped 12 centimeters. South Korea's Yonhap news agency said one person died and four others were injured in a five-vehicle accident in the eastern town of Hongcheon. In the town of Yangju, a tent-type garage collapsed and killed a person who was removing snow, according to South Korea's Ministry of the Interior and Safety. The snow caused temporary power outages at about 230 homes in the city of Gwangju, near Seoul, according to the Gyeonggi provincial government. The storm blanketed much of the country, with the central, eastern and southwestern regions recording about 10 to 28 centimeters of cover. At least 317 flights were canceled or delayed at airports nationwide, while authorities ordered around 90 ferries to remain at port. They also shut down hundreds of hiking trails. Icy road conditions slowed down the morning commute in Seoul and led to massive crowds at subways, causing delays. Emergency workers across the country responded to fallen trees, road signs and other safety risks. Officials at the Safety Ministry said they couldn't confirm any school closures as of Wednesday afternoon. Visitors dressed in traditional hanbok garb were busy taking photographs at Seoul's snow-covered medieval palaces while snowmen popped up in playgrounds and schoolyards across the country. The weather agency said snow will continue in most parts of the country until noon Thursday. President Yoon Suk Yeol instructed the safety and transport ministries to mobilize all available relevant personnel and equipment to prevent traffic and other accidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biggest-november-snowstorm-in-52-years-hits-seoul-grounds-flights/7879866.html	2024-11-27T22:18:51-08:00	
Iran to hold nuclear talks with 3 European powers	Tehran, Iran — Iran is set to meet on Friday with France, Germany and the United Kingdom for talks on its nuclear program after the three governments joined with the United States to have Tehran censured by the U.N. atomic watchdog. Last week's chiding prompted a defiant response from Tehran, but its officials have since signaled willingness to engage with other parties ahead of the return of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, whose last administration pursued a policy of 'maximum pressure' against the Islamic republic. Iranian diplomat Majid Takht-Ravanchi, who serves as the political deputy to Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, is scheduled to represent Iran in the talks on Friday. He will meet beforehand with Enrique Mora, deputy secretary general of the EU's foreign affairs arm, according to the IRNA state news agency. Last week, the 35-nation board of governors of the UN's International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) adopted a resolution condemning Iran for its lack of cooperation on nuclear issues. The resolution was brought by France, Germany, the United Kingdom and the United States, and was actively opposed by Tehran. In response, Iran announced the launch of 'new advanced centrifuges' designed to increase its stockpile of enriched uranium. Tehran's willingness to sit down with the three European countries so soon after the censure comes just weeks before Trump is set to return to the White House in January. During his first term, Trump focused on imposing heavy sanctions on Iran following the United States' unilateral withdrawal from a landmark 2015 nuclear deal three years after it was established. That agreement between Tehran and major powers aimed to give Iran relief from crippling Western sanctions in exchange for limiting its nuclear program to prevent it from developing a nuclear weapon. In retaliation for the U.S. withdrawal, Tehran has reduced its compliance with the deal, raising its uranium enrichment levels to 60% -- close to the 90% required for a nuclear bomb. Tehran has consistently denied any intentions of pursuing nuclear weapons. For Tehran, the goal of the talks on Friday is to avoid a 'double disaster' scenario, in which it would face renewed pressures from both Trump and European nations, according to political analyst Mostafa Shirmohammadi. He noted that Iran's support among European nations had been eroded by allegations it offered military assistance for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Iran has denied these accusations and hopes to mend relations with Europe, while also maintaining a firm stance. 'Legal obligations' The IAEA's censure resolution urged Iran to 'fulfil its legal obligations' under the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) ratified in 1970, which requires member states to declare and maintain their nuclear materials under IAEA supervision. In response, Foreign Minister Araghchi, who was instrumental in the nuclear negotiations in 2015, said Iran was commissioning 'several thousand advanced centrifuges.' The head of Atomic Energy Organization of Iran, Mohammad Eslami, said Wednesday that they had begun inserting gas into the centrifuges. Centrifuges work by rapidly spinning uranium gas to increase the proportion of the fissile isotope U-235. Iran insists on its right to nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, but according to the IAEA, it is the only non-nuclear-weapon state enriching uranium to 60%. Under the 2015 accord -- which will expire in October 2025 -- Iran's enrichment was capped at 3.67%. Supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who has the final authority in Iran's decision-making, has issued a religious decree, or fatwa, prohibiting the use of atomic weapons. Iran's nuclear program dates back to the late 1950s when the United States, then an ally, signed a civil cooperation agreement with Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-to-hold-nuclear-talks-with-3-european-powers/7879864.html	2024-11-27T22:03:32-08:00	
Former US diplomat discusses Trump’s Africa policy and more	WASHINGTON — As President-elect Donald Trump prepares for his second term as president of the United States, questions arise about what this means for U.S.-Africa relations. In this interview with VOA English to Africa’s Paul Ndiho, Tibor Nagy, the former Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs, shares insights into the administration's past approach. Nagy shares his perspective on U.S. competition with China and Russia, trade policies, including the extension of the African Growth and Opportunity Act, commonly known as AGOA, which provides eligible sub-Saharan African countries with duty-free access to U.S. markets and the ongoing crises in the Sahel and other regions on the continent. This interview, which aired on VOA’s Africa 54 TV program on November 27, from VOA headquarters in Washington, D.C., has been edited for clarity and brevity. Paul Ndiho: As the former top diplomat for African affairs, what should we expect when it comes to President-elect Donald Trump’s second term for Africa? Tibor Nagy: I’m very optimistic. I don’t think people should worry about the slogan 'America First' because that doesn’t mean 'America only.' There are many areas where interests between the U.S. and Africa intersect. China, we very much see as a long-term existential threat, and so I think we’ll be a little bit more honest in saying that part of our Africa relations is about China. Then there’s the very important issue of critical minerals. Why should China monopolize all the critical minerals in Africa when it would do much better if Western, i.e., American companies were also involved? So, I think Africans should be optimistic — I think they’ll have a lot more deals and a lot fewer lectures. VOA: Many argue that China and Russia have an edge over the U.S. in Africa. What can the incoming Trump administration do better to compete with those two countries? Nagy: I think you would agree that what Africans want more than anything else, especially young Africans, and everyone knows that there are millions and millions and millions of young Africans, are jobs. Frankly, yes, China has done an awful lot of infrastructure projects, but how many jobs did the African young people get out of that? I think the truth is that American and Western types of investments, do lead to the kind of jobs that young Africans are looking for. And I think that will be a successful foreign policy. And I think that that will be the true kind of win-win for both sides. VOA: President-elect Trump is proposing a 10% tariff on all goods coming into the United States, obviously with AGOA, Africans are supposed to bring goods to the United States free of tariffs. What should we expect? Nagy: What we should expect is to see what happens, aside from during campaigns, a lot of things are said, and then what the actual policy is might be a little bit different. I mean, AGOA is a law passed by Congress and I’m sure that the United States of America will comply with that law. And as you also well know that law will be going out soon and everybody’s kind of looking forward and wondering what kind of a new AGOA there will be. VOA: How about the issue of the Sahel? There is a crisis in the Sahel. There are wars in Sudan, in the Democratic Republic of Congo. How can the incoming Trump administration do better on this front? Nagy: The 'three Cs' — crises, conflicts, and coups — have been really horrible. Again, here, U.S. engagement needs to be different. Lecturing, for example, the military government in Niger, I think had a lot to do with us being kicked out of some very valuable air bases that where we had agreements with and the whole issue of coups, I think it’s important for the United States to look at coups individually. When a coup happens and we say it’s a coup, then we have to cut certain ties and engagements. What we do is we call some coups, coups, and other coups, not coups, as it happened, for example, in Gabon, we didn’t call it a coup. We just need to be a little bit more honest and say we really need to be much more flexible in how we engage with those governments because often the military government really needs engagement more to kind of help them see the way forward, especially those that are very popular with the people when they happen. VOA: What would you do differently if you got your old job back? Nagy: I’m not looking to get my old job back because being Assistant Secretary once — is enough. I would look differently to be a little bit less hypocritical, to drop the megaphone, to engage with African governments where they are, not where we want them to be, and to see the world as it is and especially put so much more energy into Sudan, Ethiopia, Sahel, those kinds of conflicts. This Q&A originated in VOA’s English to Africa Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/former-us-diplomat-discusses-trump-s-africa-policy-and-more/7879852.html	2024-11-27T20:37:06-08:00	
Zimbabwe court frees opposition leader, followers after suspending their sentences	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — A Zimbabwe court late Wednesday sentenced the interim leader of the country's main opposition party to two years in jail - then suspended his sentence and the sentences of 34 of his supporters. Magistrate Collet Ncube sentenced Citizens Coalition for Change leader Jameson Timba and supporter Jaison Kautsa to two years imprisonment, while the other 33 opposition party members got lesser sentences for participating in an unlawful gathering on June 16. All were set to be released from prison. They were among the first of about 160 opposition figures and activists to be rounded up before a July summit of the 16-nation Southern African Development Community in Harare. The charges were gathering with the intent to promote violence, breaches of peace or bigotry. A statement from the National Prosecuting Authority confirmed the sentences and went on to say they were 'wholly suspended for five years on condition that the accused do not commit an offense involving unlawful gathering with intent to promote public violence for which they will be sentenced to imprisonment without the option of a fine.' Takunda Jacob from Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights – which has been representing group members – told reporters waiting outside the court that one of his clients from the group would remain in custody while she is treated for wounds suffered during the arrest. He said it will be determined next month if the woman, who has a broken leg, is fit to stand trial. Jacob said she could be in custody until December 14. He said he was not pleased about the judgment. 'We await further instructions from clients, if they wish that we appeal against the judgment, we'll proudly do so because we are not with judgment,' Jacob said. That view is shared by Daniel Molokele, a human rights lawyer and an opposition legislator, who is urging that democratic space and tolerance be provided for the opposition. 'It is indeed a very sad day, because what we have are people who are expressing their political rights, and they get criminalized,' Molokele said. 'I pray and hope that they will appeal, against the sentence, against the conviction. As things stand, we have criminalized the political space, we have criminalized the democratic space, there is no freedom in Zimbabwe.' Student activist Makomborero Haruzivishe said the conviction of former senator Timba shows a lack of democracy in Zimbabwe. 'It's a conviction on Zimbabwe’s collective political conscience, it's a conviction of Zimbabwe’s justice system. Senator Timba was arrested for offering young people his private residence, home, a place to come and commemorate the Day of the African Child,' Haruzivishe said. 'The Day of the African Child came about when the apartheid, colonial regime in South Africa, massacred multitudes of young people, school-going children, African youths, South African youths.' Zimbabwe’s information minister Jenfan Muswere could not be reached for comment on Wednesday. Initially police arrested about 100 opposition activists at Timba’s home in June while commemorating the Day of the African Child, and some were released for reasons that remain unclear. President Emmerson Mnangagwa's ZANU-PF party has been in power since independence in 1980 and is frequently accused of suppressing any dissent. Since coming to power in 2017, however, Mnangagwa has consistently said that he respects human rights.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zimbabwe-court-frees-opposition-leader-followers-after-suspending-their-sentences/7879827.html	2024-11-27T20:30:21-08:00	
HIV activist to use Charlize Theron's Instagram for a day	Geneva, Switzerland — A young South African activist living with HIV will take over Oscar-winning actress Charlize Theron's Instagram account on World AIDS Day, the United Nations said Thursday. Ibanomonde Ngema, a 21-year-old activist, will be given the reins to the South African-born actress's global account @charlizeafrica, with some 7.6 million followers, on December 1, UNAIDS said in a statement. The takeover by Ngema, who was born with HIV and has dedicated her advocacy work to dispelling myths and reducing stigma around HIV, will aim to bring awareness to the first-hand experiences of young people living with HIV, it said. Theron, a so-called UN Messenger of Peace who has long advocated for tackling the systemic inequalities that drive HIV infections among young women and girls, insisted in the statement that 'ending AIDS is within reach.' But, she warned, 'only if we completely dismantle harmful patterns of stigma and discrimination through laws, policies, and practices that protect people living with HIV.' Theron won a best actress Oscar for her lead role in the 2004 film 'Monster' and has more recently starred in pictures such as 'Mad Max: Fury Road.' 'I have always loved watching Charlize Theron on the big screen and have long been inspired by her using her influence to help people around the world, especially in our home country of South Africa,' Ngema said in the statement. The announcement came after UNAIDS this week released a new report that showed how rights violations exacerbate the vulnerability of women and girls to HIV. Last year, women and girls accounted for 62% of all new HIV infections in sub-Saharan Africa, UNAIDS said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hiv-activist-to-use-charlize-theron-s-instagram-for-a-day/7879835.html	2024-11-27T18:58:52-08:00	
Trump seeks to have civil fraud ruling quashed	NEW YORK — Donald Trump has sought to have a civil judgment against him for fraud and a $464 million penalty set aside 'for the greater good of the country' as he prepares to return to power. Trump's lawyers filed a letter Tuesday with New York attorney general Letitia James, who brought the proceeding against the president-elect for manipulating his assets when applying for loans and insurances. Judge Arthur Engoron ruled against Trump in February, going on to order the mogul-turned-politician pay $464 million, including interest, while his sons Eric and Don Jr. were told to hand over more than $4 million each. Trump subsequently sought to challenge the civil ruling as well as the scale and terms of the penalty, which has continued to accrue interest while he appeals. 'We write to request that you completely dismiss the above-referenced case against President Donald J. Trump, his family, and his businesses, and stipulate to vacate the Judgment and dismiss all claims with prejudice,' said the letter from attorney John Sauer, Trump's nominee for solicitor general. 'In the aftermath of his historic election victory, President Trump has called for our Nation's partisan strife to end, and for the contending factions to join forces for the greater good of the country. 'This call for unity extends to the legal onslaught against him.' In the letter, reported by U.S. media, Sauer pointed to recent moves to end or suspend proceedings in several of the criminal cases that Trump had faced. 'This case warrants the same treatment. As detailed in our appellate briefing, this action exceeds the New York Attorney General's authority under Executive Law ... the dismissal of the case would restore (her) power to its more legitimate scope,' the letter said. Sauer suggested that if James does not dismiss the case outright, he might seek to argue that the case is unconstitutional, as it interferes with Trump's role as president. Sauer did not respond to an AFP request for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-seeks-to-have-civil-fraud-ruling-quashed/7879830.html	2024-11-27T18:55:39-08:00	
New missile plan by US-Japan eyes Chinese invasion of Taiwan	WASHINGTON — A U.S. plan to deploy sophisticated missiles on a Japanese island chain close to Taiwan is prompting angry responses from both China and its close ally Russia. The United States is drawing up a joint military plan with Japan to deploy High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and other weapons to Japan’s Nansei islands, according to a Sunday report by Kyodo News, which cited unnamed sources. The plan is expected to be completed by December. The island chain stretches from Japan’s main islands to within 200 kilometers of Taiwan and includes Okinawa,which has a major U.S. military presence. The U.S. could use the missiles to defend Taiwan in case of a Chinese invasion of the self-ruled island, which Beijing claims as a renegade province. The plan, the first joint operation by the U.S. and Japan to prepare for a war between Taiwan and China, will involve sending a U.S. Marine Corps regiment that possesses HIMARS and setting up temporary bases on the Nansai islands to station them, said Kyodo. The Japan Self-Defense Forces would be expected to provide logistic support, including fuel and ammunition. A Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson criticized the reported plan at a press conference on Monday, saying, 'China opposes relevant countries using the Taiwan question as an excuse to strengthen military deployment in the region, heighten tensions and confrontation, and disturb regional peace and stability.' Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova responded with a stronger statement, warning that her country would respond to the deployment with 'necessary and proportionate steps' to strengthen its defense capabilities, according to the Russian news agency Tass on Wednesday. 'We have repeatedly warned the Japanese side that if, as a result of such cooperation, U.S. medium-range missiles emerge on its territory, this will pose a real threat to the security of our country,' Zakharova said. Tass also quoted Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov urging Washington to reconsider the deployment of missiles to the Asia-Pacific. He warned that Moscow will not rule out stationing shorter- and intermediate-range missiles in Asia in response to the U.S. deployment. Earlier in November, Russian President Vladimir Putin said China is Russia’s ally and 'Taiwan is part of China,' and that China conducting wargames near the island is 'a completely reasonable policy' while Taipei is escalating tensions. While Russia and China have no formal military treaty, Putin and Chinese leader Xi Jinping have spoken of having a 'no limits' partnership, and the United States accuses China of supporting Russia’s war efforts against Ukraine. U.S. Secretary Antony Blinken said at a press conference held at the G7 meeting in Italy on Tuesday that China’s support for Russia’s defense industry is 'allowing Russia to continue the aggression against Ukraine.' US-Japan missile plan Despite Moscow’s alarming rhetoric, analysts say the deployment of HIMARS to the region is primarily aimed at protecting Taiwan from Chinese warships. 'The most important purpose of HIMARS' would be 'an anti-ship capability' and to 'protect the island and base itself,' said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Navy Adm. Samuel Paparo, commander of the U.S. Indo-Pacific Command, said last week at a forum held by the Brookings Institution that China this past summer conducted its largest rehearsal to date for an invasion of Taiwan involving 152 vessels. He cautioned that the U.S. 'must be ready.' The Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) Navy possesses the world’s largest naval force with over 370 ships and submarines while the U.S. has about 290 vessels. Eye on Chinese invasion Timothy Heath, senior international defense researcher at the RAND Corp., said HIMARS on the Nansei islands 'could help sink amphibious landing ships as well as destroyers and other PLA Navy ships that might approach the island from the north' and also 'target concentrations of PLA troops on beaches near Taipei.' Heath continued, 'The fielding of these weapons systems shows that the U.S. and its allies are learning lessons from the Ukraine theater, where HIMARS have been effectively deployed against Russia.' The U.S. is also planning to deploy the Multi-Domain Task Force’s (MDTS) long-range firing units to the Philippines, said Kyodo news on Sunday. The MDTS uses HIMARS as long-range firing units. 'The deployment of HIMARS to Nansei islands and long-range firing units to the Philippines will impose greater costs on China,' said Ryo Hinata-Yamaguchi, an associate professor at Tokyo International University Institute for International Strategy and a nonresident senior fellow with the Atlantic Council’s Indo-Pacific Security Initiative. 'Both locations are vital to deter China’s aggressive moves in not only the Taiwan Strait and East China Seas, but also Beijing’s ambitions in the Pacific. Still, one can expect China to do more to outdo such measures by enhancing their military readiness and conducting more assertive activities in the coming years,' he said. Taiwan and the Philippines, as well as Japan and Indonesia, make up what China calls the first island chain potentially blocking its military access to the Pacific. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin concluded a nine-day trip to the Indo-Pacific on Monday after a series of meetings with the defense heads of countries in the region, including Japan, the Philippines, Australia and South Korea. At the meetings, Japan agreed to increase its participation in annual trilateral amphibious training with the U.S. and Australia. The Philippines agreed to share military intelligence by signing a General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with the U.S.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-missile-plan-by-us-japan-eyes-chinese-invasion-of-taiwan-/7879818.html	2024-11-27T18:07:39-08:00	
Mexico, Canada warn Trump against raising tariffs	MEXICO CITY — Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said on Wednesday that Mexico would retaliate if U.S. President-elect Donald Trump followed through with his proposed 25% across-the-board tariff, a move her government warned could kill 400,000 U.S. jobs and drive up prices for U.S. consumers. 'If there are U.S. tariffs, Mexico would also raise tariffs,' Sheinbaum said during a news conference, in her clearest statement yet that the country was preparing possible retaliatory trade measures against its top trade partner. Mexican Economy Minister Marcelo Ebrard, speaking alongside Sheinbaum, called for more regional cooperation and integration instead of a war of retaliatory import taxes. 'It's a shot in the foot,' Ebrard said of Trump's proposed tariffs, which appear to violate the USMCA trade deal between Mexico, Canada and the U.S. Ebrard warned the tariffs would lead to massive U.S. job losses, lower growth, and hit U.S. companies producing in Mexico by effectively doubling the taxes they paid. 'The impact on companies is huge,' he said. The proposed tariffs would hit the automotive sector's top cross-border exporters especially hard, Ebrard added, namely Ford, General Motors and Stellantis. Mexico's automotive industry is the country's most important manufacturing sector, exporting predominantly to the United States. It represents nearly 25% of all North American vehicle production. Analysts at Barclays said they estimate the proposed tariffs 'could wipe out effectively all profits' from the Detroit Three automakers. Gas prices Canada is also looking at a coordinated response with the federal government and the premiers of the 10 provinces agreeing to work in a united way against a threat by Trump, Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland said Wednesday. One area affected by the proposed tariffs is Canada’s oil sector. Even as record oil output has made the U.S. the world's largest producer in recent years, more than a fifth of the oil processed by U.S. refiners is imported from Canada. In the landlocked U.S. Midwest, where refineries process 70% of the more than 4 million barrels per day of Canadian crude imports, consumers could see pump prices jump by 30 cents per gallon or more, or about 10%, based on current prices, GasBuddy analyst Patrick De Haan said. Migration and the border Sheinbaum and Trump spoke by phone later on Wednesday, the Mexican president said on social media platform X, adding the two discussed 'strengthening collaboration on security issues' and that the conversation was 'excellent.' In a post on his Truth Social platform, Trump said Sheinbaum 'agreed to stop migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border.' He described the conversation as 'very productive.' Sheinbaum's office did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Trump has previously said the tariffs would remain in effect until the flow of drugs -- particularly fentanyl -- and migrants into the U.S. was controlled. Sheinbaum added migrant caravans are no longer arriving at the U.S.-Mexico border 'because they are attended to' in Mexico. A caravan of several thousand migrants had been heading through southern Mexico but numbers have dwindled in recent days.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mexico-canada-warn-trump-against-raising-tariffs/7879812.html	2024-11-27T18:01:17-08:00	
Moldova says end of Russian gas for Transdniestria 'very realistic' scenario	CHISINAU, MOLDOVA — The termination of Russian gas supplies to Moldova's breakaway region of Transdniestria after January 1, 2025, is a 'very realistic' scenario, Energy Minister Victor Parlicov said on Wednesday after talks with Russia's Gazprom. Parliсov spoke with the head of Gazprom on Monday to discuss alternate routes to supply Transdniestria if transit through Ukraine stops. The current gas-transit agreement between Ukraine and Russia ends on December 31 and Ukraine has said it will not extend it. The unrecognized, Russian-backed Transdniestria region depends heavily on Russian natural gas supplied via Ukraine. Parliсov told a press conference in Chisinau that Gazprom was ready to supply gas to Transdniestria via the current route, but that it was up to Moldova and Ukraine to agree on transit. 'From discussions with my Ukrainian colleagues, I understand that if there is a decision to continue transit, it may be taken at the last moment,' Parlicov said. Moldova receives about 2 billion cubic meters of gas per year from Russia through Ukraine and since 2022, Transdniestria and Chisinau have agreed that all Russian gas received by Moldova will go to the breakaway region. Transdniestria has a large power plant fueled by Russian gas and Chisinau, in turn, buys electricity from the region at a relatively low fixed price. Parlicov, speaking later on Moldovan TV8 television, said he felt during his talks in St. Petersburg that Russia was less forthright in its commitment to supporting Transdniestria, which it has backed since the collapse of Soviet rule in the 1990s. 'This is already not a taboo subject like it was before,' he said. As an example, he said, Transdniestria's steel mill, a key exporter, had been left virtually unable to operate after a Russian attack on a power substation in southern Ukraine. He acknowledged that if gas supplies were cut to Transdniestria, the region would need financial help to survive and avoid a humanitarian catastrophe. Possible alternative Moldova has said that if Ukraine ends the transit of Russian gas, an alternative for Transdniestria could be gas supplied by the TurkStream pipeline to Turkey and then through Bulgaria and Romania. However, Parlicov told the briefing that Gazprom in the talks had linked continued deliveries via alternate routes to its demands that Moldova pay a debt on past supplies, which according to Russian calculations stands at $709 million. Moldova has said its debt is $8.6 million. 'We believe that it's incorrect to link the debt problems with supplies (to Transdniestria),' Parliсov said. He said that supplies via both Ukraine and alternative routes could stop on January 1 and then Chisinau would need international support to pay for gas from other sources. Gazprom has not commented on the meeting with Moldova's minister.	https://www.voanews.com/a/moldova-says-end-of-russian-gas-for-transdniestria-very-realistic-scenario/7879803.html	2024-11-27T17:58:43-08:00	
Microsoft faces antitrust investigation in US	The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has opened a broad antitrust investigation into Microsoft, including of its software licensing and cloud computing businesses, a source familiar with the matter said on Wednesday. The probe was approved by FTC Chair Lina Khan ahead of her likely departure in January. The election of Donald Trump as U.S. president, and the expectation he will appoint a fellow Republican with a softer approach toward business, leaves the outcome of the investigation up in the air. The FTC is examining allegations the software giant is potentially abusing its market power in productivity software by imposing punitive licensing terms to prevent customers from moving their data from its Azure cloud service to other competitive platforms, sources confirmed earlier this month. The FTC is also looking at practices related to cybersecurity and artificial intelligence products, the source said on Wednesday. Microsoft declined to comment on Wednesday. Competition complains about practices Competitors have criticized Microsoft's practices they say keep customers locked into its cloud offering, Azure. The FTC fielded such complaints last year as it examined the cloud computing market. NetChoice, a lobbying group that represents online companies such as Amazon and Google, which compete with Microsoft in cloud computing, criticized Microsoft's licensing policies, and its integration of AI tools into its Office and Outlook. 'Given that Microsoft is the world's largest software company, dominating in productivity and operating systems software, the scale and consequences of its licensing decisions are extraordinary,' the group said. Google in September complained to the European Commission about Microsoft's practices, saying it made customers pay a 400% mark-up to keep running Windows Server on rival cloud computing operators, and gave them later and more limited security updates. The FTC has demanded a broad range of detailed information from Microsoft, Bloomberg reported earlier on Wednesday. The agency had already claimed jurisdiction over probes into Microsoft and OpenAI over competition in artificial intelligence and started looking into Microsoft's $650 million deal with AI startup Inflection AI. Other companies faced accusations Microsoft has been somewhat of an exception to U.S. antitrust regulators' recent campaign against allegedly anticompetitive practices at Big Tech companies. Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Apple and Amazon.com Inc. have all been accused by the U.S. of unlawfully maintaining monopolies. Alphabet's Google is facing two lawsuits, including one where a judge found it unlawfully thwarted competition among online search engines. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella testified at Google's trial, saying the search giant was using exclusive deals with publishers to lock up content used to train artificial intelligence. It is unclear whether Trump will ease up on Big Tech, whose first administration launched several Big Tech probes. JD Vance, the incoming vice president, has expressed concern about the power the companies wield over public discourse. Still, Microsoft has benefited from Trump policies in the past. In 2019, the Pentagon awarded it a $10 billion cloud computing contract that Amazon had widely been expected to win. Amazon later alleged that Trump exerted improper pressure on military officials to steer the contract away from its Amazon Web Services unit.	https://www.voanews.com/a/microsoft-faces-antitrust-investigation-in-us/7879768.html	2024-11-27T16:41:35-08:00

Zambia's civil society rejects proposed NGO bill	LUSAKA, ZAMBIA — Civil society organizations in Zambia have raised concern over the government’s introduction of a bill that they say is restrictive and suffocates Zambia’s active non-governmental organization sector. The new bill, known as the NGO bill of 2024 and signed by Attorney General Mulilo Kabesha, proposes stringent controls over non-governmental organizations and continues to place them under the authority of a government-dominated registration board. The NGO bill further proposes a code of conduct and requires NGOs to submit annual information about their activities, accounts, funders and the personal wealth of officials. NGO officials could face fines or prison sentences of up to three years if they fail to submit their annual returns or conduct an audit. In addition, if implemented, the new law will compel NGOs to re-register every five years. NGOs concerned about independence At a recent news briefing in Lusaka, Zambian NGOs expressed concern the proposed bill, if enacted, would affect their independence and stifle their operations. Jacob Makambwe is the spokesperson for a consortium of 12 NGOs in Zambia, including Transparency International Zambia, Chapter One Foundation, Alliance for Community Action and the Center for Trade Policy and Development. 'We express our concern that the government has not conducted meaningful and widespread consultation on this matter,' said Makambwe. 'Having perused the NGO bill of 2024, we find its content largely focuses on control of NGOs. We therefore reject the NGO bill of 2024.' According to the Zambia Statistics Agency, there are more than 1,500 registered NGOs in Zambia. Currently, NGOs are regulated by the registrar of societies under the Ministry of Internal Security. Some NGOs have accused the Zambian authorities of following the same path as previous governments that sought to impose restrictions on the operations of NGOs since 2009. But President Hakainde Hichilema says his administration is committed to promoting fundamental freedoms. 'We are standing in for the poor' Lorraine Mwanza, is the chairperson of the Media Institute of Southern Africa, a non-governmental organization that focuses on media freedom. She told VOA she is not happy with the newly proposed law governing NGOs because she believes it infringes on fundamental freedoms. 'Why should NGOs be subjected to this?' she asked. 'We are just standing in for the voiceless, we are standing in for the poor.' Guess Nyirenda, a governance expert, urged the government to have wide consultations with NGOs as they are partners in development. 'Among some of the critical roles of NGOs include advocacy and policy influence. This is about amplifying and marginalizing voices by the NGOs,' said Nyirenda. According to media reports, Zambian authorities have made several attempts to enact restrictive laws for NGOs since 2009. NGOs opposed the 2009 law regulating their operations. Charity Musamba, a development expert and lecturer at the University of Zambia, said there is a need to strengthen regulations to ensure the accountability and financial transparency of NGOs. 'The provisions should ensure that civil society are requested to account for all the resources that come their way,' said Musamba. 'This is a proactive way of promoting democratic operations of institutions and it also gives a higher ground for civil society to continue demanding accountability from the ruling elite.' According to a 2024 Human Rights Watch report, President Hichilema promised to repeal the 2009 NGO law along with other restrictive laws when he was in opposition. The Zambian government’s Council of NGOs is responsible for coordinating the operations of NGOs in Zambia. Roy Mwilu is the chairperson of the council under the Ministry of Community Development and Social Services. 'It aims to enhance transparency, accountability and operational efficiency within the sector — that is the NGO sector — and also to ensure that the NGOs can play a pivotal role in national development,' said Mwilu. Once the bill is approved by the Cabinet, the proposed law will be presented to parliament for debate. It needs a two-thirds majority of all lawmakers to be passed by 2025. Rights groups are urging the government to repeal the NGO bill of 2024 so that the country conforms to standards of modern democratic governance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/zambia-s-civil-society-rejects-proposed-ngo-bill/7879523.html	2024-11-27T16:16:38-08:00	
Russian sabotage may lead to NATO invoke Article 5, says German intel chief	BERLIN — Russia's acts of sabotage against Western targets may eventually prompt NATO to consider invoking the alliance's Article 5 mutual defense clause, the head of Germany's foreign intelligence service said on Wednesday. Speaking at an event of the DGAP think tank in Berlin on Wednesday, Bundesnachrichtendienst chief Bruno Kahl said he expected Moscow to further step up its hybrid warfare. 'The extensive use of hybrid measures by Russia increases the risk that NATO will eventually consider invoking its Article 5 mutual defense clause,' he noted. 'At the same time, the increasing ramp up of the Russian military potential means a direct military confrontation with NATO becomes one possible option for the Kremlin.' Under Article 5, if a NATO member comes under attack, the other members of the alliance are obliged to help it respond. NATO and Western intelligence services have warned that Russia is behind a growing number of hostile activities across the Euro-Atlantic area, ranging from repeated cyberattacks to Moscow-linked arson — all of which Russia denies. Kahl said Russia's military would likely be capable of attacking NATO by the end of the decade, adding that Moscow's war on Ukraine meant that it had battle-proven troops under its command, raising the threat emanating from its conventional forces, while it also mastered modern drone warfare. According to the assessment of his experts, high-ranking officials in the Russian defense ministry doubt whether NATO's Article 5 including U.S. protective measures for Europe would actually be invoked in case of an emergency, the intel chief said. 'We don't have any indication yet that Russia intends to go to war, but if such sentiments gain the upper hand in the government in Moscow, then the risk for a military confrontation will grow over the coming years.' Should Russia attack one or several NATO allies, it would not do so to grab massive swaths of land, Kahl said, but rather to test red lines set by the West with the aim of defeating Western unity and NATO as a defensive alliance. 'In Russia's view, this goal would be reached if Article 5 were to remain without effect in case of a Russian attack,' he said. 'To meet this target, you don't need to send tank armies westwards, it is enough to dispatch little green men to the Baltics to protect allegedly threatened Russian minorities or adjust borders on Svalbard.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-sabotage-may-lead-to-nato-invoke-article-5-says-german-intel-chief-/7879524.html	2024-11-27T15:52:28-08:00	
Romania to investigate foreign interference after far-right vote surge	LONDON — Romania’s top security agency said Thursday it is investigating possible foreign interference in Sunday’s first round of the nation’s presidential election. The far-right candidate, Calin Georgescu, topped all other candidates with almost 23% of the vote, despite polling in single digits before the election. Georgescu will compete in a December 8 runoff with center-right candidate Elena Lasconi, who finished second with 19% and hopes to pick up support from defeated centrist and leftist candidates. Romanians will also vote in parliamentary elections on December 1. The Supreme Defense Council, which is led by incumbent President Klaus Iohannis, is due to meet on Thursday to 'analyze possible risks to national security generated by the actions of state and non-state cyber parties,' according to a statement released Wednesday by the president’s office. Additionally, the National Audiovisual Council of Romania, which regulates broadcasting and social media, has urged the European Commission to investigate the role TikTok may have played in Sunday’s vote amid what it called 'suspicions of manipulation of public opinion,' according to Reuters. Protests Protesters have taken to the streets of Bucharest in the wake of Georgescu’s surprise victory. Uma, a student who did not want to give her family name, joined the protests in central Bucharest on Monday. 'Calin Georgescu, an extremist, a far-right extremist who is a pro-Russian, wants to take Romania away from the NATO course,' she said. Georgescu has questioned NATO and European Union support for Kyiv in its war against Russian invaders. Romania hosts several thousand U.S. troops and shares a 613-kilometer border with Ukraine. The 62-year-old presidential candidate has praised fascist politicians in the 1930s as Romanian heroes. NATO membership, Russian engagement In a video streamed Tuesday on social media, Georgescu — standing alongside his wife, Cristela — sought to clarify his positions. 'I do not want to leave NATO. I do not want to leave the European Union. What I want, however, is to take a stance, not to kneel over there, not to take everything. We should do everything in our national interest,' Georgescu said. 'I have no connection to everything that says, ‘With Russia.’ I am Romanian, first and foremost. … I have no connection, and I am not, first and foremost, antisemitic.' Georgescu has urged Western engagement with Russia, echoing other right-wing European leaders such as Hungary’s Viktor Orban, said noted political analyst Radu Magdin, CEO of Smartlink Communications. 'Mr. Georgescu talks a lot about peace. And the thing is, we all want peace, Ukraine wants peace. But it's not easy to have peace when somebody invades your territory. So, from this perspective, by claiming peace, he's part also of a movement across Europe, which in fact is a translation of what you may call war fatigue,' Magdin told VOA. Speaking on Monday, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said Russia was unfamiliar with Georgescu’s policies. 'We are well aware of Romania's current leadership. It is not a friendly country for us. So, we will be watching the further development of electoral processes and who is going to win.' Inflation Economic pressures have also driven frustration with the established parties, according to Magdin. 'Beyond the geopolitics, what really bites is the living conditions,' he said. 'Romania is affected by inflation, like a lot of other countries, and living conditions are not what they used to be. 'It's like a never-ending nightmare. We had COVID, then we had the first wave of economic impact. Then we had war in the region, an energy crisis and an inflation wave again. And yes, you could say that Europe has tried to be resilient. But the reality is, we are all tired.' TikTok Young and overseas voters appear to have boosted Georgescu’s results. 'On social media, he was dominant on TikTok compared with other candidates,' Magdin said. 'His vision is mostly conservative, traditionalist. … For example, he talks about peasants, not farmers, so as to connect with that part of the electorate. He sounds a little bit bucolic. He invokes God quite a lot, as well.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/romania-to-investigate-foreign-interference-after-far-right-vote-surge/7879495.html	2024-11-27T15:24:34-08:00

US dismisses Russia’s warning to South Korea about supplying arms to Ukraine	WASHINGTON — The United States has dismissed Russia’s warning that it will take every measure necessary if South Korea provides lethal weapons to Ukraine. Patrick Ryder, press secretary for the Department of Defense, said Tuesday that 'it's a little bit of gaslighting there,' when asked during a press briefing about Russia warning South Korea against providing weapons to Ukraine. 'Russia obviously invaded Ukraine,' Ryder said. 'They could end this war today by withdrawing their troops from Ukrainian territory and restoring peace and stability to the region.' Gaslighting refers to a situation where an aggressor tries to manipulate others into questioning their own judgment. State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller made similar remarks on Monday during a press briefing, stressing that Russia is entirely responsible for the deployment of North Korean soldiers in Russia. 'It is Russia and Russia alone that is responsible for the very real security concerns that South Korea and the United States and Japan and any number of other countries have about the movement of DPRK troops to join the fight in Russia against Ukraine,' Miller said. DPRK is the short form of the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea, the official name of North Korea. Russia’s warning On Sunday, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Andrey Rudenko said in an interview with the country’s state news agency TASS that 'Seoul must realize that the possible use of South Korean weapons to kill Russia citizens will fully destroy relations between our countries.' Rudenko continued, saying, 'We will respond in every way that we find necessary.' In response, the South Korean government condemned the deepening military ties between Moscow and Pyongyang and said it would take 'phased countermeasures' against the two countries’ cooperation. 'We will watch closely how Russia and North Korea develop their military cooperation, and we will continue to take a step-by-step approach based on that development,' said Koo Byung-sam, spokesperson for South Korea’s Unification Ministry in charge of inter-Korean affairs, leaving open the possibility of arms support for Ukraine. U.S. experts say Russia is anxious to persuade South Korea not to support Ukraine. Bruce Bennett, a senior defense analyst at the Rand Corporation, told VOA Korean Service on Tuesday by phone that Russia is trying to coerce South Korea with saber-rattling. 'Rudenko is claiming that [Russia] is going to give technologies to North Korea, but the Russians have been already doing it,' Bennett said. 'He could be claiming that there’s going to be a war on the Korean Peninsula, but does Russia have any ground forces that can support such a thing? The Russians really don’t have extra military forces.' Bruce Bechtol, a former intelligence officer at the U.S. Defense Intelligence Agency and now a professor at Angelo University in Texas, said Russians are very wary of South Korean weapons coming into Ukraine, adding that it could help reverse Russia’s advancement in its war against Ukraine. South Korean arms 'are on par with the kind of arms that the United States makes,' Bechtol told VOA Korean Tuesday on the phone. 'So, the stuff that they’re going to send the Ukrainians, whatever that may be, that’s going to help the Ukrainians in their fight against the Russians.' North Korea’s involvement South Korea has been mulling supplying weapons directly to Ukraine amid reports that North Korean soldiers are now engaged alongside Russian forces in battles against Ukrainian troops. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol suggested in a November 7 press conference that the government could provide weapons to Ukraine, depending on the degree that North Korean troops participate in the war between Russia and Ukraine. 'If the North Korean military gains experience in modern warfare, it can be a fatal problem for our national security,' Yoon said. 'We need to change the way we provide [to Ukraine] in stages depending on the degree of involvement of the North Korean military. 'We do not rule out weapons support,' he said, adding that defensive rather than offensive weapons would be considered first. Tensions on the Korean Peninsula have been escalating in recent years, as North Korea has been ceaselessly ramping up its nuclear and missile capabilities, making provocative threats against the neighboring South. In the meantime, a Ukrainian delegation led by Defense Minister Rustem Umerov met Yoon at the presidential office in Seoul on Wednesday. Although details of the meeting were not disclosed, it is widely believed that the delegation from Ukraine has requested weapons.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-dismisses-russia-s-warning-to-south-korea-about-supplying-arms-to-ukraine/7879446.html	2024-11-27T13:57:30-08:00

From VOA Mandarin: American survivor recounts Battle of Chosin Reservoir	Wednesday marks the 74th anniversary of the start of the battle of Chosin Reservoir, a key moment in the Korean War. On November 27, 1950, Chinese forces launched a surprise attack on American troops that lasted 17 days in freezing weather. VOA Mandarin has an exclusive interview with Robert Harlan, one of the survivors of the Battle of Chosin Reservoir (Lake Changjin). Harlan’s experience is different from what was depicted in a Chinese epic movie: 'The Battle on Lake Changjin,' commissioned by China’s Communist Party in 2021.

From VOA Mandarin: Corruption report on Chinese defense chief sparks online discussion	The Financial Times newspaper reports that Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun is under investigation for corruption, part of a broader corruption probe in the People’s Liberation Army. A spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry dismissed the report during a regular press briefing Wednesday but that did not stop online discussions among Chinese-speaking users on Weibo.

US lawmaker calls for release of Vietnamese political prisoner	WASHINGTON — A top U.S. lawmaker has pledged to work with rights groups as a special advocate for Dang Dinh Bach, a Vietnamese climate activist and political prisoner, and called on Hanoi to immediately release Bach from jail. Representative Jamie Raskin, the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Accountability Committee, announced that he will advocate for Bach through the Defending Freedoms Project, part of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, according to a statement exclusively obtained by VOA Mandarin Service. 'Vietnam’s communist government maintains its clutch on power by crusading hard against good faith dissenters like Dang Dinh Bach, breaching the fundamental political, social and civil rights of their people,' Raskin said in the statement. 'Mr. Bach’s continued unjust detainment is an affront to global human rights law and climate activism around the world, and I am honored to sponsor his case through the Lantos Commission’s Defending Freedom Project. Mr. Bach should be released immediately,' Raskin said. VOA asked the Vietnamese Embassy in the U.S. for comment about Bach's case but has not received a response. Bach is an environmental lawyer and co-founder and former executive director of the Law and Policy of Sustainable Development Research Center. The LPSD is a Vietnamese nonprofit organization that works with local communities to protect the environment and promote human rights. Bach was arrested in 2021 and convicted of tax evasion a year later. He was allowed to meet with his lawyers only 10 days prior to the trial and is serving a five-year sentence at a prison in Vietnam’s Nghe An Province. Human rights advocates call the tax invasion charge fraudulent. Authorities shut down LPSD after Bach’s arrest. The Defending Freedoms Project was launched in 2012 in collaboration with the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom and Amnesty International USA. It has since expanded to include Reporters Without Borders, Freedom House, Freedom Now, Scholars at Risk, PEN America and the Senate Human Rights Caucus. According to DFP, members of Congress sponsoring a prisoner receive a detailed toolkit for advocacy, which includes writing letters to prisoners and their families, giving speeches and publishing op-eds. They can also initiate legislative actions, hold discussions or hearings and petition executive departments such as the State Department and the White House for support. By taking on a case, lawmakers can help secure releases, reduce sentences, improve prison conditions and raise awareness of unjust laws. In Vietnam, more than 160 political prisoners are in jail, according to Human Rights Watch. Bach is one of several climate activists imprisoned in Vietnam after advocating for the country’s move away from coal-based energy. His case has received widespread attention from human rights groups and environment groups. 'Dang Dinh Bach is a dedicated rights defender focused on climate issues, currently serving a five-year prison sentence in Vietnam on dubious charges of ‘tax evasion,’' said Kat Cosgrove, deputy director of policy and advocacy at Freedom House. 'Since 2021, Vietnamese authorities have frequently used this charge to target and silence local activists, and these charges appear aimed solely at stopping Mr. Bach’s vital work and weakening civil society,' she said. Maureen Harris, senior adviser for International Rivers and coordinator of the Vietnam Climate Defenders Coalition, called on the international community to speak out for Bach. 'Environmental human rights defenders like Bach are critical to the battle against climate change. Vietnam's government should stop persecuting climate leaders. I hope that the international community stands up for Bach and calls on the Vietnamese government to end his wrongful incarceration,' she said. The U.S. State Department, the European Union and the United Nations have previously issued statements calling not only for Bach’s release but other climate activists wrongfully imprisoned in Vietnam. In May 2023, the U.N. Human Rights Council’s Working Group on Arbitrary Detention issued an opinion finding Bach's imprisonment in 'violation of international law.' The group called for his immediate release and expressed concern about a 'systemic problem with arbitrary detention' of environmental defenders in Vietnam.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmaker-calls-for-release-of-vietnamese-political-prisoner/7879324.html	2024-11-27T12:36:57-08:00	
Kenya drops on travel index ranking with new visa requirements	Nairobi — A Kenyan government requirement that foreigners register online three days before traveling to the country has made the East African nation among the most difficult countries to visit in Africa, according to an index that ranks countries for ease of travel. Kenya's introduction of new visa policies earlier this year has made the country less accessible, according to the 2024 Africa Visa Openness Index. The East African country slid 17 places on the index, and now ranks 46 out of 54 African countries. The index, compiled by the African Development Bank and African Union Commission, tracks visa openness and the ease of visiting African countries. Kenya recently launched its Electronic Travel Authorization program. The cost of a visa dropped from $50 to $30, but prospective visitors have to register for the visa online, and approval takes three days. That is causing problems for people who are used to traveling with little advance planning, said Esther Mutwiri, an immigration consultant based in Kenya. 'Whenever there is an application to be made, people who don’t like changes … will feel a little bit of a challenge,' Mutwiri said. 'And this is expected; there is a little challenge. I always advise my clients, for example, if you know you are flying in next week, just apply early enough.' Before the introduction of the online visa application, citizens of many African countries could travel to Kenya, get a visa upon entry, and get their passport stamped. Now, they have to plan ahead, which is made more challenging when the registration system goes down or gets backed up. Sometimes users have to wait for hours to complete the registration process. Some users physically visit an immigration office after turning in their application, just to make sure they get their visa. Professor Chacha Nyaigotti Chacha, an expert in diplomacy and international relations, said Kenya must improve ease of travel to benefit from visitors. 'The openness status when you allow people to get your visa in an easy way means that you can receive more guests and visitors. And the more visitors you receive, the more business people do with the expenditure of various services that are provided,' Chacha said. 'So, it’s important as a country we strive to always ensure that guests and visitors are welcomed and to see that our visa application process should be seamless.' Mutwiri said travelers should apply for visas early to avoid challenges and ensure a smooth process. 'We should embrace change. Nowadays, it's all about going digital, and I think that's what our government is trying to do. So, the people who should do something are the applicants. If I know I am traveling to a country that requires a visa, then I should apply for it beforehand. That way, if most of the travelers do that, they are going to experience less challenges when they come in,' Mutwiri said. Despite the difficulties with the visa system, the Kenya Tourism Board said the country welcomed more than 1 million visitors in the first six months of this year, a 21% increase from 2023. Nnenna Lily Nwabufo, vice president of regional development, integration, and business delivery at the African Development Bank Group, said 39 African countries have improved their scores on the visa index. Benin, Gambia, Rwanda and Seychelles are among the countries ranked high for easy travel within Africa. Sudan, Libya, Equatorial Guinea and Eritrea are ranked the lowest.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-drops-on-travel-index-ranking-with-new-visa-requirements-/7879244.html	2024-11-27T11:33:21-08:00	
Trump nominates longtime adviser Keith Kellogg as special envoy for Ukraine and Russia	WEST PALM BEACH, FLORIDA — President-elect Donald Trump said Wednesday that he will nominate General Keith Kellogg to serve as assistant to the president and special envoy for Ukraine and Russia. Kellogg, a retired Army lieutenant general who has long been Trump’s top adviser on defense issues, served as national security adviser to Trump's former Vice President Mike Pence. Trump made the announcement on his Truth Social account, and he said, 'He was with me right from the beginning! Together, we will secure PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH, and Make America, and the World, SAFE AGAIN!' Kellogg's nomination comes as Russia's invasion of Ukraine enters its third year in February. Trump has criticized the billions of dollars that the Biden administration has poured into Ukraine. Washington has recently stepped up weapons shipments and has forgiven billions in loans provided to Kyiv. The incoming Republican president has said he could end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies. For the America First Policy Institute, one of several groups formed after Trump left office to help lay the groundwork for the next Republican administration, Kellogg in April wrote that 'bringing the Russia-Ukraine war to a close will require strong, America First leadership to deliver a peace deal and immediately end the hostilities between the two warring parties.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-nominates-longtime-adviser-keith-kellogg-as-special-envoy-for-ukraine-and-russia-/7879236.html	2024-11-27T11:28:40-08:00	
UN report: Taliban have detained Afghan journalists more than 250 times	washington — Journalists in Afghanistan are forced to navigate an environment of 'censorship and tight restrictions' under Taliban rule, the United Nations has said. From the Taliban takeover on August 15, 2021, to September 30 of this year, the Taliban have detained journalists 256 times and 130 cases of torture and poor treatment have been documented, according to the report published Tuesday by the U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, or UNAMA. The report documents the 'arbitrary arrests, torture, and violence' that journalists have been subject to since 2021, according to Freshta Hemmati, of the Afghanistan Journalists Support Organization. 'They are working under the severe pressure of censorship and restrictions,' she told VOA. The Taliban-led foreign ministry said that the figures in the report were 'exaggerated' and that journalists are detained only for violations of law, the Reuters news agency reported. The ministry cited crimes including defaming the government, false or baseless reports, and providing material to media outlets against the system, Reuters reported. The UNAMA report found that journalists and media workers in Afghanistan often face 'unclear rules on what they can and cannot report.' This leads to the high risk of arbitrary detention for what the Taliban deem as criticism. Analysts who spoke with VOA said that the report reflects the media suppression in Afghanistan and is a hallmark of the Taliban rule. 'The aim of multiplying the arrests is to instill fear in the whole media community and to provoke self-censorship and submission,' Célia Mercier, head of Reporters Without Borders’ South Asia Desk, told VOA in an email. Since the Taliban resumed power, they have imposed a strict interpretation of Islamic law. Their administration has not been officially recognized by any foreign government. Within three months of the takeover, around 40% of Afghan media outlets disappeared, according to the media watchdog group Reporters Without Borders, or RSF. The takeover led to a large exodus of journalists. Those who remain risk being targeted, according to Beh Lih Yi, of the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. CPJ has documented 'cruel assaults and beatings' of journalists by Taliban forces. Often, journalists and their families choose to remain silent about a detention for fear of retribution. 'All these repressive measures of the Taliban are aimed at creating a chilling effect on the press and deterring journalists from continuing their reporting,' Beh told VOA in an email. The restrictions have especially impacted women journalists in Afghanistan, Hemmati, of the Afghanistan Journalists Support Organization, told VOA. After the Taliban takeover, eight in 10 women journalists stopped working, according to RSF data. The Taliban foreign ministry, in its response to the UNAMA report, said women were free to work if they met conditions, such as covering their faces and working separately from men. Watchdogs have called on Afghan authorities to uphold press freedom by respecting the country’s media law, ratified nearly a decade ago. This law outlines the right to free expression in the country, with the goal of protecting journalists, according to the Afghanistan Journalists Center. The UNAMA report called on the Taliban to improve conditions for media. 'We urge the de facto authorities to ensure the safety and security of all journalists and media workers as they carry out their tasks, and to fully recognize the importance of women working in the media sector,' Roza Otunbayeva, special representative of the secretary-general and head of UNAMA, said in the report. Afghanistan is ranked at No. 178 out of 180 on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 signals the best environment. In 2021, before the Taliban takeover, the country ranked 122nd.

Lebanon sends troops to oversee Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire	The Lebanese Army said Wednesday it was sending more troops to southern Lebanon to help oversee the first hours of the new cease-fire between Hezbollah militants and the Israeli military. The truce, after nearly 14 months of fighting, appeared mostly to be holding. But the Israeli military said it shelled two villages in southern Lebanon, Khiam and Kfar Kila, with its soldiers opening fire after identifying a vehicle in 'a zone prohibited for movement' in Lebanon and forcing it to turn around. Thousands of people displaced by the Israeli-Hezbollah conflict streamed south out of Beirut on jam-packed roads, returning to their homes in towns and villages, many of which have been destroyed or heavily damaged by Israeli strikes. The masses strapped suitcases, mattresses, blankets and other belongings to the rooftops of their cars, inching along roadways and hoping for a return to their former lives. But the Israeli military warned civilians against returning to some areas where its forces are still positioned. U.S. President Joe Biden said in a social media post that the United States, which helped broker the Hezbollah-Israel cease-fire, would in the coming days 'make another push' for an Israeli-Hamas cease-fire in Gaza. Biden said the truce in Lebanon 'brings us closer to realizing a future I’ve been pushing for my entire presidency where the Middle East is at peace, prosperous, and integrated across borders.' Lebanese caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati said in a televised address: 'It is a new day, on which the page is turned on one of the harshest periods of suffering that the Lebanese have lived through in their modern history.' Mikati called on Israel to respect the terms of the agreement, but did not mention Hezbollah, which is designated as a terror group by the U.S. and other Western governments. It is not under the Lebanese government’s control, but under the terms of the cease-fire, the militant group is supposed to retreat from southern Lebanon to north of the Litani River. Israel killed several of Hezbollah’s longtime leaders during the months of fighting and continued to shell what it said were Hezbollah strongholds until the last hour before the truce took effect. The United States, along with France, played a key role in brokering the cease-fire, which Israel’s Security Cabinet approved late Tuesday. Biden called the cease-fire 'a critical step … to end the violence' in the Mideast. He said that Iran and its proxies, Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas militants in Gaza, 'have paid a heavy price' in more than a year of fighting Israeli forces. He said the Israeli-Hezbollah agreement 'is designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities.' But Biden, speaking at the White House, warned, 'Let me be clear, if Hezbollah or anyone else breaks the deal and poses a direct threat to Israel, then Israel retains the right to self-defense consistent with international law, just like any country, in facing a terrorist group pledged to that country's destruction.' Biden said that with Hezbollah agreeing to end its attacks on Israel, 'Hamas has a choice to make. Their only way out is to release the hostages [it is holding in Gaza], including American citizens.' Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he favored a truce with Hezbollah so Israel could focus its attention on the broader threat posed by Iran, refresh its forces and isolate Hamas in its ongoing fight against Israel in Gaza. Netanyahu vowed that if Hezbollah renews its attacks on Israel or rearms itself, Israel will immediately resume its bombardment of militant sites in Lebanon. 'The length of the cease-fire will depend on what happens in Lebanon,' Netanyahu said. 'With the full understanding of the United States, we are preserving full military freedom of action — if Hezbollah breaks the agreement and seeks to arm itself, we will attack.'

Cabinet nominees targeted with threats, Trump spokesperson says	WASHINGTON — Several of Donald Trump's Cabinet nominees and appointees were targeted with 'violent threats,' including bomb threats and 'swatting,' a spokesperson for the U.S. president-elect said Wednesday. The threats were made Tuesday night and Wednesday morning, and law enforcement and authorities acted quickly to ensure the safety of those targeted, spokesperson Karoline Leavitt said in a statement. Leavitt did not say who was targeted, and she did not elaborate on the nature of the apparent threats. Spokespeople for the FBI and the Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Leavitt said the attacks 'ranged from bomb threats to 'swatting'' — when a false crime is reported to induce a heavy, armed police response at someone's home.	https://www.voanews.com/a/cabinet-nominees-targeted-with-threats-trump-spokesperson-says/7879040.html	2024-11-27T09:16:24-08:00	
Trump’s EPA pick vows to restore US energy dominance	Washington — When U.S. President-elect Donald Trump nominated former Republican Congressman Lee Zeldin to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, Trump described him as a 'True fighter for America First policies.' Zeldin, the statement added, spent eight years in Congress as a vocal advocate on foreign policy, border security, military affairs, combating antisemitism, environmental issues and energy policy. Shortly after the announcement was made, Zeldin, a native from Long Island, New York who is married with twin daughters, took to the X social media platform, leaving no doubt about his priorities for his new role. He promised to 'restore US energy dominance, revitalize the auto industry, bring back American jobs, and make the US the global leader of AI.' Environmental record Zeldin, who has a law degree from Albany Law School, has vowed to protect access to clean air and clean water. While in Congress, he voted in favor of limiting the presence of toxic substances known as PFAS, or 'forever chemicals,' in drinking water. He stood against offshore drilling in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans to protect coastal communities and marine wildlife from oil spills. Environmental organizations have also highlighted Zeldin’s support for the Great American Outdoors Act, which increased funding for maintenance of public lands and waters. The League of Conservation Voters, or LCV, however, noted in reaction to Zeldin’s nomination that during his four terms in Congress, he voted in favor of environmental legislation just 14% of the time. The LCV’s voting tracker shows Zeldin rejected most of the legislative proposals related to climate change. The Republican never served on committees with oversight of environmental policy, but he was part of the House Climate Solutions Caucus, a short-lived bipartisan effort tasked with building a constructive dialogue on climate change. WATCH: US climate changes regulations to be scaled back under Trump's EPA pick Change of priorities At this year’s United Nations Climate Change Conference, U.N. Secretary General Antonio Guterres renewed his call for countries to move away from burning fossil fuels, the primary cause of global warming. 'The sound you hear is the ticking clock. We are in the final countdown to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius and time is not on our side,' Guterres said. Under Democratic President Joe Biden’s administration, the EPA has set limits on the production of oil and gas and prioritized the production of clean and renewable power in a bid to fight climate change. The EPA’s website currently states that 'understanding and addressing climate change is critical to the agency’s mission of protecting human health and the environment.' President-elect Trump’s economic vision for the country will now take precedence. 'We will blast through every bureaucratic hurdle to issue rapid approvals for new drilling, new pipelines, new refineries, new power plants, new electric plants and reactors of all types,' Trump told attendees at The Economic Club of New York on September 5. Zeldin expressed similar views when running for New York governor in 2022. 'We should reverse the state’s ban on the safe extraction of natural gas. Approve new pipeline applications,' he said during a campaign event. If confirmed to the Cabinet post, Zeldin says he will move swiftly to implement Trump’s economic agenda and roll back a wide range of Biden-era environmental protections on Day One. 'There are regulations that the left wing of this country have been advocating through regulatory power that ends up causing businesses to go in the wrong direction,' he told Fox News on November 11. Climate action in US The Trump administration will have broad power to reverse several EPA rules including those curbing carbon emissions from power plants or vehicles. However, climate action in the United States won’t come to a complete halt, according to Carbon Direct policy analyst Zara Ahmed. 'Consumers can choose to purchase a low-emissions vehicle. States can choose to enact their own regulations about emissions,' she told the Reuters news agency.

US imposes sanctions on 21 top Venezuelan officials over election crackdown	WASHINGTON — The United States imposed sanctions on 21 senior Venezuelan officials for their role in suppressing protests after a presidential election in July, a senior administration official said on Wednesday. Washington says President Nicolas Maduro falsely claimed victory in the vote in what U.S. officials have described as a subversion of democratic norms. The United States says opposition leader Edmundo Gonzalez won and refers to him as the president-elect. '[This] is not merely about holding Nicolas Maduro accountable,' an administration official told reporters. 'Officials who are acting unlawfully to uphold his regime based on repressive tactics will also find themselves in the cross hairs of these sanctions.' In September, Venezuela's government rejected a United Nations human rights report criticizing repression of political opponents and children in the wake of the elections, saying it was a sign of coercion against the state. The United States would also be imposing visa restrictions on several officials associated with Maduro, the administration official said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-sanctions-on-21-top-venezuelan-officials-over-election-crackdown/7878973.html	2024-11-27T08:44:56-08:00	
US inflation gauge ticks higher with price pressures still stubborn	Washington — Consumer price increases accelerated last month, the latest sign that inflation's steady decline over the past two years has stalled. According to the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge, consumer prices rose 2.3% in October from a year earlier, the Commerce Department said Wednesday. That is up from just 2.1% in September, though it is still only modestly above the Fed's 2% target. Yet excluding the volatile food and energy categories, so-called 'core' prices also picked up, climbing 2.8% last month from a year earlier, up from 2.7% in September. Economists closely watch core prices because they typically provide a better read on where inflation is headed. Inflation has fallen sharply since it peaked at 7% in mid-2022, according to the Fed's preferred measure. Yet yearly core inflation has been stuck at 2.8% since February. Price increases have remained elevated in services, including apartment rents, restaurant meals, and car and home insurance. Wednesday's report also underscored that Americans' incomes and spending remained healthy, a key reason the economy has kept growing this year despite widespread fears of a slowdown. Incomes grew 0.6% from September to October, faster than economists had expected, while consumer spending rose by a solid 0.4% last month.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-inflation-gauge-ticks-higher-with-price-pressures-still-stubborn/7878889.html	2024-11-27T08:05:06-08:00	
US brokers release of 3 Americans it says were wrongly detained in China	The United States has brokered the release of three Americans it said had been wrongfully detained in China for many years, the White House said in a statement on Wednesday.

Police evict protesters from Pakistan’s capital	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan said Wednesday that an overnight security crackdown evicted thousands of opposition activists rallying in support of jailed former Prime Minister Imran Khan from central Islamabad, reopening roads linking the capital with the rest of the country after a four-day lockdown. Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party, or PTI, launched what it had billed as a 'peaceful' protest march on Sunday, bringing thousands of people into the city to stage a sit-in demonstration until their demands were met, including Khan’s release from 'unlawful' custody. The capital’s police chief told a news conference that the sweeping operation on Tuesday night involved 'nonlethal' weapons such as tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse the crowd, resulting in the arrest of nearly 1,000 protesters. Ali Nasir Rizvi said that clashes with demonstrators resulted in the deaths of at least three law enforcement personnel and injured more than 70 others, with some suffering 'bullet injuries.' He alleged that participants in the rally used 'firearms' and slings. Authorities also reported the death of a police officer on Monday. The PTI and residents in neighborhoods near the conflict zone disputed police claims, accusing security forces of resorting to intense gunfire at peaceful marchers that resulted in deaths and injuries to dozens of them. PTI officials reported the deaths of at least 10 protesters. While government officials were silent about civilian casualties, local journalists in social media comments supported the opposition's claims, alleging that authorities were hiding the truth about casualties. 'Today, armed security forces launched a violent assault on peaceful PTI protesters in Islamabad, firing live rounds with the intent to kill as many people as possible,' the opposition party said in a statement. 'The world must condemn this atrocity and the erosion of democracy and humanity in Pakistan.' Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi hailed the security crackdown, saying law enforcement forces 'bravely repulsed the protesters.' Authorities also disrupted mobile internet service across Islamabad, closed schools and used scores of shipping containers as roadblocks to prevent or limit the size of the PTI rally. Khan’s party announced Wednesday it was canceling the protest march, part of its campaign for his release and that of numerous party members reportedly detained without trial. The PTI is also seeking the resignation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his coalition government, alleging the February elections that put them in power were rigged. Sharif denounced the protest march as 'extremism' and 'unacceptable.' The PTI won more seats than any other party in the elections but not enough to form a government, enabling Sharif to form a ruling coalition of parties aligned with the military. Khan, prime minister from 2018 to 2022, was ousted through an opposition parliamentary vote of no-confidence after falling out with the powerful military. The 72-year-old former cricket star-turned-politician has been imprisoned since August 2023, facing more than 150 criminal cases, which include charges of corruption, terrorism and instigation of violence against military properties. Khan denies the charges, calling them politically motivated and orchestrated by the military — accusations his successor and army officials dismiss as unfounded. The Sharif government maintains that it has nothing to do with Khan's legal challenges and that only courts can order his release. The PTI asserts that all convictions have been either overturned or suspended by appeals courts due to lack of evidence, but authorities keep coming up with new charges. The United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention has recently called for Khan’s immediate release, saying he is being detained illegally and in breach of international law. Khan’s removal from office has plunged Pakistan into protracted political turmoil, fueling his popularity and making him the country’s most popular politician. The military has staged several coups and governed Pakistan for more than three decades since its independence in 1947. Khan and other prominent Pakistani politicians say that the military interferes in the working of elected governments even when not formally in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-evict-protesters-from-pakistan-s-capital/7878783.html	2024-11-27T07:01:17-08:00

Morocco pushes to bring Central Sahel ‘out of isolation’	In a November interview, Morocco's foreign minister said his country plans to bring Central Sahel countries such as Burkina Faso, Niger and Mali 'out of isolation' with a joint development and port access package known as The Atlantic Initiative. As they battle militants linked to terror groups, Central Sahel countries have turned away from regional and international partners, so what can their neighbors do to reach out to them?

One of India’s largest conglomerates under suspicion following US fraud charges	New Delhi — Nearly two years after one of India’s biggest conglomerates was hit by allegations of wrongdoing by a U.S. investment firm, it is again in the eye of a storm as it faces charges of fraud, which analysts say are far more serious. The latest allegations by the United States could dampen investor confidence in Asia’s third largest economy at a time when the country is wooing foreign investment. They have also triggered a political storm in India with opposition parties demanding a probe into the allegations against an influential business tycoon whose $135 billion empire — spanning seaports, airports and energy - has a massive imprint on the Indian economy. An indictment filed in New York last week charged Gautam Adani, the founder of Adani Group, with duping investors by concealing that a huge solar energy project was being facilitated by an alleged $250 million scheme that involved bribing Indian officials to obtain lucrative contracts. The company in question, Adani Energy Green, is building a massive solar energy plant in the western state of Gujarat and plans to generate enough energy to light up millions of homes. Adani Group has strongly denied allegations made by U.S. authorities against Gautam Adani and other top officials. The charges came after the conglomerate endured accusations of engaging in stock market manipulation and fraud. The allegations were made last year by a U.S. investment firm, Hindenburg Research. Indian regulators, who investigated the charges, said they found no wrongdoing. Analysts say the new indictment in the U.S. poses a far bigger challenge. 'It’s one thing for allegations to come from a short seller firm or from media outlets,' according to Michael Kugelman, director of the Wilson Center’s South Asia Institute in Washington. 'But this is a case of the U.S. government coming out with a long and detailed indictment. It’s a whole other order of magnitude.' Gautam Adani, 62, is a college dropout from a middle-class family who has led a dizzying rise in his conglomerate’s fortunes, especially since he began in the 1990s expanding into infrastructure. He has built power plants, airports, roads and renewable energy projects in India as the country pushes to bridge an infrastructure deficit for its growing economy. Besides Adani’s huge presence in India, his global ambitions have taken his companies to other countries, including Australia, Indonesia and Israel. After Donald Trump’s recent U.S. presidential election victory, in a post on X, Adani congratulated Trump and announced plans to invest $10 billion in energy and infrastructure projects in the U.S. The U.S. indictment already is impacting the conglomerate’s push to expand his energy and infrastructure business overseas. A day after the charges became public, Kenya announced it is scrapping airport expansion and electricity deals worth about $2.5 billion with Adani Group. The indictment also has cast a cloud over planned projects in Sri Lanka, as government officials on Tuesday said the finance and foreign ministries will review infrastructure projects awarded to the Indian conglomerate. Adani has a contract to develop a deep seaport terminal in Colombo. The controversy will affect the reputation of Adani Group, say analysts. 'Definitely the charges will trigger mistrust in the Adani Group. There will also be an increase in borrowing cost for them, so they will need to work that much harder,' according to Shriram Subramanian, founder of corporate governance advisory firm InGovern Research Services. 'But it won’t be debilitating in the long run because they have a good track record in executing projects.' The U.S. charges will raise questions about business practices and norms in India and could hurt the country’s effort to woo businesses looking to set up factories and facilities in countries outside China. 'In the immediate term, it could give some investors cold feet, as they may not want to risk their reputations investing in a country where Adani’s clout and reach is so expansive across the economy,' according to Kugelman. 'This would be especially bad timing for New Delhi, which wants to capitalize on many foreign investors’ desire to relocate production and other business out of China.' Kugelman pointed out that the setback to the investment climate in India is likely to be temporary because 'the key drivers impacting foreign investment in India — multiple growth sectors, large consumer markets, a fast-growing major economy will remain in place.' The U.S. indictment has also turned the spotlight on accusations made for several years by India’s main opposition Congress Party and by other critics — that the tycoon’s dramatic business expansion has coincided with Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s rule. Parliament was disrupted for a second day on Wednesday as opposition parties demanded a discussion on the indictment. 'He should be in jail and the government is protecting him,' Congress Party leader Rahul Gandhi told reporters outside parliament. At a protest on Monday, Congress Party activists held placards reading, 'Modi and Adani are one' and 'Modi’s friendship is costing the nation.' The government has not commented on the charges. The ruling Bharatiya Janata Party has pointed out that the charges involved bribing officials in four states that were not governed by them, but by opposition parties. Political analysts say the latest controversy over Adani is not likely to hurt Modi. 'This issue has been raised for a long time, but it has not impacted the prime minister in any way. The opposition has not been able to convince the people about their case,' according to political analyst Nilanjan Mukhopadhyay. 'At the moment, people simply look at it as a case of one group being favored over another by the government, which many people feel is not unusual in India.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-of-india-s-largest-conglomerates-under-suspicion-following-us-fraud-charges/7878640.html	2024-11-27T05:37:28-08:00	
Several hurt in Kyiv after Russia attacks Ukraine with 89 drones	Ukrainian officials said Wednesday that Russian forces launched 89 drones in a wave of overnight attacks that left three people injured in Ukraine’s capital, Kyiv. Serhiy Popko, head of Kyiv’s City Military Administration, said on Telegram that falling debris from a destroyed drone damaged a building. Ukrainian air defenses shot down 36 of the 89 drones, the country’s military said. In addition to Kyiv, intercepts took place over the Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Mykolaiv, Poltava, Sumy, and Zhytomyr regions. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Wednesday it shot down 25 Ukrainian drones over the Black Sea and Russia-occupied Crimea. That followed another 22 drones that Russian air defenses shot down overnight, the ministry said. Most of the drones were shot down in areas along the Russia-Ukraine border, including over the Rostov, Belgorod, Voronezh, Kursk and Bryansk regions. There were no reports of major damage from the Ukrainian attacks. 'The only effective way to protect ourselves from this is to eliminate Russian weapons and Russian launchers directly on Russian territory,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address Tuesday. 'That is why the ability to strike Russian territory is so important to us. This is the only factor that can limit Russian terror and Russia's capacity to wage war in general,' he added. Countries that have given Ukraine weapons to fight Russia have been reluctant to give Ukraine permission to launch those weapons directly into Russia, but Zelenskyy said he is 'grateful to all the partners who understand this and convey it to other partners.'

ICC prosecutor requests arrest warrants for the head of Myanmar's military regime	THE HAGUE — The International Criminal Court’s chief prosecutor asked judges on Wednesday to issue an arrest warrant for the head of Myanmar’s military regime for crimes committed against the country’s Rohingya Muslim minority. Senior Gen. Min Aung Hlaing, who took power from elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi in a coup in 2021, is accused of crimes against humanity for the deportation and persecution of the Rohingya. Nearly a million people were forced into neighboring Bangladesh to escape what has been called an ethnic cleansing campaign involving mass rapes, killings and the torching of homes. From a refugee camp in Bangladesh, the court’s top prosecutor, Karim Khan, said in a statement that he intends to request more warrants for Myanmar's leaders soon. 'In doing so, we will be demonstrating, together with all of our partners, that the Rohingya have not been forgotten. That they, like all people around the world, are entitled to the protection of the law,' the British barrister said. The allegations stem from a counterinsurgency campaign that Myanmar’s military began in August 2017 in response to an insurgent attack. Hlaing, who heads the Myanmar Defense Services, is said to have directed the armed forces of Myanmar, known as the Tatmadaw, as well as national police to attack Rohingya civilians. Khan was in Bangladesh where he met with members of the displaced Rohingya population. Myanmar does not belong to the global court, but Bangladesh does. In 2018 judges at the court ruled the prosecutor could look into crimes which were 'completed' on the territory of a member state, such as forcible deportation. In 2019, Khan’s predecessor, Fatou Bensouda, formally requested to open an investigation into the situation and judges gave the green light for investigations into 'any crime, including any future crime' committed at least partly in Bangladesh or another court member state and linked to the Rohingya. The move paved the way for Khan to pursue crimes beyond forcing men, women and children over the border and into refugee camps. The request comes days after a powerful rebel group seized a key trading town in northeastern Myanmar on the Chinese border, taking control of a lucrative rare earth mining hub in another setback for the military-led government. The military seized power from Aung San Suu Kyi's government in February 2021, triggering intensified fighting with long-established armed militias organized by Myanmar’s ethnic minority groups in its border regions which have struggled for decades for more autonomy. In 2022, the International Court of Justice, the United Nations’ highest court, advanced a separate case against Myanmar brought by Gambia alleging the Southeast Asian nation is responsible for genocide against the Rohingya. Five European countries and Canada have asked the court to back Gambia in the proceedings.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-prosecutor-requests-arrest-warrants-for-the-head-of-myanmar-s-military-regime-/7878520.html	2024-11-27T02:21:48-08:00	
New EU commission to get all clear with big push on defense and economy	Strasbourg, France — EU chief Ursula von der Leyen warned Wednesday that Europe has 'no time to waste' to boost its defenses and its competitiveness, as European lawmakers prepared to greenlight her new executive to start work. Addressing parliamentarians in Strasbourg, von der Leyen said her team was ready to get to work immediately on rising to the bloc's mounting challenges — most urgently the Ukraine war 'raging at Europe's borders.' Appealing for a massive defense spending boost, she said, 'We have no time to waste. And we must be as ambitious as the threats are serious.' From Russia's invasion of Ukraine to war in the Middle East, the mounting economic threat from China and the imminent return of Donald Trump to the White House, the European Union has its hands full. 'Our freedom and sovereignty depend more than ever on our economic strength. Our security depends on our ability to compete, innovate and produce,' von der Leyen told lawmakers. Ensuring a swift handover at the helm of the 27-nation bloc after European elections in June is seen as critical. The new team should formally start its mandate on Sunday, after several of the main groups in parliament reached a deal to back it. Right, centrist and center-left groups last week agreed to vote in the new 27-member commission as a whole, skippered by Germany's von der Leyen, 66, for a second term. That came after all nominees put forward by member states were -- for the first time in decades -- cleared individually, though only after a bout of political horse-trading. Parliament has previously used the process to flex its muscles and turn down some candidates. Weapons and tariffs The top roles in the new commission speak of the priorities for the next five years. Estonia's ex-premier Kaja Kallas is to take over the reins as the bloc's top diplomat, while Lithuania's Andrius Kubilius landed a new role overseeing the EU's push to rearm. Both are hawkish Russia critics. The EU must swiftly increase defense spending to rival Russian levels, von der Leyen said Wednesday, noting there was 'something wrong' when Moscow is spending up to 9% of GDP on defense against the EU's 1.9%. She has previously said the bloc needs to invest $526 billion on defense over the next decade if it wants to keep up with Russia and China. This has become more urgent since Donald Trump was elected as the next U.S. president this month, amid fears he might reduce the U.S. commitment to European security and support for Ukraine. Similarly, trade policy -- under Maros Sefcovic of Slovakia, a seasoned Brussels operative -- has shot up the agenda as the bloc will contend with a tariff-loving US president who could push for the EU to buy more American products or face higher duties. Stephane Sejourne of France is to take charge of industrial strategy at a time when Europe's manufacturing sector is struggling amid competition from China, high energy costs and weak investments. The former French foreign minister will have to work hand-in-hand with Spain's Teresa Ribera, the new competition and green transition chief, to reconcile economic growth with climate ambitions. Hands-on' chief Front and center, however, will be von der Leyen. The former German defense minister has significantly 'strengthened her power and her profile as a political actor' over the past five years, said Luigi Scazzieri of the Centre for European Reform think tank. She has weeded out commissioners she didn't see eye to eye with, like France's Thierry Breton, and benefited from a political alignment that has seen countries fill her new team with fellow conservatives. In her first term, she also pushed back the boundaries of what the EU can and is expected to do -- something observers say may come in handy in the future. Under her leadership, the commission shepherded efforts to purchase COVID-19 vaccines, use joint borrowing to finance post-pandemic economic recovery, ship weapons to Ukraine and wean Europe off Russian gas. The incoming commission 'is facing more threats,' Ylva Johansson, the outgoing commissioner for home affairs said, noting the geopolitical environment has changed dramatically since 2019. But the EU's executive is now 'much more operational than five years ago,' she said. 'That is also thanks to the personality of Ursula von der Leyen -- because she's very hands-on.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-eu-commission-to-get-all-clear-with-big-push-on-defense-and-economy/7878514.html	2024-11-27T02:13:10-08:00	
Sweden urges Chinese ship to return for undersea cable investigation	STOCKHOLM — Sweden is asking a Chinese vessel to return to Swedish waters to help facilitate an investigation into recent breaches of undersea fiber-optic cables in the Baltic Sea, Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said on Tuesday, but stressed he was not making any accusations. Two subsea cables, one linking Finland and Germany and the other connecting Sweden to Lithuania, were damaged in less than 24 hours on Nov. 17-18, prompting German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to say he assumed it was sabotage. Sweden, Germany and Lithuania all launched criminal investigations last week, zeroing in on Chinese bulk carrier Yi Peng 3, which left the Russian port of Ust-Luga on Nov. 15. A Reuters analysis of MarineTraffic data showed that the ship's coordinates corresponded to the time and place of the breaches. The ship now sits idle in international waters but inside Denmark's exclusive economic zone, closely watched by Danish military vessels. 'From the Swedish side we have had contact with the ship and contact with China and said that we want the ship to move towards Swedish waters,' Kristersson told a press conference, adding it would help facilitate the investigation. 'We're not making any accusations but we seek clarity on what has happened,' Kristersson said. China's foreign ministry said the communications channels with Sweden and other relevant parties were 'unobstructed,' when asked about Sweden's request. 'I would like to reiterate China's consistent support working with all countries to maintain the security of international submarine cables and other infrastructure in accordance with international law,' ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told reporters at a regular news briefing on Wednesday. Western intelligence officials from multiple countries have said they are confident the Chinese ship caused the cuts to both cables. But they have expressed different views on whether these were accidents or could have been deliberate. U.S. Naval Intelligence assesses that both incidents were an accident, according to a U.S. official, but officials from other countries have said sabotage cannot be ruled out. Katja Bego, Senior Research Fellow at Chatham House, told Reuters that, while between 150-200 such breaches occur every year and the overwhelming majority are accidents, geopolitical tensions in the region meant an investigation was probably warranted. 'Investigating incidents like this can take a long time, and even if the culprit is found, as appears to be the case here, proving intent is incredibly difficult,' she said. 'Neither sabotage nor an accident can be ruled out at this point.' Russia last week said suggestions it had anything to do with the breaches were 'absurd.' Kristersson said he was hopeful that China would respond positively to the request to move the ship to Swedish waters. China's foreign ministry said on Monday that Beijing has maintained 'smooth communication' with all parties involved. Last year a subsea gas pipeline and several telecoms cables running along the bottom of the Baltic Sea were severely damaged, and Finnish police have said they believe the incident was caused by a Chinese ship dragging its anchor. But the investigators have not said whether they believe the damage in 2023 was accidental or intentional.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sweden-urges-chinese-ship-to-return-for-undersea-cable-investigation/7878502.html	2024-11-27T01:17:39-08:00	
VW confirms plans to exit controversial Xinjiang operation	SHANGHAI — Volkswagen will exit its controversial plant in China's Xinjiang region, after years of investor pressure to abandon its presence in the region, where rights groups have documented abuses including mass forced labor in detention camps. Volkswagen and its Chinese partner agreed to sell the asset to a Shanghai government-owned buyer, the German car maker said on Wednesday, confirming an earlier report by Reuters. The move will bring to an end years of mounting investor pressure to abandon VW's presence in the region, where rights groups have documented abuses including mass forced labor in detention camps. Beijing denies any such abuses. The transaction value of the deal was not revealed. The significance of the plant, which previously assembled Volkswagen's Santana vehicle, has dwindled in recent years after the carmaker cut jobs, leaving about 200 employees to just conduct final quality checks and handing over vehicles to dealers in the region. Volkswagen has denied reports that it kept the plant open as a condition from Beijing to keep producing across China, its largest market where sales have been flagging. The German automaker and SAIC will sell the plant to Shanghai Motor Vehicle Inspection Certification (SMVIC), a subsidiary of state-owned Shanghai Lingang Development Group, which will take on all the plant's employees. The decision to free itself from the plant comes as Volkswagen is battling to boost flagging sales in China amid intense competition and sluggish demand. Europe's car companies also have to contend with the impact of a potential trade war between Beijing and the European Union after the EU imposed anti-subsidy import tariffs on China-made electric vehicles. The VW brand, which has lost its title as the best-selling brand in China to BYD, is working with Chinese partners like Xpeng to develop new models better suited to Chinese consumers, aiming for over 30 new electric or hybrid models by 2030. Under the deal, SMVIC will also take over SAIC/VW's test tracks in Turpan Xinjiang and Anting in Shanghai, they added. Following the deals, Volkswagen will no longer have a presence in Xinjiang. At the same time, Volkswagen will extend its partnership with SAIC by a decade to 2040 and the joint venture aims to release 18 new models by 2030, including two extended range models for Chinese consumers in 2026. VW said earlier this year it is talking to SAIC about the future direction of its business activities in Xinjiang and considering various scenarios.	https://www.voanews.com/a/vw-confirms-plans-to-exit-controversial-xinjiang-operation/7878497.html	2024-11-27T01:10:12-08:00	
Long-sought court ruling restores Oregon tribe's hunting, fishing rights	LINCOLN CITY, Ore. — Drumming made the floor vibrate and singing filled the conference room of the Chinook Winds Casino Resort in Lincoln City, on the Oregon coast, as hundreds in tribal regalia danced in a circle. For the last 47 years, the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians have held an annual powwow to celebrate regaining federal recognition. This month’s event, however, was especially significant: It came just two weeks after a federal court lifted restrictions on the tribe's rights to hunt, fish and gather — restrictions tribal leaders had opposed for decades. 'We're back to the way we were before,' Siletz Chairman Delores Pigsley said. 'It feels really good.' The Siletz is a confederation of over two dozen bands and tribes whose traditional homelands spanned western Oregon, as well as parts of northern California and southwestern Washington state. The federal government in the 1850s forced them onto a reservation on the Oregon coast, where they were confederated together as a single, federally recognized tribe despite their different backgrounds and languages. In the 1950s and ‘60s, Congress revoked recognition of over 100 tribes, including the Siletz, under a policy known as 'termination.' Affected tribes lost millions of acres of land as well as federal funding and services. 'The goal was to try and assimilate Native people, get them moved into cities,' said Matthew Campbell, deputy director of the Native American Rights Fund. 'But also I think there was certainly a financial aspect to it. I think the United States was trying to see how it could limit its costs in terms of providing for tribal nations.' Losing their lands and self-governance was painful, and the tribes fought for decades to regain federal recognition. In 1977, the Siletz became the second tribe to succeed, following the restoration of the Menominee Tribe in Wisconsin in 1973. But to get a fraction of its land back — roughly 1,457 hectares of the 445,000-hectare reservation established for the tribe in 1855 — the Siletz tribe had to agree to a federal court order that restricted their hunting, fishing and gathering rights. It was only one of two tribes in the country, along with Oregon’s Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde, compelled to do so to regain tribal land. The settlement limited where tribal members could fish, hunt and gather for ceremonial and subsistence purposes, and it imposed caps on how many salmon, elk and deer could be harvested in a year. It was devastating, tribal chair Pigsley recalled: The tribe was forced to buy salmon for ceremonies because it couldn’t provide for itself, and people were arrested for hunting and fishing violations. 'Giving up those rights was a terrible thing,' Pigsley, who has led the tribe for 36 years, told The Associated Press earlier this year. 'It was unfair at the time, and we’ve lived with it all these years.' Decades later, Oregon and the U.S. came to recognize that the agreement subjecting the tribe to state hunting and fishing rules was biased, and they agreed to join the tribe in recommending to the court that the restrictions be lifted. 'The Governor of Oregon and Oregon’s congressional representatives have since acknowledged that the 1980 Agreement and Consent Decree were a product of their times and represented a biased and distorted position on tribal sovereignty, tribal traditions, and the Siletz Tribe’s ability and authority to manage and sustain wildlife populations it traditionally used for tribal ceremonial and subsistence purposes,' attorneys for the U.S., state and tribe wrote in a joint court filing. Late last month, the tribe finally succeeded in having the court order vacated by a federal judge. And a separate agreement with the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife has given the tribe a greater role in regulating tribal hunting and fishing. As Pigsley reflected on those who passed away before seeing the tribe regain its rights, she expressed hope about the next generation carrying on essential traditions. 'There’s a lot of youth out there that are learning tribal ways and culture,' she said. 'It’s important today because we are trying to raise healthy families, meaning we need to get back to our natural foods.' Among those celebrating and praying at the powwow was Tiffany Stuart, donning a basket cap her ancestors were known for weaving, and her 3-year-old daughter Kwestaani Chuski, whose name means 'six butterflies' in the regional Athabaskan language from southwestern Oregon and northwestern California. Given the restoration of rights, Stuart said, it was 'very powerful for my kids to dance.' 'You dance for the people that can’t dance anymore,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/long-sought-court-ruling-restores-oregon-tribe-s-hunting-fishing-rights-/7878480.html	2024-11-27T00:09:41-08:00	
Australia's House of Representatives passes bill that would ban young children from social media	MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA — Australia’s House of Representatives on Wednesday passed a bill that would ban children younger than 16 years old from social media, leaving it to the Senate to finalize the world-first law. The major parties backed the bill that would make platforms including TikTok, Facebook, Snapchat, Reddit, X and Instagram liable for fines of up to $33 million for systemic failures to prevent young children from holding accounts. The legislation passed 102 to 13. If the bill becomes law this week, the platforms would have one year to work out how to implement the age restrictions before the penalties are enforced. Opposition lawmaker Dan Tehan told Parliament the government had agreed to accept amendments in the Senate that would bolster privacy protections. Platforms would not be allowed to compel users to provide government-issued identity documents including passports or driver’s licenses. The platforms also could not demand digital identification through a government system. 'Will it be perfect? No. But is any law perfect? No, it’s not. But if it helps, even if it helps in just the smallest of ways, it will make a huge difference to people’s lives,' Tehan told Parliament. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said the Senate would debate the bill later Wednesday. The major parties’ support all but guarantees the legislation will pass in the Senate, where no party holds a majority of seats. Lawmakers who were not aligned with either the government or the opposition were most critical of the legislation during debate on Tuesday and Wednesday. Criticisms include that the legislation had been rushed through Parliament without adequate scrutiny, would not work, would create privacy risks for users of all ages and would take away parents’ authority to decide what’s best for their children. Critics also argue the ban would isolate children, deprive them of positive aspects of social media, drive children to the dark web, make children too young for social media reluctant to report harms they encountered and take away incentives for platforms to make online spaces safer. Independent lawmaker Zoe Daniel said the legislation would 'make zero difference to the harms that are inherent to social media.' 'The true object of this legislation is not to make social media safe by design, but to make parents and voters feel like the government is doing something about it,' Daniel told Parliament. 'There is a reason why the government parades this legislation as world-leading, that’s because no other country wants to do it,' she added. The platforms had asked for the vote on legislation to be delayed until at least June next year when a government-commissioned evaluation of age assurance technologies made its report on how the ban could been enforced. Melbourne resident Wayne Holdsworth, whose 17-year-old son Mac took his own life last year after falling victim to an online sextortion scam, described the bill as 'absolutely essential for the safety of our children.' 'It’s not the only thing that we need to do to protect them because education is the key, but to provide some immediate support for our children and parents to be able to manage this, it’s a great step,' the 65-year-old online safety campaigner told The Associated Press on Tuesday. 'And in my opinion, it’s the greatest time in our country’s history,' he added, referring to the pending legal reform.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-s-house-of-representatives-passes-bill-that-would-ban-young-children-from-social-media-/7878472.html	2024-11-26T23:57:30-08:00	
UNAIDS: upholding human rights essential for ending AIDS	HARARE, ZIMBABWE — Ahead of World AIDS Day on December 1, the U.N. has released a report saying that upholding human rights is essential for ending the AIDS pandemic. The report says human rights violations, including discrimination against girls and women, and criminalization of LGBTQ+ people, obstruct efforts to end AIDS. UNAIDS Executive Director Winnie Byanyima released a report online called 'Take the Rights Path to End AIDS.' The report says the world can meet the goal of ending AIDS by 2030 if leaders protect the human rights of everyone living with and at risk of HIV. She said advances in medicine are helping reduce new cases of HIV. 'But big gaps still remain in the protection of rights. When there is impunity for gender-based violence; when people can be arrested for who they are, or who they love; when a visit to health services is dangerous for people because of their gender — the result is that people are blocked from care, this drives the AIDS pandemic,' she said. 'Only rights can fix these wrongs. There is an urgent need to enact laws that protect the human rights of everyone.' Zimbabwe was one of the countries hit hardest by HIV/AIDS until it introduced an AIDS levy in 1999, a 3% tax on income and business profits which is managed by the National AIDS Council. Dr. Bernard Madzima, the executive officer of the Zimbabwe National AIDS Council, said the country is aiming to end HIV as a public health threat by the end of the decade. He said the country enforces a policy of no discrimination against HIV patients. 'In Zimbabwe there is no one who has been stigmatized whether they are HIV positive or whether they are HIV negative, they will get access. Our approach in HIV intervention is based on it being a public health approach,' he said. 'So our interventions are to make sure that HIV is no longer a public health threat by 2030.' Madzima said the government is also attempting to reach marginalized groups like sex workers, prison inmates and informal miners with care. In the past, Zimbabwean authorities targeted sex workers and organizations such as Gays and Lesbians of Zimbabwe. The UNAIDS report noted that police only stopped arresting sex workers for 'loitering' in 2015, after Zimbabwe Lawyers for Human Rights successfully argued in court that the police conduct was illegal. The report said the move has resulted in sex workers being able to seek health services. The report commended Zimbabwe for stopping the criminalization of HIV transmission in 2022, adding that criminalization and stigmatization of marginalized communities obstruct access to life-saving HIV services.	https://www.voanews.com/a/unaids-upholding-human-rights-essential-for-ending-aids/7878470.html	2024-11-26T23:50:58-08:00	
Trump announces picks for economic, health posts	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump announced a set of economic advisers he wants to appoint for his administration, including international trade attorney Jamieson Greer as his pick to be the U.S. trade representative. Greer served in Trump’s first administration as the chief of staff to the trade representative, and Trump said Tuesday that Greer played a key role in both imposing tariffs on China and in the creation of a new trade deal with Canada and Mexico. Trump said Kevin Hassett is his choice to lead the White House National Economic Council. Hassett led the Council of Economic Advisers during Trump’s previous term. Trump said in the new role, Hassett would work to 'renew and improve' a set of tax cuts implemented in 2017 and 'will play an important role in helping American families recover from the inflation that was unleashed by the Biden Administration.' Trump also announced Tuesday several health-related nominees, including his choice of health economist Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to lead the National Institutes of Health. Bhattacharya was a sharp critic of lockdowns and vaccine mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic. Trump said Bhattacharya will work with Robert F. Kennedy Jr., the nominee to lead the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), 'to direct the Nation’s Medical Research, and to make important discoveries that will improve Health, and save lives.' 'Together, Jay and RFK Jr. will restore the NIH to a Gold Standard of Medical Research as they examine the underlying causes of, and solutions to, America’s biggest Health challenges, including our Crisis of Chronic Illness and Disease,' Trump said. Another nomination announced Tuesday was Trump’s pick of former HHS official Jim O’Neill to serve as the agency’s deputy secretary. Trump also said he was nominating private investor John Phelan to serve as secretary of the Navy. Earlier Tuesday, Trump’s transition team announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding with the Biden administration about the process of starting to work with federal agencies. A statement from Susie Wiles, Trump’s chief of staff, said, 'This engagement allows our intended Cabinet nominees to begin critical preparations, including the deployment of landing teams to every department and agency, and complete the orderly transition of power.' Wiles’ announcement said the transition will use only private funding, and the donors will be disclosed to the public. The Trump-Vance transition team will not use government offices or technology, Wiles said. She added that the transition has an existing ethics plan and 'security and information protections built in, which means we will not require additional government and bureaucratic oversight.' The signing of the MOU means that teams from the transition will 'quickly integrate directly into federal agencies and departments with access to documents and policy sharing,' Wiles’ announcement said.

China declines comment on marriage of son of jailed official Bo Xilai	BEIJING — China declined on Wednesday to comment about the marriage of the son of jailed former leader Bo Xilai to an individual from Taiwan, saying only that it opposed 'malicious' speculation about the matter. Public discussion is taboo in the case of Bo, once considered a contender for top leadership but jailed for life in 2013, and the issue of his son's marriage is made even more sensitive by the poor state of China's ties with Taiwan. Asked about the wedding at a regular news briefing in Beijing, Chen Binhua, a spokesperson for China's Taiwan Affairs Office, said he could not comment. But he added the government 'was opposed to maliciously hyping it up.' Pressed by a reporter on further questions about the son, Bo Guagua, Chen said he had nothing more to say about 'that marriage.' The father was found guilty of corruption and abuse of power in a dramatic fall from grace linked to the killing of British businessman Neil Heywood. The mother was found guilty of murdering Heywood and is also in jail in China. Last week, Taiwan's government said Bo Guagua was visiting the democratically governed island, which China claims as its own, though Taipei rejects the sovereignty claims, following his marriage to a Taiwanese citizen. Reuters has not been able to contact the Oxford- and Harvard-educated Bo Guagua for comment. He has lived outside China and kept a low profile since his parents were jailed. It is not known if he has returned to China during that time. Reuters has also not able to confirm whom he had married. Wednesday's news conference was carried live online by state media, but the official transcript omitted the question about Bo Guagua.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-declines-comment-on-marriage-of-son-of-jailed-official-bo-xilai/7878438.html	2024-11-26T21:50:02-08:00	
Malaysia drops 1MDB-linked charges against ex-PM Najib, former treasury official	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia — A Malaysian court on Wednesday allowed corruption charges linked to the multibillion-dollar 1MDB scandal filed against jailed former Prime Minister Najib Razak and the former treasury chief to be dropped, their lawyers said. Najib faces several trials linked to the scandal at state fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB), from which Malaysian and U.S. authorities say about $4.5 billion was stolen in a complex, globe-spanning scheme between 2009 and 2014. Najib, who helped found 1MDB when he was premier in 2009, was found guilty of corruption and money laundering in a case linked to the scandal and sentenced to 12 years in prison in 2022, though the term was later halved by a pardon's board chaired by Malaysia's king. He last month apologized for his role in mishandling the 1MDB scandal, though he maintained he had no knowledge of any illegal transfers from the state fund. Najib and former treasury secretary-general Irwan Serigar Abdullah had been charged in 2018 with six counts of criminal breach of trust involving government funds worth 6.6 billion ringgit, or $1.48 billion, which officials have said were related to a settlement agreement between 1MDB and Abu Dhabi state fund International Petroleum Investment Company. The pair consistently denied wrongdoing. The Kuala Lumpur High Court granted their bid for a discharge not amounting to an acquittal, due to procedural delays and the failure of the prosecution to disclose key documents, their lawyers said. 'The court correctly exercised its jurisdiction to discharge our client of the charges, consonant with the law,' Najib's lawyer Muhammad Farhan Muhammad Shafee said in a text message. The decision is likely to prompt further questions over the remaining cases against Najib, after prosecutors last year did not appeal his acquittal in a separate 1MDB-related case. That came amid accusations that current Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who was voted in two years ago on an anti-corruption platform, is backsliding on promised reforms. Anwar has said he remains committed to tackling graft but does not interfere in court cases. Najib has also been pushing to serve the remainder of his sentence under house arrest, and has filed a case to compel the government to confirm the existence of a royal order that he says would allow him to do so. Anwar's government said last month it would introduce a law allowing house arrest for some offenses next year, though it denied that was aimed at getting Najib or other politicians accused of corruption out of jail.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malaysia-drops-1mdb-linked-charges-against-ex-pm-najib-former-treasury-official/7878436.html	2024-11-26T21:44:47-08:00	
Brazil police report: Bolsonaro directly involved in 2022 coup plot	BRASILIA, BRAZIL — Brazil's federal police presented evidence to the Supreme Court that former President Jair Bolsonaro was directly involved in plotting a coup to overturn the outcome of the 2022 election he lost, according to an 884-page report unsealed on Tuesday. The final police report, the result of a nearly two-year investigation, lays out evidence gathered from search warrants, wiretaps, financial records and plea bargain testimony pointing to a criminal conspiracy with Bolsonaro at the helm. 'Bolsonaro effectively planned, directed and executed, in coordination with other officials since at least 2019, concrete acts that aimed at the abolition of the democratic rule of law, with him remaining as president,' the report said. Police also found that Bolsonaro had 'full knowledge' of a plan to assassinate Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, then president-elect, and his running mate, based on dialog captured between conspirators and meetings at the presidential residence. The report cites eight main pieces of evidence to back up the formal accusation against Bolsonaro in the alleged coup attempt, including a meeting he called in December 2022 with top commanders of the armed forces, presenting them with a proposed coup d'état and asking them to join the conspiracy. The army and air force commanders refused, according to police, while the navy commander, now retired Admiral Almir Garnier Santos, expressed support, according to investigators. Garnier Santos was one of the 37 people, most retired and some active-duty military officers, including Bolsonaro whom police formally accused last week of a role in the planned coup. The country's prosecutor general, Paulo Gonet, will now decide whether to press charges against Bolsonaro and his alleged co-conspirators. Bolsonaro was formally accused in the attempted coup, along with violent abolition of the democratic rule of law and criminal organization. Bolsonaro has denied committing any crime. On Monday, he told journalists in Brasilia that he had never discussed a coup. His lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the full report on Tuesday. A representative for Garnier did not immediately respond to request for comment. Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes on Tuesday lifted the seal on the police report regarding the alleged coup plot. Bolsonaro's defense minister, now retired General Walter Braga Netto, also played an important role in planning the alleged coup, the police investigation found. Not only did he encourage Bolsonaro's allies to attack the armed forces commanders on social media for not joining the coup plot, he held a meeting at his house where the assassination of Lula and his Vice President-elect Geraldo Alckmin was discussed and approved, the report said. Braga Netto, who was Bolsonaro's running mate in the 2022 election, has denied this. 'It was never a coup, much less a plan to murder someone,' he said in a social media post following last week’s official accusation. Bolsonaro never recognized his defeat by Lula, who was sworn in as president on January 1, 2023. The formal police accusations against Bolsonaro are a fresh blow to his plan to run for president in 2026. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's recent victory had buoyed Bolsonaro allies in trying to overturn a court decision that has blocked him from public office for attacking the legitimacy of the 2022 vote. Federal police finished two separate criminal probes of Bolsonaro and his associates earlier this year formally accusing them of tampering with COVID-19 vaccination cards while in office and of embezzling jewelry gifted by the Saudi government. Reuters reported last week, citing sources, that Gonet is planning to merge the three investigations into Bolsonaro's actions against Brazil's democratic system and produce one single global indictment against him. Because of that, Brazil's top public prosecutor is not likely to issue any indictments until next year for Bolsonaro, members of his government and military officers who allegedly planned the coup, they said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7878411.html	2024-11-26T19:19:45-08:00	
Russia launches largest drone attack of war, pushes deeper into Ukraine	Russia launched its largest drone strike on Ukraine overnight with 188 drones, Ukraine's air force said Tuesday. Ukraine's military said it shot down 76 Russian drones in the overnight attacks that targeted areas across the country and damaged critical infrastructure facilities. The air force said Russia also used four missiles in the aerial assault. 'Unfortunately, there were hits to critical infrastructure facilities, and private and apartment buildings were damaged in several regions due to the massive drone attack,' according to an air force statement. The attack coincided with a push by Russia on the front lines in eastern Ukraine, where Russia claimed to have gained nearly 240 square kilometers in the past week, for a total of about 600 square kilometers in November, Reuters reported, citing the Russian army and other analysts. For its part, Ukraine reporting repelling Russian troops from Kupiansk, a logistical center in Kharkiv, for the third time, according to Reuters. 'The only effective way to protect ourselves from this is to eliminate Russian weapons and Russian launchers directly on Russian territory,' Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in his nightly address. 'That is why the ability to strike Russian territory is so important to us. This is the only factor that can limit Russian terror and Russia's capacity to wage war in general,' he added. Countries that have given Ukraine weapons to fight Russia have been reluctant to give Ukraine permission to launch those weapons directly into Russia, but Zelenskyy said he is 'grateful to all the partners who understand this and convey it to other partners.' 'Nearly 200 Russian drones against Ukraine in one day — that is nearly 200 proofs that Russian ambitions are utterly detached from any ideas of real peace,' Zelenskyy said. Ukraine's president said rescue operations are still underway in Sumy, where Russia's barrage of drones targeted a vehicle service station. The president said two people had been killed in Sumy and 'one person is likely still trapped under the rubble.' Ukrainian air defenses shot down drones in the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Chernivtsi, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa, Poltava, Rivne, Sumy, Ternopil, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions. The power grid of Ternopil in western Ukraine, about 134 miles east of Poland was hit in the attack. 'The consequences are bad because the facility was significantly affected and this will have impact on the power supply of the entire region for a long time,' the governor of Tenopil, Vyacheslav Nehoda, said in a televised address. Serhiy Lysak, governor of Dnipropetrovsk, said on Telegram that one drone hit the center of Nikopol. Russia's Defense Ministry said Tuesday it shot down 39 Ukrainian aerial drones overnight. Most of the drones were shot down over the Rostov region, with other intercepts taking place over Bryansk, Belgorod, Kursk, Oryol, Voronezh and Russia-occupied Crimea. Officials in Rostov, Bryansk and Voronezh said on Telegram there were no reports of damage or casualties from the attacks. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-launches-largest-drone-attack-of-war-pushes-deeper-into-ukraine/7878395.html	2024-11-26T19:19:43-08:00	
Can China hit its 5% growth target under Trump’s tariffs?	The prospect of punishing new U.S. tariffs will hang over the deliberations at China's highest-level economic meeting when the Central Economic Work Conference of the Chinese Communist Party convenes for its annual session next month. A key function of the meeting will be to set the nation’s growth target for 2025, a task made more challenging by the prospect of tariffs that could stunt the crucial export sector. U.S. President-elect Donald Trump threatened repeatedly during his election campaign to swiftly impose a 60% tariff on Chinese-made goods. He wrote on his Truth Social account late Monday that he will impose 'an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of [China’s] many products coming into the United States of America.' Most of the Chinese government advisers interviewed for a Reuters report this month recommended that Beijing maintain an economic growth target of 5.0% for next year, the same target as 2024. Some said the country would have to launch stronger fiscal stimulus measures to offset the impact of new U.S. tariffs after Trump takes office in January. Cai Shenkun, an independent commentator in the United States, told VOA Mandarin that Beijing’s '5% target' is clearly based on political necessity, rather than a market perspective. After securing an extraordinary third term as president last year, Chinese leader Xi Jinping 'will have to give the CCP an explanation and a vision,' Cai said. 'He must make a good gesture. If he does not maintain the 5% target, his ruling position will be greatly threatened.' Si Ling, a financial scholar in Australia, said in a phone interview with VOA Mandarin that if China wants to achieve its goal of doubling the size of its economy from 2020 to 2035, the annual economic growth rate must reach 4%. 'China has taken into account the uncertainty factors, like external shocks when Trump pledged to impose high tariffs. China must face the sudden decline in GDP growth,' said Si. Reuters reported last month that China's economy is likely to expand 4.8% in 2024, missing the government's 5% growth target, and could slow to 4.5% in 2025. Si said the growth of China's current GDP is dependent on exports and investments. If Trump fulfills his promise to impose high tariffs on Chinese goods, the impact on China's economy will be profound, he said. 'China's advantages in industrial products exports, brought by high state subsidies, will be completely wiped out due to high tariffs,' Si said. 'Can the domestic market digest the industrial products intended for export? Many of these industrial enterprises have already begun to reduce their production scale. This means more people will lose their jobs.' Local debt and real estate woes Independent commentator Cai warned that overreliance on stimulus measures may exacerbate local government debt problems. 'Private capital does not dare to invest anymore. State-owned enterprises can no longer play the role of investment pioneers,' Cai said. '‘Maintaining the 5% target’ means printing a lot of cash, pouring it into the market, issuing a lot of treasury bonds and increasing the fiscal deficit. This is the only way. But it will have a great negative impact on the stability of the RMB currency value.' A new wave of property market challenges will likely occur in the next 10 years, Cai said. 'In the past, people saw property as a means of asset appreciation or value preservation. Now the future housing market looks dark to everyone. If we continue to build houses, who will buy them? In the end, it may only lead to an avalanche-like bubble, which will burst completely.' Kristalina Georgieva, managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said last month that unless China's economy shifts from an export and investment-driven model to a consumer demand-driven model, its economic growth may slow to 'well below 4%.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/can-china-hit-its-5-growth-target-under-trump-s-tariffs-/7878409.html	2024-11-26T19:11:47-08:00	
China state media dismiss Trump's tariff vow, focus on fentanyl	BEIJING — China's state media shrugged off U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's pledge to slap additional tariffs on Chinese goods in editorials late on Tuesday, accusing the former president of blaming China for the country's failure to address the fentanyl crisis. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, said on Monday he would impose 'an additional 10% tariff, above any additional tariffs' on imports from China. He previously said he would introduce tariffs in excess of 60% on Chinese goods. The tariff threat is rattling China's industrial complex, which sells goods worth more than $400 billion annually to the U.S. and hundreds of billions more in components for products Americans buy from elsewhere. Economists have begun downgrading their growth targets for the $19 trillion economy for 2025 and 2026. Editorials in Chinese communist party mouthpieces China Daily and the Global Times focused squarely on the reason Trump gave for imposing the tariffs: fentanyl. 'Scapegoating others can't end U.S.' drug crisis,' read the headline of a China Daily editorial on Tuesday, while the Global Times urged the 'U.S. not to take China's goodwill for granted regarding anti-drug cooperation after Trump's remarks.' 'The excuse the president-elect has given to justify his threat of additional tariffs on imports from China is farfetched,' China Daily said. 'The world sees clearly that the root cause of the fentanyl crisis in the U.S. lies with the U.S. itself,' it added. 'There are no winners in tariff wars. If the U.S. continues to politicize economic and trade issues by weaponizing tariffs, it will leave no party unscathed.' Trump's team maintains China is 'attacking' the U.S. with fentanyl. China is the dominant source of chemical precursors used by Mexican cartels to produce the deadly drug. Trump on Monday also pledged 25% tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada until they clamp down on drugs and migrants crossing the border. Trump is threatening Beijing with far higher tariffs than the 7.5%-25% levied on Chinese goods during his first term. S&P Global on Sunday lowered its growth forecast for China for 2025 and 2026 by 0.2 and 0.7 percentage point, respectively, to 4.1% and 3.8%, citing the impact Trump's tariffs could have. 'What we assumed in our baseline is an across-the-board increase from around 14% now to 25%. Thus, what we assumed is a bit more than the 10% on all imports from China,' said Louis Kuijs, Chief Asia Economist at S&P Global Ratings. 'For now, the only thing we know for sure is that the risks in this area are high.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-state-media-dismiss-trump-s-tariff-vow-focus-on-fentanyl/7878396.html	2024-11-26T19:00:13-08:00	
Promise and peril for Southeast Asia in Trump’s tariff talk	BANGKOK — Southeast Asia could see a new wave of factories moving in from China to evade the soaring tariffs U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has proposed to impose on the world’s second-largest economy, trade experts tell VOA. But the trade surpluses the region has built up with the United States and its heavy use of Chinese inputs for its own exports may blunt the benefits, they add. A number of firms with factories in China, both Chinese and foreign owned, moved their plants to Southeast Asia to skirt the tariffs Trump imposed on the country — as high as 25% on some goods — during his first term from 2017 to 2021. For his second term, which starts in January, Trump has threatened to push tariffs on all imports from China up to 60%. If that happens, 'the speed of relocation will increase, and we will almost certainly now be looking at a world of bifurcated supply chains,' said Jayant Menon, a senior fellow at Singapore’s ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute. 'What that means is a world where most important manufactured goods are produced not once but twice using two sets of supply chains,' he added, one for the U.S. and possibly European markets and another for everyone else. And whereas the first wave of relocations mostly brought Southeast Asia factories hungry for lots of cheap labor, he said the second could bring in factories that rely more on equipment, technology and other capital for making machines, electronics, cars and the like. 'Countries that can closely replicate the costs and conditions in China will benefit, and at the moment a lot of those countries are in Southeast Asia,' Menon said. 'Other countries can benefit if they respond to this opportunity, but at the moment Southeast Asia is the closest competitor.' Aat Pisanwanich, an associate professor at Thailand’s Center for International Trade Studies, agreed. Facing even higher U.S. tariffs than before, factories in China will 'come to Thailand and other ASEAN countries more than [during] Trump 1,' he said, referring to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and to Trump’s first term. Memon said most of the factories that left China for Southeast Asia after Trump’s first round of tariffs settled in Malaysia, Thailand and Vietnam and that those fleeing a second would follow suit. He added that Cambodia and Laos — both very close with China — as well as Indonesia could start to attract more interest as well. Some of the sub-region’s largest industrial park developers and operators have reportedly begun preparing for an expected influx already by expanding their sales teams and hiring more Chinese speakers. But trade experts say Trump’s take on tariffs, and on international trade in general, also poses risks for Southeast Asia that could dull, or even outstrip, the potential rewards. Trump has repeatedly railed against the trade surpluses many countries besides China have built up with the U.S. and suggested bringing them down with higher tariffs on their goods as well, or with other trade restrictions. That could prove problematic for many countries in Asia, and Vietnam especially, says Deborah Elms, head of trade policy at the Hinrich Foundation, a Singapore-based research group focused on sustainable global trade. Trump called Vietnam 'almost the single worst abuser' of the global trade system in 2019, when the country’s annual trade surplus with the U.S. stood at $55.8 billion. It has soared well past $100 billion since then. 'That’s put Vietnam quite high up in the crosshairs for retaliation this time, and that makes it a less popular location for firms because you don’t want to move out of China into Vietnam, only to find yourself hit with more tariffs and other kinds of trade restrictions because you’re now in Vietnam and they’re trying to reset the trade balance,' said Elms. Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand all now have trade surpluses with the U.S. in the tens of billions of dollars as well. The other major risk the region faces, experts say, is the growing attention the United States is paying to imports not only from China but from anywhere else with a large share of Chinese inputs, and the added trade curbs they too might face in Trump’s second term. 'That would present a real problem for Southeast Asia, because you can move manufacturing — you can sew a T-shirt in the region, you can make a phone case in the region, whatever, that goes to the United States — but a lot of the raw materials, parts and components in those products, whether it's fabrics or plastics or screws or whatever it is that’s in the product, is imported from China,' said Elms. Aat, of the Center for International Trade Studies, said factories that move to Southeast Asia to make exports but continue to draw heavily on Chinese inputs also crowd out producers across the sub-region that could be supplying them instead, leaving local economies with little to gain from their arrival. And even if Southeast Asian countries avoid the added U.S. tariffs or trade curbs many fear, they may still face the 10%-20% levy Trump has proposed imposing on all U.S. imports across the board. Elms says it’s also not clear how much of what Trump has said about tariffs he will actually follow through on, and how quickly, making the choice firms will face on whether to move out of China all the more difficult. Some of them will be 'dusting off' the relocation plans they shelved after Trump left office in 2021 for another look now that he is headed back to the White House, she said. 'Whether they execute those is still, I think, an open question,' she added. 'There are so many factors that matter, but there’s a reason why firms are so heavily located in China, and it’s because China just continues to have a speed and a scale that is hard for anywhere else to match.' Rather than move, Elms said some of those firms may end up choosing instead to absorb higher tariffs, if they can, or to focus on other markets besides the U.S. While that could give regional trade within Asia a boost, Aat and others fear it will flood Southeast Asia with cheap Chinese goods that undercut local producers. All three experts said Trump’s tough talk on tariffs ultimately holds more peril than promise for the countries of the region. 'In the short term, of course they will benefit from the massive relocation, if there’s an increase in this relocation,' said Menon. 'But eventually, as these things work themselves out, this is not going to be very beneficial.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/promise-and-peril-for-southeast-asia-in-trump-s-tariff-talk/7878390.html	2024-11-26T18:47:50-08:00

Strikes reach Syria's Homs province	Border crossings between Lebanon and Syria were targeted with strikes late Tuesday, Lebanon transportation minister Ali Hamieh said. Sana, Syria's state media, confirmed the strikes, which Hamieh said came just after a ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah was announced. Israel had increased raids on these crossings and had sealed off those roads to Syria, according to Reuters. Syrian state TV said 10 people were injured, three of them critically. Israel did not immediately comment. Earlier Tuesday, Syrian state news reported that two villages in Syria's Homs province were hit with strikes in what it described as Israeli aggression. A website affiliated with the Syrian opposition reported that 'the air defense is confronting Israeli missiles in the skies of Homs,' according to Ynetnews.com. Syrian state television said blasts had been heard near Homs city and their source was under investigation. Israel has conducted strikes against Iran-linked organizations in Syria for years. However, Israeli attacks on Syria have grown following Israel's war in Gaza that began in October 2023 and the ongoing hostilities between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon. The U.S. military also hit an Iranian-linked site in Syria on Tuesday, the U.S. Central Command said. The site was a weapons storage facility and was in retaliation for an attack on Monday on U.S. forces. Last week, the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported there have been more than 150 Israeli strikes on Syria this year. SOHR said the strikes targeted Iranian-back militants in Syria's provinces. Iran is a major supporter of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government, building a significant military presence in Syria in recent years, supported by dozens of proxy groups, including Hezbollah and several Iraqi militias. Local media reports in Syria last week said that amid increased Israeli strikes, Iran sent some of its proxies from Syria to Iraq, including at least a dozen high-ranking military advisers who had been deployed in Damascus and Palmyra. Seth Frantzman, an adjunct fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, has offered a different explanation for the movement of Iranian proxies in the region. 'Iran may be moving proxies around Iraq and Syria in order to threaten Israel and may feel the need to move them more often so that they preserve operational security in case of Israeli retaliation,' he told VOA. 'Iran also likely wants to mobilize proxy forces in case of a ceasefire in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah so it can increase threats to Israel on other fronts,' Frantzman said. Iran's Foreign Ministry recently said there has been no change in the status or number of their military advisers in Syria.

Southern African countries in bid to fight UK anti-hunting bill	GABORONE, BOTSWANA — Six southern African countries have voiced disappointment with new efforts by the British Labour Party government to introduce a bill that seeks to ban the importation of wildlife trophies from Africa. Representatives from the six nations have now requested a meeting with British government officials to discuss the issue. The Hunting Trophies (Import Prohibition) Bill was among a list of proposed laws that went for a first reading in the House of Commons in October. The second reading is in January. The Labour Party came into power this year promising to eliminate hunting in the United Kingdom within five years. Steve Reed, the secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs, introduced the bill that had collapsed under the Conservative government. Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, Tanzania, Zambia and Zimbabwe requested an urgent meeting with Reed. In a letter addressed to him on Monday, the countries' envoys want to know if the government will support the bill. U.K.-based Adam Hart, professor and conservation scientist at the University of Gloucestershire in England, says the reintroduction of the bill is counterproductive. 'It is disappointing that the government are bringing the bill back. It is going to waste more parliamentary time,' said Hart. 'If it is passed, it will have no conservation benefits whatsoever as has been shown in recent analysis. No hunted species is threatened by trophy hunting. In fact, trophy hunting is instrumental in protecting the habitat and their species in many cases.' The southern African countries are concerned that a group of animal welfare organizations, some from Africa, support the proposed ban. The nations argue the lobby undermines their position on hunting as the affected countries. Hart said the meeting between the nations' representatives and Reed is important. 'It is also disappointing that the government doesn't seem to want to listen to nations that are much more successful than the U.K., and they are not willing to take the advice of those people or even listen to them,' said Hart. 'So hopefully, they will take this meeting, and they will consider what is going on in the nations that the largely populist agenda is going to affect.' Conservationists opposed to animal hunts argue the killings could drive endangered species to extinction. Botswana-based conservationist Neil Fitt supports trophy hunting but says it should be done ethically. 'Trophy hunting is a viable contributor to ecosystem management from financial and animal numbers point of view,' said Fitt. 'It is definitely a tool which is in the toolbox for management and needs to stay there, provided quotas are issued on a scientific basis. Not all have been in the recent past, and that hunting is undertaken ethically.' Botswana, with the largest elephant herd in the world at more than 130,000, has been at the forefront of a campaign against efforts by the United Kingdom and other European nations to ban hunting trophies from Africa. Southern Africa is home to some of the world's largest wildlife populations, including more than 230,000 elephants. Fitt said it is up to the southern African countries to convince the U.K. and the rest of the world that trophy hunting is sustainable. 'Should Britain and/or others stop the importation, to be honest, that is absolutely up to them as a sovereign state,' said Fitt. 'We as an independent sovereign state do not like to be told what we can do. What we need to do is demonstrate — which I hope the people are trying to do — the viability of it, the ethics and the sustainability for the whole environment of our country and other countries.' With more than 6.4 million hunters, Europe is a major importer of hunting trophies from Africa.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southern-african-countries-in-fresh-bid-to-fight-uk-anti-hunting-bill/7878054.html	2024-11-26T16:16:23-08:00	
Report exposes legal loopholes protecting rapists in Africa	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — A report by the international NGO Equality Now says the definition of rape in 25 African countries has allowed many perpetrators to go unpunished. Such narrow definitions, it says, often allow charges against accused rapists to be reduced to lesser crimes with lower penalties. The findings are part of a 46-page study uncovering gaps in legislation, implementation, and access to justice for rape victims in 47 African countries. The report says globally, 35% of women have experienced either physical or sexual violence, and that about 33% of women in Africa have experienced sexual violence in their lifetime. High rates of sexual violence have been documented during conflicts in Ethiopia, Sudan, and the Democratic Republic of Congo, says the report, which adds that in those countries, rape was used as a weapon of war to denigrate, disempower, and demoralize communities. Sally Ncube is a regional representative for southern Africa at Equality Now. She told VOA via a messaging app from Zimbabwe that narrow legal definitions of rape have long promoted impunity for perpetrators in many countries. 'For example, rape committed within an intimate partner relationship or relegate these violations to lesser offenses with lesser penalties which create a hierarchy of abuse and sending a confused signal about the absolute right of each individual to bodily autonomy,' Ncube said. The report names 25 African countries where the legal definition of rape may be too narrow. They include Cameroon, South Sudan, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Gabon, Gambia, Mozambique and Malawi. Zione Lapani coordinates the victim support unit at the Blantyre Police Station in Malawi. She told VOA about a case in which a married woman complained to police after her husband sexually abused her. Lapani said they did not open a case after a discussion with the couple that established that the man forced himself on his wife after being denied sex for so long because of some family matters. 'We said, 'No, this is not very big because there was something inside both of you which you didn't communicate.' This no longer rape but just because the man was tired because the lady was giving punishment to the man,' said Lapani. An Equality Now report about gaps in family laws released earlier this year found that Malawian customary law presumes perpetual consent to sex within marriage and that a wife can deny her husband sex only when she is sick or legally separated. Ncube said African governments should ensure that the crime of rape meets international human rights law standards. 'By providing clear definitions based on consent rather than just force,' said Ncube. 'That all forms of penetration that are sexual in nature are included no matter how slight they are, and that there is no form of hierarchy in punishment in form of rape of penetration.' However, the report says Rwanda has taken significant steps to promote a victim-centered approach to investigating and prosecuting sexual violence cases. It also says Senegal has taken a similar approach by establishing 'law shops' offering judicial, legal and psycho-social services. And in Malawi, the courts have started giving stiffer punishments to convicted rapists. For example, in 2021, a high court in southern Malawi sentenced a 33-year-old man to 40 years in prison for raping a 9-year-old child.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7877998.html	2024-11-26T15:34:27-08:00

Nigerian activists, lawmakers coalesce against gender-based violence	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Hundreds of people, including women’s rights activists, Nigerian lawmakers, and other participants, chanted as they walked from the National Assembly through the streets of Abuja on Monday. The rally was part of Nigeria's participation in the United Nations-backed '16 Days of Activism,' a campaign against gender-based violence, running from November 25 to December 10. It also was an opportunity to announce the latest efforts by authorities to address gender-based violence — also referred to as GBV — in Nigeria. Abbas Tajudeen, Nigeria's speaker of the House of Representatives, led lawmakers to the rally. It took place on the 25th anniversary of the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women. 'Every 10 minutes a woman is being killed across the world. This is an unacceptable trend; this is an unforgivable trend,' said Tajudeen. 'We in the parliament must have to unite more than ever before with relevant authorities, particularly the law enforcement in ensuring that we cut this dangerous trend to the barest minimum.' Gender-based violence is a global problem. Nigerian authorities say about one-third of women between 15 and 49 experiences physical and sexual assault in their lifetimes. The country also accounts for approximately 20 million GBV survivors — or about 10% of the global total. Poor awareness, a low rate of reporting, cultural and religious biases, and trust deficits in the justice system are some of the challenges hampering efforts to address GBV in Nigeria. Raquel Kasham Daniel is the founder of the non-profit 'Beyond the Classroom Foundation,' which promotes the rights of girls through education and advocacy. 'I think that policies that protect women and put the perpetrators behind bars will be very helpful,' said Daniel, whose foundation is championing the sexual harassment bill in tertiary education. 'That will be a very good one to pass, we hope that it gets the presidential assent soon.' Nigeria had previously launched a 'sex offenders' registry to name and shame perpetrators of violence against women. On Monday, Women Affairs Minister Imaan Suleiman-Ibrahim announced the launch of a national electronic dashboard system to improve data collection and accountability. Suleiman-Ibrahim said that besides preventive measures, authorities will review existing laws to ensure they protect survivors of gender-based violence. 'This occasion provides us yet another opportunity to renew those commitments and take deliberate actions to protect the rights, safety and dignity of women, girls and vulnerable people across Nigeria, said Suleiman-Ibrahim. As authorities continue to make efforts to address the problem, many hope the new intervention offers a lifeline to millions of vulnerable people. Africa recorded the highest rates of intimate partner and family-related femicide last year, followed by the Americas and Oceania, according to the United Nations’ Office on Drugs and Crime.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigerian-activists-lawmakers-coalesce-against-gender-based-violence/7877944.html	2024-11-26T13:38:49-08:00	
Ceasefire deal: Hezbollah to move north, Israeli troops to gradually withdraw	JERUSALEM — Israel and Lebanon have signed a ceasefire agreement after more than 13 months of conflict. According to the deal, Hezbollah troops will move north of the Litani River and Israeli troops will withdraw from south Lebanon. The Israeli Cabinet voted Tuesday to approve the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hezbollah, which will take effect on Wednesday at 10 a.m. Speaking on Israeli TV, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that Israel retains freedom of movement to attack the Iran-backed Shia militant group if it violates the ceasefire. Netanyahu said, 'If Hezbollah violates the agreement and tries to rearm, we will attack. If it tries to rebuild terror infrastructure near the border, we will attack.' The prime minister said Israel has set Hezbollah back decades by assassinating leader Hassan Nasrallah as well as thousands of other Hezbollah fighters and destroying much of Hezbollah’s attack capability. According to the terms of the ceasefire, Hezbollah will move its soldiers north of the Litani River as called for by U.N. Resolution 1701. Israeli troops will gradually withdraw from south Lebanon, and acting Lebanese Prime Minister Nagib Mikati said 5,000 Lebanese soldiers will be deployed there. Netanyahu said the ceasefire will enable more than 60,000 residents who have been displaced from their homes in northern Israel to return. More than a million Lebanese have also been displaced on the other side of the border. But some are skeptical that the ceasefire will really mean the end to Hezbollah attacks on northern Israel. Middle East expert Eitan Shamir of Bar Ilan University said Israel has achieved its objectives in the fight against Hezbollah. 'We are at a point of diminishing returns,' Shamir said. 'A lot of effort, getting some casualties, we will probably get more casualties if we continue. On the other hand, most of the damage has already been done to Hezbollah. The idea from the get-go was not to completely destroy Hezbollah and getting it to a situation where it has to surrender. From the minute this campaign was launched, there was an understanding that Hezbollah will continue to be a serious actor in Lebanon.' The big question is how the ceasefire deal in Lebanon will affect the fighting in Gaza. Netanyahu said that Israel will continue to fight in Gaza until Hamas is annihilated and all remaining hostages, living and dead, are returned.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ceasefire-deal-hezbollah-to-move-north-of-litani-river-israeli-troops-to-gradually-withdraw/7877957.html	2024-11-26T13:19:42-08:00	
Uyghur exiles accuse Xinjiang’s leader of repression beyond borders	WASHINGTON — Exiled members of China’s Uyghur minority group accuse Beijing of human rights violations and say the Communist Party chief in the Xinjiang region where most of them are from has been more heavy-handed in his approach toward them than his predecessor. Members of the largely Turkic Muslim minority group said they had hoped Ma Xingrui, with his technocratic background, might moderate the region’s hardline stance, but three years into his current position, observers said the opposite is happening in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region in northwest China. 'Under Ma’s watch, arbitrary detentions have persisted, and forced labor has expanded, especially in Belt and Road projects,' said Abduweli Ayup, a Norway-based Uyghur activist. China’s Belt and Road Initiative is a global infrastructure and trade endeavor that has lasted for more than 10 years. Ayup also said that under Ma, 240 Uyghurs who sought refuge in cities such as Shanghai and Beijing were forced to return to Xinjiang. 'These individuals were arrested and forcibly returned to Xinjiang, where their fates remain uncertain,' Ayup told VOA, citing information from trusted sources from China. Obtaining and verifying information from inside China has been challenging due to the government's tight control over communications and the people’s fear of repercussions for disclosing sensitive details. Despite the risks, Uyghurs from within and outside of China rely on discreet networks and encrypted messaging to get the word out, often at great peril, according to Ayup and other exiles. Activists said they notice during Ma’s tenure, he has not only upheld but intensified the internment of over 1 million Uyghurs, turning temporary detentions into long-term imprisonments. The United States and Canada have accused China of genocide. The European Union and rights organizations have condemned China’s policies against the Uyghurs and described Beijing’s approach as crimes against humanity. Chinese authorities deny allegations of repression in Xinjiang, framing their policies as efforts to combat 'terrorism, extremism and separatism.' 'China is a law-based country. Judicial departments handle cases in accordance with law,' Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, wrote in a response to a VOA request for comment. Repression extends beyond Xinjiang Observers said Beijing’s narrative sharply contradicts firsthand accounts and international reports that accuse China of human rights abuses, including mass detentions and cultural erasure. Some Uyghurs have tried to move out of Xinjiang and away from the scrutiny of Chinese officials within the region. But the crackdown has spilled beyond Xinjiang’s borders, targeting Uyghurs in other parts of China, Ayup said. One such case involves Irpan Yarmemet, a Uyghur content producer who was arrested in Shanghai in September for traveling to Turkey eight years ago to study. Ayup said Yarmemet was living in Shanghai for fear of arbitrary detention in Xinjiang. After his arrest, he was detained in Xinjiang. It is unknown whether he is charged or convicted of a crime. 'His hopes of staying safe by avoiding Xinjiang were dashed,' Ayup said. 'The recent arrests and forced returns show that the crackdown under Ma Xingrui has no geographical boundaries.' The human cost Uyghur exile Madina Mehmet, now living in the Netherlands, said leaving China was a matter of survival. In 2012, she enrolled at Beijing Foreign Studies University but was forced out after just a year. 'They kept pressuring me to remove my headscarf,' Mehmet said. 'They wouldn’t let me live in peace. I couldn’t take it anymore.' She eventually secured a university scholarship in Turkey, where she lived and studied for eight years. She then moved to the Netherlands. However, Beijing’s reach continued to haunt her. 'While I was in Turkey, Chinese officials demanded proof that I was a student there,' she said. 'Even now, they interrogate my mother in Urumqi, asking for my address and details about my life in the Netherlands.' Urumqi is Xinjiang’s capital. Mehmet said her relatives have also been scrutinized for their travels. She said almost a decade ago, her sister, Mihray Mehmet, cousin and aunt had either studied or traveled to Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, all countries Beijing has deemed sensitive. In late 2021, Madina Mehmet said, the three women were detained in Urumqi. They were falsely accused of being 'connected to terrorist organizations,' said Mehmet. Rights groups reported that Uyghurs who had visited a sensitive country prior to 2017 would be scrutinized for possible arrests and interrogations. 'My sister was an exceptional student,' Mehmet said of her sister, who was attending Xinjiang Medical University when her academic aspirations were derailed by state harassment over her headscarf. 'Teachers humiliated her by forcibly removing it in front of her classmates,' Mehmet said. Mihray Mehmet eventually left university to study in Egypt — a decision later used to justify her detention. VOA asked the Chinese Embassy in Washington about Mihray Mehmet’s case, and Liu responded by saying, 'I have not heard about the case you mentioned.' Last year, Madina Mehmet’s aunt was released from detention, but her sister and cousin were sentenced to at least seven years in prison. 'They’ve committed no crime,' Mehmet told VOA. 'My sister’s children — just 3 and 5 years old when she was arrested — are growing up without their mother.' Despite the risks of speaking out, Madina Mehmet refuses to stay silent. 'I want the Chinese government to release my sister and cousin,' she said. 'They deserve to be free, to raise their children, to live without fear.' Targeting prominent Uyghurs Rehmutulla Semet, the vice chair of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Xinjiang and a prominent real estate developer, was also a target of China’s Xinjing policies. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison in 2021 on charges of 'assisting terrorist activities' and 'gathering a crowd to disrupt public order,' according to a source who requested anonymity out of fear of reprisal. Sources close to Semet fear retaliation and request not to be revealed but told VOA the charges are false. They said he was targeted due to his ethnicity, social status and wealth. Since Ma’s arrival in Xinjiang, Semet’s assets, valued at more than $400 million, have been seized. Some of his assets were auctioned off on platforms such as Douyin, China’s domestic version of TikTok. 'One of his signature buildings, the Gold Coin Hill Building, a high-rise in Urumqi, was among those auctioned off,' a source told VOA. 'He owned similar buildings in other major cities in the region, all of which were officially confiscated by the government this past August.' Ayup said such prosecutions are part of a broader pattern of stripping influential Uyghurs of their wealth and silencing dissent. Mehmet and Ayup are part of a growing number of Uyghur exiles who are calling for international accountability and action. 'The world must act — justice for Uyghurs is long overdue,' Mehmet said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uyghur-exiles-accuse-xinjiang-s-leader-of-repression-beyond-borders/7877900.html	2024-11-26T12:50:33-08:00	
Jordan airdrops aid to northern Gaza for first time in 5 months	AMMAN — Jordanian military planes dropped aid to northern Gaza on Tuesday for the first time in five months to help relieve the dire humanitarian situation in the enclave, the army said. Two C-130 planes belonging to the Jordanian air force dropped the cargo, comprising nearly seven tons of food and other essential relief, to areas the United Nations agencies identified as most in need, the army said. 'The kingdom is maintaining an air and land corridor as part of its efforts to step up aid,' an army source told Reuters. A U.N. aid official said last week that Gaza aid access had reached a low point, with deliveries to parts of the besieged north of the enclave all but impossible. Jordan has been air-dropping aid and sending convoys westward overland to the Palestinians in Gaza throughout the war that erupted in October 2023 between Israel and Hamas, the Islamist group that has been ruling the enclave. The army said it has so far launched about 400 such operations by its air force and allied countries. King Abdullah has accused Israel of placing obstacles to deliveries and has called on the international community to put pressure on Israel to allow uninterrupted aid flows. Washington has prodded Israel to expand the use of a land corridor through Jordan that first began late last year. The World Food Program wants it to be a major conduit for the supply of U.N.-funded food and humanitarian aid to Gaza. Israeli officials deny accusations they are deliberately using aid as a political weapon and say they have been seeking to alleviate the humanitarian situation since the start of the war.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jordan-airdrops-aid-to-northern-gaza-for-first-time-in-five-months-official-source/7877894.html	2024-11-26T12:33:23-08:00	
Palestinians fear Israel's UNRWA ban will spark disaster	GAZA STRIP/ISTANBUL — In northern Gaza, families are still fleeing what is left of their homes. 'They told us to leave immediately,' said one woman, who stopped briefly to tell a VOA cameraman what is going on. Families behind her streamed down the bombed-out street, carrying belongings in backpacks and plastic sacks, and other items, such as pans and buckets, in their hands. 'We have nothing else to lose. We lost our children. We lost everything,' she said, as a male family member urged her to keep moving. The United Nations said the Israeli military is 'subjecting an entire population to bombing, siege and risk of starvation.' And in the next two months, the situation could get immeasurably worse, added Roger Hearn, director of relief and social services for UNRWA, the U.N.’s agency for Palestinian refugees. Over the objections of much of the international community, Israeli laws that would essentially halt UNRWA operations in the Gaza Strip are expected to take effect in late January. 'People are facing catastrophic hunger in Gaza,' said Hearn in a phone interview from an airport on his way home from Gaza. 'People are struggling to get the basics, such as water. Most people in Gaza are displaced. … So, to actually take that one step further and say, ‘OK, UNRWA is forbidden from working in Gaza,’ would be a very cruel addition to a situation where people are already in dire need.' Israel accuses UNRWA of having Hamas members among its staff in Gaza, including participants of the October 7, 2023, terror attack that sparked the war when Hamas-led militants killed about 1,200 Israelis and kidnapped more than 250 others. The United States, Britain and other Western countries designate Hamas as a terror group. In a letter to the U.N. early this month, Israel withdrew from the 1967 agreement recognizing UNRWA, according to The Times of Israel. 'UNRWA — the organization whose employees participated in the October 7th massacre and many of whose employees are Hamas operatives — is part of the problem in the Gaza Strip and not part of the solution,' said Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz, according to the news site. And while UNRWA disputes these allegations, Hearn said the most urgent issue on their agenda is trying to convince Israel not to implement the new laws. People in Gaza are now starving, even as trucks containing enough food to feed the Strip for months languish across the border in Egypt. Aid that gets in is hard to distribute amid ongoing battles, bombings and looting. Aid workers in Gaza say they still have hope that the laws will not go into force. 'We hope that the active parties in the international community will intervene and prevent this disaster,' said Abu Sharaf Jadallah, a local leader and relief worker who helps distribute UNRWA aid in Gaza. 'It is the only party now that is providing aid to all Palestinians, to 2 million displaced people.' Long-term losses Further south, in Khan Younis and Deir Albalah, Gaza, where conditions for displaced families are marginally better than in the north, humanitarian aid is not nearly enough to feed the people. They are malnourished and increasingly sick. Soon, many also may face starvation. Families here say they fear that if UNRWA stops working in Gaza, they will have even less access to food and clean water. However, the long-term consequences of an UNRWA ban could be even more devastating, they say. Before the current war, UNRWA was providing education for 350,000 children in Gaza. Palestinians in general, and Gaza specifically, have one of the world’s highest literacy rates. But that status is already in jeopardy as children here face a second year without classes. UNRWA schools now mostly serve as crowded and undersupplied emergency shelters. But locals say that to cripple the future education system at this time would be a massive blow. 'It will be a terrible thing,' said Rasheed Abu Eida, a 50-year-old father of six. 'A country deprived of education.' Now, his children are just trying to survive, he said. Besides trauma from constant bombings, they have suffered from severe weight loss and other illnesses. 'My children are destroyed,' Eida said. New law controversy The international community has widely objected to the laws, with U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres saying, 'It would be a catastrophe in what is already an unmitigated disaster.' The laws were approved by Israel’s parliament in late October and would bar UNRWA from operating in Israel, which controls all access to Gaza, and curtail the agency’s activities inside the Strip. Israel has said that more than 10% of the UNRWA staff of about 13,000 people in Gaza has ties to Hamas, and that 12 employees participated in the October 7 attack. UNRWA has fired nine employees in response to these allegations and says it has seen no evidence to support the claim that more than 1,400 other staff members have ties to Hamas. Israel says other organizations and U.N. agencies can take up the work of UNRWA, but the U.N. says it would be virtually impossible to replace UNRWA’s complex systems on the ground during war time. Locals say the potential loss of the organization, which has been helping Palestinians since 1950, is unthinkable. The organization serves Palestinian communities in Gaza, the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan. 'A ban on UNRWA would mean no care for refugees,' said Fatma Alzahraa Sharqawy, a displaced mother of four. 'And not only the refugees who left their villages and cities in the past, but all of Palestine. So, if the United Nations and UNRWA is banned, it means the international community has abandoned the Palestinian cause.'

One killed in Bangladesh as Hindu protesters clash with police	DHAKA — At least one person was killed in Bangladesh in clashes between security forces and Hindus protesting the arrest of a religious leader, police said, even as neighboring India urged that the safety of Hindus and minorities be ensured. Chinmoy Krishna Das, a Hindu leader associated with the International Society for Krishna Consciousness, or ISKCON, was arrested at the Dhaka airport on Monday on several charges, including sedition. His arrest sparked protests by his supporters in both the capital Dhaka and Chittagong city. 'A Muslim lawyer defending Das was killed amid protests outside the court [in Chittagong],' said police officer Liaquat Ali. A probe has been ordered into the alleged killing, the caretaker government said in a statement, adding that Chief Adviser Muhammad Yunus had directed law enforcement agencies to step up security in the port city. 'The interim government is committed to ensuring and upholding communal harmony in Bangladesh at any cost,' the government said. Das faces sedition charges filed in October after leading a large rally in Chittagong, in which he was accused of disrespecting Bangladesh’s national flag and was denied bail by a court in Chittagong on Tuesday. 'Rampage' When Das was being escorted back to prison from court, more than 2,000 supporters surrounded the van, blocking it for over two hours, said Chittagong Metropolitan Police Commissioner Hasib Aziz. 'They went on a rampage, throwing bricks at us. To disperse the crowd, we had to fire tear gas. No one was seriously injured, but one of our constables was hurt,' Aziz said. India condemned the arrest of Das, saying in a sternly worded statement that the perpetrators of documented vandalism and arson against minorities as well as those who desecrated deities remained at large. Hindu-majority India has strong cultural and business ties with its neighbor, and Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government has expressed concern over a spate of attacks on Hindus. 'It is unfortunate that, while the perpetrators of these incidents remain at large, charges should be pressed against a religious leader presenting legitimate demands through peaceful gatherings,' the Indian foreign ministry statement said. Bangladesh's foreign ministry, responding to India, said the government does not interfere in the judiciary's work, and the matter was being dealt with by the court of law. 'The Government of Bangladesh is also committed to upholding communal harmony in the country,' the ministry said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/one-killed-in-bangladesh-as-hindu-protesters-clash-with-police-/7877840.html	2024-11-26T11:42:18-08:00

Israel bombards Hezbollah targets near Beirut as Israeli officials weigh cease-fire	The Israeli military bombarded Hezbollah militant targets in Beirut’s southern suburbs on Tuesday. The strike came hours ahead of a scheduled meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and senior Cabinet ministers on whether to accept a cease-fire deal to halt more than a year of fighting. The Israeli attacks targeted 20 buildings that the military said were Hezbollah strongholds, warning noncombatant residents living there to flee to safety and maintain a distance of at least 500 meters. It was the largest number of buildings the Israel Defense Forces had warned about in a single day of an impending attack. The airstrikes sent billowing clouds of dark smoke into the sky over the Lebanese capital. At least 10 of the strikes were simultaneous, in what the Israeli air force described as 'a widespread attack.' The attacks appeared to be a last attempt by Israel to gain the upper hand in its war with Hezbollah, since Netanyahu has signaled he is open to a cease-fire to end the Jewish state’s 13-month conflict with Hezbollah. The militants began attacking Israel in October 2023 in support of Hamas militants fighting a war with Israel in Gaza. The Cabinet-level talks were set to take place at the Israeli military headquarters in Tel Aviv. The cease-fire deal, brokered by U.S. and French diplomats, would halt the fighting and start a 60-day period in which Israel and Hezbollah would both withdraw from southern Lebanon. Israeli forces would move south of the Lebanon-Israel border, while Hezbollah would retreat north of the Litani River. The plan calls for the Lebanese army, which is not involved in the Israeli-Hezbollah fighting, to patrol the region between the two warring sides. Netanyahu is reportedly in favor of the deal, but it is not clear whether some of his far-right colleagues in the Israeli parliament will go along with the proposal. Hezbollah leader Naim Qassem suggested last week that the militants would agree to a truce if Israel stopped attacks on Lebanon and that Lebanon retained its sovereignty. But difficulties remain in reaching a cease-fire, such as how Hezbollah’s withdrawal from the border area will be monitored and whether Israel will have freedom to strike the militants if it decides it must to maintain its security. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called on Israel to agree to the cease-fire, saying there are 'no more excuses.' Speaking to reporters ahead of a meeting of G7 foreign ministers in Italy, Borrell said a cease-fire is 'absolutely necessary' for civilians displaced by several months of intensified fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border. The G7 comprises the world’s leading industrialized countries. Borrell expressed hope that Netanyahu’s government would approve a cease-fire on Tuesday without seeking to add additional stipulations that could delay or derail an agreement. 'No more excuses. No more additional requests. Stop this fighting. Stop killing people. And let’s start thinking on peace,' Borrell said. U.S. officials expressed hope Monday that a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah was close. Speaking to reporters during a press call, national security spokesman John Kirby described recent talks in Beirut led by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein as 'constructive,' adding, 'We believe that the trajectory of this is going in a very positive direction.' In New York on Monday, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said negotiations toward a cease-fire are 'moving forward' but have not been 'finalized.' He added that Israel would retain the ability to strike southern Lebanon under any agreement. 'We will make sure that we will have the ability to neutralize any threat that will not be dealt [with] in southern Lebanon. I hope that the Lebanese army will take care of that in the future, but if they will fail, again, we will be there,' Danon said. Meanwhile, Lebanon's deputy speaker, Elias Bou Saab, said there are no major obstacles to implementing a cease-fire deal. A five-nation committee, chaired by the United States and including France, will oversee the cease-fire process, according to Bou Saab. The fighting in Lebanon has caused a humanitarian crisis, displacing hundreds of thousands. On Monday, the United Nations World Food Program announced that it has provided emergency aid to more than a half million people in Lebanon since the conflict began. The WFP said it plans to reach 1 million people and is continuing to work to deliver critical assistance to affected communities. In the October 2023 attack on Israel that ignited the Middle East warfare, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,235 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. The Israeli military says the death toll includes thousands of Hamas fighters. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries.

Turkey threatens new Syria operation against Kurd militants	Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is warning of a new military operation into Syria to create a 30-kilometer-deep security zone. The operation is aimed at Kurdish militants, which Ankara accuses of being linked to PKK rebels fighting Turkey. Last month, the PKK carried out a deadly attack in the Turkish capital, Ankara.

Analysis: Adani's 'renewable energy marvel' trapped in US bribery indictment	NEW DELHI — Betting big on the clean energy goals of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, billionaire Gautam Adani found backers in France's TotalEnergies and the Qatar Investment Authority as he set out to build the world's biggest renewable energy project. The crown jewel of his company, Adani Green, is an energy park in western Gujarat state planned to be five times the size of Paris on completion, and producing 50 gigawatts by 2030, or roughly a tenth of India's clean energy goals. Now the plan faces a hurdle in the form of a U.S. indictment of Adani, his nephew and executive director Sagar Adani and managing director Vneet S. Jaain, accusing them of paying bribes of $265 million to secure Indian power supply contracts, and misleading U.S. investors during fund raises there. Since the news, stock of Adani Green has nosedived 36%, losing $9.6 billion in market value. Adani Group has denied the accusations in the U.S. indictment as baseless, and vowed to seek all legal recourse. But fund-raising could get complicated. 'To the extent of raising additional capital for newer projects, any sort of regulatory issues become problematic,' said Deepika Mundra, a senior analyst at M&G Investments based in Britain. 'Particularly if you want to tap international markets.' Adani Green is one of many public and private companies key to helping India achieve its goals, she added. 'It is quite important that all these (Adani Green) projects go through.' The Adani Green boom is reflected in a surge of 10,000% in its shares between 2018 and 2022 as power demand in India swells, spurring it to develop the energy park in Khavda in Gujarat. 'For us, this renewable energy park is a symbol of our commitment to sustainability and a symbol of national pride,' Adani wrote in his annual report in June. When complete, its output would be 'enough to power nations like Belgium, Chile, and Switzerland,' he added. Adani has committed investment of $100 billion in the renewables sector, seen as core to the ports-to-airports conglomerate that is worth more than $135 billion. Now the tide is turning for Adani Green, described by U.S. prosecutors as being at the heart of 'The Corrupt Solar Project.' After the U.S. indictment, TotalEnergies, which holds a stake of nearly 19.8% in Adani Green, was among the first to react, saying it would not invest more in the group for now. It had not been made aware of the bribery case, even though Sagar Adani was served a grand jury subpoena last year by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation, it added. The Qatar Investment Authority, with a stake of 2.7%, declined comment. But standing firm for now is GQG Investors, which holds a stake of 4.2%. In an internal client note seen by Reuters, it said, 'We believe the fundamentals of the companies we are invested in remain sound.' Adani Green added power capacity of 37% each year to reach 11.2 GW by September this year, from a mere 2 GW in the 2018-19 financial year. Its next big target is 50 GW goal by 2030, or a capacity addition of 31% each year, it told investors in a presentation in November. 'Renewable energy marvel' Adani Green's revenues of $574 million during the period from April to September this year were up 20% on the year, boosting its cash profit 27% to $313 million over that time. With large solar, wind and hybrid power developments in Gujarat and the desert state of Rajasthan, it is developing smaller pumped-storage hydro power projects in five Indian states. The facilities in Rajasthan and Gujarat were to have supplied the power contracted for in the Adani deals that U.S. prosecutors allege to have been granted after payment of bribes. One of them is the partly developed marquee project in Khavda, just 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the international border with Pakistan. It is described by Adani as 'a renewable energy marvel in the making.' Adani is targeting a massive jump in operational capacity at the location to 30 GW by 2029, up from 2.25 GW now. Energy from the park can power 16.1 million homes each year, Adani says. Reuters was among media which toured the project site in April, when thousands of laborers worked on construction and scores of solar panels were being installed. Engineers that day talked up the potential of the project, which would sprawl across 540 sq km (210 sq miles) when complete, saying it would be visible from space. 'The kind of support being provided by the central government, and I must say, the state governments also, is extraordinary,' Managing Director Vneet S. Jaain said at the time. Jaain, one of three Adani executives, besides Gautam and Sagar Adani, indicted for offering bribes to Indian state officials to secure deals, has not responded to a request for comment from Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysis-adani-s-renewable-energy-marvel-trapped-in-us-bribery-indictment-/7877543.html	2024-11-26T08:37:46-08:00	
Africa displacement triples, fueled by conflict, violence and disasters, new report states	NAIROBI — A new report from the Internal Displacement Monitoring Center says the number of people displaced in Africa has tripled to 35 million. Of these, 32.5 million abandoned their homes due to conflict and violence. The report, published Tuesday, says government efforts to address internal displacement on the continent have been commendable but not enough. Twenty-four-year-old Amani Kalindi has not known peace since he was a boy growing up in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. The truck driver is one of the millions of Africans displaced from their homes due to conflict, disasters, and climate change. He said people are living in constant fear, fleeing to seek safety, but then hit with new dangers and forced to flee again. War has been a constant problem, with foreign armed groups invading the country to fight over its resources and minerals, he said, adding that inter-communal violence is also a threat. Kalindi said that, with nowhere else to turn, he arrived in Uganda on Saturday after spending years in Ituri and North and South Kivu provinces in the DRC. Escaping danger, he joined millions of others from Africa and beyond in registering as a refugee. In a new report published Tuesday, the Geneva-based Internal Displacement Monitoring Center says the large majority of people displaced worldwide are in Africa. The report looks at the new trends and developments of the displaced from 2009 to 2023 and found that the number of people forced from their homes has tripled to 35 million. Almost 93 percent are displaced due to conflict and violence, and 26 million of them are displaced in just five countries: the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia and Sudan. Experts say poverty, inequality and marginalization are among the many factors that fuel conflict and violence, and armed groups have exploited these grievances, which create more displacements. IDMC director Alexandra Bilak said violence is not solely to blame for the crisis. 'So, five countries on the African continent are generating the most conflict-related internal displacement, but our report also shows that disaster displacement is also rising. We are now reporting six times more disaster displacements than 15 years ago,' Bilak said. Floods and droughts trigger the majority of disaster displacements. IDMC researchers warn climate change will make these weather-related events more frequent and intense, and they expect these displacement trends to continue. With the heightening conflict in Sudan, the chronic armed conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo, and weather-related disasters hitting communities, Balik said it's hard to see the numbers going down. 'It's hard to be optimistic. We know that with the impact of climate change, the disasters we already see today are likely to increase in the future,' Balik said. 'We have seen prolonged periods of drought across the Horn of Africa. And without more investments in the underlying causes of this displacement, we fear that the number will continue rising.' The Internal Displacement and Monitoring Center notes that some African countries have developed national policies to protect and assist internally displaced persons in accordance with a 2009 African Union agreement. Beyond national legislation and policies, Nigeria issues birth certificates and national identification cards to the displaced, ensuring they are recognized and have access to government services. Balik said implementing such solutions is necessary for countries to reach their development goals.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-displacement-triples-fueled-by-conflict-violence-and-disasters-new-report-states/7877504.html	2024-11-26T08:04:55-08:00	
Britain on alert after 2nd major storm batters country, killing at least 2	LONDON — Britain remained on high alert Monday after the second major storm of the season battered the country over the weekend, killing at least two people and disrupting road and rail travel. Hundreds of homes in England and Wales battled the floodwaters on Monday and several rail operators canceled services after Storm Bert lashed Britain with heavy rains and wind gusts up to 80 mph over the weekend. As much as 130 millimeters (5.1 inches) of rain fell in some areas, causing some rivers to overflow their banks and turning roads into waterways. A man in his 80s died after his car entered the water at a ford in Lancashire in northwest England on Saturday, and a body believed to be that of a missing dog walker was found the same day near the Afon Conwy River in North Wales. 'Further flooding is sadly likely over the next few days as water levels rise in slower flowing rivers such as the Severn and the Ouse,' Environment Secretary Steve Reed told the House of Commons. 'The Environment Agency anticipates that any impacts should be less severe than we've seen in recent days.' More than 130 flood alerts remained in effect across England, Wales and Scotland late Monday. A severe flood warning, meaning there is danger to life, was issued for the River Nene in Northampton as water levels continued to rise. Hoping to escape, people holding shopping bags filled with necessities waded through deep water Monday. Stan Brown, 67, who has lived in the region for 25 years, said he had no choice but to go. 'I've got somewhere else to go, but I'm one of the few,' he said. 'Other people have spent their life savings to buy a place there, and now they've got nowhere else to go.' Among the hardest-hit areas were parts of Wales, where residents of Pontypridd tried to protect their homes by using buckets to bail water over a flood wall and back into the River Taff. Two severe flood warnings issued for the River Monnow in southeast Wales have been lowered to warnings. Because of climate change and warmer oceans, storms can pick up more energy, increasing wind speeds, while a warmer atmosphere can hold more moisture. Reed said the government planned to spend 2.4 billion pounds ($3 billion) over the next two years to shore up flood defenses around the country. 'Climate change will inevitably lead to more severe weather of the kind we've seen this weekend,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/britain-on-alert-after-2nd-major-storm-batters-country-killing-at-least-2/7877492.html	2024-11-26T07:48:02-08:00	
Rescuers recover 20 bodies from flash floods, landslides on Indonesia's Sumatra island	KARO, Indonesia — Indonesian rescuers have recovered 20 bodies and are looking for two villagers who remain missing after flash floods on Sumatra island caused mud and rocks to tumble down mountainsides, officials said Tuesday. Torrential rains over the weekend caused rivers to burst their banks in four hilly districts in North Sumatra province, washing away houses and destroying farms. Four more bodies were recovered Monday evening in Karo Regency, bringing the total there to 10, National Disaster Management Agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said in a statement Tuesday. Flash floods also left four people dead in Deli Serdang district, and rescue workers were still searching for two people who were swept away. Earlier, rescuers recovered two bodies in villages in South Tapanuli district, and four members of a family, including two children, in Harang Julu, a mountainside village in Padang Lawas district. Seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rescuers-recover-20-bodies-from-flash-floods-landslides-on-indonesia-s-sumatra-island/7877499.html	2024-11-26T07:46:06-08:00

Rebel group takes key Myanmar border town, rare earth mining hub	BANGKOK — A powerful rebel group has seized a key trading town in northeastern Myanmar on the Chinese border, taking control of a lucrative rare earth mining hub in another setback for the military-led government, according to witnesses. The apparent loss of Kanpaiti to the Kachin Independence Army leaves Myanmar's military in control of only one town with a border crossing, Muse, and deprives it of potential profits from the mines that provide China with rare earth minerals critical for electric motors and wind turbines, as well as high-tech weapons and a broad range of electronics. Neither Colonel Naw Bu, the KIA's spokesperson, nor Thet Swe, spokesperson for the military, responded to multiple requests for comment, but several local media outlets reported that Kanpaiti fell last week. The ongoing civil war and military restrictions make travel for journalists nearly impossible, but the reports were confirmed by witnesses by telephone. Video clips circulating on social media, which could not be independently verified, showed what was said to be a KIA member raising the group's flag at the tunnel through the mountain to China. Other clips showed a vast quantity of weapons allegedly captured by the KIA. The military seized power from the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021, triggering intensified fighting with long-established armed militias organized by Myanmar's ethnic minority groups in its border regions, which have struggled for decades for more autonomy. The once-mighty armed forces, known as the Tatmadaw, have suffered a series of unprecedented defeats over the past year, especially in areas to the east near the Chinese border and in the western state of Rakhine, after an alliance of three powerful militias launched a coordinated offensive on Oct. 27, 2023. Since then, other militias organized along ethnic lines have joined in, including the KIA in the northern state of Kachin. In Kachin's so-called Special Region 1, where Kanpaiti is located, the KIA since late September has been increasing assaults on a rival ethnic militia, the New Democratic Army-Kachin, which is allied with the government military and had provided border guard forces. The NDA-K also controlled the web of small, unlicensed operations where heavy rare earth elements are mined, then sold directly to China's big state-owned mining conglomerates or through intermediaries. There are more than 300 unregulated mines in the area, producing most of the $1.4 billion in rare earths for sale to China last year 'at a terrible cost to the environment and local communities,' according to a report issued by London-based environmental group Global Witness in May.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rebel-group-takes-key-myanmar-border-town-rare-earth-mining-hub/7877455.html	2024-11-26T07:28:33-08:00

Prince Harry's phone-hacking lawsuit against Daily Mail to go to trial in 2026	London — Prince Harry and other high-profile British figures' privacy lawsuits against the Daily Mail newspaper's publisher will go to trial in early 2026, London's High Court heard on Tuesday, with the parties' legal costs set to exceed $47 million. Harry, the younger son of King Charles, is one of seven claimants suing Associated Newspapers over allegations of voicemail interception – commonly known as phone-hacking – and other serious privacy breaches dating back 30 years. Associated, which also publishes the Mail on Sunday, has always denied involvement in unlawful practices. Its lawyers said in filings for a preliminary hearing on Tuesday that the claimants' allegations were 'firmly denied.' The publisher's attempt to throw out the lawsuits was rejected last year, paving the way for a trial which the claimants and Associated say should begin in early 2026. Lawyers representing the claimants, who also include singer Elton John and actors Elizabeth Hurley and Sadie Frost, expect to spend around $22 million up to and including the trial, with Associated incurring nearly $24 million, according to court filings made public on Tuesday. Harry and the other claimants' lawsuits, which were filed in 2022, marked the first time Associated had been dragged into the phone-hacking scandal, which emerged more than a decade ago and prompted a public inquiry into the ethics of the press and several criminal trials. It also sparked long-running litigation against Rupert Murdoch's British newspaper arm, News Group Newspapers, and the publisher of the Daily Mirror, Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN). Harry's case against Associated is one of several he has brought against British media organizations as part of his 'mission' to purge executives and editors whom he accuses of spreading lies and intruding into people's lives. The prince accepted substantial damages from MGN to settle the remainder of his phone-hacking lawsuit, having been awarded around $178,000 after the High Court ruled he had been targeted by journalists. Harry's case against News Group Newspapers is due to go to trial in January.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prince-harry-s-phone-hacking-lawsuit-against-daily-mail-to-go-to-trial-in-2026/7877284.html	2024-11-26T05:15:26-08:00

Death toll from Sudan’s brutal civil war far exceeds previous estimates, study suggests	London — The number of people killed in Sudan’s civil war is far higher than previously thought, according to new research, as aid agencies warn that the conflict has created the world’s worst hunger crisis with millions on the brink of famine. The study by the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggests that deaths in Khartoum state alone were higher than previous estimates for the entire country. 'In Khartoum State, between April 2023 and June 2024, the researchers estimate over 61,000 people died of all causes, a 50% increase in the pre-war death rate. Over the same period, it is estimated that there were over 26,000 deaths due to violence in Khartoum State, significantly higher than the 20,178 intentional-injury deaths reported by ACLED for the entire country,' the report said. ACLED, or Armed Conflict Location & Event Data, is a non-profit organization whose figures are widely used by international organizations, including the United Nations, and national governments. The research from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine showed that the leading cause of death was preventable disease and starvation. It indicates that the nationwide death toll in Sudan is far higher than previous estimates, as 'over 90% of both all-cause and violent deaths in Khartoum State went unrecorded, suggesting the death toll in other regions is also significantly higher than recorded figures.' Sudan’s civil war erupted in April 2023, a brutal power struggle between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces. The conflict has cut off entire communities and devastated most government services, making it difficult to reach an accurate estimate of the number of excess deaths caused by the conflict. The study used a relatively new technique known as 'capture-recapture analysis' which compares data from multiple sources to arrive at accurate estimates when not all data are recorded. 'It allows us to estimate the number of unrecorded events, in this case, deaths. We've done that by collecting data from three different sources, triangulating those three sources and comparing them and seeing the amount of overlap there was. The less there was an overlap between the three source lists, the more unrecorded deaths we estimated to have occurred,' lead author Maysoon Dahab told VOA. Separately, the aid group Doctors without Borders says that since January this year, one in six of its patients at a Khartoum hospital were children under 15, with many sustaining severe injuries from gunshots, explosions and shrapnel. The organization said there has also been a rise in cases of severe malnutrition among children. The United Nations says the conflict has forced 11 million people to flee their homes, with some 25 million people - half of Sudan’s population – needing food aid, making it the world’s biggest hunger crisis. It’s vital that more is done to end the suffering, said Maysoon Dahab of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine. 'So, in the case of the international community, ensuring the understanding that the aid effort needs to be increased, scaled up and put out to inaccessible populations. In terms of actors who are shaping the war, what we hope to put out in terms of the research is the true price of this war. So that they are able to make their decision based on those facts,' she told VOA. Visiting Khartoum last week for talks with Sudan’s army chief, the United States’ Special Envoy to Sudan, Thomas Perriello, said efforts international efforts were ongoing to end the violence. 'We also share the aspiration for this war to end as soon as possible, to see an end to the horrific atrocities,' Perriello told reporters in Port Sudan on November 18. However, there are few signs that either the Sudanese army or the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces are ready to agree a truce. Meanwhile, Russia last week vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution calling for a ceasefire, saying the process excluded Sudan itself. Britain, which sponsored the resolution alongside Sierra Leone, strongly criticized Moscow’s decision. 'This Russian veto is a disgrace, and it shows to the world yet again Russia’s true colors,' British Foreign Secretary David Lammy said. 'Shame on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin for pretending to be a partner of the Global South while condemning black Africans to further killing, further rape, further starvation in a brutal war,' he added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/death-toll-from-sudan-s-brutal-civil-war-far-exceeds-previous-estimates-study-suggests/7877242.html	2024-11-26T04:41:29-08:00	
Job boom creates Swiss immigration headache for EU trade talks	ZURICH — Switzerland is scrambling to keep a lid on immigration from its top trade partner, the European Union, as a jobs boom powered by the country's low-tax business model turns population growth into a political hot potato. The issue helped derail talks in 2021 to overhaul rules governing some $338 billion of annual trade, and threatens to do so again after Brussels and Bern relaunched negotiations in March, aiming for a deal by year-end. With runaway population growth fueling calls by Swiss nationalists to reject closer ties with the bloc, Switzerland is seeking to introduce a 'protection clause' into the EU deal that would let it control immigration, diplomats and lawmakers say. Since Switzerland secured unfettered access to the EU's single market in 1999, its economy has expanded faster than those of Germany, Austria, France and Italy, neighbors whose growth it had lagged during the decade before. Jobs growth has been faster, while average wages have risen more. And its population - just 7 million in 1995, according to World Bank data - is now above 9 million. 'This is a result of the success story of needing lots of workers in Switzerland,' said Peter Fischer, board chairman of metal processing company Fischer Reinach. He wants to see the deal updated so that Swiss firms can continue to recruit freely from the 27-nation EU. The Swiss foreign ministry said the government understands how important free movement is for the economy and wants to establish specifics on a protection mechanism. 'It is crucial for (the government) that free movement of people and immigration from the EU takes place into the labor market and not into the welfare system,' it said. Tax draw Underpinning government concerns is a drive by the biggest group in the lower house of parliament, the right-wing Swiss People's Party, to enshrine population curbs in law. The party says infrastructure will be overwhelmed and rents will skyrocket if the population is not stopped from reaching 10 million by 2050 - a figure it is on track to hit far sooner. The Swiss population grew at its fastest clip in six decades last year and the rate of increase since the mid-1990s has been more than quadruple that of the EU. Freedom of movement is a pillar of the single market and diplomats do not expect a formal curb to be granted. But they express confidence a deal can be done. After Britain voted in 2016 to leave the EU, Brussels is keen to persuade one of the world's wealthiest countries to embrace it. That would not be the end of it, however. The Swiss parliament would have to approve any deal, as would Swiss voters, if - as is likely - it is later put to a referendum. Switzerland is highly dependent on immigrants. Some 27% of the population is foreign - over four times the EU average, official data show. Many companies have moved to Switzerland to take advantage of low taxes, something that has cost its EU neighbors, said Jacqueline Badran, a businesswoman and federal lawmaker for the center-left Social Democrats. 'We've taken away their tax base,' she said. 'If we want less immigration, we have to stop luring capital.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/job-boom-creates-swiss-immigration-headache-for-eu-trade-talks/7877161.html	2024-11-26T02:21:20-08:00	
Philippine investigators summon VP Duterte over threats against Marcos	MANILA, Philippines — Philippine authorities handed a subpoena to Vice President Sara Duterte’s office Tuesday, inviting her to answer investigators' questions after she publicly threatened to have the president, his wife and the House of Representatives speaker assassinated if she were killed in an unspecified plot herself. President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday described her threat as a criminal plot and vowed to fight it and uphold the rule of law in the country in a looming showdown between the country’s two top leaders. The national police and the military expressed alarm and immediately boosted Marcos’s security. National Security Adviser Eduardo Ano said the threats were a national security concern. Duterte, a 46-year-old lawyer, said her remarks were not an actual threat but an expression of concern over her own safety due to unspecified danger to her life. The Marcos administration’s statements against her were 'a farce' and part of efforts to persecute critics like her, Duterte said. The subpoena ordered Duterte to appear before the National Bureau of Investigation on Friday to 'shed light on the investigation for alleged grave threats.' Duterte said Monday she was willing to face an investigation but demanded the Marcos administration also respond to her questions, including alleged irregularities in government. Under Philippine law, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or their family and are punishable by a prison term and fine. Marcos ran with Duterte as his vice-presidential running mate in 2022 elections and both won landslide victories on a campaign call of national unity. In the Philippines, the two positions are elected separately. The two leaders and their camps, however, soon had a bitter falling out over key differences, including in their approaches to China’s aggressive territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea. Duterte resigned from the Marcos Cabinet in June as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body and became one of the most vocal critics of the president, his wife and his cousin Martin Romualdez, who heads the House of Representatives. The House has been investigating alleged misuse of confidential government funds by Duterte as vice president and when she headed the Department of Education.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-investigators-summon-vp-duterte-over-threats-against-marcos-/7877149.html	2024-11-26T01:38:10-08:00	
China sends naval, air forces to shadow US plane over Taiwan Strait	BEIJING — China's military said on Tuesday it deployed naval and air forces to monitor and warn a U.S. Navy patrol aircraft that flew through the sensitive Taiwan Strait, denouncing the United States for trying to 'mislead' the international community. Around once a month, U.S. military ships or aircraft pass through or above the waterway that separates democratically governed Taiwan from China - missions that always anger Beijing. China claims sovereignty over the island of Taiwan and says it has jurisdiction over the strait. Taiwan and the United States dispute that, saying the strait is an international waterway. The U.S. Navy's 7th fleet said a P-8A Poseidon maritime patrol aircraft had flown through the strait 'in international airspace,' adding that the flight demonstrated the United States' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific. 'By operating within the Taiwan Strait in accordance with international law, the United States upholds the navigational rights and freedoms of all nations,' it said in a statement. China's military criticized the flight as 'public hype,' adding that it monitored the U.S. aircraft throughout its transit and 'effectively' responded to the situation. 'The relevant remarks by the U.S. distort legal principles, confuse public opinion and mislead international perceptions,' the military's Eastern Theatre Command said in a statement. 'We urge the U.S. side to stop distorting and hyping up and jointly safeguard regional peace and stability.' Taiwan's defense ministry said the P-8A flew in a northerly direction through the strait and that the Taiwanese military monitored it, adding the 'situation was as normal.' In April, China's military said it sent fighter jets to monitor and warn a U.S. Navy Poseidon in the Taiwan Strait, a mission that took place just hours after a call between the Chinese and U.S. defense chiefs.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-sends-naval-air-forces-to-shadow-us-plane-over-taiwan-strait/7877147.html	2024-11-26T01:28:11-08:00	
EU urges Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire: ‘No more excuses’	WASHINGTON — European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell called on Israel to agree Tuesday to a cease-fire with the Lebanon-based Hezbollah militant group, saying there are 'no more excuses.' Speaking to reporters ahead of a meeting of G-7 foreign ministers in Italy, Borrell said a cease-fire is 'absolutely necessary' for civilians displaced by several months of intensified fighting along the Israel-Lebanon border. He expressed hope that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government would approve a cease-fire proposal 'today' without seeking to add additional stipulations that could delay or derail an agreement. 'No more excuses. No more additional requests. Stop this fighting. Stop killing people. And let’s start thinking on peace,' Borrell said. U.S. officials expressed hope Monday that a cease-fire agreement between Israel and Hezbollah was close. Speaking to reporters during a press call, national security spokesperson John Kirby described recent talks in Beirut led by U.S. envoy Amos Hochstein as 'constructive,' adding, 'We believe that the trajectory of this is going in a very positive direction.' In New York on Monday, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said negotiations toward a ceasefire, aimed at ending the fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Lebanese Shia militia, are 'moving forward' but have not been 'finalized.' He added that Israel would retain the ability to strike southern Lebanon under any agreement. 'We will make sure that we will have the ability to neutralize any threat that will not be dealt [with] in southern Lebanon. I hope that the Lebanese army will take care of that in the future, but if they will fail, again, we will be there,' Danon said. Meanwhile, Lebanon's deputy speaker, Elias Bou Saab, said there are no major obstacles to implementing a U.S.-proposed ceasefire deal, which requires Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon and Lebanese troop deployment within 60 days. A five-nation committee, chaired by the United States and including France, will oversee the process, according to Bou Saab. At the State Department, officials declined to comment on the details and terms of the ceasefire proposal but acknowledged that 'significant progress' has been made toward an agreement. 'We don't believe we have an agreement yet. We believe we're close to an agreement. We believe that we have narrowed the gap significantly. But there are still steps that we need to see taken,' spokesperson Matthew Miller said during a briefing on Monday, without specifying what those steps are. Hezbollah started firing on Israel more than a year ago in support of Hamas militants, who attacked Israel in October 2023 and have been warring with Israel in Gaza since then. The fighting has caused a humanitarian crisis, displacing hundreds of thousands. On Monday, the United Nations World Food Program announced that it has provided emergency aid to more than a half-million people in Lebanon since the conflict began. The WFP said it plans to reach 1 million people and is continuing to work tirelessly to deliver critical assistance to affected communities. Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the current war in Gaza. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 44,235 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries.

Top importer Vietnam struggles to recycle plastic waste	MINH KHAI, Vietnam — Countless discarded bags float on the canal running through Minh Khai village, whose narrow streets are clogged with tall heaps of plastic waste spilling out from villagers' front yards and stacked near furnaces where non-recyclable scrap is burned. This so-called plastic recycling 'craft village,' an hour's drive from Vietnam's capital Hanoi, is where some of the plastic sorted for recycling in Japan, America and Europe ends up for final treatment. Delegates at a United Nations summit in South Korea this week are discussing new global rules that could limit that trade, which U.N. data shows was worth $3.8 billion last year. Stricter domestic requirements on waste imports will also be applicable in Vietnam from next year. The Southeast Asian nation has emerged as a major importer of plastic scrap in recent years after China, once the top player in the industry, banned imports in 2018. Vietnam was the world's fourth largest importer in 2022, according to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. But that surge in imports has taken place as the country is struggling to recycle even its own plastic waste. Additional restrictions could reduce the trade but the large size of the domestic informal industry may make it hard to monitor commercial flows and recycling rates, experts and officials said. More than one quarter of Vietnam's plastic recycling capacity is concentrated in craft villages like Minh Khai, the World Bank said in a 2021 report, noting that spare capacity to process imported plastic amounted to 300,000 metric tons. That was well short of the 420,000 tons of plastic scrap Vietnam imported last year, which was up 11% from 2022, according to U.N. data, which does not capture the entire volume. Vietnam's environment ministry did not reply to requests for updated figures. Researchers have found that recycling is being hampered by the inability to properly sort plastic waste, both offshore and in Vietnam. Only 30% of plastic waste generated in Vietnam is sorted, said a government-backed WWF report in 2023. As a result, in spite of shipment costs, Vietnam's recyclers rely on higher-quality foreign plastic scrap, according to FiinGroup, a research firm. But estimates suggest Vietnam recycles only up to one-third of the imported plastic waste, said a research paper published in January. That is partly because some imported plastic is often mixed with organic waste that makes it hard or impossible to treat, said one of the paper's authors, Kaustubh Thapa, from the Netherlands' Utrecht University. A recycler at Minh Khai village was more upbeat. 'The amount of imported waste that can't be recycled is often about 5% of the volume, but at times it goes up to 25%,' said Chi, who declined to give his full name. Most people contacted in the village in person or by phone declined to talk to media for fear of repercussions on their activities. Much of the unrecycled plastic is dumped in 'unsanitary' landfills, and about 15% of that is directly released into the environment and the oceans, the WWF report said. 'Exporting waste for recycling to destinations without sound recycling capacity raises questions of fairness and sustainability,' concluded the research paper by Thapa and co-authors.	https://www.voanews.com/a/top-importer-vietnam-struggles-to-recycle-plastic-waste/7877129.html	2024-11-26T00:29:22-08:00	
German exporters optimistic for first time in months despite possible Trump tariffs	Berlin — The mood in Germany's export industry improved slightly in November as companies, generally cautious about foreign business developments, wait to see which trade policies U.S. President-elect Donald Trump will implement, a survey said on Tuesday. The Ifo Institute for Economic Research's indicator for export expectations rose to minus 5.9 points in November from minus 6.5 points in October, the first increase in six months. 'Companies are unsettled but are still waiting to see which trade policy Trump will ultimately implement,' said Klaus Wohlrabe, head of surveys for Ifo, which is based in Munich. 'In addition, the dollar has appreciated strongly since the election, which may benefit exporters,' he said. Some analysts assume that German deliveries to the United States could initially increase in the coming months as companies there try to order goods before the possible introduction of tariffs, which would make them more expensive. Trump, who on Monday announced plans for significant tariff increases on imports from Canada, Mexico and China, had said during his election campaign that he would place high tariffs on goods from the European Union. That would hit the already lagging German economy particularly hard as the U.S. is the largest buyer of its goods. Germany is the world’s third-largest exporting nation, behind China and the US, according to the World Bank.	https://www.voanews.com/a/german-exporters-optimistic-for-first-time-in-months-despite-possible-trump-tariffs/7877127.html	2024-11-26T00:22:40-08:00	
Ukraine says it shot down 76 of 188 Russian drones	Ukraine’s military said Tuesday it shot down 76 Russian drones in overnight attacks that targeted areas across the country and damaged critical infrastructure facilities. Ukraine’s air force said Russia launched 188 total drones, along with four missiles, in the latest daily aerial assault, and that there was also damage to apartment buildings in several regions. Ukrainian air defenses shot down drones in the Cherkasy, Chernihiv, Chernivtsi, Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Khmelnytskyi, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odessa, Poltava, Rivne, Sumy, Ternopil, Vinnytsia, Zaporizhzhia and Zhytomyr regions. Serhiy Lysak, governor of Dnipropetrovsk, said on Telegram that one drone hit the center of Nikopol. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Tuesday it shot down 39 Ukrainian aerial drones overnight. Most of the drones were shot down over the Rostov region, with other intercepts taking place over Bryansk, Belgorod, Kursk, Oryol, Voronezh and Russia-occupied Crimea. Officials in Rostov, Bryansk and Voronezh said on Telegram there were no reports of damage or casualties from the attacks.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-says-it-shot-down-76-of-188-russian-drones/7877118.html	2024-11-25T23:58:58-08:00	
Indonesia province resumes search for 7 missing after landslide and floods kill 15	JAKARTA, INDONESIA — Indonesian rescuers are searching for seven people still missing four days after torrential rain hit North Sumatra province, causing flash flooding and landslides that killed 15 people, an official said on Tuesday. Eleven people were killed in landslides in Karo district, Padang Lawas district and Tapanuli Selatan district, and another four died in flash floods in Deli Serdang district after the bad weather hit on Saturday, disaster agency spokesperson Abdul Muhari said. About a hundred rescuers along with police and military were still searching for the seven missing people, but they had been hampered by persistent rain, Abdul said. 'It's still raining from the afternoon until the evening. This is the main obstacle while we try to locate the missing people,' he said, adding the search would continue until Saturday. The landslides and flash floods damaged houses, mosques, and rice fields. Road access was cut off to several villages, and excavators were being used in the search for victims and the missing. The disaster agency warned people in North Sumatra province to anticipate potential floods in the coming weeks as more heavy rain is forecast, Abdul said. Landslides are frequent in Indonesia, especially in the rainy season. The risk of landslides is often increased by deforestation and small-scale illegal mining operations in remote districts.	https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesia-province-resumes-search-for-7-missing-after-landslide-and-floods-kill-15/7877114.html	2024-11-25T23:02:00-08:00	
Google, Meta urge Australia to delay bill on social media ban for children	SYDNEY — Google and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms urged the Australian government on Tuesday to delay a bill that will ban most forms of social media for children under 16, saying more time was needed to assess its potential impact. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's center-left government wants to pass the bill, which represents some of the toughest controls on children's social media use imposed by any country, into law by the end of the parliamentary year on Thursday. The bill was introduced in parliament last week and opened for submissions of opinions for only one day. Google and Meta said in their submissions that the government should wait for the results of an age-verification trial before going ahead. The age-verification system may include biometrics or government identification to enforce a social media age cut-off. 'In the absence of such results, neither industry nor Australians will understand the nature or scale of age assurance required by the bill, nor the impact of such measures on Australians,' Meta said. 'In its present form, the bill is inconsistent and ineffective.' The law would force social media platforms, and not parents or children, to take reasonable steps to ensure age-verification protections are in place. Companies could be fined up to $32 million for systemic breaches. The opposition Liberal party is expected to support the bill though some independent lawmakers have accused the government of rushing through the entire process in around a week. A Senate committee responsible for communications legislation is scheduled to deliver a report on Tuesday. Bytedance's TikTok said the bill lacked clarity and that it had 'significant concerns' with the government's plan to pass the bill without detailed consultation with experts, social media platforms, mental health organizations and young people. 'Where novel policy is put forward, it's important that legislation is drafted in a thorough and considered way, to ensure it is able to achieve its stated intention. This has not been the case with respect to this Bill,' TikTok said. Elon Musk's X raised concerns that the bill will negatively impact the human rights of children and young people, including their rights to freedom of expression and access to information. The U.S. billionaire, who views himself as a champion of free speech, last week attacked the Australian government saying the bill seemed like a backdoor way to control access to the internet.	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-meta-urge-australia-to-delay-bill-on-social-media-ban-for-children/7877111.html	2024-11-25T22:56:41-08:00	
3 Uzbek nationals arrested in the killing of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi in the UAE	DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — The United Arab Emirates said Monday police arrested three Uzbek nationals for the killing of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi, an attack that's raised concerns for the burgeoning Israeli community in the country. The statement from the country's Interior Ministry offered no motive for the slaying of Zvi Kogan, though an Israeli Foreign Ministry official later told The Associated Press that he simply had been 'killed because of who he was.' Kogan, 28, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who went missing on Thursday, ran a kosher grocery store in the city of Dubai, where Israelis have flocked for commerce and tourism since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in the 2020 Abraham Accords. The agreement has held through more than a year of soaring regional tensions unleashed by Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023, attack into southern Israel. But Israel's devastating retaliatory offensive in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon, after months of fighting with the Hezbollah militant group, have stoked anger among Emiratis, Arab nationals and others living in the UAE. The Interior Ministry statement identified the three men as Olimboy Tohirovich, 28, Makhmudjon Abdurakhim, 28, and Azizbek Kamilovich, 33. The state-run WAM news agency carried images of the three men, blindfolds covering their faces in prison uniforms and flip flops. The preliminary probe into the men is 'in preparation for referring them to the public prosecution for further investigation,' the Interior Ministry said. It wasn't immediately clear if the three men had lawyers or had sought consular assistance in the UAE, an autocratically ruled nation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula. The Uzbek Consulate in Dubai did not respond to a request for comment regarding the arrests. Israeli media reports, citing unnamed security officials, had alleged Uzbeks were involved in Kogan's killing. Uzbeks and other transnational criminal gangs previously have been hired in Iranian plots targeting dissidents and others. Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah, has also been threatening to retaliate against Israel after a wave of airstrikes Israel carried out in October in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack. Iran's Embassy in Abu Dhabi has denied Tehran was involved in the rabbi's slaying. While the UAE statement did not mention Iran, Iranian intelligence services have carried out past kidnappings in the UAE. Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in the UAE and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living across the country. Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters Monday that the 'terrorists' who killed the rabbi would be brought to justice and pointed a finger at the 'axis of evil' — a phrase Israel has used to refer to Iran and its allies. That echoed remarks Sunday by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who also used the phrase 'axis of evil.' Kogan's wife, Rivky, is an American citizen. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken called Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nayhan, the UAE's foreign minister, to condemn Kogan's killing. Blinken 'expressed appreciation for the UAE's close security cooperation with the United States and other partners in the region, as well as its long-standing tradition of and commitment to tolerance and freedom of worship,' the State Department said. Jared Kushner, the son-in-law of President-elect Donald Trump who helped broker the Abraham Accords, pledged $1 million to Chabad UAE, the religious organization for which Kogan worked. Kushner's brother Joshua pledged another $1 million. 'Let us come together from all faiths to pick up where Rabbi Kogan left off and bring his work, and the work of those building the UAE into a thriving destination of tolerance, bridge building and mutual benefit, to new heights,' Jared Kushner wrote on the social platform X. Kogan's body was flown back to Israel on Monday ahead of a planned funeral the following day. His casket, covered in a prayer shawl, arrived to Kfar Chabad, Israel, on Monday night in front of a crowd of hundreds who gathered in the rain to honor him. 'How long will Jews continue to die for the sanctification of God?' Rabbi Yosef Yitzhak Aharonov asked those gathered. The procession then took Kogan's body to be buried at the Mount of Olives in east Jerusalem. The Israeli Foreign Ministry official, who spoke to the AP on condition of anonymity to discuss the ongoing investigation and diplomatic matters, said authorities believe Kogan's death came from his identity as an ultra-Orthodox Jew, not anything else. 'He was attacked because of who he was,' the official said. Since the Oct. 7 attacks, Israelis and Jews in the UAE have been on edge. Worship, which typically requires 10 Jewish men to happen, still takes place but not at sites previously used by the community, the official said. The official acknowledged that tensions likely boil beneath the surface in the UAE, but praised the Emirati government for their investigation into Kogan's killing. Israeli security services have been involved in the probe, the official said. That likely includes the Mossad, Israel's foreign intelligence service. The UAE, while strenuously criticizing the conduct of the Israeli military in the Gaza Strip, has maintained its diplomatic relations with Israel. Israeli diplomats also have returned to Bahrain, the official said. 'They might not agree with what we do in the war ... but the dialogue allows them to send in all the humanitarian aid,' the official said of the Emirati government. The official added: 'It's been challenging to the relationship, but in a way, that keeps it strong.' The RANE Network, a risk consultancy, separately warned that countries like that UAE that have normalized ties with Israel 'will likely face a similarly low risk of attacks by lone actors, small cells or jihadist groups against Israeli, Jewish or even Western individuals and businesses allegedly associated with Israel.' 'The incident highlights heightened anti-Israeli sentiment in the region over the war in Gaza, as well as the ongoing shadow war between Iran and Israel,' it added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uzbek-nationals-arrested-in-the-killing-of-an-israeli-moldovan-rabbi-in-the-uae/7877082.html	2024-11-25T20:47:37-08:00	
Police in Turkey detain demonstrators seeking more protection for women against violence	ISTANBUL — Police detained dozens of people in Istanbul who tried to join a rally Monday calling for greater protection for women in Turkey, where more than 400 women have been murdered this year. The demonstrators tried to enter the main pedestrian street, Istiklal, to mark the International Day for the Elimination of Violence Against Women, in defiance of a ban on all protests in the area. Earlier, police barricaded all entrances to Istiklal and to the city's main square, Taksim, while authorities shut down several metro stations to prevent large gatherings. Many demonstrators were protesting President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's decision in 2021 that withdrew Turkey from a landmark European agreement known as the Istanbul Convention. The treaty, which aims to protect women from violence, was signed in Istanbul in 2011. Erdogan's decision came after some members of his Islamic-rooted ruling party accused the treaty of promoting LGBTQ+ rights and other ideals they said were incompatible with Turkey's traditional family values. On Monday, Erdogan dismissed calls for Turkey's return to the convention and reiterated his government's commitment to protecting women. The local advocacy group We Will Stop Femicide says 411 women have been murdered in Turkey in 2024.	https://www.voanews.com/a/police-in-turkey-detain-demonstrators-seeking-more-protection-for-women-against-violence/7877080.html	2024-11-25T20:37:54-08:00	
Overseas Chinese activists mark two years since White Paper protests	Taipei, Taiwan — Chinese exiles gathered in cities around the world to mark the second anniversary of the 'White Paper Movement' in China, saying the demonstrations against the COVID-19 lockdown policies have inspired a new generation of pro-democracy Chinese activists. To prevent the spread of coronavirus across China, the Chinese government from early 2020 to late 2022 regularly imposed lockdowns on entire buildings, villages and even cities. The 2022 movement was a nationwide citizen-initiated protest that eventually forced the Chinese government to end the restrictive policies in November of that year. In Amsterdam, a candlelight vigil marked the anniversary with some 50 people who held flowers, candles, pieces of blank paper, or wore white masks. They gathered at Dam Square in downtown Amsterdam on Sunday. Other commemorations were held in Berlin, London, San Francisco and Tokyo. At the events, exiled activists shared their experiences during the monthlong, nationwide protest from two years ago. They remembered the protesters who remain in detention after participating in the demonstrations and commemorated those who lost their lives during a deadly building fire in Xinjiang’s capital of Urumqi. Lockdown measures may have kept firefighters from entering the high-rise in time and prevented some residents from exiting the building. The fire killed 10 people. Following the deadly event, a protest erupted on the campus of Nanjing University of Media and Communication on November 25, 2022, where students held up blank pieces of paper as symbols of their protests against the Chinese authorities’ control of free speech. 'Following lengthy lockdowns across China, It felt like the civil society was on the brink of an explosion in November 2022, so when I read the news about the deadly fire in Xinjiang, I felt like we were all living in hell,' said Rei Xia, an exiled Chinese activist and one of the organizers of the vigil in Amsterdam. The movement was dubbed 'the White Paper Movement' or the 'White Paper Revolution' as demonstrations spread to several cities, including Shanghai. Police arrested many participants. Those detained said they were tortured. 'I also remembered being forced into a corner at the detention center while the guards tried to force me to confess to some forged testimonies by threatening to shave my head or prolonging my detention,' Rei Xia told VOA by phone. 'I was surrounded by the police at the scene, punched and kicked, and then I was picked up and carried to the van by the police,' said Jack Wei, a former White Paper Movement participant from Chengdu, who now lives in the United States. 'When interrogated, I said that I was against the pandemic prevention policy ... and I wanted to eat [and] not do coronavirus tests. They forced me to sign a letter of repentance and gave me a warning,' he recalled during a conference in San Francisco on November 17. VOA reached out to the Chinese foreign ministry and the Chinese embassy in Washington for comment but did not receive a response at the time of publication. While hundreds of overseas Chinese took part in candlelight vigils, relevant keywords were censored on the Chinese internet. When VOA entered 'the White Paper Movement' on the popular microblogging site Weibo, there were no relevant results. Although many protesters were targeted in the nationwide crackdown following the protests, Huang Yicheng, a 28-year-old former student of Peking University, managed to escape from arrest and hid. Months later, he fled to Germany via Hong Kong and began to publicly advocate for other White Paper protesters who had been arrested or detained by Chinese authorities. 'I become an advocate for other participants after going into exile, and I have to cope with all kinds of harassment and risks associated with the Chinese government’s increasingly frequent transnational repression campaigns,' he told VOA. While memories of the movement have faded for some people, Huang said the protests created powerful symbols that continue to inspire a younger generation of Chinese activists. 'The blank papers, candles, flowers and the road sign of Urumqi Road are all important symbols of resistance for young Chinese activists,' Huang said. Some exiled Chinese activists said the White Paper Movement has also rejuvenated the overseas Chinese democracy movement, which has been mainly headed by activists from the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989. 'Since the White Paper Movement, many young Chinese people abroad have begun to emerge, and this trend provides new hope for the overseas Chinese democracy movement,' U.S.-based Chinese human rights lawyer Teng Biao told VOA by phone. Huang in Germany said some strategies used by activists outside of China have inspired protesters in major Chinese cities, but the rapidly shrinking space for dissent and activism in China is making attempts to organize protests more difficult. 'After overseas Chinese people in New York combined Chinese political sarcasm with Halloween in 2022, we have seen similar tactics being used by young Chinese people in Shanghai during Halloween in 2023 and 2024, but local police quickly impose restrictions and arrest people,' he said. Teng in the U.S. said Beijing’s efforts to tighten control over civil society have not only deprived Chinese people of their basic rights and freedoms but also led to violent acts across the country. 'The Chinese authorities’ attempt to limit freedom of speech and restrict citizens’ basic rights have pushed many people to the brink and at a time when the Chinese economy remains sluggish, the underlying social crisis will be exposed,' he said. Huang said since the Chinese government will likely maintain its repressive approach to controlling civil society, overseas Chinese activists like him can only try to highlight the problems that exist in China. 'We can only urge people in foreign countries to pay attention to the different kinds of problems in China.' He said he is worried the violent attacks in recent weeks may cause deeper issues in the country going forward. With no hint of Beijing loosening its control over the country in the horizon, Xia in Amsterdam said she is determined to keep tracking social and human rights issues in China. 'Social movements have become an important part of my life because of the White Paper Movement, and this experience has really empowered me,' she said.

US lawmakers say Hong Kong is becoming hub for financial crime	Lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives have asked Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen to rethink ties with Hong Kong's banking sector, saying the city has become a top location for money laundering and sanctions evasion. Hong Kong has turned into a hub for many violations of U.S. trade controls, including export of controlled Western technology to Russia and the creation of front companies to buy Iranian oil, the bipartisan leaders of the House of Representatives Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party said in a letter to Yellen. The letter, scheduled to be publicly released on Monday, said that Hong Kong has shifted from being a trusted global financial center to a critical player in the deepening authoritarian axis of China, Iran, Russia and North Korea. 'We must now question whether longstanding U.S. policy towards Hong Kong, particularly towards its financial and banking sector, is appropriate,' a copy of the letter seen by Reuters said. The letter, signed by Republican John Moolenaar, who chairs the committee, and Raja Krishnamoorthi, the committee's ranking Democrat, cited research that shows nearly 40% of goods shipped from Hong Kong to Russia in 2023 were high-priority items such as semiconductors that Russia could use to prosecute its war in Ukraine. The U.S. Treasury Department did not immediately respond to Reuters' requests for comments. Hong Kong's trade office in New York could not be immediately reached for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-lawmakers-say-hong-kong-is-becoming-hub-for-financial-crime/7877066.html	2024-11-25T19:35:40-08:00	
US telecom worker who was Chinese agent sentenced to 4 years in prison	WASHINGTON — A former U.S. telecom company employee who provided information about Chinese dissidents and Falun Gong members to China was sentenced to four years in prison on Monday, the Justice Department said. Ping Li, 59, of Wesley Chapel, Florida, admitted in a plea agreement to acting as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government, the department said in a statement. Li, who emigrated to the United States from China, provided corporate information to China's Ministry of State Security (MSS) and personal details about an individual affiliated with the Falun Gong spiritual movement who lived in Florida. The Falun Gong movement is banned in China. The U.S. Justice Department said Li worked for a major U.S. telecom company and an international information technology company. The companies were not identified in court documents, but according to press reports, they were Verizon and InfoSys, respectively. 'From at least as early as 2012, [Li] served as a cooperative contact working at the direction of officers of the MSS to obtain information of interest to the [Chinese] government,' the Justice Department said. 'Li obtained a wide variety of information at the request of the MSS, including information concerning Chinese dissidents and pro-democracy advocates, members of the Falun Gong religious movement, and U.S.-based nongovernmental organizations.' A 71-year-old Chinese man was sentenced to 20 months in prison in California last week for taking part in a plot targeting the Falun Gong in the United States. John Chen, of Los Angeles, was also convicted of acting as an unregistered agent of the Chinese government. China calls the Falun Gong movement, founded in 1992, an evil cult, outlawing it in 1999 after 10,000 members peacefully demonstrated outside a government building in Beijing.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-telecom-worker-who-was-chinese-agent-sentenced-to-4-years-in-prison/7877062.html	2024-11-25T19:27:57-08:00	
Pakistan police clash with protesters rallying for jailed former PM Khan	ISLAMABAD — Clashes between Pakistan security forces and supporters of imprisoned former Prime Minister Imran Khan outside Islamabad late on Monday resulted in the death of at least one police officer and injuries to dozens of people. The violence erupted when thousands of supporters of Khan’s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) Party attempted to enter the capital city for a sit-in protest until their demands were met. Khan’s party accused police of 'firing live bullets' at protesters as they arrived just outside Islamabad. It reported dozens of injuries, saying authorities had also arrested hundreds of PTI workers and leaders. Khan’s wife, Bushra Bibi, is leading the rally that entered the city before dawn on Monday and was seen heading to the venue despite the barricades and police crackdown. While addressing a late Monday news conference, Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi warned that security forces are determined to arrest anyone who reaches the venue. He reported the death of the police officer and said several other officers were also seriously injured after coming under fire from protesters. PTI launched the protest march Sunday as part of its campaign to seek an end to Khan’s detention, along with that of dozens of party members allegedly held without trial. The opposition party also demanded the resignation of Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif and his coalition government, claiming they resulted from rigged elections held in February. For the past two days, authorities have placed Islamabad under a security lockdown, disrupted mobile internet and WhatsApp services, closed schools and blocked highways leading into the capital to keep protesters away from the venue near the parliament. Major roads, city roads and streets have been barricaded, with the deployment of thousands of police and paramilitary personnel in riot gear. Police banned public gatherings in Islamabad in the lead-up to the protest march. The United States, while responding to Monday’s political violence in Pakistan, reaffirmed its support for freedom of expression and peaceful assembly. 'We call on protesters to demonstrate peacefully and refrain from violence,' State Department spokesperson Mathew Miller told reporters in Washington. 'At the same time, we call on Pakistani authorities to respect human rights and fundamental freedoms and to ensure respect for Pakistan’s laws and constitution as they work to maintain law and order,' Miller added. Khan, prime minister from 2018 to 2022, was ousted through an opposition parliamentary vote of no-confidence after falling out with Pakistan’s powerful military. The 72-year-old former cricket star-turned-politician has been imprisoned since August 2023, facing more than 150 criminal cases, which include charges of corruption, terrorism and instigation of violence against military properties. Khan denies the charges, calling them politically motivated and orchestrated by the military, accusations Khan’s successor and army officials dismiss as unfounded. The military has staged several coups and has governed Pakistan for more than three decades since its independence in 1947. Khan and other prominent Pakistani politicians claim that army generals influence elected governments even when not formally in power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-police-clash-with-protesters-rallying-for-jailed-former-pm-khan-/7877047.html	2024-11-25T18:42:00-08:00	
Behind the scenes at the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day parade	For nearly 100 years, Americans have enjoyed watching the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day Parade.

Analysis: Trump's win powered by improved performance across electorate	Nearly three weeks after the 2024 election, with almost all of the votes counted, it has become clear that Donald Trump won his second term in the White House by orchestrating a nationwide rightward shift in voting patterns that largely persisted across most of the 50 states, whether their electoral votes went to Trump or to his Democratic opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. The main force behind Trump's victory was strong support from his base, which is generally made up of white Americans without a college degree. His win would not have been possible, however, had the president-elect not improved his showing among groups who tend to support Democratic candidates. Trump won larger shares of the vote in parts of the country with large Hispanic and Asian American populations, many of whom appeared to respond to his criticism of the Biden administration's handling of the economy and of immigration. Many areas of the country with a large concentration of Black voters, who have historically favored Democrats, saw lower turnout than in past years, creating a further disadvantage for Harris. The shift in favor of Trump was apparent in an overwhelming majority of communities across the country. An analysis of county-level data updated by CNN on November 22 demonstrated that in nearly nine of 10 U.S. counties, Trump's 2024 vote share had improved over that of 2020. 'He did much better' Drew McCoy, president of Decision Desk HQ, an organization that gathers data on elections in the United States, told VOA that Trump's improvement with the electorate had been broad and cut across several demographic groups. 'We definitely have a lot of data on how Trump did, and across the board, he did much better,' McCoy said, mentioning that the president-elect had improved among white voters, Hispanic voters and Asian American voters. Meanwhile, while many had predicted a sharp increase in the gender gap in favor of Harris, it never materialized. While female voters appear to have favored Harris decisively, McCoy said the margin was 'essentially flat' compared with Trump's last two runs for the presidency. 'It wasn't the blowout across the board with women that many people were expecting,' McCoy said. The shift in the Hispanic vote was especially noticeable, he said. For example, in the heavily Hispanic Rio Grande Valley, just north of the border with Mexico, Trump's share of the vote surged. In Florida's Miami-Dade County region, which Hillary Clinton won by 30 percentage points in 2016, Trump won by 13 points. Popular and electoral vote tally Trump became the first Republican candidate in two decades to win the popular vote. As of November 25, The Associated Press tally had Trump with precisely 50% of the vote and Harris at 48.4%, with the remainder scattered among third-party candidates. In total, Americans cast more than 151 million votes for president, about 4 million fewer than were cast in 2020, when Trump lost to Joe Biden. However, Trump won approximately 77 million votes, nearly 3 million more than he did in 2020. Each U.S. state has a specified number of votes in the Electoral College, which is the body that officially elects the president. Each state allocates its votes to candidates based on the popular result in that state, in most cases on a winner-take-all basis. Trump needed 270 electoral votes to win. He received 312, or 58% of the total available. Historically, that is not a large percentage. Many presidents have won well over 75% of the electoral vote. However, in the seven presidential elections held since 2000, only Barack Obama, in 2008 and 2012, won more than 58% of electoral votes. Swing state sweep In the months leading up to the election, the American public's attention was focused on seven battleground states: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In 2020, Trump lost all of them, except for North Carolina, to Biden. This time, Trump won them all, in some cases by larger margins than Biden enjoyed in 2020. In Arizona, which Biden won by just over 10,000 votes in 2020, Trump won by nearly 200,000 votes. Much of the swing was attributable to a shift in the Hispanic vote toward Trump. He trimmed Biden's advantage considerably, in both more diverse Maricopa County, which includes Phoenix, as well as the heavily Hispanic counties along the state's southern border with Mexico. In Georgia, Harris' chance for victory hinged on running up her margins in the city of Atlanta and its densely populated suburbs, which represent the core of Democratic support in an otherwise reliably Republican state. In the end, she failed to do so, winning by a slimmer margin than Biden did in populous Fulton, Gwinnett and DeKalb counties. In Michigan, many of the same dynamics at play across the country remained in force, but Harris' performance was further hindered by the presence of large Arab American voting blocs in several metropolitan areas. The Biden administration's support for Israel in its ongoing wars in Gaza and Lebanon greatly angered many Arab Americans, and helped hand the state to Trump. In some precincts in the majority Arab American city of Dearborn, where Biden received 88% of the vote in 2020, Harris not only lost to Trump, but came in third, behind Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Betting on Las Vegas In Nevada, some 7 in 10 voters live in Clark County, in and around the city of Las Vegas. Nearly 1 in 3 voters in Clark are Hispanic, and the county also has Nevada's largest share of Black and Asian American voters. Biden beat Trump by more than nine percentage points four years ago, but Harris won by less than three, a difference that appears to have been driven by Hispanic and Asian American voters switching to the Republican candidate. Democrats in North Carolina may have been hopeful that the presence of a popular incumbent Democratic governor on the ticket would give Harris a shot at a pickup there. However, Trump improved his margin in the state, winning with 51% of the vote. One of the things that harmed Harris in North Carolina was earning fewer votes than Biden in majority-Black counties. For example, in majority-Black areas like Bertie and Hertford counties, her winning margin fell by six and seven percentage points, respectively. She also performed worse among college-educated white voters. In Pennsylvania, which put Biden over the top in 2020, Harris also underperformed. In the city of Philadelphia, she garnered 50,000 fewer votes than Biden had four years earlier. Trump won a much higher share of the vote in several communities with high concentrations of Hispanic voters than he had in 2020 and remained dominant in the state's more rural areas. Finally, in Wisconsin, Trump triumphed by increasing his vote totals in counties across In some counties in the rural southwestern part of the state, where the white population exceeds 95%, he won by as much as six percentage points more than he did in 2020. Safe and sound In the days and weeks leading up to the election, there had been considerable concern about whether the balloting would be disrupted in any way. Trump frequently claimed that fraud was likely, and there was also considerable evidence that non-U.S. actors were using social media to sow doubts about the safety and soundness of the process. Also, after 2020, when the counting of ballots took several days in a number of key states, there were questions about how long it would take to name a winner. Several weeks after the polls closed, groups that monitor elections in the U.S told VOA that in terms of its administration, the election had been an unqualified success. David Becker, executive director and founder of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research, called the election 'a triumph of public service.' 'The election ended up being safe and secure, even with massive amounts of disinformation, even with foreign adversaries like Russia circulating fake videos, even with bomb threats and [the] firebombing of a couple of drop boxes in the Pacific Northwest. All of those things were handled, and largely, everything went very well,' he said. 'We had clear results, with a winner declared by the media less than 12 hours after the polls closed,' Becker said. 'We had no certification challenges. That's just a remarkable success by the professionals who run elections around the country.' Mark Lindeman, policy and strategy director for Verified Voting, an organization that works to ensure the responsible use of technology in elections, agreed. 'The 2024 election went very smoothly, thanks to a lot of preparation and hard work by election officials,' Lindeman said. 'Over the last eight years since 2016, the entire country has wrapped its head around election-related cybersecurity. And the level of training and the level of resources both have improved quite substantially,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/analysis-trump-s-win-powered-by-improved-performance-across-electorate/7877032.html	2024-11-25T18:03:24-08:00	
Trump pledges tariffs on Canada and Mexico, more on China, too	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Monday that on his first day in office he would impose a 25% tariff on all products from Mexico and Canada, and an additional 10% tariff on goods from China, citing concerns over illegal immigration and the trade of illicit drugs. 'On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders,' Trump said in a post on Truth Social. Trump said the tariffs would remain in place until the two countries clamp down on drugs, particularly fentanyl, and migrants crossing the border illegally. On China, the president-elect accused Beijing of not taking strong enough action to stop the flow of illicit drugs crossing the border into the U.S. from Mexico. 'Until such time as they stop, we will be charging China an additional 10% Tariff, above any additional Tariffs, on all of their many products coming into the United States of America,' Trump said. Trump has previously pledged to end China's most-favored-nation trading status and slap tariffs on Chinese imports in excess of 60% - much higher than those imposed during his first term. The Chinese economy is in a much more vulnerable position given the country's prolonged property downturn, debt risks and weak domestic demand. The dollar rose more than 2% against the Mexican peso MXN= after Trump posted on his social media platform. Mexico's foreign ministry and its economy ministry did not have an immediate comment when contacted by Reuters. The Chinese embassy in Washington, the office of Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and the Canadian foreign ministry did not immediately respond to separate requests for comment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-pledges-tariffs-on-canada-and-mexico-more-on-china-too/7877012.html	2024-11-25T17:18:16-08:00	
Militia detains 300 migrants in desert in Libya's effort to contain sea crossings	TRIPOLI, LIBYA — Libyan military officials said Monday that they apprehended hundreds of migrants traversing the country's vast desert hoping to ultimately cross the Mediterranean Sea in pursuit of a better life in Europe. The 444th Brigade, a powerful militia group that operates under the auspices of the Libyan army, said in a statement that its patrolling commanders detained more than 300 migrants and referred them to authorities. In a post on Facebook, the group condemned smuggling and human trafficking and said its patrols would continue efforts to block smuggling routes. It posted satellite images of the desert and pictures of what appeared to be migrants sitting in rows in front of armed and masked militants. The apprehensions come as Libya remains a primary point of departure for people from the Middle East and Africa aiming to reach Europe. Many are escaping war or poverty and many employ smugglers to help them negotiate treacherous deserts and sea routes. Roughly 38,000 people have arrived in Italy and Malta from Libya this year, according to UNHCR, the United Nations refugee agency. The overcrowded boats used by migrants and smugglers are known to routinely capsize, and a key priority for European leaders has been to encourage North African countries to prevent migrants from reaching the sea. But unlike in Morocco and Tunisia — where tens of thousands of migrants also attempt to pass through en route to the southern shores of Europe — fighting between rival governments in Libya has added additional challenges to migration management partnerships. Migrant apprehensions are rarely reported in Libya, though the country's state news service, LANA, reported more than 2,000 arrests in July. The oil-rich country plunged into turmoil after a NATO-backed uprising toppled longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi. Since then, the country has been divided between dueling governments in the east and west, each backed by militias and foreign powers. Human traffickers have for years benefited from the political chaos. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Volker Türk in July said migrants in the country had been subjected to torture, forced labor and starvation while being detained.	https://www.voanews.com/a/militia-detains-300-migrants-in-the-desert-in-libya-s-effort-to-contain-sea-crossings-/7877007.html	2024-11-25T17:11:14-08:00	
Democrats plan to elect new party leader days after Trump's inauguration	WASHINGTON — The chair of the Democratic National Committee informed party leaders on Monday that the DNC would choose his successor in February, an election that will speak volumes about how the party wants to present itself during four more years of Donald Trump in the White House. Jaime Harrison, in a letter to members of the party’s powerful Rules & Bylaws Committee, outlined the process of how the party would elect its new chair. Harrison said in the letter that the committee would host four candidate forums — some in person and some virtually — in January, with the final election on February 1 during the party’s winter meeting in National Harbor, Maryland. The race to become the next chair of the Democratic National Committee, while an insular party affair, will come days after Trump is inaugurated for a second term. Democrats' selection of a leader after Vice President Kamala Harris’ 2024 loss will be a key starting point as the party starts to move forward, including addressing any structural problems and determining how to oppose Trump. Members of the Rules & Bylaws Committee will meet on December 12 to establish the rules for these elections, which beyond the chair position will include top party roles such as vice chairs, treasurer, secretary and national finance chair. The committee will also use that meeting to decide the requirements for gaining access to the ballot for those top party roles. In 2021, candidates were required to submit a nominating statement that included signatures from 40 DNC members, and that will likely be the same standard for the 2025 campaigns. 'The DNC is committed to running a transparent, equitable, and impartial election for the next generation of leadership to guide the party forward,' Harrison said in a statement. 'Electing the Chair and DNC officers is one of the most important responsibilities of the DNC Membership, and our staff will run an inclusive and transparent process that gives members the opportunity to get to know the candidates as they prepare to cast their votes.' Two Democrats have announced campaigns for chair: Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and a vice chair of the national party, and Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor and current commissioner of the Social Security Administration. Other top Democrats are either considering a run to succeed Harrison or are being pushed by party insiders, including former Texas Rep. Beto O’Rourke; Michael Blake, a former vice chair of the party; Ben Wikler, chair of the Democratic Party of Wisconsin; Rahm Emanuel, the U.S. ambassador to Japan and a former Chicago mayor; Sen. Mallory McMorrow, majority whip of the Michigan Senate, and Chuck Rocha, a longtime Democratic strategist. The next chair of the committee will be tasked with rebuilding a party demoralized by a second Trump victory. They will also oversee the party’s 2028 nominating process, a complex and contentious exercise that will make the chair central to the next presidential election. Harrison, of South Carolina, made clear in his letter to the rules committee that the four forums hosted by the party would be live streamed and the party would give grassroots Democrats across the country the ability to engage with the process through those events. He also said he intends to remain neutral during the chair election.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democrats-plan-to-elect-new-party-leader-days-after-trump-s-inauguration-/7877004.html	2024-11-25T16:52:39-08:00	
Biden to attend Trump inauguration, White House says	U.S. President Joe Biden will attend Donald Trump's inauguration in January, the White House said Monday, calling it a 'commitment to our democratic values' despite Trump's skipping Biden's own swearing-in. Then-President Trump refused to attend Biden's inauguration in 2021, after falsely claiming Biden’s election win was fraudulent and whipping up a mob of supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol. 'The president promised that he would attend the inauguration of whoever won the election,' deputy press secretary Andrew Bates told reporters flying with Biden on Air Force One. 'He and the first lady are going to honor that promise and attend the inauguration.' Bates added: 'He views that as an important demonstration of commitment to our democratic values and to honoring the will of the people, as we continue to provide an orderly and effective transition.' Despite repeatedly describing Trump as a threat to democracy during the 2024 campaign, Democrat Biden has made a point of providing Trump with the smooth transition that the Republican denied him. Biden invited President-elect Trump to the White House the week after the November 5 vote, in which Trump beat Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris to win a historic comeback. Biden, 82, dropped his own bid for a second term in July and endorsed Harris after a disastrous debate performance against Trump triggered fears among Democrats about his age and mental acuity.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-to-attend-trump-inauguration-white-house-says/7876995.html	2024-11-25T16:44:53-08:00	
Death toll from Sudan’s civil war far exceeds previous estimates, study suggests	The number of people killed in Sudan’s civil war is far higher than previously thought, according to new research. The conflict has forced 11 million people to flee their homes and has created the world’s worst hunger crisis.

18,000 in Mexico register to run for Supreme Court seats, federal judgeships	Over 18,000 people in Mexico have registered online to run for Supreme Court seats and federal judgeships in the country's contentious new selection process, but a random drawing in the end will determine who gets on the ballot, officials said Monday. 'The registration to be a member of the judiciary was a success, something unprecedented, historic,' President Claudia Sheinbaum told the press Monday morning. Sheinbaum defends this reform promulgated by her predecessor and mentor, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador. The ruling party pushed through a constitutional reform in September to make all federal judges stand for election, replacing the system where court employees and lawyers mainly move up through the ranks. Current court employees and their supporters have staged dozens of demonstrations against the reforms, calling them part of a ruling-party campaign to weaken checks and balances and eliminate independent regulatory and oversight bodies. Now, candidates for Supreme Court seats and federal judgeships need only a law degree, a grade point average of 3.2, 'five years of professional experience' and five letters of recommendation from neighbors or friends. That, and some luck in the final drawing. Officials rejected criticism that has called the process rushed or amateurish for the often highly technical posts that can hear cases involving intellectual property, organized crime and constitutional law. 'The results have been spectacular,' said Arturo Zaldivar, a top adviser to Sheinbaum. According to the plan, evaluation committees will have just over a month to review thousands of resumes and whittle the field to about 10 candidates or fewer for each of the 881 judgeships and nine seats on the Supreme Court. Then 1,793 names chosen at random from those selected will appear on the ballot on June 1. Critics warn that many who land on the ballot will be unknowns who perhaps have never argued a case in the courts they seek to run. 'You don't elect a doctor or a surgeon for an operation based on their popularity. You elect them based on their technical expertise, their ability, their knowledge,' said Sergio Méndez Silva, the legal coordinator for the civic group Foundation for Justice. 'That also applies for a judge.' With candidates now having to run election campaigns, critics warn there is a chance drug cartels or political parties could finance them to get friendly judges onto the bench. There are also concerns that the evaluation committees deciding who makes the cut for the selection to appear on ballots may not be impartial. Most committee members were appointed by the legislative or executive branches, controlled by the ruling Morena party. Some critics argue that the current justice system, which is riddled with nepotism, corruption and a lack of accountability, needs to be changed. 'We need a justice system that gives results,' said Martínez Garza, an academic and former head of the human rights commission in the northern border state of Nuevo Leon who has registered to run for a Supreme Court seat. Trials in Mexico can last for years, and the ruling party has added to the growing list of crimes for which bail is not allowed, meaning that a large percentage of the prison population is people awaiting trial. Some material for this report came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7876746.html	2024-11-25T16:11:08-08:00	
Haiti's sexual violence survivors face dwindling support, report warns	Survivors of sexual violence in Haiti face worsening risks and dwindling support amid the growing influence of armed gangs, a collapsed health care system and a frozen justice system, a report warned on Monday. Nearly 4,000 women and girls reported being victims of sexual violence in the first 10 months of 2024, Human Rights Watch said in the report, noting that many people do not report due to fear of retaliation and poor prospects of receiving help. Those who do seek care often cannot do so within the critical 72-hour window to access drugs to treat HIV exposure or emergency contraception, the report said, as many cannot afford private health care and as public clinics shut down due to violence. In October, the United Nations warned that just 24% of health facilities were operating in Port-au-Prince's metropolitan area. This month, Doctors Without Borders, a major free health care provider, halted operations, citing rape and death threats from police. Haitian feminist organization Neges Mawon said it has this year received reports of some 230 rapes in just two neighborhoods outside the capital, and four pregnant women died due to poor health care and blocked medical supplies. Abortion is illegal in Haiti A 25-year-old mother of four told HRW that she was raped by four men in Port-au-Prince's Cite Soleil area while looking for water. 'Now, they do whatever they want to all of us,' she said. 'I couldn't go to the doctor. I didn't have money.' In a separate report released on Monday, the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime said outgunned police, a 'woefully' under-resourced international mission, political infighting and violent vigilantism are aggravating Haiti's general crisis. 'It is difficult to identify any meaningful inroads on the part of law enforcement,' it said, adding that the transitional presidential council's recent ouster of the prime minister resulted in the council's 'reigning over a mountain of ashes.' The prime minister's replacement saw the two women who previously held senior Cabinet positions — foreign affairs and economy — removed from their posts. 'More than 150 feminist and human rights groups have endorsed an action plan to ensure the full participation of women,' Neges Mawon said on X. 'It is clear fighting violence against women and girls is not a priority for this government.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-s-sexual-violence-survivors-face-dwindling-support-report-warns/7876736.html	2024-11-25T16:07:24-08:00	
Court agrees with ban on medical marijuana advertising in Mississippi	JACKSON, Mississippi — Medical marijuana businesses in the southern U.S. state of Mississippi don't have the right to advertise on billboards or other places because marijuana itself remains illegal under federal law, an appeals court says. The owner of a medical marijuana dispensary argued that the First Amendment protects the right to advertise because Mississippi law permits the sale of cannabis products to people with debilitating medical conditions. The state enacted its law in 2022. A three-judge panel of 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Friday rejected the arguments about advertising. They cited the federal Controlled Substances Act, which since 1970 has prohibited the manufacture, distribution, dispensing and possession of marijuana. The federal law applies in all states, and Mississippi 'faces no constitutional obstacle to restricting commercial speech relating to unlawful transactions,' the judges wrote. The Mississippi attorney general's office praised the court decision for upholding 'Mississippi’s reasonable restrictions on advertising for medical marijuana dispensaries by print, broadcast and other mass communications,' said the office spokesperson, MaryAsa Lee. Clarence Cocroft II operates Tru Source Medical Cannabis in the northern Mississippi city of Olive Branch. He sued the state in 2023 to challenge its ban on medical marijuana advertising on billboards or in print, broadcast or social media or via mass email or text messaging. 'Upholding this ban makes it incredibly difficult for me to find potential customers and to educate people about Mississippi’s medical marijuana program,' Cocroft said in a statement Monday. 'I remain committed to continuing this fight so my business can be treated the same as any other legal business in Mississippi.' The state allows medical marijuana businesses to have websites or social media accounts that provide information about their retail dispensing locations and a list of products available. It allows them to be listed in phone books or business directories and to display cannabis in company logos. The businesses can also sponsor not-for-profit charity or advocacy events. Cocroft is represented by the Institute for Justice, a nonprofit libertarian law firm. The firm said Monday that it was considering its next steps in the lawsuit, including possibly asking the entire appeals court to reconsider the case or an appeal to the Supreme Court. 'Mississippi cannot on the one hand create an entire marketplace for the sale of medical marijuana, and on the other hand rely on an unenforced federal law to prohibit buyers and sellers from talking about it,' said Ari Bargil, an Institute for Justice attorney.	https://www.voanews.com/a/court-agrees-with-ban-on-medical-marijuana-advertising-in-mississippi-/7876744.html	2024-11-25T15:55:15-08:00	
Trump's candidate picks include some firsts, but diversity down from Biden	Washington — Republican President-elect Donald Trump's picks for his Cabinet include some historic firsts, though women and people of color make up less of the overall number than they did when Democratic President Joe Biden first took office. Historic firsts Florida political operative Susie Wiles, who ran Trump's 2024 campaign, is set to be the first woman to hold the high-profile position of White House chief of staff. U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, would be the first person of Hispanic origin to hold that role if confirmed by his fellow senators. Hedge fund executive Scott Bessent, nominee for Treasury secretary, could become the first openly gay Republican Cabinet member confirmed by the Senate. The investor lives in South Carolina with his husband and two children. Former U.S. Representative Tulsi Gabbard, with roots in both Samoan and Hawaiian cultures, would be the first director of national intelligence from the Pacific Islander community, according to Inclusive America, a nonprofit that tracks diversity in government. Gender gap Trump has chosen eight women so far for his Cabinet, doubling the number from his first-term cabinet selection. This is less than Biden's first Cabinet, made up of 11 women, which then rose to 13, a historic high for women serving concurrently, according to the Center for American Women and Politics. That compares with eight women during Barack Obama's presidential cabinet, five for George W. Bush and nine for Bill Clinton, according to the center's data. Race breakdown Trump has so far picked four people of color for his Cabinet, representing about a fifth of it. That number is in line with his first term but trails the roughly 40% share of minorities in the full U.S. population, according to the U.S. Census. The number is also well below Biden's Cabinet, which included 13 people of color, as well as Obama's with 10, Bush's with six and Clinton's with eight, according to Inclusive America. Generational breakdown While Trump will be the oldest president to take office at age 78 -- about five months older than Biden was at his Jan. 20, 2021 inauguration -- the president-elect has chosen millennial and Gen Z women for top roles. Congresswoman Elise Stefanik, 40, the nominee for United Nations ambassador, will be the youngest person to hold this position if confirmed by the Senate. Karoline Leavitt, 27, is also set to be the youngest White House press secretary ever, taking the highly visible job after working on Trump's 2024 campaign. Experience At least 16 of Trump's cabinet picks so far have experience in state or federal government, but not all in the direct field or department that they could oversee. Three of the picks come from the industries that the secretaries will regulate: Bessent, Commerce Secretary nominee Howard Lutnick and Energy Secretary nominee Chris Wright. Sexual misconduct claims Two of Trump's cabinet picks have been accused of sexual misconduct. Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump's Health and Human Services secretary nominee, was accused by his family's live-in babysitter of groping her in 1999, when she was 23. Kennedy has said he does not recall the incident. No charges were filed. Defense Secretary nominee Pete Hegseth was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a conference in California in 2017. No charges were filed, and Hegseth's attorney has said the encounter was consensual. Hegseth and the woman entered into a confidential monetary settlement afterward to avoid a lawsuit. Linda McMahon, the nominee to run the Department of Education, is a defendant in a sexual abuse lawsuit that alleges that as CEO of World Wrestling Entertainment in the 1980s, she failed to stop a former ringside announcer from sexually grooming and abusing five boys who worked for him. McMahon has denied the allegations, and she herself is not accused of sexual abuse. Didn’t I see you on TV? Many of the cabinet selections have been TV regulars in recent years advocating on air for Trump's agenda. But for at least four high-level selections, television has been their recent day job.

French prosecutors seek 20-year term for Pelicot in mass rape case	AVIGNON, France — French prosecutors asked for the maximum 20-year prison sentence for Dominique Pelicot, who organized the repeated mass rape of his then-wife by knocking her unconscious with drugs and inviting dozens of strangers to abuse her in the family home. Pelicot, 71, has admitted the charges in a trial that attracted worldwide attention and turned into an examination of the pervasiveness of sexual violence in France and beyond. Fifty other men also stand trial for participating in the sex acts. The prosecutors, who will over the next two days say what sentences they seek against the co-accused, rejected the arguments made by many of the men that they did not realize they were raping Gisele Pelicot or had not intended to do it. Gisele Pelicot appeared motionless while the accused abused her in thousands of videos and pictures recorded by her then-husband and shown in court over the past weeks. 'The accused are trying to shirk responsibility by saying they thought Gisele Pelicot consented,' public prosecutor Laure Chabaud told the court on Monday. 'But it's not possible, today, in 2024, to consider that,' Chabaud said, adding that video and pictures clearly showed Gisele Pelicot was unconscious and therefore unable to give her consent. As for Dominique Pelicot, 'the maximum sentence is 20 years, which is a lot ... but at the same time ... too little in view of the seriousness of the acts that were committed and repeated,' Chabaud said. The prosecutors also said they were seeking a 17-year sentence for Jean-Pierre Marechal, 63, who has admitted to working with Dominique Pelicot to drug his own wife, Cilia, and for both men to rape her, after the men met on a now-shuttered website. The verdicts and sentences are expected around December 20. Gisele Pelicot, 71, could have demanded the trial be kept behind closed doors but instead asked for it be held in public, saying she hoped it would help other women speak up and show that victims have nothing to be ashamed of. The trial has triggered protest rallies in support of Gisele Pelicot and spurred soul searching, including a debate on whether to update France's rape law. Unlike in some other European countries, French law makes no mention of a requirement that sex involve consent and requires prosecutors to prove a perpetrator's intent to rape using 'violence, coercion, threat or surprise.' Dominique Pelicot's lawyer, Beatrice Zavarro, told reporters it was not a surprise that prosecutors had sought the longest sentence possible.	https://www.voanews.com/a/french-prosecutors-seek-20-year-term-for-pelicot-in-mass-rape-case/7876738.html	2024-11-25T15:44:29-08:00	
Google to build subsea cable linking Australia's Darwin to Christmas Island	sydney — Australia's Indian Ocean territory of Christmas Island will be connected by subsea cable to the northern garrison city of Darwin, a project backed by Alphabet's Google that Australia says will boost its digital resilience. Christmas Island is 1,500 kilometers (930 miles) west of the Australian mainland, with a small population of 1,250, but strategically located in the Indian Ocean, 350 kilometers (215 miles) from Jakarta. The cable announcement comes as the Australian and U.S. militaries upgrade airfields in Australia's north, where a rotating force of U.S. Marines will be joined by Japanese troops next year. Google's vice president of global network infrastructure, Brian Quigley, said in a statement the Bosun cable will link Darwin to Christmas Island, while another subsea cable will connect Melbourne on Australia's east coast to the west coast city of Perth, then on to Christmas Island and Singapore. Australia is seeking to reduce its exposure to digital disruption by building more subsea cable pathways to Asia to its west, and through the South Pacific to the United States. 'These new cable systems will not only expand and strengthen the resilience of Australia's own digital connectivity through new and diversified routes but will also complement the Government's active work with industry and government partners to support secure, resilient and reliable connectivity across the Pacific,' Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said in a statement. The other partners in the cable project include Australian data center company NextDC, Macquarie-backed telecommunications group Vocus, and SUBCO. SUBCO previously built an Indian Ocean cable from Perth to Oman, with spurs to the U.S. military base of Diego Garcia, and Cocos Islands, where Australia is upgrading a runway for defense surveillance aircraft. Although 900 kilometers (560 miles) apart, Christmas Island is seen as an Indian Ocean neighbor of Cocos Islands, which the Australian Defense Force has said is key to its maritime surveillance operations in a region where China is increasing submarine activity. The new cables will also link to a Pacific Islands network being built by Google and jointly funded by the United States, connecting the U.S. and Australia through hubs in Fiji and French Polynesia. Vocus said in a statement the two networks will form the world's largest submarine cable system spanning 42,500 kilometers (26,408 miles) of fiber optic cable running between the U.S. and Asia via Australia.	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-to-build-subsea-cable-linking-australia-s-darwin-to-christmas-island-/7876729.html	2024-11-25T15:42:18-08:00	
Google's US antitrust trial over online ad empire winds down	ALEXANDRIA, Virginia — The U.S. Justice Department told a federal judge that Google illegally dominated online advertising technology in seeking a second antitrust win against the company. The closing arguments in Alexandria cap a 15-day trial held in September in which prosecutors sought to show Google monopolized markets for publisher ad servers and advertiser ad networks and tried to dominate the market for ad exchanges, which sit between buyers and sellers. 'Google rigged the rules of the road,' said DOJ lawyer Aaron Teitelbaum, who asked the judge to hold Google accountable for anti-competitive conduct and added that Google is 'once, twice, three times a monopolist.' Another DOJ lawyer, Julia Tarver Wood, compared the case to the Charles Dickens novel A Tale of Two Cities and said U.S. Judge Leonie Brinkema had to decide whether to adopt the DOJ or Google version of the state of the ad market. Google lawyer Karen Dunn said the DOJ had not met its legal burden and was asking Brinkema to overrule key precedents. 'The law simply does not support what the plaintiffs are arguing in this case,' Dunn said. She argued the DOJ was ignoring Google's legitimate business decisions and the robust quality of the online advertising market. The company argues the government had cherry-picked a narrow slice of the online market and did not account for aggressive competition. Shares of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, were up 1.4% in afternoon trading. Publishers testified at the trial that they could not switch away from Google, even when it rolled out features they disliked, since there was no other way to access the huge advertising demand within Google's ad network. In 2017, News Corp estimated losing at least $9 million in ad revenue that year if it had switched away, one witness said. If Brinkema finds that Google broke the law, she would consider prosecutors' request to make Google at least sell off Google Ad Manager, a platform that includes the company's publisher ad server and its ad exchange. Google offered to sell the ad exchange this year to end a European Union antitrust investigation, but European publishers rejected the proposal as insufficient, Reuters first reported in September. Analysts view the ad tech case as a smaller financial risk than the case in which a judge ruled Google maintains an illegal monopoly in online search, and in which prosecutors have argued the company must be forced to sell its Chrome browser.	https://www.voanews.com/a/google-s-us-antitrust-trial-over-online-ad-empire-winds-down/7876728.html	2024-11-25T15:30:17-08:00	
California governor says state could offer electric vehicle rebates if Trump eliminates federal tax credit	SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA — California could offer rebates for electric vehicle purchases if the incoming Trump administration eliminates a federal tax credit for people who buy electric cars, Governor Gavin Newsom said Monday. Newsom, a Democrat, proposed creating a new version of the state’s Clean Vehicle Rebate Program, which was phased out in 2023 after funding 594,000 cars and saving 456 million gallons of fuel, Newsom’s office said. 'Consumers continue to prove the skeptics wrong — zero-emission vehicles are here to stay,' Newsom said in a statement. 'We’re not turning back on a clean transportation future — we’re going to make it more affordable for people to drive vehicles that don’t pollute.' Newsom’s proposal is part of his plan to protect California's progressive policies ahead of Republican President-elect Donald Trump's second term. He called the state Legislature to convene in a special session to help 'Trump-proof' state laws by giving the attorney general’s office more funding to fight federal challenges. But a budget shortfall could complicate California’s resistance efforts. Early budget projections show the state could face a $2 billion deficit next year, according to a report released last week by the nonpartisan Legislative Analyst’s Office. That’s an improvement from an estimated $46.8 billion deficit the state faced last year, but the shortfall could still curtail the state’s ability to expand new programs and fight federal legal challenges. Legislative leaders in both chambers have said the state needs to stay prudent in anticipation of future budget deficits. Karoline Leavitt, a spokeswoman for Trump's transition team, said the president-elect would deliver on his campaign promises, 'including stopping attacks on gas-powered cars.' 'When he takes office, President Trump will support the auto industry, allowing space for both gas-powered cars AND electric vehicles,' she said in a statement. Money for the new rebate system could come from the state's Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund, which is funded by polluters under the state’s cap-and-trade program, the governor's office said. Officials didn’t say how much the program would cost or how the rebates would work. California has surpassed 2 million zero-emission vehicles sold, according to Newsom's office. The state has passed policies in recent years to transition away from fossil fuel-powered, cars, trucks, trains and lawn mowers. Trump previously vowed to end federal electric vehicle tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new zero-emission vehicles. There’s also a $4,000 credit for used ones. But Trump later softened his stance as Tesla CEO Elon Musk became a supporter and adviser. Newsom's proposed rebates could exclude Tesla and other automakers in an effort to promote more market competition and innovation, according to the governor's office. But that is subject to negotiation with the state Legislature. Musk called Tesla's possible exclusion 'insane' in a post on X. About 42% of rebates went to people buying or leasing Tesla vehicles under the state's previous clean vehicle rebate program, according to data from the California Air Resources Board. Trump criticized Newsom on social media after the governor called for a special session, calling out the high cost of living in California and the state’s homelessness crisis. Trump said Newsom was 'stopping all of the GREAT things that can be done to ‘Make California Great Again.’' Newsom said on his podcast earlier this month that he reached out to Trump after the election. He said at a news conference last week that he still hadn’t heard back from the president-elect. California's defunct Clean Vehicle Rebate Program offered rebates on electric cars as high as $2,500.	https://www.voanews.com/a/california-governor-says-state-could-offer-electric-vehicle-rebates-if-trump-eliminates-federal-tax-credit-/7876724.html	2024-11-25T15:27:19-08:00	
Migrant boat sinkings off Madagascar highlight desperation felt by many Somalis	Mogadishu, Somalia — The Somali government says it will begin evacuating the survivors of two boats, carrying mostly Somali migrants, which capsized off the coast of Madagascar Saturday. Twenty-four passengers were killed while 46 others survived. The passengers were attempting to migrate in search of a better life, away from Somalia’s chronic drought, violence and food insecurity. During a news briefing in Mogadishu, Somali Foreign Minister Ahmed Moalin Fiqi confirmed the fatality figures from the capsizing of the two boats off the coast of Madagascar, in the Indian Ocean on Saturday. Fiqi said that while authorities believe most of the migrants are Somalis, they suspect that a small number are from other countries. He said migrants identified as Somalis will be brought back to their home country. He said, 'We have made significant efforts over the past two days, particularly through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and their embassy staff in Addis Ababa; they have maintained close communication with their headquarters and the office of the president. Together, they have worked effectively to determine the best way to evacuate these survivors after assessing the nationalities of those involved.' Migration from Somalia has been on the rise in recent years, mainly due to a lack of security and lack of employment opportunities in the country. There are no reliable estimates of how many have migrated. Zakariye Yusuf Abdirahman, program manager of the Coalition of Somalia Human Rights Defenders, said many Somali youths have a sense of hopelessness that drives them to seek opportunities elsewhere, even if it means facing dangerous conditions. He said that with the ongoing insecurity and employment challenges in the country, the burdens people face continue to increase daily. He also said there seems to be no end in sight, and this situation particularly affects the youth who are striving for a better life and future. Some Somali lawmakers accuse the government of failing to create opportunities for young people under 30 years old, who make up 75 percent of the population. Mohamed Ibrahim Moallimu, an opposition member of parliament, said young Somalis should try to make their country a better place rather than flee. The lawmaker said he understands why young people are leaving the country. He believes that the insecurity caused by terrorism and the lack of employment opportunities are significant challenges contributing to their disappointment with their homeland. However, he encourages them to recognize that they have the power to create change in their country. One major reason people say they are leaving is the heavy taxes placed on businesses by both the government and militant group al-Shabab, which has led to widespread protests in recent months. This situation has forced many individuals to shut down their businesses. Asma Mohamed of Mogadishu is one such individual. She said that, although it is tragic to hear about the incident in Madagascar, the youth involved believed they had no other option. She explains that she used to run a stall. However, when both the government and al-Shabab militants imposed taxes on her, she was forced to close her business. Now, she said, she is preparing to leave the country. Meanwhile, dozens of Somalis who left and got as far as Madagascar are preparing to come back, no doubt happy to be alive after the boat sinking, but no closer to migrating from the country they desperately wanted to leave.	https://www.voanews.com/a/migrant-boat-sinkings-off-madagascar-highlight-desperation-felt-by-many-somalis/7876726.html	2024-11-25T15:25:53-08:00	
Biden opens final White House holiday season with turkey pardons	washington — President Joe Biden kicked off his final holiday season at the White House on Monday by issuing the traditional reprieve to two turkeys who will bypass the Thanksgiving table to live out their days in southern Minnesota. Biden welcomed 2,500 guests to the South Lawn under sunny skies as he cracked jokes about the fates of 'Peach' and 'Blossom' and sounded wistful tones about the last weeks of his presidency after a half-century in Washington power circles. 'It’s been the honor of my life. I’m forever grateful,' Biden said, taking note of his impending departure on January 20, 2025. That's when power will transfer to Republican President-elect Donald Trump, the man Biden defeated four years ago and was battling again until he was pressured to bow out of the race amid concerns about his age and viability. Biden is 82. Until Inauguration Day, the president and first lady Jill Biden will continue a busy run of festivities that will double as their long goodbye. The White House schedule in December is replete with holiday parties for various constituencies, from West Wing staff to members of Congress and the White House press corps. Turkey talk Biden relished the brief ceremony with the pardoned turkeys, named for the official flower of the president's home state of Delaware. 'The peach pie in my state is one of my favorites,' he said during remarks that were occasionally interrupted by Peach gobbling atop the table to Biden's right. 'Peach is making a last-minute plea,' Biden said at one point, drawing laughter from an overflow crowd that included Cabinet members, White House staff and their families, and students from 4H programs and Future Farmers of America chapters. Biden introduced Peach as a bird who 'lives by the motto, ‘Keep calm and gobble on.’ ' Blossom, the president said, has a different motto: 'No fowl play. Just Minnesota nice.' Peach and Blossom came from the farm of John Zimmerman, near the southern Minnesota city of Northfield. Zimmerman, who has raised about 4 million turkeys, is president of the National Turkey Federation, the group that has gifted U.S. presidents Thanksgiving turkeys since the Truman administration after World War II. President Harry Truman, however, preferred to eat the birds. Official pardon ceremonies did not become an annual White House tradition until the administration of President George H.W. Bush in 1989. Separately Monday, first lady Jill Biden received the official White House Christmas tree that will be decorated and put on display in the Blue Room. The 18.5-foot (5.64-meter) Fraser fir came from a farm in an area of western North Carolina that recently was devastated by Hurricane Helene. Cartner’s Christmas Tree Farm lost thousands of trees in the storm 'but this one remained standing and they named it ‘Tremendous’ for the extraordinary hope that it represents,' Jill Biden said at the event. The Bidens were also traveling to New York City on Monday for an evening 'Friendsgiving' event at a Coast Guard station on Staten Island. Biden began his valedictory calendar Friday night with a gala for hundreds of his friends, supporters and staff members who gathered in a pavilion erected on the South Lawn, with a view out to the Lincoln Memorial. Cabinet secretaries, Democratic donors and his longest-serving staff members came together to hear from the president and pay tribute, with no evidence that Biden was effectively forced from the Democratic ticket this summer and watched Vice President Kamala Harris suffer defeat on November 5. Even as the first couple avoided the context surrounding the president's coming exit, those political realities were nonetheless apparent, as younger Democrats like Maryland Governor Wes Moore, Illinois Governor J.B. Pritzker and Biden's Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg not only raised their glasses to the president but held forth with many attendees who could remain in the party's power circles in the 2028 election cycle and beyond.	https://www.voanews.com/a/biden-opens-final-white-house-holiday-season-with-turkey-pardons/7876720.html	2024-11-25T15:13:45-08:00

US urges Zimbabwe to double down on reforms	Harare, ZIMBABWE — The United States is urging the Zimbabwe government to double down on reforms aimed at returning the country to the prosperity it once enjoyed. Speaking to reporters in Harare on Monday, Pamela Tremont, the U.S. ambassador to Zimbabwe, said her country wants to have cordial relations with the southern African nation. She urged the government to pursue political and financial reforms that she said would deliver Zimbabwe’s people the prosperity and dignity they deserve. 'We're here today as part of our commitment to the Zimbabwe people that is long-standing and consistent, and we're here to advocate for the reforms that the international community has been asking for for many years,' Tremont said. 'We're quite clear — we need public officials to quit using their public offices for private gain. We need the judiciary to be able to deliver justice independently of political considerations.' The United States also wants 'the rights to assembly and free speech to be fully respected,' in Zimbabwe, she said. Tremont spoke as talks on restructuring Zimbabwe’s $21 billion debt began. Akinwumi Adesina, president of the African Development Bank Group, called for negotiations on the debt to speed up. 'Even wars never last this long,' Adesina said. 'It is clearly time to bring this to a close — end the decades of untold damage to the economy of Zimbabwe, the suffering of its people, and have a new beginning with collective hope, aspiration and shared prosperity for its people, today and well into the future. It is time to make Zimbabwe beautiful again. No one, no matter how strong, can run up a hill carrying on their back piles of sand. The $21 billion debt of Zimbabwe, of which the bulk is actually arrears, has made arrears the new debt stacked like piles of sandbags on the back of Zimbabwe. 'We all agree we must play our part to correct this anomaly and give a new lease of life to this nation and its people so Zimbabwe can run again.' Adesina was asking institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund to finance new loans for Zimbabwe and forgive or reduce old debts. At the same meeting, President Emmerson Mnangagwa appealed for debt to be restructured so Zimbabwe can access credit lines. 'The successful implementation of our arrears clearance and debt resolution strategy is key for Zimbabwe to unlock new concessional external financing critical for achieving our economic development objectives,' the president said. 'I call for the continued support of the international financial institutions, development partners, our creditors and the international community for the arrears clearance and debt resolution process. Access to external financing will be key for long-term funding [of] our projects and programs. I am looking forward to achieving the set objective of this structured dialogue.' Zimbabwe’s national debt has climbed steadily since the early 2000s, when land confiscations by the government led to sharply reduced food production and sent the economy into a tailspin. Some government officials maintain that Zimbabwe cannot access credit lines because of the targeted sanctions imposed on some leaders for alleged election rigging and human rights abuses in the early 2000s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-urges-zimbabwe-to-double-down-on-reforms/7876700.html	2024-11-25T15:01:23-08:00

Dow hits another record as stocks rise on treasury secretary pick	New York — U.S. stocks rose Monday, with those benefiting the most from lower interest rates and a stronger economy leading the way. The S&P 500 climbed 0.3% to pull closer to its all-time high set two weeks ago. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 440 points, or 1%, to its own record set on Friday, while the Nasdaq composite rose 0.3%. Treasury yields also eased in the bond market amid what some analysts called a 'Bessent bounce' after President-elect Donald Trump said he wants Scott Bessent, a hedge fund manager, to be his treasury secretary. Bessent has argued for reducing the U.S. government's deficit, which is how much more it spends than it takes in through taxes and other revenue. Such an approach could soothe worries on Wall Street that Trump's policies may lead to a much bigger deficit, which in turn would put upward pressure on Treasury yields. After climbing above 4.44% immediately after Trump's election, the yield on the 10-year Treasury fell back to 4.26% Monday, down from 4.41% late Friday. That's a notable move, and lower yields make it cheaper for all kinds of companies and households to borrow money. They also give a boost to prices for stocks and other investments. That helped stocks of smaller companies lead the way, and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks jumped 1.5%. It finished just shy of its all-time high, which was set three years ago. Smaller companies can feel bigger boosts from lower borrowing costs because of the need for many to borrow to grow. The two-year Treasury yield, which more closely tracks the market's expectations for what the Federal Reserve will do with overnight interest rates, also eased sharply. The Fed began cutting its main interest rate just a couple months ago from a two-decade high, hoping to keep the job market humming after bringing inflation nearly all the way down to its 2% target. But immediately after Trump's victory, traders had reduced bets for how many cuts the Fed may deliver next year. They were worried Trump's preference for lower tax rates and higher spending on the border would balloon the national debt. A report coming on Wednesday could influence how much the Fed may cut rates. Economists expect it to show that an underlying inflation trend the Fed prefers to use accelerated to 2.8% last month from 2.7% in September. Higher inflation would make the Fed more reluctant to cut rates as deeply or as quickly as it would otherwise. Goldman Sachs economist David Mericle expects that to slow by the end of next year to 2.4%, but he said inflation would be even lower if not for expected tariff increases on imports from China and autos favored by Trump. In the stock market, Bath & Body Works jumped 16.5% after delivering stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. The seller of personal care products and home fragrances also raised its financial forecasts for the full year, even though it still sees a 'volatile retail environment' and a shorter holiday shopping season this year. Much focus has been on how resilient U.S. shoppers can remain, given high prices across the economy and still-high interest rates. Last week, two major retailers sent mixed messages. Target tumbled after giving a dour forecast for the holiday shopping season. It followed Walmart, which gave a much more encouraging outlook. Another big retailer, Macy's, said Monday that its sales for the latest quarter were in line with its expectations, but that it would delay the release of its full financial results. It found a single employee had intentionally hidden up to $154 million in delivery expenses, and it needs more time to complete its investigation. Macy's stock fell 2.2%. Among the market's leaders were several companies related to the housing industry. Monday's drop in Treasury yields could translate into easier mortgage rates, which could spur activity for housing. Builders FirstSource, a supplier of building materials, rose 5.9%. Homebuilders, D.R. Horton, PulteGroup and Lennar all rose at least 5.6%. All told, the S&P 500 rose 18.03 points to 5,987.37. The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 440.06 to 44,736.57, and the Nasdaq composite gained 51.18 to 19,054.84. In stock markets abroad, indexes moved modestly across much of Europe after finishing mixed in Asia. In the crypto market, bitcoin was trading below $95,000 after threatening to hit $100,000 late last week for the first time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dow-hits-another-record-as-stocks-rise-on-treasury-secretary-pick/7876681.html	2024-11-25T14:22:07-08:00

Can Israeli strikes in Syria undermine Iran-backed militias?	Strikes carried out by Israel in recent weeks in Syria have significantly weakened Iranian-backed militant groups, though they continue to pose a threat, experts say. Since the start of the war in Gaza in October 2023, and the ongoing hostilities between Israel and the militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, Israeli strikes in Syria have become more frequent, according to monitoring groups. The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), which has researchers across Syria, reported last week it has documented over 150 Israeli strikes in Syria so far in 2024. The strikes have hit targets belonging to Iranian-backed militias in several Syrian provinces, according to SOHR. Iran, a key backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad’s government, has built a significant military presence in Syria in recent years, supported by dozens of proxy groups, including Hezbollah and several Iraqi militias. Last week, the Syrian government blamed Israel for an attack in the ancient town of Palmyra in central Syria that killed at least 36 people and wounded 50 others. SOHR, which gave a much higher figure on casualties, said one of the strikes targeted a meeting involving some commanders of Hezbollah and the Iraqi group al-Nujaba. Both Hezbollah and al-Nujaba are U.S.-designated terrorist organizations. The Israeli military declined to comment on the attack, but it has previously acknowledged conducting strikes against Iranian-linked groups in Syria. Phillip Smyth, an expert on Iranian-backed militias, said the Israeli strikes 'are demonstrative of their goals to degrade the leadership elements within Lebanese Hezbollah' and other pro-Iranian militant groups in Syria. 'This would include those in Lebanon and Syria, particularly the latter, given how Hezbollah still needs to command its 3,000-7,500 [militants] that currently occupy the country,' he told VOA. 'These types of strikes eliminate people who are irreplaceable in other respects,' Smyth said. 'They are loyal, are part of the early generations of leadership and have a good amount of control over a very closed organization.' Another Israeli strike earlier this month hit a suburb near the Syrian capital, Damascus, killing at least 15 people, according to Syrian state media. The Israeli military said the Palestinian Islamic Jihad group was the target of that attack, adding that it 'inflicted significant damage to the terrorist organization’s command center and to its operatives.' Ahmed Rahal, a former Syrian military general who defected from the army in 2012, stated that such attacks have created new dynamics for Iran and its proxies in Syria. 'Iran has moved some of its military advisers out of Syria,' he told VOA, noting that, 'recent strikes against Islamic Jihad and even elements of the Syrian military show that Israel isn’t only targeting Iranian and Hezbollah forces but anything it deems a threat.' Local media reports in Syria last week said that amid increased Israeli strikes, Iran transported some of its proxies from Syria to Iraq, including at least a dozen high-ranking military advisers who had been deployed in Damascus and Palmyra. Seth Frantzman, an adjunct fellow at the Washington-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies, offers a different explanation for the movement of Iranian proxies in the region. 'Iran may be moving proxies around Iraq and Syria in order to threaten Israel and may feel the need to move them more often so that they preserve operational security in case of Israeli retaliation,' he told VOA. 'Iran also likely wants to mobilize proxy forces in case of a ceasefire in Lebanon between Israel and Hezbollah so it can increase threats to Israel on other fronts,' Frantzman said. Iran's Foreign Ministry recently said there has been no change in the status or number of their military advisers in Syria. Other experts argue that as long as pro-Iranian militias control the Iraq-Syria border, Israeli strikes are unlikely to prevent Tehran from sending weapons to Hezbollah and other proxies. 'These strikes may briefly disrupt the transport of men and weapons between Iraq and Syria, but these groups have shown their ability to adapt and resume their activities quickly,' said Omar Abu Layla, director of Deir Ezzor 24, a news and research network focused on eastern Syria.

US prosecutors seek to drop federal criminal cases against Trump	Washington — U.S. prosecutors moved on Monday to drop the two federal criminal cases against Donald Trump involving his efforts to overturn his 2020 election defeat and his handling of classified documents, citing Justice Department policy against prosecuting a sitting president. The steps by prosecutors working with Special Counsel Jack Smith in the two cases represent a big legal victory for the Republican president-elect, who won the Nov. 5 U.S. election and is set to return to office on Jan. 20. The Justice Department policy that the prosecutors cited dates back to the 1970s. It holds that a criminal prosecution of a sitting president would violate the U.S. Constitution by undermining the ability of the country's chief executive to function. Courts will still have to approve both requests from prosecutors. The prosecutors in a filing in the election subversion case said the department's policy requires the case to be dismissed before Trump returns to the White House. 'This outcome is not based on the merits or strength of the case against the defendant,' prosecutors wrote in the filing. Smith's office similarly moved to end its attempt to revive the case accusing Trump of illegally retaining classified documents when he left office in 2021 after his first term as president. But the prosecutors signaled they will still ask a federal appeals court to bring back the case against two Trump associates who had been accused of obstructing that investigation. Trump spokesman Steven Cheung hailed what he called 'a major victory for the rule of law.' Trump had faced criminal charges in four cases -- the two brought by Smith and two in state courts in New York and Georgia. He was convicted in the New York case while the Georgia case is in limbo. In a post on social media, Trump railed on Monday against the legal cases as a 'low point in the History of our Country.' The moves by Smith, who was appointed in 2022 by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, represents a remarkable shift from the special prosecutor who obtained indictments against Trump in two separate cases accusing him of crimes that threatened U.S. election integrity and national security. Prosecutors acknowledged that the election of a president who faced ongoing criminal cases created an unprecedented predicament for the Justice Department. It shows how Trump's election victory over Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris was not just a political triumph, but also a legal one. Trump pleaded not guilty in August 2023 to four federal charges accusing him of conspiring to obstruct the collection and certification of votes following his 2020 loss to Democrat Joe Biden. Trump, who as president will again oversee the Justice Department, was expected to order an end to the federal 2020 election case and to Smith's appeal in the documents case. Florida-based Judge Aileen Cannon, who Trump appointed to the federal bench, had dismissed the classified documents case in July, ruling that Smith was improperly appointed to his role as special counsel. Smith's office had been appealing that ruling and indicated on Monday that the appeal would continue as it relates to Trump personal aide Walt Nauta and Carlos De Oliveira, a manager at his Mar-a-Lago resort, who had been previously charged alongside Trump in the case. Both Nauta and De Oliveria have pleaded not guilty, as did Trump. In the 2020 election case, Trump's lawyers had previously said they would seek to dismiss the charges based on a U.S. Supreme Court ruling in July that former presidents have broad immunity from prosecution over official actions taken while in the White House. Smith attempted to salvage the case following that ruling, dropping some allegations but arguing that the rest were not covered by presidential immunity and could proceed to trial. Judge Tanya Chutkan had been due to decide whether the immunity decision required other portions of the case to be thrown out. A trial date originally set for March 2024 had not been rescheduled. The case was brought following an investigation led by Smith into Trump's attempts to retain power following his 2020 election defeat, culminating in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol by a mob of his supporters following his inflammatory speech near the White House. Trump denied wrongdoing and argued that the U.S. legal system had been turned against him to damage his presidential campaign. He vowed during the campaign that he would fire Smith if he returned to the presidency. Trump in May became the first former president to be convicted of a crime when a jury in New York found him guilty of felony charges relating to hush money paid to a porn star before the 2016 election. His sentencing in that case has been indefinitely postponed. The criminal case against Trump in Georgia state court involving the 2020 election is stalled.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-prosecutors-seek-to-drop-federal-criminal-cases-against-trump/7876646.html	2024-11-25T13:44:33-08:00

Namibia elections set for Wednesday	Namibia is preparing for its seventh presidential and National Assembly elections since gaining independence 34 years ago, with the ruling SWAPO Party facing potential shifts in support. The November 27 election marks a milestone as SWAPO fields its first female presidential candidate, Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who could become Africa's third female president. The key question is whether SWAPO can recover from its loss of a two-thirds parliamentary majority in the last election and retain its long-held power.

Israel's UN ambassador: Lebanon cease-fire talks 'moving forward’	Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, told VOA on Monday that negotiations toward a cease-fire with Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Lebanese Shia militia, are 'moving forward' but have not been 'finalized.' He added that Israel would retain the ability to strike southern Lebanon under any agreement. Ahead of a U.N. Security Council meeting, Danon said he expected Israel's Cabinet to convene on Monday or Tuesday to discuss the cease-fire deal. 'We will make sure that we will have the ability to neutralize any threat that will not be dealt [with] in southern Lebanon. I hope that the Lebanese army will take care of that in the future, but if they will fail, again, we will be there,' Danon said. Meanwhile, Lebanon's deputy speaker, Elias Bou Saab, said there are no major obstacles to implementing a U.S.-proposed cease-fire deal, which requires Israel's withdrawal from southern Lebanon and Lebanese troop deployment within 60 days. A five-nation committee, chaired by the United States and including France, will oversee the process. Earlier on Monday, Israeli forces carried out airstrikes on Beirut’s southern suburbs in attacks that followed Israeli warnings for people to leave the area. The Israeli military said in its warning that Hezbollah militants were operating in Haret Hreik, and a short time later at least two strikes sent heavy smoke rising into the sky. An Israeli military spokesperson said the strikes targeted Hezbollah military command headquarters. The attack came a day after Hezbollah militants fired about 250 rockets and other projectiles into Israel in response to an Israeli attack on Beirut that killed at least 29 people. Some of the Hezbollah strikes reached the Tel Aviv area in the heart of Israel and wounded seven people. The assault was one of the largest Hezbollah has mounted since it started firing on Israel more than a year ago in support of Hamas militants, who attacked Israel in October 2023 and have been warring with Israel in Gaza since then. The fighting has caused a humanitarian crisis, displacing hundreds of thousands. On Monday, the United Nations World Food Program announced that it has provided emergency aid to more than a half-million people in Lebanon since the conflict began. The WFP said it plans to reach 1 million people and is continuing to work tirelessly to deliver critical assistance to affected communities. But Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, dampened hopes for a halt to the fighting. 'I am not convinced it is going to happen,' Borrell told reporters Sunday evening after a day of meeting with Lebanese officials. 'I do not see the Israeli government interested clearly in reaching an agreement for a cease-fire.' Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their October 7, 2023, attack on Israel that sparked the current war in Gaza. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed at least 44,235 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the United Kingdom and other Western countries.

Horn of Africa forum opens in Djibouti amid Ethiopia-Somalia tensions	Washington — Somali scholars, politicians and traditional leaders from across the Horn of Africa gathered in Djibouti on Monday for a three-day forum on strengthening regional stability. The annual forum, the eighth of its kind, was organized by the Heritage Institute for Policy Studies in Somalia, an independent, nonprofit, nonpartisan research group in Mogadishu. Mursal Saney, executive director of the institute, said the forum is providing an opportunity for Somalis from across the region to discuss issues of concern. 'We have invited nearly 300 delegates including regional experts to provide them an opportunity to discuss and exhibit constructive ideas on how the Horn of Africa region can strengthen its stability and the importance of rule of law,' Saney said. This year’s forum comes at a time of growing tension between Somalia and Ethiopia over a port deal Addis Ababa signed in January with Somaliland, a breakaway region. Mogadishu sees Somaliland as a part of Somalia. The deal so far, in the form of a memorandum of understanding, gives landlocked Ethiopia a 50-year lease for a Red Sea port from Somaliland in exchange for possible recognition of Somaliland’s independence. The deal has angered Mogadishu, which has described it as an assault on Somalia’s sovereignty and territorial integrity. Ethiopia maintains that it does not infringe on Somalia's sovereignty. Somaliland declared its independence from the rest of Somalia in 1991, following the collapse of the military government led by late dictator Mohamed Siad Barre. Somalia has never accepted Somaliland’s secession, nor has Somaliland received international recognition. In July and August, two rounds of talks between Ethiopia and Somalia, mediated by Turkey, failed to solve the dispute, with Somalia demanding Ethiopia withdraw from the deal. The issue has raised fears of fresh conflict in the Horn of Africa region. 'Because of its strategic location in the region and the fact that it is coming out of a conflict era, Somalia is thirsty for peace and regional stability, respecting the international law and the rule of law,' Somali Foreign Minister Ahmed Moalim Fiqi said at the start of the forum. Also on Monday, Mumin Hassan Barre, Djibouti’s minister of justice and religion, said experts attending the forum should contribute to the well-being of the region. 'We see experts that know the region well, and I think the peace, stability and the solution of the region’s problems lie in the hands of its people, including the experts who gathered here,' Barre said. Somalis representing Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti and Somalia are attending the event, as well as those from across the region and the diaspora communities in the United States, Europe and elsewhere.

Israel sanctions oldest newspaper over critical coverage	Israel’s Cabinet unanimously voted Sunday to boycott the country’s oldest newspaper, Haaretz, citing its critical coverage of the Israel-Hamas conflict and comments by the outlet’s publisher calling for sanctions on top government officials. In a statement on Sunday, the office of Shlomo Karhi, the communications minister, said that his proposal against Haaretz had been unanimously approved by the other ministers. 'We will not allow a reality in which the publisher of an official newspaper in the state of Israel will call for the imposition of sanctions against it and will support the enemies of the state in the midst of a war and will be financed by it,' the statement said. The proposal will end government advertising in the left-leaning newspaper, owned by the Schocken family, and cancel all subscriptions for state employees and employees of state-owned companies. 'We advocate a free press and freedom of expression, but also the freedom of the government to decide not to fund incitement against the state of Israel,' the statement from the communications minister’s office also said. Widely respected internationally, Haaretz has been critical of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his current rightwing coalition government. The newspaper has also provided critical coverage of the Israel-Hamas war and investigated abuses allegedly committed by the Israeli military. In a statement on Sunday, Haaretz accused Netanyahu of aiming to 'dismantle Israeli democracy.' 'Like his friends Putin, Erdoğan, and Orbán, Netanyahu is trying to silence a critical, independent newspaper. Haaretz will not balk and will not morph into a government pamphlet that publishes messages approved by the government and its leader,' the statement said. To justify the government’s boycott of Haaretz, the office of Karhi, the communications minister, pointed to comments made by Haaretz publisher Amos Schocken at a news conference organized by the newspaper late last month in London. In the speech Schocken called for international sanctions on Israeli leaders. He also accused the Israeli government of 'imposing a cruel apartheid regime on the Palestinian population' and said it was 'fighting the Palestinian freedom fighters, that Israel calls terrorists.' Following pushback, Schocken clarified that he was not referring to Hamas but rather was referring to Palestinians living in the occupied West Bank. The Israeli government has faced criticism over its press freedom record throughout the Israel-Hamas war, which has been the deadliest on record for journalists, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ. As of Monday, at least 137 journalists and media workers have been killed in the war, including 129 Palestinians, two Israelis and six Lebanese, according to CPJ data. On top of that, Israeli authorities shuttered Al Jazeera’s West Bank bureau in September and Israel offices in May. Officials said the closings were needed because Al Jazeera was a threat to national security. Press freedom groups rejected those claims as false. Last week, Israeli lawmakers voted to extend the law’s duration to six months, and increase the law’s main provision — a broadcasting ban on any foreign media outlet deemed detrimental to national security by the security services — from 45 days to 60. 'Netanyahu’s government is openly targeting media independence and pluralism in Israel,' Anne Bocande, editorial director at Reporters Without Borders, said in a statement last week. 'The free press in a country that describes itself as ‘the only democracy in the Middle East’ will be undermined,' Bocande added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-sanctions-oldest-newspaper-over-critical-coverage-/7876062.html	2024-11-25T07:48:41-08:00	
UN chief, pope call for nations to end the use of antipersonnel land mines	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — The U.N. head, Pope Francis and others called Monday for nations to end the production and use of land mines, even as their deployment globally grows. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a message to delegates at the fifth review of the International Mine Ban Treaty, also known as the Ottawa Convention, that 25 years after it went into force some parties had renewed the use of antipersonnel mines and some are falling behind in their commitments to destroy the weapons. 'I call on states parties to meet their obligations and ensure compliance to the convention, while addressing humanitarian and developmental impacts through financial and technical support,' Guterres said at the opening of the conference in Cambodia. 'I also encourage all states that have not yet acceded to the convention to join the 164 that have done so. A world without anti-personnel mines is not just possible. It is within reach.' In a statement read on behalf of Pope Francis, his deputy Cardinal Pietro Parolin said that antipersonnel land mines and victim-activated explosive devices continue to be used. Even after many years of hostilities, 'these treacherous devices continue to cause terrible suffering to civilians, especially children.' 'Pope Francis urges all states that have not yet done so to accede to the convention, and in the meantime to cease immediately the production and use of land mines,' he said. The treaty was signed in 1997 and went into force in 1999, but nearly three dozen countries have not acceded to it, including some key current and past producers and users of land mines such as the United States, China, India, Pakistan, South Korea and Russia. In a report released last week by Landmine Monitor, the international watchdog said land mines were still actively being used in 2023 and 2024 by Russia, Myanmar, Iran and North Korea. It added that non-state armed groups in at least five places — Colombia, India, Myanmar, Pakistan and the Gaza Strip — had used mines as well, and there were claims of their use in more than a half dozen countries in or bordering the Sahel region of Africa. At least 5,757 people were killed and wounded by land mines and unexploded ordnance last year, primarily civilians of whom a third were children, Landmine Monitor reported. Landmine Monitor said Russia had been using antipersonnel mines 'extensively' in Ukraine, and just a week ago, the U.S., which has been providing Ukraine with anti-tank mines throughout the war, announced it would start providing Kyiv with antipersonnel mines as well to try and stall Russian progress on the battlefield. 'Antipersonnel mines represent a clear and present danger for civilians,' Guterres said in his statement. 'Even after fighting stops, these horrifying and indiscriminate weapons can remain, trapping generations of people in fear.' He praised Cambodia for its massive demining efforts and for sharing its experience with others and contributing to U.N. peacekeeping missions. Cambodia was one of the world's most mine-affected countries after three decades of war and disorder that ended in 1998, with some 4 million to 6 million mines or unexploded munitions littering the country. Its efforts to rid the country of mines has been enormous, and Landmine Monitor said Cambodia and Croatia accounted for 75% of all land cleared of mines in 2023, with more than 200 square kilometers (80 square miles). Prime Minister Hun Manet joined the calls for more nations to join the Mine Ban Treaty, and thanked the international community for supporting Cambodia's mine clearance efforts. He said they have reduced land mine casualties from more than 4,300 in 1996 to fewer than 100 annually over the last decade.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-chief-pope-call-for-nations-to-end-the-use-of-antipersonnel-land-mines/7875788.html	2024-11-25T02:40:57-08:00	
Philippine showdown: President says he'll fight vice president's plot to have him killed	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. on Monday described a public threat by the vice president to have him killed by an assassin as a criminal plot and vowed to fight it, in a looming showdown between the country's two top leaders. Vice President Sara Duterte said Saturday in an online news conference that she has contracted an assassin to kill the president, his wife and the speaker of the House of Representatives if she herself is killed, in a threat she warned was not a joke. The national police and military immediately boosted the security of the president, and the justice department said it would summon the vice president for an investigation. The National Security Council said it considered the threat a national security concern. The vice president, a lawyer, later tried to walk back her remarks by saying it was not an actual threat but an expression of concern about her own safety over an unspecified threat. 'Why would I kill him if not for revenge from the grave? There is no reason for me to kill him. What's the benefit for me?' Duterte told journalists. 'That criminal plot should not be allowed to pass,' Marcos said in a televised statement, without mentioning Duterte by name. 'I'll fight it.' 'As a democratic country, we need to uphold the rule of law,' Marcos said. Marcos ran with Duterte as his vice-presidential running mate in May 2022 elections and both won landslide victories on a campaign call of national unity. In the Philippines, the two positions are elected separately. The two leaders and their camps, however, soon had a bitter falling out over key differences, including in their approaches to China's aggressive territorial claims in the disputed South China Sea. Duterte resigned from the Marcos Cabinet in June as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body. On Monday, Justice Undersecretary Jesse Andres said in a news conference that Duterte would be subpoenaed to face an investigation. Andres called the vice president the 'self-confessed mastermind' of a 'premeditated plot to assassinate the president.' All government resources and law enforcement agencies would be mobilized to identify the alleged assassin and determine criminal accountability, he said. 'We have to maintain order in a civilized society by adherence to the rule of law and we will apply the full strength and force of the law on this,' Andres said. Under Philippine law, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or their family and are punishable by a jail term and fine. The Philippine Constitution says that if a president dies, sustains a permanent disability, is removed from office or resigns, the vice president takes over and serves the rest of the term. The vice president is the daughter of Marcos' predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose police-enforced anti-drug crackdown when he was a city mayor and later president left thousands of mostly petty drug suspects dead in killings that the International Criminal Court has been investigating as a possible crime against humanity. Like her equally outspoken father, the vice president became a vocal critic of Marcos, his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president's cousin, accusing them of corruption, incompetence and politically persecuting the Duterte family and its supporters. Last month, the vice president told reporters her relationship with Marcos had 'gone so toxic' that she has imagined 'cutting his head.' Her latest tirade was set off by the decision by House members allied with Romualdez and Marcos to detain Duterte's chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, who was accused of hampering a congressional inquiry into the possible misuse of Duterte's budget as vice president and education secretary. Lopez has been detained in a hospital after being traumatized by a plan by legislators to temporarily detain her in prison.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-showdown-president-says-he-ll-fight-vice-president-s-plot-to-have-him-killed/7875783.html	2024-11-25T02:32:09-08:00	
At least 22 Somalis dead after boats capsize off Madagascar, official says	MOGADISHU/ANTANANARIVO — At least 22 Somali citizens died when two migrant boats capsized off the coast of Madagascar over the weekend, Somalia's Information Minister Daud Aweis said. Madagascar's Port, Maritime, and River Authority (APMF) said the boats had set sail from Somalia for the French Indian Ocean territory of Mayotte on Nov. 2, a journey of several hundred kilometers. On Saturday, the port authority reported that local fishermen discovered the first boat drifting on Friday near Nosy Iranja. They rescued 25 people, including 10 men and 15 women, but seven occupants died, the authority said. A second boat carrying 38 people arrived at Madagascar's Port du Cratère, according to APMF. The maritime authority did not disclose a death toll for the second boat but confirmed the rescue of 23 people. Somali Information Minister Aweis, citing information from his counterparts in Madagascar, confirmed the total death toll at 22. 'They were about 70 Somalis, 22 of them died. One boat was carrying 38 people and the other boat was carrying 32 people,' Aweis said on state-owned television late on Sunday. In recent decades thousands of people have attempted to make the crossing to Mayotte, which has a higher standard of living and access to the French welfare system. Mayotte is officially part of France, although Comoros claims it. Aweis said Somalia will investigate where the boats sailed from, terming those who organized the trip as criminals involved in illicit immigration. 'This is also a message of warning to those who want to immigrate illegally before they go and die in such manner. It is unfortunate people still go despite danger,' he added. In early November, at least 25 people died off Comoros islands after traffickers capsized their boat.	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-least-22-somalis-dead-after-boats-capsize-off-madagascar-official-says/7875772.html	2024-11-25T02:10:00-08:00	
Russian aerial attack injures at least 15 in Kharkiv	Ukrainian officials said Monday a Russian attack on the northeastern city of Kharkiv injured at least 15 people. Oleh Syniehubov, governor of the Kharkiv region, said on Telegram that Russia hit central Kharkiv and that the attack also damaged several buildings.

Ivan Fedeorov, governor of the Zaporizhzhia region, reported on Telegram that a Russian attack injured a child and damaged several houses. Russia’s Defense Ministry said Monday it shot down 23 Ukrainian drones in overnight attacks. Russian air defenses downed eight of the drones over the Kaluga region, the ministry said, along with seven over Kursk, five over Bryansk and three over Belgorod. Officials in Kaluga said falling drone wreckage damaged an industrial facility.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-aerial-attack-injures-at-least-15-in-kharkiv/7875748.html	2024-11-25T00:29:00-08:00	
Foreign ministers meet in Italy for the last G7 of the Biden administration	ROME — Foreign ministers from the world’s leading industrialized nations are meeting Monday, with the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East entering decisive phases and a certain pressure to advance diplomatic efforts ahead of the new U.S. administration taking over. Hopes for brokering a cease-fire in Gaza and Lebanon are foremost on the agenda of the Group of Seven meeting outside Rome that is gathering ministers from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. On the first day of the two-day gathering Monday, the G7 will be joined by ministers from Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, as well as the Secretary General of the Arab League. 'With partners will be discussed ways to support efforts to reach a ceasefire in Gaza and Lebanon, initiatives to support the population and the promotion of a credible political horizon for stability in the region,' the Italian foreign ministry said. The so-called 'Quint' grouping of the U.S., Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Egypt and the UAE has been working to finalize a 'day after' plan for Gaza, and there is some urgency to make progress before the Trump administration takes over in January. President-elect Donald Trump is expected to pursue a policy that strongly favors Israel over the aspirations of the Palestinians. Host Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani added another item to the G7 agenda last week after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his former defense minister and Hamas’ military chief. Italy is a founding member of the court and hosted the 1998 Rome conference that gave birth to it. But Italy’s right-wing government has been a strong supporter of Israel after the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, while also providing humanitarian aid for Palestinians in Gaza. The Italian government has taken a cautious line, reaffirming its support and respect for the court but expressing concern that the warrants were politically motivated. 'There can be no equivalence between the responsibilities of the state of Israel and the terrorist organization of Hamas,' Premier Giorgia Meloni said, echoing the statement from U.S. President Joe Biden. Nathalie Tocci, director of the Rome-based Institute for International Affairs think tank, said Italy would be seeking to forge a united front on the ICC warrants, at least among the six G7 countries that are signatories of the court: everyone but the U.S. But in an essay this weekend in La Stampa newspaper, Tocci warned it was a risky move, since the U.S. tends to dictate the G7 line and has blasted the ICC warrants against Netanyahu as 'outrageous.' 'If Italy and the other (five G7) signatories of the ICC are unable to maintain the line on international law, they will not only erode it anyway, but will be acting against our interests,' Tocci wrote, recalling Italy’s recourse to international law in demanding protection for Italian U.N. peacekeepers who have come under fire in southern Lebanon. The other major talking point of the G7 meeting is Ukraine, and tensions have only heightened since Russia attacked Ukraine last week with an experimental, hypersonic ballistic missile that escalated the nearly 33-month-old war. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha is expected at the G7 in Fiuggi on Tuesday, and NATO and Ukraine are to hold emergency talks the same day in Brussels. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the strike was retaliation for Kyiv’s use of U.S. and British longer-range missiles capable of striking deeper into Russian territory. The G7 has been at the forefront of providing military and economic support for Ukraine since Russia’s invasion in February 2022 and G7 members are particularly concerned about how a Trump administration will change the U.S. approach. Trump has criticized the billions of dollars that the Biden administration has poured into Ukraine and has said he could end the war in 24 hours, comments that appear to suggest he would press Ukraine to surrender territory that Russia now occupies. Italy is a strong supporter of Ukraine and has backed the U.S. decision to allow Ukraine to strike Russia with U.S.-made, longer-range missiles. But Italy has invoked the country’s constitutional repudiation of war in declining to provide Ukraine with offensive weaponry to strike inside Russia and limiting its aid to anti-air defense systems to protect Ukrainian civilians. The G7 foreign ministers’ meeting, the second of the Italian presidency after ministers gathered in Capri in April, is being held in the medieval town of Fiuggi southeast of Rome, best known for its thermal spas. On Monday, which coincides with the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, ministers will attend the inauguration of a red bench meant to symbolize Italy’s focus on fighting gender-based violence. Over the weekend, tens of thousands of people marched in Rome to protest gender-based violence, which in Italy so far this year has claimed the lives of 99 women, according to a report last week by the Eures think tank.	https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-ministers-meet-in-italy-for-the-last-g7-of-the-biden-administration-/7875744.html	2024-11-25T00:14:05-08:00	
South Korean opposition leader cleared of forcing witness to commit perjury	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — South Korea's main opposition leader Lee Jae-myung was cleared on Monday of charges that he forced a witness to commit perjury, the Seoul Central District Court said, in the latest of a series of legal cases that could threaten his political future. Lee thanked the court after the ruling, for 'bringing back truth and justice,' as his supporters cheered. He had been accused of ordering a witness in a 2019 trial related to an election law violation to give false testimony. Lee, the leader of the Democratic Party, still faces several other trials, including for bribery and other charges mostly tied to a $1 billion property development scandal. On November 15, a court convicted Lee of violating the election law, handing him a one-year prison term suspended for two years, a penalty that, if upheld, could jeopardize his bid to run for president in 2027. Lee said that he would appeal. Last week, Lee was also indicted on charges that he used more than $71,900 of public funds for personal purposes when he was a governor. Lee, who narrowly lost to President Yoon Suk Yeol in the 2022 election and is widely expected to seek to run again, has said there was no basis for the indictment and described other charges against him as 'political retaliation.' Any final prison sentence or a fine of $714.13 or more in an election law violation case would strip him of his seat in parliament and his right to run in any elections for the next five years.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korean-opposition-leader-cleared-of-forcing-witness-to-commit-perjury/7875736.html	2024-11-24T23:45:56-08:00	
Landslide and flash floods hit Indonesia's Sumatra island, leaving 16 dead and 6 missing	KARO, Indonesia — Rescuers in Indonesia recovered 16 bodies under tons of mud and rocks or that were swept away in flash floods that hit mountainside villages on Sumatra Island, officials said Monday. Six people are still missing, officials said. Mud, rocks and trees tumbled down a mountain after torrential rains over the weekend and rivers burst their banks, tearing through four hilly districts in North Sumatra province, washing away houses and destroying farms. Police, soldiers and rescue workers used excavators, farm equipment and their bare hands to sift through the rubble looking for the dead and missing in Semangat Gunung, a resort area in Karo district, said Juspri M. Nadeak, who heads the local disaster management agency. Rescuers recovered six bodies after a landslide hit two houses and a cottage late Sunday, he said. Nine injured people managed to escape, he said. Rescuers on Monday were still searching for four missing people, including two children. Rescuers on Sunday pulled two bodies from a river after flash floods swept away at least 10 houses and damaged about 150 houses and buildings in villages in South Tapanuli district, said Puput Mashuri, who heads the local disaster management agency. Dozens of people were injured by the flash floods, which also destroyed more than 130 hectares (321 acres) of agricultural land and plantations. Flash floods on Sunday left four people dead in Deli Serdang district and rescue workers on Monday were searching for two people who were swept away by flash floods and are still missing. A landslide hit several houses in Harang Julu, a mountainside village in Padang Lawas district, said Mustari, the chief of the local search and rescue agency, who like many Indonesians goes by a single name. Rescuers late Saturday pulled out the bodies of a four-member family, including two children, and rescued at least three injured people from the devastated village, he said. Television reports showed relatives wailing as they watched rescuers pull mud-caked bodies from a room at a buried house in Harang Julu village. Seasonal rain from about October to March frequently causes flooding and landslides in Indonesia, an archipelago of 17,000 islands where millions of people live in mountainous areas or near fertile flood plains. Last December, 12 people were swept away to Lake Toba or buried under tons of mud after heavy rains triggered a flash flood and landslide in mountainside villages in North Sumatra province. One of them was found dead and 11 others remain unaccounted for. The 1,145-square-kilometer (440-square-mile) Lake Toba, formed out of an ancient super volcano, is a popular sightseeing destination on the island of Sumatra and an area the government aims to develop as a magnet for international tourists.	https://www.voanews.com/a/landslide-and-flash-floods-hit-indonesia-s-sumatra-island-leaving-16-dead-and-6-missing/7875731.html	2024-11-24T23:37:20-08:00	
Taiwan says Chinese balloon detected near island	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan said Monday it had detected a Chinese balloon over waters northwest of the island, the first reported since April, as Beijing maintains pressure on Taipei to accept its claims of sovereignty. Communist China claims democratic Taiwan as part of its territory and has refused to renounce the use of force to bring it under its control. Beijing regularly deploys fighter jets, drones and warships around Taiwan, and occasionally balloons, as it keeps up military pressure. The latest balloon was spotted at 6:21 p.m. on Sunday about 111 kilometers northwest of Keelung City at an altitude of 10,058 meters, said the defense ministry, which releases daily data on China's military presence around Taiwan. It entered the island's air defense identification zone and disappeared at 8:15 pm, the ministry said. As well as the balloon, 12 Chinese military aircraft and seven warships were detected around Taiwan in the 24 hours to 6 a.m. Monday, the ministry said. In the run-up to Taiwan's January presidential election, balloons crossed the sensitive waters separating Taiwan and China day and night, with some floating above the island. Taiwan has described the balloons as a form of 'gray zone' harassment -- a tactic that falls short of an act of war. China has previously brushed off allegations it sends balloons over Taiwan, accusing Taipei of trying to raise tensions with the mainland. Balloons from China became a politically fraught topic in early 2023 when the United States shot down what it called a spy balloon. The huge balloon, which carried a large payload of electronics, flew over sensitive US military installations and prompted concerns Beijing was scooping up vital intelligence. Beijing has said it was a civilian airship blown off-course.	https://www.voanews.com/a/taiwan-says-chinese-balloon-detected-near-island/7875729.html	2024-11-24T23:29:34-08:00	
Namibia may elect its first female president this week	OSHAKATI, Namibia — Namibia's Vice President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah could become the country's first female president if she wins the presidential election Wednesday. At least 1.4 million people, or about half of the population, have registered to vote in the elections, with 15 political parties running for president and seats in the National Assembly. Results from special early polls held for Namibia 's foreign missions, seamen and security services announced by the Electoral Commission of Namibia this month indicate Nandi-Ndaitwah and her party, the South West Africa People's Organization, or SWAPO, are in the lead. SWAPO has governed the southwest African country since its independence from South Africa's apartheid minority government in 1990. But in 2019, the party lost its two-thirds majority in the National Assembly for the first time since 1994. Its dismal electoral performance has been widely attributed to allegations of corruption and money laundering in the Namibian fishing industry. Two cabinet ministers were arrested, and businessmen connected to the ministers were also convicted and imprisoned. Political analyst Henning Melber, a professor at the University of Pretoria and the University of the Free State, believes SWAPO and Nandi-Ndaitwah must take the 2019 election results as a warning even though they appear favored to win the elections. Melber said the party needs to attract support from younger voters who do not feel a link to the party's history of liberation struggles — a challenge also shared by Africa's other former liberation movements, such as South Africa's African National Congress. 'It looks like there is no way back to regain such dominance. The process of erosion of legitimacy as a former liberation movement has advanced too much,' he said. He added that the 'born-frees' — a term for children born after their country's liberation — will not vote based on emotions like the older generations did, but will do so based on delivery and governance. Nandi-Ndaitwah, 72, has promised to create more jobs and tackle the 20% unemployment rate for young people and graduates. She has pledged to spend approximately $4.7 billion over the next five years to create more than 500,000 jobs, a goal that her critics call unrealistic. Issues affecting women, including reproductive rights, equal pay and healthcare, are also likely to rank high for voters. If she becomes president, Nandi-Ndaitwah would follow in the footsteps of Liberia's Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, who made history when she became the continent's first elected female president in 2005, as well as Malawi's Joyce Banda and Samba Pranza of the Central African Republic. Erika Thomas, a political science lecturer at the University of Namibia, said should Nandi-Ndaitwah be elected as president of Namibia, she must strive to be independent, transparent and accountable. 'She must also try to push for policies and legislation frameworks for women participation and to bring more women into the political structures,' Thomas said. SWAPO will face competition from the Independent Patriots for Change, led by former dentist Panduleni Itula, and university professor Job Amupanda's Affirmative Repositioning party. Political parties contesting the elections wrapped up their campaigns with final rallies this weekend. Elections in southern Africa this year have delivered ground-breaking changes to the region's political landscape, with the ANC in South Africa losing its 30-year parliamentary majority and Botswana's Democratic Party getting unseated after 58 years in power. In Mauritius, considered one of the most stable democracies in Africa, the opposition won recent elections by a landslide. Disputed election results in Mozambique, which saw the ruling Frelimo party declared the winner, have led to ongoing protests that have seen at least 30 people killed.	https://www.voanews.com/a/namibia-may-elect-its-first-female-president-this-week/7875727.html	2024-11-24T23:22:56-08:00	
South Korea holds memorial for forced laborers at Sado mines, a day after boycotting Japanese event	SADO, Japan — South Korea paid tribute to wartime Korean forced laborers at Japan's Sado Island Gold Mines in a memorial ceremony on Monday, a day after boycotting a similar event organized by Japan, as tensions over historical atrocities continue to impact relations between the two sides. Monday's ceremony at a former dormitory near the 16th century Sado mines, which were listed this summer as a UNESCO World Heritage site, was organized by South Korea's Foreign Ministry and attended by nine families of Korean wartime laborers, the country's ambassador to Japan and other officials. Japan on Sunday held a memorial service for all workers at the Sado mines, including Koreans. It thanked them for their contributions at the mines but did not acknowledge their forced labor or issue an apology. At the Korean-sponsored memorial on Monday, participants in dark suits observed a moment of silence and offered white chrysanthemums in honor of the South Korean laborers, along with offerings such as dried fish, sliced apple and pears. In a short speech, South Korea's Ambassador to Japan Park Choel-hee offered his condolences to the forced laborers and their families, expressing hopes that the memorial would bring comfort to families. He said South Korea and Japan should both make efforts to ensure that the painful wartime history is remembered. 'We will never forget the tears and sacrifices of the Korean workers behind the history of the Sado mines,' Park said. 'I sincerely hope that today will be a day of remembrance for all the Korean workers who suffered indescribable pain under harsh conditions, and that this memorial service will bring comfort to the souls of the deceased Korean workers and their bereaved families,' Park added. At the mines, about 1,500 Koreans were forced to labor under abusive and brutal conditions during World War II, historians say. Sunday's ceremony, which was supposed to further mend wounds, renewed tensions between the two sides. South Korea announced Saturday its decision to not attend the Japanese-organized ceremony, citing unspecified disagreements with Tokyo over the event. There was speculation that the South Korean boycott was related to parliamentary vice minister Akiko Ikuina's attendance at Sunday's ceremony. Ikuina reportedly visited Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni Shrine in August 2022, weeks after she was elected as a lawmaker. Japan's neighbors view Yasukuni, which commemorates 2.5 million war dead, including war criminals, as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. The Sado mines were registered as a UNESCO cultural heritage site in July after Japan agreed to include an exhibit on the conditions of Korean forced laborers and to hold a memorial service annually, after repeated protests from the South Korean government. Signs, including one at the site where South Koreans held their ceremony, have been erected indicating former sites of Korean laborers' dormitories. A city-operated museum in the area also added a section about Korean laborers, but a private museum attached to the main UNESCO site doesn't mention them at all. The site of South Korea's memorial was the former Fourth Souai Dormitory, one of four dorms for Korean laborers without families. A newly erected sign there reads, 'Workers from the Korean Peninsula lived here during the wartime.' On Saturday, the families visited a former housing site where Korean laborers lived. They also briefly saw the city-run museum and an exhibit on the Korean laborers as they listened to explanations through a translator.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-korea-holds-memorial-for-forced-laborers-at-sado-mines-a-day-after-boycotting-japanese-event/7875726.html	2024-11-24T23:15:36-08:00	
Uruguay's conservative candidate concedes presidential runoff to left-wing challenger	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — The presidential candidate of the conservative coalition that has governed Uruguay for the past five years conceded defeat on Sunday after a tight runoff election, as the South American nation joined others around the world in rebuking the incumbent party in a year of landmark elections. Even as the vote count continued, Álvaro Delgado, the center-right government's candidate, told supporters at his campaign headquarters in the capital of Montevideo that 'with sadness, but without guilt, we can congratulate the winner,' referring to left-wing challenger Yamandú Orsi. Fireworks erupted over the stage where Orsi, 57, a working-class former history teacher and two-time mayor from Uruguay's center-left coalition known as the Broad Front, claimed victory as crowds flocked to greet him. 'The country of liberty, equality and fraternity has triumphed once again,' he said, vowing to unite the nation of 3.4 million people after such a tight vote. 'Let's understand that there is another part of our country who have different feelings today,' he said. 'These people will also have to help build a better country. We need them too.' With more than 91% of the votes counted, Orsi had 49.56% support compared to Delgado's 46.17% in an election in which nearly 90% of voters turned out, according to preliminary data released by the Electoral Court. The rest were blank votes or non-voters. While failing to entice apathetic young voters and generating extraordinary indecision, Uruguay's lackluster electoral campaigns steered clear of the anti-establishment fury that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere in the world, like in the United States and neighboring Argentina. Delgado's concession ushers in Orsi as Uruguay's new leader and spells an end to a short stint by the center-right party in Uruguay. The 2019 election of President Luis Lacalle Pou interrupted 15 consecutive years of rule by the Broad Front. 'I called Yamandú Orsi to congratulate him as President-elect of our country,' Lacalle Pou wrote on social media platform X, adding that he would 'put myself at his service and begin the transition as soon as I deem it appropriate.' Orsi's victory was the latest sign that simmering discontent over post-pandemic economic malaise favors anti-incumbent candidates. In the many elections that took place during 2024, voters frustrated with the status quo have punished ruling parties from the U.S. and Britain to South Korea and Japan. But unlike elsewhere in the world, Orsi is a moderate who plans no radical changes and agrees with his opponent on key issues like combating childhood poverty and cracking down on organized crime. Despite his promise to lead a 'new left' in Uruguay, his platform resembles the mix of market-friendly policies and welfare programs that characterized the Broad Front's tenure from 2005-2020. The coalition of leftist and center-left parties presided over a period of economic growth and pioneering social reforms that won widespread international acclaim. Behind Uruguay's legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and sale of marijuana was former President José 'Pepe' Mujica, an ex-Marxist guerilla who became a global icon and mentor to Orsi. Mujica, now 89 and recovering from esophageal cancer, turned up at his local polling station before balloting even began, praising Orsi's humility and Uruguay's famous stability. 'This is no small feat,' he said of Uruguay's 'citizenry that respects formal institutions.' Orsi proposes tax incentives to lure investment and social security reforms that would lower the retirement age but fall short of a radical overhaul sought by Uruguay's unions that failed to pass in October, with Uruguayans rejecting generous pensions in favor of fiscal constraint. 'He's my candidate, not only for my sake but also for my children's,' Yeny Varone, a nurse at a polling station, said of Orsi. 'In the future they'll have better working conditions, health and salaries.' Delgado, 55, a rural veterinarian with a long career in the National Party, served most recently as Secretary of the Presidency for Lacalle Pou and campaigned under the slogan 're-elect a good government.' With inflation easing and the economy expected to expand by some 3.2% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund, Delgado has promised to continue pursuing his predecessor's pro-business policies. Lacalle Pou, who constitutionally cannot run for a second consecutive term, has enjoyed high approval ratings. But the official results trickling in Sunday showed that mounting complaints in Uruguay about years of sluggish economic growth, stagnant wages and the government's struggle to stem an upsurge in violent crime helped to swing the election against Delgado's party. In the weeks after the Oct. 27 general election — in which neither front-runner secured an outright majority — most polls had showed a virtual tie between Delgado and Orsi. Turnout on Sunday stood at 89.4% in the nation where voting is compulsory, with over 2.7 million citizens registered. In his victory speech, Orsi struck a conciliatory tone. 'I will be the president who calls for national dialogue again and again, who builds a more integrated society and country,' he said, adding that he would get to work 'starting tomorrow.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uruguay-s-conservative-candidate-concedes-presidential-runoff-to-left-wing-challenger/7875675.html	2024-11-24T18:28:00-08:00	
Countries remain divided as fifth UN plastics treaty talks begin	As delegates from 175 countries gathered in Busan, South Korea, on Monday for the fifth round of talks aimed at securing an international treaty to curb plastic pollution, lingering divisions cast doubts on whether a final agreement is in sight. South Korea is hosting the fifth and ostensibly final U.N. Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee (INC-5) meeting this week, after the previous round of talks in Ottawa in April ended without a path forward on capping plastic production. Instead, the meeting issued a direction for technical groups to focus on chemicals of concern and other measures after petrochemical-producing countries such as Saudi Arabia and China strongly opposed efforts to target plastic production. The United States raised eyebrows in August when it said it would back plastic production caps in the treaty, putting it in alignment with the EU, Kenya, Peru and other countries in the High Ambition Coalition. The election of Donald Trump as president, however, has raised questions about that position, as during his first presidency he shunned multilateral agreements and any commitments to slow or stop U.S. oil and petrochemical production. The U.S. delegation did not answer questions on whether it would reverse its new position to support plastic production caps. But it 'supports ensuring that the global instrument addresses plastic products, chemicals used in plastic products, and the supply of primary plastic polymers,' according to a spokesperson for the White House Council on Environmental Quality. Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Program, said she was confident the talks will end with an agreement, pointing to the communique from the Group of 20 nations at a summit last week calling for a legally binding treaty by the end of this year. 'This is a very powerful message,' Andersen told Reuters in Baku, on the sidelines of the UN climate negotiations, before traveling to Busan for the talks. 'We know that it is often down to the wire, but if there is a will, I think we will get there.' For a Pacific island country like Fiji, a global plastics treaty is crucial to protect its fragile ecosystem and public health, said Sivendra Michael, Fiji's climate minister and chief climate and plastics negotiator. He told Reuters on the sidelines of the 29th U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP29) this month that despite not producing any plastic, Fiji is bearing the brunt of its downstream pollution. 'Where do these plastics end up? It ends up in our oceans, in our landfill, in our backyards. And the impact of the plastics breaking down into little substances has detrimental effects, not only on the environment, but on us as individuals, on our health,' he said, noting studies that showed most of the fish consumed in the country was polluted with microplastics. While supporting an international treaty, the petrochemical industry has been vocal in urging governments to avoid setting mandatory plastic production caps, and focus on solutions on reducing plastic waste, like recycling. 'We would see a treaty successful if it would really put ... emphasis on ending plastic pollution. Nothing else should be the focus.' said Martin Jung, president for performance materials at chemical producer BASF. Previous talks have also discussed searching for forms of funding to help developing countries implement the treaty. At COP29, France, Kenya and Barbados floated setting up a series of global levies on certain sectors that could help ramp up the amount of money that could be made available to developing countries seeking support to aid their clean energy transition and cope with the increasingly severe impacts of climate change. The proposal included a fee of $60-$70/ton on primary polymer production, which is on average around 5-7% of the polymer price, seen potentially raising an estimated $25 billion-$35 billion per year. Industry groups have rejected the idea, saying it will raise consumer prices.	https://www.voanews.com/a/countries-remain-divided-as-fifth-un-plastics-treaty-talks-begin/7875670.html	2024-11-24T17:51:09-08:00	
Venezuelan government opponents decry police outside embassy	CARACAS — Six Venezuelan government opponents who have sheltered for months at the Argentine embassy in Caracas decried Sunday that local police and intelligence agents were stationed outside of it for hours. The move prompted the U.S. government to call it a serious violation of international law and Argentina's Foreign Ministry to describe it as an act of harassment. Most of the opponents belong to the Vente Venezuela party led by former legislator María Corina Machado. It denounced what it called 'a new siege by hooded officials' that began Saturday night and extended into Sunday. The incident occurred hours after Machado called for a massive mobilization on Dec. 1, prompting Venezuela's minister of the interior to accuse the political leader of being part of a new conspiracy attempt against the government of President Nicolas Maduro. Vente Venezuela said in a statement that the diplomatic headquarters remains without electricity and is surrounded by 'regime vehicles' that are preventing traffic from circulating in the area. It said communication signals also were scrambled. Argentina's Foreign Ministry said in a statement late Saturday that the deployment of armed troops and the closing of streets in the vicinity 'constitute a disturbance of security.' It also called on the international community to condemn the incident, which the U.S. did. On Sunday, the U.S. Embassy in Venezuela posted on X that the U.S. 'strongly condemns the acts of harassment against asylum-seekers.' 'The deployment of armed forces and blockades seriously violate international law,' it said. 'We demand that the Venezuelan regime respect its international obligations, cease these intimidating actions and guarantee safe passage for asylum-seekers.' Diplomatic relations between the two countries have been broken since 2019. The opposition members entered the embassy in March after the Venezuelan Attorney General's Office issued arrest warrants and accused them of promoting alleged acts of violence to destabilize the government. In August, Brazil accepted Argentina's request to guard its embassy after the Venezuelan government ordered the expulsion of Argentine diplomatic personnel following statements by its president, Javier Milei, that he would not recognize 'another fraud' in Venezuela after the controversial elections in July. A month later, Venezuela revoked Brazil's authorization to guard the embassy, alleging it had evidence of the use of the facilities 'for the planning of terrorist activities and assassination attempts.' Brazil and Argentina have rejected those accusations.	https://www.voanews.com/a/venezuelan-government-opponents-decry-police-outside-embassy/7875664.html	2024-11-24T17:41:51-08:00	
Pro-Russian candidate creates a surprise in Romanian presidential election	BUCHAREST — A Romanian hard-right NATO critic and leftist Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu appeared in dead heat after the first round of presidential elections on Sunday, partial tallies showed, in a shock result threatening Romania's staunchly pro-Ukraine stance. After nearly 93% of votes were counted, Calin Georgescu, 62, was at 22%, while Ciolacu had 21%, suggesting they will likely qualify to face each other in the second round, due on Dec. 8. A center-right contender, Elena Lasconi, was running second, behind Georgescu, among the hundreds of thousands of voters living outside Romania, with about 50% ballots cast there counted. But that margin might not be enough to win her a spot in the final race after all votes are tallied, observers said. Romania's president has a semi-executive role that gives him or her control over defense spending -- likely to be a difficult issue as Bucharest comes under pressure to uphold NATO spending goals during Donald Trump's second term as U.S. president while trying to reduce a heavy fiscal deficit. Some opinion polls had Georgescu running at around 5% of the vote in the run-up to the election, after barely registering in earlier polls. Political commentator Radu Magdin said the difference between his single-digit popularity and Sunday's result was without precedent since Romania shed communism in 1989. 'Never in our 34 years of democracy have we seen such a surge compared to surveys,' Magdin said. Campaigning focused largely on the soaring cost of living, with Romania having the EU's biggest share of people at risk of poverty. Ciolacu had courted voters with a promise of generous spending and no tax hikes, despite Romania running the European Union's largest budget deficit at 8% of economic outlook, while offering a sense of security in policy stability at a time of a war next door. Formerly a prominent member of the hard-right Alliance for Uniting Romanians party, Georgescu has called NATO's ballistic missile defense shield in the Romanian town of Deveselu a 'shame of diplomacy.' He has said the North Atlantic alliance will not protect any of its members should they be attacked by Russia. 'We are strong and brave, many of us voted, even more will do so in the second round,' Georgescu said standing alone on Sunday evening outside a residential building near capital Bucharest. Lasconi, a former journalist, joined the Save Romania Union (USR) in 2018 and became party head this year. She believes in raising defense spending and helping Ukraine, and surveys suggest she would beat Ciolacu in a runoff. Romania shares a 650-kilometer (400-mile) border with Ukraine and since Russia attacked Kyiv in 2022, it has enabled the export of millions of tons of grain through its Black Sea port of Constanta and provided military aid, including the donation of a Patriot air defense battery. Villages on the border with Ukraine have seen a barrage of drones breaching national airspace although no casualties have been reported. One political commentator said Russian meddling to give Georgescu an edge could not be ruled out in the election. 'Based on Georgescu's stance towards Ukraine and the discrepancy between opinion surveys and the actual result, we cannot rule (that) out,' said Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University. Outgoing two-term president Klaus Iohannis, 65, had cemented Romania's strong pro-Western stance but was accused of not doing enough to fight corruption. 'It will be a tight run-off, with the Social Democrat leader more vulnerable to negative campaigning due to him being an incumbent PM,' Magdin said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pro-russian-candidate-creates-a-surprise-in-romanian-presidential-election/7875655.html	2024-11-24T17:02:36-08:00	
Heavy rains in Bolivia cause landslide in La Paz, destroying homes; 1 missing	LA PAZ, Bolivia — A landslide caused by heavy rains after a prolonged drought in La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, flooded dozens of homes early Sunday, local authorities said. It swept away a young girl, spurred evacuations and left parts of the city without electricity. Torrential rain on Saturday caused a river to spill its banks, dislodging mud from a southwestern La Paz neighborhood where low-slung, shoddily built dwellings dot the hillside. The torrent of rocks and soil surged down a narrow ravine early Sunday, wrecking some two dozen homes and flooding another 40, said Juan Carlos Calvimontes, Bolivia's deputy civil defense minister. 'I lost my workshop and the cars that I had there are buried,' said auto mechanic Luis Mencias, his voice shaking as he surveyed the sea of debris. Hours after the rain subsided, rescuers were still searching for a missing 5-year-old girl in the inundated neighborhood of Bajo Llojeta. Emergency workers trudged through the boot-sucking mud on Sunday, pulling at least six residents — suffering from hypothermia, their hair matted with sludge — from the collapsed hillside. Soldiers helped clear mud from the streets. 'My daughter was with her cousins when the mud came,' said Grover Mendoza, the missing girl's father. 'The neighbors rescued my nephews, but my daughter was missing.' The mayor of La Paz, Iván Arias, directly blamed the poor construction of houses perched on the hillside without permits. 'There are irresponsible people who destabilize the hillside and the rains drag it away, affecting the lower-lying neighborhoods,' he said. In a visit to the site, President Luis Arce delivered aid to flood victims and vowed to hold people responsible for the illegal construction that exacerbated the damage. 'We are shocked by what happened,' he said. 'This cannot be left like this. An investigation must be carried out.' The city of La Paz, nestled in a valley surrounded by high hills, is particularly prone to floods and landslides.

South African dissident writer and poet Breyten Breytenbach dies at 85	JOHANNESBURG — South African writer and poet Breyten Breytenbach, a staunch opponent of the former white-minority government's apartheid policy of racial oppression, has died in Paris, his family announced on Sunday. He was 85. Breytenbach was a celebrated wordsmith, a leading voice in literature in Afrikaans — an offshoot of Dutch that was developed by white settlers — and a fierce critic of apartheid that was imposed against the country's Black majority between 1948 and 1990. He moved to Paris but on a clandestine trip to his home country in 1975 he was arrested on allegations that he assisted Nelson Mandela's then-outlawed African National Congress group in its sabotage campaign against the white-minority government. He was convicted of treason and served seven years in prison. French president Francois Mitterrand helped secure his release in 1982. Upon his release, Breytenbach based himself in Paris, becoming a French citizen, and continued his anti-apartheid activism. Breytenbach is best known for 'Confessions of an Albino Terrorist,' his account of his imprisonment and the events leading to it. His work addressed themes of exile, identity and justice, his family said in a statement on Sunday. 'Known for his masterful poetry collections in Afrikaans, as well as autobiographical works such as 'The True Confessions of an Albino Terrorist' and 'A Season in Paradise,' he fearlessly addressed themes of exile, identity and justice,' his family said in a statement. Breytenbach was a poet, novelist, painter and activist whose work touched on and influenced literature and the arts both domestically and abroad, his family added. He was born in the Western Cape province in 1939 but spent much of his life abroad. He joined Okhela, an ideological wing of South Africa's African National Congress, in exile, but remained deeply connected to his South African roots. He is survived by his wife, Yolande, daughter Daphnée and two grandsons. Some information for this report came from Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-african-dissident-writer-and-poet-breyten-breytenbach-dies-at-85/7875647.html	2024-11-24T16:44:55-08:00	
Record dryness in US Northeast should change water behavior, experts say	Denver, Colorado — It hasn't been a typical fall for the northeastern United States. Fires have burned in parks and forests around New York City. Towns and cities in a stretch from Portsmouth, New Hampshire, to south of Philadelphia had their driest three months on record, according to the Applied Climate Information System. Some reservoirs in the region are near historic lows. Major changes need to happen to avoid critical shortages of water in the future, even if that future isn't immediate. As the climate warms, droughts will continue to intensify and communities should use this one as motivation to put in place long-term solutions, experts say. 'This is the canary in the coal mine for the future,' said Tim Eustance, executive director of the North Jersey District Water Supply Commission. 'People should stop watering their lawns yesterday.' Eustance wants New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy to issue a drought emergency to increase people's sense of urgency. Here are some ways to stretch water experts said could become necessary in the Northeast. Replenishing more water underground One important place water is stored is under our feet. Groundwater has dropped significantly over the years in parts of Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey and New York. Groundwater makes up about half of New Jersey's drinking water. Sprawl and concrete can make it tough for rain to replenish the water underground. 'New Jersey is 'mall-landia.' We have these giant parking lots that could be ways to reclaim water instead of having runoff,' Eustance said. In some other parts of the country, there is increasing use of permeable asphalt, concrete and pavers that allow water to percolate into the ground and back into the aquifer. It would be up to municipalities to require that, he said. A faster way to replenish the aquifer is by injecting highly treated wastewater into it, something Los Angeles has been doing for years. It is dramatically adding to the city's available water. Virginia Beach, Virginia, is also pumping highly treated water back into its aquifer, and Anne Arundel County in Maryland is trying to pass legislation that would allow the same. Paying people to conserve In some places in the western U.S., getting paid to save water has long been an option. Some cities and counties pay dollars for every square foot of lawn torn out and replaced with native landscaping. Those policies are not nearly as widespread in the Northeast, said Alan Roberson, CEO of the Association of State Drinking Water Administrators. 'The abundance has created a different perspective,' he said. This can make it hard to get people on board with conservation. Upgraded water meters can give customers details about their water use and help them see where they can save money when drought doesn't feel as urgent, said Beth O'Connell, chief engineer for Anne Arundel County, Maryland. Reusing water could become more common The concept is simple: capture water from the sink, clothes washer, shower and toilet, treat it to a high standard and use it again for nonpotable purposes: It can be sent back through pipes to flush toilets, cool buildings, water yards or help raise water levels in a river or aquifer. 'One of the crimes I think, in America, is we use drinking water to water our lawns and flush our toilet,' Eustance said. Zach Gallagher is CEO of Natural Systems Utilities, which designs, builds and operates water recycling systems. He also is the father of three kids and lives in New Jersey, so this drought hits close to home. 'I feel like I'm doing something that is going to be meaningful and leave something beyond for my children, and their children,' he said. Reuse can be a tool for both drought and flood, he explained. When a building can reuse its own wastewater and discharge it directly into a body of water, it eases stress on a city's fragile sewer system, which is a common vulnerability in old coastal cities. It also reduces demand on new water. Once open this summer, the company's redesign of the old Domino Sugar Refinery on New York's East River will be able to treat 400,000 gallons (1.5 million liters) of wastewater a day, enough to cover a football field in nearly 15 inches (38 centimeters) of water. The cleaned water will be piped back into the new mixed-use buildings for flushing toilets, cooling and landscaping, with some of it discharged back into the river. Nonpotable reuse has a growing footprint in the eastern U.S., but scaling it to a regional level should be the next focus, O'Connell said. A new mindset Planning for a future that includes extended drought can be costly. It could also require a shift in mindset from one of abundance to conservation, said Del Shannon, dam engineer and member of the American Society of Civil Engineers. He has worked on water projects around the world and said many developing countries are focused on getting reliable water for crops and drinking. 'We need to treat our water and guard it as gently as those countries are.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/record-dryness-in-us-northeast-should-change-water-behavior-experts-say/7875643.html	2024-11-24T16:31:43-08:00	
Australia withdraws misinformation bill after critics compare it to censorship	CANBERRA, Australia — Australia's government has withdrawn a bill that would give a media watchdog power to monitor digital platforms and require them to keep records about misinformation and disinformation on their networks. Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said Sunday that the government was unable to drum up the support needed to pass the legislation. The opposition spokesman, David Coleman, said the bill 'betrayed our democracy' and amounted to 'censorship laws in Australia.' 'Based on public statements and engagements with senators, it is clear that there is no pathway to legislate this proposal through the Senate,' Rowland said. The bill would have granted the Australian Communications and Media Authority power over digital platforms by approving an enforceable code of conduct or standards for social media companies if self-regulation fell short. 'This bill would have had the effect of suppressing the free speech of everyday Australians, as platforms would have censored online content to avoid the threat of big fines,' Coleman said said in a statement.	https://www.voanews.com/a/australia-withdraws-misinformation-bill-after-critics-compare-it-to-censorship/7875394.html	2024-11-24T15:51:22-08:00	
Israel and Hezbollah trade fire as hostilities continue	Israel continues its airstrike campaign on Lebanon in what Israel says are ongoing operations against Hezbollah. This, as Hezbollah launches more rocket attacks into Israel.

Hezbollah rockets land near Tel Aviv after big Israeli strike on Beirut	JERUSALEM/BEIRUT — Lebanon's Hezbollah movement fired heavy rocket barrages at Israel on Sunday, and the Israeli military said houses had been destroyed or set alight near Tel Aviv, after a powerful Israeli airstrike killed at least 29 people in Beirut the day before. Israel also struck Beirut's Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs, where intensified bombardment over the last two weeks has coincided with signs of progress in U.S.-led cease-fire talks. Hezbollah, which has previously vowed to respond to attacks on Beirut by targeting Tel Aviv, said it had launched precision missiles at two military sites in Tel Aviv and nearby. Police said there were multiple impact sites in the area of Petah Tikvah, on the eastern side of Tel Aviv, and that several people had minor injuries. The Israeli military (IDF) said a direct hit on a neighborhood had left 'houses in flames and ruins.' Television footage showed an apartment damaged by rocket fire. The IDF said Hezbollah had fired 240 rockets at Israel, of which many were intercepted, with sirens sounding across most of the country. At least four people had been injured by shrapnel. Video obtained by Reuters showed a projectile exploding as it smashed into the roof of a building in the northern Israeli city of Nahariya. The military warned on social media that it planned to target Hezbollah facilities in southern Beirut before strikes that demolished two apartment blocks, according to security sources in Lebanon. Afterwards, the IDF said it had hit command centers 'deliberately embedded between civilian buildings.' On Saturday, it had carried out one of its deadliest and most powerful strikes on the center of Beirut. Lebanon's health ministry on Sunday raised the death toll from 20 to 29. It said 84 people had been killed in all on Saturday, taking the death toll to 3,754 since October 2023. The current was began after Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages in their Oct. 7, 2023, attack on Israel. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,000 Palestinians, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated a terror group by the United States. The IDF did not comment on Saturday's strike on Beirut or say what it had attacked. Israel went on the offensive against the Iran-backed Hezbollah in September, pounding the south, the Bekaa Valley and Beirut's southern suburbs with airstrikes after nearly a year of hostilities ignited by the Gaza war. The Israeli offensive has uprooted more than 1 million people in Lebanon. Israel says its aim is to secure the return home of tens of thousands of people evacuated from its north due to rocket attacks by Hezbollah, which opened fire in support of Hamas at the start of the Gaza war in October 2023. U.S. mediator Amos Hochstein highlighted progress in negotiations during a visit to Beirut last week, before traveling to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz, and then returning to Washington. European Union foreign policy chief Josep Borrell on Sunday said a U.S. cease-fire proposal was awaiting final approval from Israel. 'We must pressure the Israeli government and maintain the pressure on Hezbollah to accept the U.S. proposal for a ceasefire,' he said in Beirut after meeting Lebanese officials. Israeli media reported that Netanyahu had convened a meeting of his security Cabinet for 5 p.m. (1500 GMT). Diplomacy has focused on restoring a cease-fire based on U.N. Security Council Resolution 1701, which ended a 2006 Hezbollah-Israel war. It requires Hezbollah to pull its fighters back around 30 kilometers (19 miles) from the Israeli border, and the Lebanese army to deploy in the buffer zone. The Lebanese army said on Sunday at least one soldier had been killed and 18 more injured in an Israeli strike that caused severe damage at an army center in Al-Amiriya near the southern city of Tyre. The Israeli military said it regretted and was investigating the incident, and that it was fighting against Hezbollah, not the Lebanese Army. Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, said the attack 'represents a direct bloody message rejecting all efforts to reach a ceasefire, strengthen the army's presence in the south, and implement ... 1701.' Borrell said the EU was ready to allocate 200 million euros ($208 million) to support the Lebanese army.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hezbollah-rockets-land-near-tel-aviv-after-big-israeli-strike-on-beirut/7875345.html	2024-11-24T12:57:46-08:00	
Trump ‘incredibly concerned’ about escalation of munitions in Russia-Ukraine conflict, aide says	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump is 'incredibly concerned' about the escalating use of different types of weaponry in Russia’s nearly three-year war on Ukraine, his designated choice for national security adviser said Sunday. Michael Waltz, now a Florida congressman, told 'Fox News Sunday' that the decision by the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden to allow Ukraine to use anti-personnel land mines to try to halt Russia’s battlefield ground troop advances has turned the fight in eastern Ukraine into something akin to 'World War I trench warfare.' Waltz said the decision 'needs to be within a broader framework to end this conflict.' 'It is just an absolute meat grinder of people and personnel on that front,' he said. U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said last week the United States is sending the anti-personnel mines to Ukraine because of the changing nature of the conflict in eastern Ukraine, the main battlefield. He said Russian ground troops, rather than forces more protected in armored carriers, are leading Moscow’s advance, so Ukraine has 'a need for things that can help slow down that effort.' Waltz said Trump, who takes office January 20, is concerned about the carnage but said that in the broad picture, the question that must be preeminent is, 'How do we restore deterrence and how do we bring peace?' 'We need to, we need to bring this to a responsible end,' he added. Trump has often claimed that he would end the Russia-Ukraine war even before he is inaugurated as the 47th U.S. president. Trump has never said how and refused to say during a campaign debate in September that he wants Ukraine to win. Biden gave Ukraine authority to launch Washington-supplied missiles with a 300-kilometer range deep into Russia in response to North Korea’s dispatch of 10,000 troops to fight alongside Moscow’s forces. Within two days, Kyiv targeted weapons warehouses in Russia’s Bryansk region with the missiles. Then, Russian President Vladimir Putin launched a new experimental rocket, targeting Dnipro in Ukraine’s eastern region. 'This is a clear escalation,' Waltz said. 'Where is this escalation going? How do we get both sides to the table' for peace negotiations? Waltz, whose appointment does not require Senate confirmation, said he has been meeting with Jake Sullivan, Biden’s national security adviser. Waltz said that any U.S. adversary 'is wrong' if it thinks it can 'play one side off against the other' with the switch in power in Washington from Biden, a Democrat, and his long-time political foe, Trump, a Republican. Waltz said he is 'confident' Trump will restore peace 'in pretty short order' in the multiple conflicts in the Middle East involving Israel fighting Iran-funded militants — Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon. But months of cease-fire talks on the conflict in Gaza are stalemated and talks to reach a halt in the Hezbollah-Israel fighting have yet to produce a deal.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-incredibly-concerned-about-escalation-of-munitions-in-russia-ukraine-conflict-aide-says-/7875300.html	2024-11-24T10:49:10-08:00

Moscow offers debt forgiveness to new recruits and AP sees wreckage of new Russian missile	KYIV — Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law granting debt forgiveness to new army recruits who enlist to fight in Ukraine. The measure, whose final version appeared on a government website Saturday, underscores Russia’s needs for military personnel in the nearly 3-year war, even as it fired last week a new intermediate-range ballistic missile. According to Russian state news agency Interfax, the new legislation allows those signing up for a one-year contract to write off bad debts of up to 10 million rubles ($96,000). The law applies to debts for which a court order for collection was issued and enforcement proceedings had commenced before Dec. 1, 2024. It also applies to the spouses of new recruits. Russia has ramped up military recruitment by offering increasing financial incentives, in some cases several times the average salary, to those willing to fight in Ukraine. The strategy has allowed the military to boost its ranks in the conflict zone while avoiding another mobilization order. A 'partial mobilization' in September 2022 sparked an exodus of tens of thousands of Russian men, who fled the country to avoid enlistment. The intense and drawn-out war has strained Russian resources. Putin in September called for the military to increase its troops by 180,000. The U.S., South Korea and Ukraine say North Korea sent more than 10,000 troops to Russia in October, some of whom have recently begun engaging in combat on the front lines, piling more pressure on Ukraine’s also weary and overstretched army. The AP sees wreckage of Russia's new experimental missile The push for recruits coincides with the firing of a new intermediate-range ballistic missile at Ukraine on Thursday. Putin said it was in response to Kyiv’s use of American and British missiles capable of striking deeper into Russia. Ukraine’s Security Service showed The Associated Press on Sunday wreckage of the new experimental ballistic missile, which struck a factory in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro. The fragments of the missile called Oreshnik -– Russian for hazel tree, and which the Pentagon said is based on Russia’s RS-26 Rubezh intercontinental ballistic missile -– have not been analyzed yet, according to security officials on site in an undisclosed location in Ukraine. The AP and other media were able to see the fragments before they were taken by investigators. Charred, mangled wires and an ashy airframe the size of a large snow tire was all that remained of the weapon, which can carry either conventional or nuclear warheads. 'It should be noted that this is the first time that the remains of such a missile have been discovered on the territory of Ukraine,' said an expert with Ukraine’s Security Service, who identified himself only by his first name Oleh because he wasn't authorized to discuss the issue with the media. Ukraine’s Main Intelligence Directorate said the missile was fired from the 4th Missile Test Range, Kapustin Yar, in Russia’s Astrakhan region and flew for 15 minutes before striking Dnipro. The missile had six warheads, each carrying six submunitions. The peak speed was 11 Mach. The U.S. needs to 'get ahead' of escalation, says incoming national security adviser In light of the missile strike, U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s incoming national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said Sunday that the incoming administration wants 'to get both sides to the table' and is concerned about escalation. Waltz made clear on 'Fox News Sunday' that he has met with Biden’s national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, to discuss U.S. policy and options in Ukraine, and the Florida congressman assured that those conversations will continue. 'For our adversaries out there that think this is a time of opportunity, that they can play one administration off the other, they’re wrong,' Waltz said. 'We are hand in glove. We are one team with the United States in this transition.' Waltz seemed to endorsed Biden’s decision to send antipersonnel mines for Ukraine forces to use in the conflict. 'It is a step towards somewhat solidifying the lines, and we also needed to stop Russian gains,' Waltz said. The congressman also emphasized Trump’s desire for the conflict to end quickly. Trump, who has praised Putin over the years, avoided throughout the campaign setting conditions for an end to the conflict, suggesting he would be open to considerable annexations of Ukraine. Waltz avoided discussing any terms Trump might pursue once he takes office. 'The president-elect has been very concerned about the escalation and where it’s all going,' Waltz said. 'We need to bring this to a responsible end. We need to restore deterrence, restore peace and get ahead of this escalation ladder, rather than responding to it.'

Uruguay's once-dull election has become dead heat in presidential runoff	MONTEVIDEO, Uruguay — Uruguayans went to the polls Sunday for a second round of voting to choose their next president, with the conservative governing party and the left-leaning coalition locked in a close runoff after failing to win an outright majority in last month's vote. The staid election has turned into a hard-fought race between Álvaro Delgado, the incumbent party's candidate, and Yamandú Orsi from the Broad Front, a coalition of leftist and center-left parties that governed for 15 years until the 2019 victory of center-right President Luis Lacalle Pou. The Broad Front oversaw the legalization of abortion, same-sex marriage and the sale of marijuana in the small, laid-back South American nation of 3.4 million people. Orsi's Broad Front took 44% of the vote while Delgado's National Party won 27% in the first round of voting Oct. 27. But the other conservative parties that make up the government coalition — in particular, the Colorado Party — notched 20% of the vote collectively, enough to give Delgado an edge over his challenger this time around. Congress ended up evenly split in the October vote. Most polls have shown a virtual tie between Delgado and Orsi, with nearly 10% of Uruguayan voters undecided even at this late stage. Analysts say the candidates' lackluster campaigns and broad consensus on key issues have generated extraordinary indecision and apathy in an election dominated by discussions about social spending and concerns over growing income inequality but largely free of the anti-establishment rage that has vaulted populist outsiders to power elsewhere. 'The question of whether Frente Amplio (the Broad Front) raises taxes is not an existential question, unlike what we saw in the U.S. with Trump and Kamala framing each other as threats to democracy,' said Nicolás Saldías, a Latin America and Caribbean senior analyst for the London-based Economist Intelligence Unit. 'That doesn't exist in Uruguay.' Both candidates are also appealing to voter angst over a surge in violent crime that has shaken a nation long regarded as one of the region’s safest and most stable. Delgado promises tough-on-crime policies and a new maximum-security prison while Orsi advocates a community-oriented approach to crime prevention. Delgado, 55, a rural veterinarian with a long career in the National Party, campaigned on a vow to continue the legacy of current President Lacalle Pou — in some ways making the election into a referendum on his leadership. He campaigned under the slogan 're-elect a good government.' While a string of corruption scandals briefly rattled Lacalle Pou's government last year, the president — who constitutionally cannot run for a second consecutive term — now enjoys high approval ratings and a strong economy expected to grow 3.2% this year, according to the International Monetary Fund. Inflation has also eased in recent months, boosting his coalition. Delgado served most recently as Secretary of the Presidency for Lacalle Pou and promises to press on with his predecessor's pro-business, market-friendly policies. He would continue pursuing a prospective trade deal with China that has raised hackles in Mercosur, an alliance of South American countries that promotes regional commerce. Orsi, 57, a former history teacher and two-time mayor from a working-class background, is widely seen as an heir to iconic former President José 'Pepe' Mujica, a former Marxist guerilla who boosted Uruguay's profile as one of the region's most socially liberal and environmentally sustainable nations during his 2010-2015 term. Mujica, now 89 and recovering from esophageal cancer, was among the first to cast his ballot after polls opened. 'When it comes to governing, with the parliamentary structure that we will have, the government will be forced to negotiate,' he told reporters as he emerged from his local polling station, praising Uruguay's robust and level-headed democracy as 'no small thing' in Latin America. While promising to forge a 'new left' in Uruguay, Orsi plans no dramatic changes. He proposes tax incentives to lure investment and social security reforms that would buck the demographic trend in lowering the retirement age but fall short of a radical overhaul sought by Uruguay's unions. The contentious plebiscite on whether to boost pension payouts failed to pass in October, with Uruguayans rejecting generous pensions in favor of fiscal constraint. 'This is a normal election, which is rare,' said Saldías. 'It's indicative of Uruguay’s strength as a democracy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/uruguay-s-once-dull-election-has-become-dead-heat-in-presidential-runoff-/7875228.html	2024-11-24T08:37:30-08:00	
Taiwan seeks to strengthen cooperation with Europe through foreign minister’s trip	Taipei, Taiwan — Taiwan’s foreign minister, Lin Chia-lung, wrapped up a weeklong trip to Europe Sunday after meeting European lawmakers in Brussels and overseeing efforts to deepen bilateral cooperation in developing drone technology between Taiwan and Lithuania. Analysts say the trip was part of Taiwan’s ongoing efforts to deepen engagement with European countries and reflected the current administration’s attempt to focus on facilitating practical and tangible cooperation with individual nations. 'European countries and members of the European parliament have pushed for tangible cooperation that the EU and Taiwan can both agree on, so focusing on deepening bilateral ties is a more realistic approach for Taiwan as it can help tangible examples of economic cooperation to materialize,' Zsuzsa Anna Ferenczy, an expert on EU-Taiwan relations at National Dong Hwa University in Taiwan, told VOA. During his seven-day trip, Lin met with several members of the European Parliament in Brussels and visited the Interuniversity Microelectronics Centre, which focuses on nanoelectronics and digital technologies. Lin has made economic and trade diplomacy his priority since becoming Taiwan’s top diplomat in May. Lin also led a delegation of representatives from 20 Taiwanese drone companies to Lithuania. They attended a forum on drone technologies and signed two agreements that will facilitate collaboration in the unmanned aerial vehicle industry. The signing of the agreements is part of Taiwan’s efforts to build a domestic drone manufacturing industry, which the government sees as an important part of enhancing the island’s overall defense capabilities in the face of increasing military pressure imposed by China. Beijing views Taiwan, a self-governing island, as an inalienable part of its territory that should one day reunite with the mainland, by force if necessary. In September, Taiwan gathered more than 50 domestic drone manufacturers and established the Taiwan Excellence Drone International Business Opportunities Alliance, which has been building drone development partnerships with other countries. On November 16, the alliance signed an agreement to promote drone development with the Polish-Taiwanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Experts say Lin’s trip can help Taiwan broaden the scope of economic cooperation with central and eastern European countries beyond the semiconductor industry. By focusing on developing partnerships in drone development with Lithuanian companies, 'the trip allows the conversation around economic engagements with Taiwan to move beyond the focus on semiconductors,' Marcin Jerzewski, the head of the Taiwan Office at the European Values Center for Security Policy, told VOA by phone. Other European analysts say since central and eastern European countries, especially Lithuania, play an important role in supplying drones to Ukraine in Kyiv's ongoing fight against Russia, Taiwan’s emphasis on deepening bilateral cooperation in this sector could resonate with these countries’ priorities. Since Taiwan is deepening cooperation over drone technology 'with Lithuania and Poland, two front-line countries that have nuanced and realistic views of the threats coming from Russia, this development can help improve the defense capabilities in central and eastern Europe,' Matej Šimalčík, executive director of the Central European Institute of Asian Studies, or CEIAS, told VOA by phone. During a dinner ceremony marking the third anniversary of the establishment of Taiwan’s representative office in Lithuania on November 20, Lin said he expects Taiwan and Lithuania to expand the bilateral partnership and 'work toward the common goal of promoting peace and prosperity.' Lithuania’s recalibration Despite Taiwan’s attempt to deepen engagement with Lithuania, Lin’s trip comes at a time when Lithuania’s potential new government is considering improving relations with China after Beijing downgraded diplomatic relations with the Baltic country in 2021 following the establishment of Taiwan’s representative office in the country. Gintautas Paluckas, the candidate that the Social Democratic Party wants to make prime minister after coming out on top in elections last month, expressed his desire to 'normalize' relations with China. He spoke during an interview with Lithuanian national broadcaster LRT on October 31. 'Having normal relations is certainly an aspiration because the EU – even though relations with China will not be rosy, they will argue about the economy, about tariffs, about protectionist measures [...] – but the EU is trying to maintain diplomatic relations. We cannot fall out of this context and call it leadership,' he said. Ferenczy said as Lithuania rethinks its engagement with China, Taiwan’s focus on deepening economic ties will be more 'productive' to the sustainability of bilateral ties as it could avoid triggering potential retaliation from China. 'It will help circumvent member states’ reluctance to engage with Taiwan and instead bring the kind of engagement that helps both sides,' she told VOA. Ferenczy adds that successful bilateral cooperation with European countries can help consolidate Taiwan’s engagement with the European Union as a whole. 'Building up stronger bilateral relationships will help consolidate Taiwan’s cooperation with the EU, as countries that have substance to their partnerships with Taiwan may be more willing to embrace Taiwan at the European level,' she said. In response to questions about Lin’s trip to Europe, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said Beijing opposes any form of official interaction between Taiwan and countries having diplomatic ties with China. 'The EU should abide by the one-China principle, stop any form of official interaction with the Taiwan authorities, and stop sending wrong signals to ‘Taiwan independence separatist forces,’' he said during a press conference on November 20. Lin Chia-lung's trip marks the third time a high-level Taiwanese delegation has visited Europe since Taiwanese President Lai Ching-te won elections in January. As Taipei continues to deepen engagement with European countries, Jerzewski said the Lai administration should consider establishing a coherent approach to manage its relations with Europe.

Floods sweep through parts of England and Wales in wake of Storm Bert	Floods swept through parts of Britain on Sunday as residents woke to flooded homes and streets as Storm Bert battered Britain. Floods in the small Welsh town of Pontypridd, near Cardiff, left residents battling high water levels and volunteering in groups to help clear water from their homes and streets using an assortment of buckets. Emergency workers rescued a dog while local resident Victor fled the town with his partner and pet cat 'Cookie' after moving their valuables to the upper floor of the home, planning on returning once waters subside. In West Yorkshire's small town of Hebden Bridge, fire fighters planned to return a major road back into use as they spent the morning using pumps to remove the floodwaters off the road and back into the local river. Storm Bert brought snow, rain and strong winds on Saturday (November 23), killing one person and closing several railway lines, bridges and roads. A man in his 60s died after a tree fell on a car on the A34 highway in southern England, local police said. Met Office Chief Meteorologist Jason Kelly termed the storm a 'multi-hazard event,' saying it was expected to bring snow, rain and wind to Britain for most of the weekend.	https://www.voanews.com/a/floods-sweep-through-parts-of-england-and-wales-in-wake-of-storm-bert-/7875174.html	2024-11-24T07:53:42-08:00	
Elvis Smylie holds out mentor Cam Smith to win the Australian PGA by 2 shots	BRISBANE, Australia — Australian Elvis Smylie shot a 4-under 67 to win the 54-hole Australian PGA on Sunday by two shots after a final round shootout with his compatriot and former mentor Cameron Smith. Smylie finished on 14-under 199, two ahead of Smith who had a 2-under final round 69. Smith's LIV tour teammate Mark Leishman and Australian Anthony Quayle shared third place on 11 under at the par-71 Royal Queensland. Heavy rain showers and an unplayable course on Friday forced the second round to be abandoned and made the joint Australasian PGA and European Tour event a 54-hole tournament. Five years ago Smylie, the son of former Australian tennis pro Liz Smylie. won the Cameron Smith Scholarship which allowed him to spend a week at Smith's Florida home where he was able to learn to live and practice as a PGA Tour professional. Now 22, Smylie started Sunday's final round tied atop the leaderboard with Smith at 10 under par. Smith was the 2022 British Open winner at St. Andrews and previously won the Australian PGA in 2017, 2018 and 2022. Smylie had a breakthrough win in last month's West Australian Open. The pair traded birdies until the sixth hole when there was a two-shot turnaround when Smylie birdied and Smith bogeyed. Smylie, who led after a first round 65, had four birdies in his first seven holes and played his outward nine in four-under 32, turning at 14 under. He had good ups and downs under pressure at the par four 10th and 12th holes, using his three wood to bunt the ball onto the greens from close range. With a bogey at the ninth hole, Smith turned in 35, having dropped back into a second place tie at 11-under with Quayle, Mark Leishman and Australia David Micheluzzi. Smith had another bogey on the par-4 14th which dropped him back to 10 under while Quayle finished with an 8-under 63 to take an early clubhouse lead at 11-under. Smylie was under pressure at the par-5 15th when he hit his second well to the left of the green. Again he scrambled to save par while Smith birdied to move back to 11-under, cutting the lead to three shots. Smith trimmed Smylie's lead to two when he holed out from off the green for birdie at the par-3 17th, winning a large cheer from the crowd on the tournament's party hole. Smylie's birdie putt from six feet slipped past. Smylie held his nerve when he put his tee shot on the 18th into light rough with the broad trunk of a tree between him and the green 186 meters away. He curled his around the tree, but into a greenside bunker. Smylie played a nerveless shot from the sand to three feet and holed out for par, finishing with 11 consecutive pars. He managed to get up and down from precarious positions six times on the back nine. 'It’s a dream come true,' Smylie said. 'I won’t forget this day playing with Cam and [Leishman]. 'My short game was great; I definitely saved myself.' The Australian PGA is the first event of the 2025 European Tour season. Next week, many of the same players will travel to Melbourne for the Australian Open, also on the European Tour. It is being played concurrently with the Women’s Australian Open at famed sandbelt courses Kingston Heath and Victoria.	https://www.voanews.com/a/elvis-smylie-holds-out-mentor-cam-smith-to-win-the-australian-pga-by-2-shots/7875164.html	2024-11-24T07:32:36-08:00	
Iran to hold nuclear talks with 3 European powers in Geneva on Friday, Kyodo reports	DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES — Iran plans to hold talks about its disputed nuclear program with three European powers on Nov. 29 in Geneva, Japan's Kyodo news agency reported on Sunday, days after the U.N. atomic watchdog passed a resolution against Tehran. Iran reacted to the resolution, which was proposed by Britain, France, Germany and the United States, with what government officials called various measures such as activating numerous new and advanced centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium. Kyodo said Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian's government was seeking a solution to the nuclear impasse ahead of the inauguration in January of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. A senior Iranian official confirmed that the meeting would go ahead next Friday, adding that 'Tehran has always believed that the nuclear issue should be resolved through diplomacy. Iran has never left the talks.' In 2018, the then-Trump administration exited Iran's 2015 nuclear pact with six major powers and reimposed harsh sanctions on Iran, prompting Tehran to violate the pact's nuclear limits, with moves such as rebuilding stockpiles of enriched uranium, refining it to higher fissile purity and installing advanced centrifuges to speed up output. Indirect talks between President Joe Biden's administration and Tehran to try to revive the pact have failed, but Trump said in his election campaign in September that 'We have to make a deal, because the consequences are impossible. We have to make a deal.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-to-hold-nuclear-talks-with-3-european-powers-in-geneva-on-friday-kyodo-reports/7875028.html	2024-11-24T02:50:33-08:00	
Prominent Cambodia environmentalist arrested while investigating illegal logging	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia — A prominent Cambodian environmentalist was arrested along with five others while investigating illegal logging in a national park, a rights group and a government official said Sunday. Ouch Leng, who was awarded a 2016 Goldman Environmental Prize for his activism, was arrested Saturday in northeastern Stung Treng province, the rights group Licadho said in a statement. The activists have documented an increase in illegal deforestation within the Veun Sai-Siem Pang National Park, located near an economic land concession, it said. The arrests come during a broader crackdown on environmental activists in recent months. In July, 10 members of a Cambodian environmental group, Mother Nature Cambodia, who campaigned against destructive infrastructure projects and alleged corruption were each sentenced to six years in prison on charges of conspiring against the state. Stung Treng provincial spokesman Men Khung confirmed Sunday by telephone that the six were arrested after they ignored instructions from authorities to leave the forestry area where no access is allowed. He said authorities were strictly guarding the site against illegal logging and land grabbing. Men Khung said several dozen armed personnel have been sent to the site to chase away illegal loggers and land grabbers and to ensure that no outsiders enter. He said that the six were not environmental activists but attempted to sow anarchy and provoke the authorities. He said that no charges had been filed against the six as of Sunday. According to Licadho, the government granted an economic land concession in the area in 2022, even though it contravened a 2012 moratorium on new concessions, which have been linked to mass evictions, rapid deforestation and extraction of resources. Cambodia's government has long been accused of using its judiciary to persecute critics and political opponents. Prime Minister Hun Manet succeeded his father, Hun Sen, in August last year after he ruled the country for nearly four decades, but there have been few signs of political liberalization.	https://www.voanews.com/a/prominent-cambodia-environmentalist-arrested-while-investigating-illegal-logging/7875023.html	2024-11-24T02:33:43-08:00	
Pakistan partially stops mobile and internet services ahead of pro-Khan protest	ISLAMABAD — Pakistan on Sunday suspended mobile and internet services 'in areas with security concerns' as supporters of imprisoned former premier Imran Khan geared up for a protest in the capital. The government and Interior Ministry posted the announcement on social media platform X, which is banned in Pakistan. They did not specify the areas, nor did they say how long the suspension would be in place. 'Internet and mobile services will continue to operate as usual in the rest of the country,' the posts said. A spokesperson for the Interior Ministry was not immediately available for comment. Khan has been in prison for more than a year and has over 150 criminal cases against him. But he remains popular and his political party, Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf or PTI, says the cases are politically motivated. His supporters rely heavily on social media to demand his release and use messaging platforms like WhatsApp to share information, including details of events. Pakistan has already sealed off the capital Islamabad with shipping containers and shut down major roads and highways connecting the city with PTI strongholds in the provinces of Punjab and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. The government is imposing social media platform bans and targeting VPN services, according to monitoring service Netblocks. On Sunday, Netblocks said live metrics showed WhatsApp backends are restricted in Pakistan, affecting media sharing on the app. Last month, authorities suspended cellphone service in Islamabad and Rawalpindi to thwart a pro-Khan rally. The shutdown disrupted communications and affected everyday services such as banking, ride-hailing and food delivery.	https://www.voanews.com/a/pakistan-partially-stops-mobile-and-internet-services-ahead-of-pro-khan-protest/7875007.html	2024-11-24T01:07:39-08:00	
Israel says rabbi who went missing in the UAE was killed	TEL AVIV, Israel — Israel said Sunday that the body of an Israeli-Moldovan rabbi who went missing in the United Arab Emirates has been found after he was killed in what it described as a 'heinous antisemitic terror incident.' The statement from Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said Israel 'will act with all means to seek justice with the criminals responsible for his death.' There was no immediate comment from the UAE. Zvi Kogan, 28, an ultra-Orthodox rabbi who went missing on Thursday, ran a Kosher grocery store in the futuristic city of Dubai, where Israelis have flocked for commerce and tourism since the two countries forged diplomatic ties in the 2020 Abraham Accords. The agreement has held through more than a year of soaring regional tensions unleashed by Hamas' October 7, 2023 attack into southern Israel. In that attack, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,000 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Israel's devastating retaliatory offensive in Gaza and its invasion of Lebanon, after months of fighting with the Hezbollah militant group, have stoked anger among Emiratis, Arab nationals and others living in the the UAE. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. Iran, which supports Hamas and Hezbollah, has also been threatening to retaliate against Israel after a wave of airstrikes Israel carried out in October in response to an Iranian ballistic missile attack. The Emirati government did not respond to a request for comment. Early Sunday, the UAE's state-run WAM news agency acknowledged Kogan's disappearance but pointedly did not acknowledge he held Israeli citizenship, referring to him only as being Moldovan. The Emirati Interior Ministry described Kogan as being 'missing and out of contact.' 'Specialized authorities immediately began search and investigation operations upon receiving the report,' the Interior Ministry said. Israel's largely ceremonial president, Isaac Herzog, condemned the killing and thanked Emirati authorities for 'their swift action.' He said he trusts they 'will work tirelessly to bring the perpetrators to justice.' Kogan was an emissary of the Chabad Lubavitch movement, a prominent and highly observant branch of ultra-Orthodox Judaism based in Brooklyn's Crown Heights neighborhood in New York City. It said he was last seen in Dubai. The UAE has a burgeoning Jewish community, with synagogues and businesses catering to kosher diners. The Rimon Market, a kosher grocery store that Kogan managed on Dubai's busy Al Wasl Road, was shut Sunday. As the wars have roiled the region, the store has been the target of online protests by supporters of the Palestinians. Mezuzahs on the front and the back doors of the market appeared to have been ripped off when an Associated Press journalist stopped by on Sunday. Kogan's wife, Rivky, is a U.S. citizen who lived with him in the UAE. She is the niece of Rabbi Gavriel Holtzberg, who was killed in the 2008 Mumbai attacks. The UAE is an autocratic federation of seven sheikhdoms on the Arabian Peninsula and is also home to Abu Dhabi. Local Jewish officials in the UAE declined to comment. While the Israeli statement did not mention Iran, Iranian intelligence services have carried out past kidnappings in the UAE. Western officials believe Iran runs intelligence operations in the UAE and keeps tabs on the hundreds of thousands of Iranians living across the country. Iran is suspected of kidnapping and later killing British Iranian national Abbas Yazdi in Dubai in 2013, though Tehran has denied involvement. Iran also kidnapped Iranian German national Jamshid Sharmahd in 2020 from Dubai, taking him back to Tehran, where he was executed in October.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-says-rabbi-who-went-missing-in-the-uae-was-killed/7875000.html	2024-11-24T00:20:03-08:00	
Development, pollution threaten Papuan women's mangrove forest in Indonesia	JAYAPURA, Indonesia — On the southeastern coast of the city of Jayapura, Petronela Merauje walked from house to house in her floating village inviting women to join her the next morning in the surrounding mangrove forests. Merauje and the women of her village, Enggros, practice the tradition of Tonotwiyat, which literally means 'working in the forest.' For six generations, women from the 700-strong Papuan population there have worked among the mangroves collecting clams, fishing and gathering firewood. 'The customs and culture of Papuans, especially those of us in Enggros village, is that women are not given space and place to speak in traditional meetings, so the tribal elders provide the mangrove forest as our land,' Merauje said. It's 'a place to find food, a place for women to tell stories, and women are active every day and earn a living every day.' The forest is a short 13 kilometers away from downtown Jayapura, the capital city of Papua, Indonesia's easternmost province. It's been known as the women's forest since 2016, when Enggros' leader officially changed its name. Long before that, it had already been a space just for women. But as pollution, development and biodiversity loss shrink the forest and stunt plant and animal life, those in the village fear an important part of their traditions and livelihoods will be lost. Efforts to shield it from devastation have begun but are still relatively small. Women have their own space — but it's shrinking One early morning, Merauje and her 15-year-old daughter took a small motorboat toward the forest. Stepping off on Youtefa Bay, mangrove trees all around, they stood chest-deep in the water with buckets in hand, wiggling their feet in the mud to find bia noor, or soft-shell clams. The women collect these for food, along with other fish. 'The women's forest is our kitchen,' said Berta Sanyi, another woman from Enggros village. That morning, another woman joined the group looking for firewood, hauling dry logs onto her boat. And three other women joined on a rowboat. Women from the next village, Tobati, also have a women's forest nearby. The two Indigenous villages are only 2 kilometers apart, and they're culturally similar, with Enggros growing out of Tobati's population decades ago. In the safety of the forest, women of both villages talk about issues at home with one another and share grievances away from the ears of the rest of the village. Alfred Drunyi, the leader of Drunyi tribe in Enggros, said that having dedicated spaces for women and men is a big part of the village's culture. There are tribal fines if a man trespasses and enters the forest, and the amount is based on how guilty the community judges the person to be. 'They should pay it with our main treasure, the traditional beads, maybe with some money. But the fines should be given to the women,' Drunyi said. But Sanyi, 65, who's been working in the forest since she was just 17, notes that threats to the space come from elsewhere. Development on the bay has turned acres of forest into large roads, including a 700-meter bridge into Jayapura that passes through Enggros' pier. Jayapura's population has exploded in recent decades, and around 400,000 people live in the city — the largest on the island. In turn, the forest has shrunk. Nearly six decades ago, the mangrove forest in Youtefa Bay was about 514 hectares. Estimates say it's now less than half that. 'I am so sad when I see the current situation of the forest,' Sanyi said, 'because this is where we live.' She said many residents, including her own children, are turning to work in Jayapura instead of maintaining traditions. Pollution puts traditions and health at risk Youtefa Bay, where the sea's brackish water and five rivers in Papua meet, serves as the gathering bowl for the waste that runs through the rivers as they cross through Jayapura. Plastic bottles, tarpaulins and pieces of wood are seen stuck between the mangrove roots. The water around the mangrove forest is polluted and dark. After dozens of years being able to feel the clams on the bay with her feet, Sanyi said she now often has to feel through trash first. And once she removes the trash and gets to the muddy ground where the clams live, there are many fewer than there used to be. Paula Hamadi, 53, said that she never saw the mangrove forest as bad as it is now. For years, she's been going to the forest almost every day during the low tide in the morning to search for clams. 'It used to be different,' Hamadi said. 'From 8 a.m. to 8:30 in the morning, I could get one can. But now, I only get trash.' The women used to be able to gather enough clams to sell some at the nearest village, but now their small hauls are reserved for eating with their families. A study in 2020 found that high concentrations of lead from waste from homes and businesses were found at several points in the bay. Lead can be toxic to humans and aquatic organisms, and the study suggests it has contaminated several species that are often consumed by the people of Youtefa Bay. Other studies also showed that populations of shellfish and crab in the bay were declining, said John Dominggus Kalor, a lecturer on fisheries and marine sciences at Cenderawasih University. 'The threats related to heavy metal contamination, microplastics, and public health are high,' Kalor said. 'In the future, it will have an impact on health.' Some are trying to save the land Some of the mangrove areas have been destroyed for development, leading to degradation throughout the forest. Mangroves can absorb the shocks of extreme weather events, like tsunamis, and provide ecosystems with the needed environment to thrive. They also serve social and cultural functions for the women, whose work is mostly done between the mangroves. 'In the future people will say that there used to be a women's forest here' that disappeared because of development and pollution, said Kalor. Various efforts to preserve it have been made, including the residents of Enggros village themselves. Merauje and other women from Enggros are trying to start mangrove tree nurseries and, where possible, plant new mangrove trees in the forest area. 'We plant new trees, replace the dead ones, and we also clean up the trash around Youtefa Bay,' Merauje said. 'I do that with my friends to conserve, to maintain this forest.' Beyond efforts to reforest it, Kalor said there also needs to be guarantees that more of the forest won't be flattened for development in the future. There is no regional regulation to protect Youtefa Bay and specifically the women's forests, but Kalor thinks it would help prevent deforestation in the future. 'That should no longer be done in our bay,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/development-pollution-threaten-papuan-women-s-mangrove-forest-in-indonesia/7873058.html	2024-11-24T00:04:16-08:00	
Argentina's football federation locked in struggle with Argentine president	BUENOS AIRES, ARGENTINA — Argentina produces some of the best football players on the planet and has three World Cup titles to prove it. Off the field, though, a major power struggle is transpiring between Argentina President Javier Milei and Argentine Football Association president Claudio Tapia. Tapia opposes Milei's effort to enable football clubs to become sports limited companies, inspired by the model of the English Premier League. He wants clubs to continue to belong to members — not to private shareholders. The government threatened to intervene in AFA due to alleged irregularities in Tapia's reelection to a third term. Amid this struggle, FIFA and CONMEBOL warned that any government interference in the management of AFA will result in its disaffiliation, and its teams will be marginalized from all competitions. What did Milei's decree say? Milei, a libertarian economist who has pushed economic deregulation, signed a decree last December enabling football clubs organized as civil associations to transform into public limited companies. The former do not pursue a commercial purpose, while PLCs seek profit. The government also gave sports associations, federations and confederations a period of one year from August to modify their statutes and accept this new form of organization. The new model is optional and clubs that want to transform into sports corporations will require the vote of two-thirds of their members present at an extraordinary assembly. Milei said that the time has come to end 'poor socialism' in football and predicted a windfall of investment. What does the federation say? AFA says its statutes prohibit the affiliation and participation in its tournaments of sports corporations. It won a court order blocking the decree. That ruling was appealed by the government and the Supreme Court will have the last word. 'The clubs need to fulfill the function they fulfill as the civil associations that they are,' Tapia said. 'I am convinced that that is its essence. Most clubs have an established statute that civil associations are not to be changed.' If a club decides to become a public limited company, it will be disaffiliated, AFA warned. An imperfect model? Argentina is a renowned producer of football talent — Lionel Messi and Diego Maradona start the list. Despite the success developing young players, most clubs are forced to let them go earlier to be able to financially sustain not only their professional team, but also other sports and social activities in the club. In Argentine football 'we are 40 years behind,' said Guillermo Tofoni, a FIFA agent who is also an adviser in Milei's government. 'It is played any day, at any time, the tournaments (formats) change, the corruption of the referees. All this combination means that the television networks do not pay what they deserve, and a vicious and non-virtuous circle is generated.' Argentine football receives less than $100 million a year for television rights, far below the billions of dollars shared by English Premier League clubs. According to Tofoni, with genuine private capital investment 'clubs can keep their players until they are 24, 25 years old, and sell them to the European market when it is convenient, not because they need to.' Are clubs willing to try it? So far, Estudiantes La Plata and Talleres de Córdoba are the only clubs publicly in favor of allowing private capital to enter football. 'I am pragmatic, I understand that soccer is a business. They leave us out of business, Argentina, Argentine football is out of business,' Estudiantes president Juan Sebastián Verón said. 'Let us not be afraid of growth, of the new, which can take us to a very important place in the future.' The former Argentina midfielder recently signed a pre-agreement with the American businessman Foster Gillett, who will invest $150 million in the club. In turn, the American investor will benefit from future sales of players, the commercial exploitation of the stadium's name and profits from competing in international tournaments. The agreement must be endorsed by the members of 'Pincha' in an extraordinary assembly. Tapia's reelection bad news for Milei? Amid the dispute, Tapia called an election of new AFA authorities a year early. As the only candidate, Tapia was reelected to a third term on October 17, thus ensuring he would continue in office until 2028 — a year after the end of Milei's term. 'It looks like Venezuela with (President Nicolás) Maduro celebrated Christmas earlier,' said Milei, who a few days later signed a decree that took away social security benefits from AFA. In turn, the General Inspection of Justice, a body dependent on the Ministry of Justice and in charge of regulating civil associations, challenged Tapia's reelection and threatened to intervene in the AFA. However, a civil appeals court upheld the October vote. What does FIFA and CONMEBOL say? Both entities are closely following the dispute. In official notes, they indicated that only the local federation can set the statutory framework of the clubs and warned that state interference is a cause for disaffiliation. 'The AFA, and only the AFA, is, in view of the legal framework of FIFA, the only entity competent to decide, through its legitimate associative governing bodies, aspects relating to the legal nature of the clubs affiliated to the same,' FIFA said. FIFA president Gianni Infantino also congratulated Tapia on his reelection and thanked him for 'all his efforts, work and important contribution to the development of our sport.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/argentina-s-football-federation-locked-in-struggle-with-argentine-president-/7873052.html	2024-11-24T00:03:40-08:00	
Africa's junta-led nations use music to push anti-imperialism drive	NIAMEY, Niger — Thousands from the junta-led countries in Africa's Sahel region gathered this week in the Nigerien capital of Niamey, with music and cultural displays, to condemn what they called the West's imperialist agenda and to drive support for their military regimes. Delegates from Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali took part in the three-day conference that ended on Thursday. The junta leaders of the three countries are seeking greater popular support after they deposed democratically elected governments and severed ties with longstanding Western partners such as France, their former colonial ruler, with Russia the new preferred partner. All three nations are nearing the end of their one-year withdrawal process from the West Africa regional bloc known as ECOWAS, which they accuse of being influenced by France in sanctioning them for the coups and of failing to help address the extremist violence rampant across their shared borders. Conference delegates – including pro-junta youth, women and civil society groups as well as allies from across West Africa and beyond — discussed their countries' sovereignty as well as economic and security partnerships being forged under the bloc of the three junta-led countries known as the Alliance of Sahel States, or AES. Major highlights were the three countries' colors and cultures depicted in the attires and just about everything else as well as music performances and songs, beginning with a pro-junta rendition by Nigerien artiste Idi Sarki, who flashed back to the July 2023 coup in the country. 'Nigeriens, wake up, we don't want the French army on our land anymore,' sang Sarki, referring to the French troops asked to leave in the wake of the military takeover in Niger and other countries in the region. 'After the colonization, it's recolonization … We'll have to intervene one way or another if we want our energy and economic sovereignty — we need raw materials from sub-Saharan Africa,' he sang as the ecstatic crowd chorused and waved flags of the three coup-hit countries. A women's music group also performed a song dedicated to African youth. 'After so many years of suffering, the youths rise today in an awakening of conscience for a fight towards hope and freedom,' said the lead performer, wearing with others a white-and-grey traditional gown and scarf. Since the coups, the militaries in Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso have promised to help address shortcomings that they said inspired them to take over power, such as the deadly violence and economic hardships faced by their citizens. But the problems have persisted, even worsening in some cases. And in Mali where the junta seized power in 2020, the civilian prime minister appointed by the military was fired on Wednesday after he criticized delays in the election that was to usher in a new government. Some at the conference, however, expressed optimism that the militaries would deliver long sought-after democratic dividends. 'How can we live under a so-called democracy, when there are no schools?' asked Ali Moussa, who came from the Central African country of Gabon, where a military junta is also in power. 'We think that times have changed, it is no longer the time to talk about democracy,' he said. The campaign for sovereignty and anti-imperialism should also extend to other African countries, said Inem Richardson, who came from Burkina Faso where she runs a pan-African library called the Thomas Sankara Center, named for a Marxist military officer who took power in a 1983 coup. 'All of Africa needs to unite … the masses should be 100% engaged,' Richardson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/africa-s-junta-led-nations-use-music-to-push-their-latest-anti-imperialism-drive-/7873035.html	2024-11-24T00:03:02-08:00	
Small but mighty efforts are brewing to bring back native forests in India	UDHAGAMANDALAM, India — Scattered groves of native trees, flowers and the occasional prehistoric burial ground are squeezed between hundreds of thousands of tea shrubs in southern India's Nilgiris region — a gateway to a time before colonization and the commercial growing of tea that reshaped the country's mountain landscapes. These sacred groves once blanketed the Western Ghats mountains, but nearly 200 years ago, British colonists installed rows upon rows of tea plantations. The few groves that stand today are either protected by Indigenous communities who preserve them for their faith and traditions, or are being grown and tended back into existence by ecologists who remove tea trees from disused farms and plant seeds native to this biodiverse region. It takes decades, but their efforts are finally starting to see results as forests flourish despite ecological damage and wilder weather caused by climate change. The teams bringing back the forests — home to more than 600 native plants and 150 animal species found only here — know that they still need to work around their neighbors. Nearly everyone in the region's more than 700,000-strong population either farms black, green and white tea or works with the almost 3 million tourists who come to escape the searing heat of the Indian plains. 'In this time of climate change, I think ecological restoration and rewilding is extremely important,' said Godwin Vasanth Bosco, a Nilgiris-based naturalist and restoration practitioner. 'What we're trying to do is to help nature restore itself.' Degraded land and climate change threaten communities Environmentalists say industrial-scale tea farming has destroyed the soil's nutrients and led to conflict with animals like elephants and gaur, or Indian bison, that have little forest left to live in. Estimates say nearly 54,600 hectares of tea have been planted across the mountains, damaging close to 70% of native grasslands and forests. 'There is no biological diversity,' Gokul Halan, a Nilgiris-based water expert, said of the tea farms. 'It doesn't support the local fauna nor is it a food source.' The forests among the tea farms are recognized by the United Nations as one of the world's eight 'hottest hotspots for biodiversity,' but the areas degraded by excessive pesticide use and other commercial farming methods have been dubbed 'green deserts' by environmentalists for their poor soil and inability to support other life. The Nilgiris region has also had to clear land to facilitate the increasing number of tourists and people from India's plains who are moving to the region. Poorer land makes it more vulnerable to landslides and flooding, which are now more common because of human-caused climate change. The neighboring mountainous region of Wayanad suffered devastating landslides that killed nearly 200 people earlier this year, and Halan warns Nilgiris may suffer a similar fate. Halan also warned the region is susceptible to long droughts and excess heat because of climate change, and that's already affected some tea harvests. Restoring forests brings life back to Nilgiris In a small mountain fold just a few hundred meters below the region's tallest peak, native trees planted 10 years ago have grown up to 4.5 meters tall. A stream flows amid the young trees that replaced nearly 3 hectares of tea plants. 'This whole place was tea plantations and this stream was not flowing throughout the year,' said Bosco, the ecologist. 'Since we began our restoration work, it flows through the year and the trees and bamboo have grown well along the stream.' The forests are known as Shola-grassland forests or cloud forests because they can capture moisture from high-altitude mist. Bosco said the plants and trees have an 'incredible capacity to provide for life' across the about 809 hectares his organization works to restore. The native trees maintain the microclimate underneath them by providing nutrients to the soil. That helps saplings and small plants grow even during hot, dry summers. The region is also home to several Indigenous communities, called Adivasi, many of them classified as highly vulnerable with only a few thousand of their people remaining. Representatives of these Adivasi communities consider themselves the original custodians of the forests and have also restored forests in the region. They say such restoration initiatives are welcome. 'When the British built tea estates, we were kicked out to the fringes of this district, our lands were lost and we lost our traditions because of deforestation,' said Mani Raman, who belongs to the Alu Kurumbar Adivasi community. 'Such restoration work is good. By bringing the forests back, the wildlife and birds will get more food. Animals that have moved out of forests will have a place to live,' he said. Tea growers still need a livelihood Tea growers and factory owners say that the region's entire economy depends on tea and it is relatively less harmful to the local environment compared to rampant development to cater to tourism. 'To convert tea to grasslands and shola forests will have a negative impact on the region's economy and environment,' said A. Balakrishnan, the owner of a 2-year-old tea factory near the town of Kotagiri in the Nilgiris. Eighty-year-old I. Bhojan, who's been a tea grower all his life, agrees. 'There is no Nilgiris without tea,' he said. Bhojan, president of the small farmers and tea growers welfare association for the Nilgiris, estimates that around 600,000 people — 50,000 of them small farmers — depend on tea for their livelihood. Balakrishnan argued that tea plants are maintained well given their economic benefits compared to native forests. 'If tea was not there, Nilgiris will become a place for tourists only, there'll be more construction and urbanization,' he said. Finding common ground Planting woody trees and shrubs in tea plantations, known as agroforestry, can ease the battle for space between farms and restoration, according to some experts. Other crops and timber 'can make tea plantations a bit more biodiverse compared to what is there currently,' said water expert Halan. Officials of Tamil Nadu state, of which the Nilgiris district is a part, earmarked $24 million earlier this year to encourage farmers to shift away from chemical-laden fertilizers to help preserve soil health. The state's forest department officials also announced plans last year to plant nearly 60,000 native trees in the region. Restoration ecologist Bosco said adding value to smaller tea farming operations by growing special, higher-quality tea on smaller parcels of land can open up more land to reforestation without hurting farmers' pockets. He added that if those working to restore the land were paid for that service, that could be another stream of revenue for residents, as well as sourcing new products to sell from the native plants. 'For example, we're trying to come up with products from some of the plants that have medicinal value,' he said. Raman added that future such work could also learn from Adivasi traditional practices. 'Adivasi people have been protecting forests for so long, wherever we live the forests are protected,' he said. 'The state government should be taking such work up at large scale.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/small-but-mighty-efforts-are-brewing-to-bring-back-native-forests-in-india-/7871649.html	2024-11-24T00:02:25-08:00	
How a viral, duct-taped banana came to be worth $6.2 million	NEW YORK — Walk into any supermarket and you can generally buy a banana for less than $1. But a banana duct-taped to a wall? That sold for $6.2 million at an auction at Sotheby's in New York. The yellow banana fixed to the white wall with silver duct tape is a work entitled 'Comedian,' by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan. It first debuted in 2019 as an edition of three fruits at the Art Basel Miami Beach fair, where it became a much-discussed sensation. Was it a prank? A commentary on the state of the art world? Another artist took the banana off the wall and ate it. A backup banana was brought in. Selfie-seeking crowds became so thick, 'Comedian' was withdrawn from view, but three editions of it sold for between $120,000 and $150,000, according to Perrotin gallery. Five years later, someone has now paid more than 40 times that higher price point at the Sotheby’s auction. Or, more accurately, they have purchased a certificate of authenticity that gives them the authority to duct-tape a banana to a wall and call it 'Comedian.' Bidding started at $800,000 and within minutes shot up to $2 million, then $3 million, then $4 million, as the auctioneer joked, 'It’s slipping through the auction room.' The final hammer price announced in the room Wednesday was $5.2 million, which didn't include the about $1 million in auction house fees, paid by the buyer. Sotheby’s calls Cattelan 'among Contemporary Art’s most brilliant provocateurs.' 'He has persistently disrupted the art world’s status quo in meaningful, irreverent, and often controversial ways,' the auction house said in a description of 'Comedian.' 'What Cattelan is really doing is turning a mirror to the contemporary art world and asking questions, provoking thought about how we ascribe value to artworks, what we define as an artwork,' Galperin said. The banana that was on display in Miami is long gone. Sotheby's says the fruit always was meant to be replaced regularly, along with the tape. 'What you buy when you buy Cattelan's 'Comedian' is not the banana itself, but a certificate of authenticity that grants the owner the permission and authority to reproduce this banana and duct tape on their wall as an original artwork by Maurizio Cattelan,' Galperin said. The very title of the piece suggests Cattelan himself likely didn't intend for it to be taken seriously. But Chloé Cooper Jones, an associate professor at the Columbia University School of the Arts, said it is worth thinking about the context. Cattelan premiered the work at an art fair, visited by well-off art collectors, where 'Comedian' was sure to get a lot of attention on social media. That might mean the art constituted a dare, of sorts, to the collectors to invest in something absurd, she said. If 'Comedian' is just a tool for understanding the insular, capitalist, art-collecting world, Cooper Jones said, 'it's not that interesting of an idea.' But she thinks it might go beyond poking fun at rich people. Cattelan is often thought of as a 'trickster artist,' she said. 'But his work is often at the intersection of the sort of humor and the deeply macabre. He's quite often looking at ways of provoking us, not just for the sake of provocation, but to ask us to look into some of the sort of darkest parts of history and of ourselves.' And there is a dark side to the banana, a fruit with a history entangled with imperialism, labor exploitation and corporate power. 'It would be hard to come up with a better, simple symbol of global trade and all of its exploitations than the banana,' Cooper Jones said. If 'Comedian' is about making people think about their moral complicity in the production of objects they take for granted, then it's 'at least a more useful tool or it's at least an additional sort of place to go in terms of the questions that this work could be asking,' she said. 'Comedian' hits the block around the same time that Sotheby's is also auctioning one of the famed paintings in the 'Water Lilies' series by the French impressionist Claude Monet, with an expected value of around $60 million. When asked to compare Cattelan's banana to a classic like Monet's 'Nymphéas,' Galperin says impressionism was not considered art when the movement began. 'No important, profound, meaningful artwork of the past 100 years or 200 years, or our history for that matter, did not provoke some kind of discomfort when it was first unveiled,' Galperin said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-a-viral-duct-taped-banana-came-to-be-worth-6-2-million/7871610.html	2024-11-24T00:01:46-08:00	
Designer describes invitation to work on Notre Dame cathedral's reopening as 'calling'	paris — When Jean-Charles de Castelbajac watched as Notre Dame cathedral burned in April 2019, he felt compelled to act. Returning home, the French fashion designer began sketching ideas, imagining the monument's reconstruction. So, when the Paris Archbishop's emissary approached him to design the liturgical garments for the cathedral's reopening next month, Castelbajac — a believer with personal roots with the church — felt the moment transcended mere coincidence. 'It's bigger than a job. It's a bit mysterious … mysterious,' Castelbajac said, his eyes brimming with wonder as he previewed some of the 2,000 colorful pieces for 700 celebrants at his Paris home. 'It's a calling. To be called like that is synchronicity.' This duty, as he calls it, led to a collection of work crafted in collaboration with the esteemed artisans of 19M studio. The garments, often in thick off-white Scottish wool gabardine, blend his signature eye-popping pop-art aesthetic with a reverence for the cathedral's centuries-old legacy with medieval touches. The unorthodox designs are fun, modern — and perhaps shockingly minimalist. They undoubtedly break with the richly embellished styles associated with the cathedral's near-900-year-old liturgical garb. At their center is a large gold cross, accented by debris fragments of vivid color-blocked red, blue, yellow, and green velvet. 'It's something that is exploded that reconstructs itself,' Castelbajac said, likening the dissipated shards coming together to the cathedral's own rebirth. The commission was not subject to an open call. Instead, Castelbajac was handpicked by the Catholic leadership, due to his history of designing for the church. In 1997, he created the rainbow-colored robes worn by Pope John Paul II for World Youth Day in Paris, garments later enshrined in Notre Dame's treasury as a relic. That connection carried a special weight during the fire. 'As I watched the fire, I was thinking, 'Are the relics burning? Are the relics safe?' So my link was not just material. It's really a strong spiritual link,' he said. For Castelbajac, 74, the memory of those two hours in 2019 spent watching the fire with his wife amid people praying on their knees still evokes both grief and determination. 'It was not Notre Dame burning. It was hope burning. It was spirituality burning. It was such an intense moment … I was thinking, what can I do?' he said. The vestments, which will be worn in liturgies permanently — forever, as Castelbajac put it — carry a sense of continuity with his past work. The designs are a variation on the pontiff's robes, infused with Castelbajac's signature aesthetic: bright, almost childlike hues that evoke optimism. Color defines career Castelbajac's fascination with color began as a child in a military boarding school in Normandy, an experience he recalled as stifling and gray. 'It was the absolute loneliness. It was colorless,' he said. For the young boy, color became a lifeline. 'Color was like my teddy bear, my transitional element in a world of conflict. Each morning, there was the stained glass in the church and the coats of arms in the refectory that filled my world with primary colors,' he explained. This obsession would define his career, earning him a reputation as a provocateur in the fashion world. Castelbajac's creations have dressed pop culture royalty for decades: Madonna in her teddy bear coat, Beyonce in sequins, Rihanna in a Donald Duck costume. Collaborating with Andy Warhol, Keith Haring, and Jean-Michel Basquiat, he fused art and fashion into a playground of exuberance. Cathedral's vestments reflect hope While his designs have graced runways and music icons, Castelbajac's work for Notre Dame strikes a different, more personal chord. The playful vestments might raise eyebrows among traditional Catholics, but he has no doubt about the faith Notre Dame's leadership placed in him. 'Maybe I have the trust of the archbishop,' he mused, reflecting on the 'carte blanche' he said he received for his designs. This combination produced a modern-looking body of work that reflects the unity, hope, and rebirth symbolized by Notre Dame itself—just like the phoenix-like rooster gleaming like fire atop the newly constructed spire. When the cathedral reopens on the weekend of December 7-8, Castelbajac hopes the vestments will be viewed by the world as a testament to renewal and the 'power of color' to heal and inspire.	https://www.voanews.com/a/designer-describes-invitation-to-work-on-notre-dame-cathedral-s-reopening-as-a-calling-/7874311.html	2024-11-24T00:01:04-08:00	
Haiti wonders what's next as gang violence surges and UN peacekeeping mission flops	SAN JUAN, PUERTO RICO — When Kenyan police arrived in Haiti as part of a U.N.-backed mission earlier this year to tackle gang violence, hopes were high. Coordinated gang attacks on prisons, police stations and the main international airport had crippled the country's capital and forced the prime minister to resign, plunging Haiti into an unprecedented crisis. But the crisis has only deepened since the international policing contingent arrived. The main international airport closed for the second time this year after gangs opened fire on commercial flights in mid-November, striking a flight attendant. Gunmen also are attacking once-peaceful communities to try and seize control of the entire capital, taking advantage of political infighting that led to the abrupt dismissal of the prime minister earlier this month. Now, a new prime minister is tasked with turning around a nation that sees no escape from its troubles as Haitians wonder: How did the country reach this point? 'No functioning authority' Bloody coups, brutal dictatorships and gangs created by Haiti's political and economic elite have long defined the country's history, but experts say the current crisis is the worst they've seen. 'I'm very bleak about the future,' said Robert Fatton, a Haitian politics expert at the University of Virginia. 'The whole situation is really collapsing.' The government is anemic, the U.N.-backed mission that supports Haiti's understaffed police department lacks funding and personnel, and gangs now control 85% of the capital. Then, on Wednesday, another blow. Doctors Without Borders announced it was suspending critical care in Port-au-Prince as it accused police of targeting its staff and patients, including threats of rape and death. It's the first time the aid group has stopped working with new patients since it began operating in Haiti more than 30 years ago. 'Every day that we cannot resume activities is a tragedy, as we are one of the few providers of a wide range of medical services that have remained open during this extremely difficult year,' said Christophe Garnier, mission director in Haiti. Lionel Lazarre, deputy spokesperson for Haiti's National Police, did not return messages for comment. Neither did officials with Kenya's mission when asked about the surge in gang violence. In a recent statement, the Kenyan-led mission said it was 'cognizant of the road ahead that is fraught with challenges.' But it noted that ongoing joint patrols and operations have secured certain communities and forced gangs to change the way they operate. André François Giroux, Canada's ambassador to Haiti, told The Associated Press on Saturday that his country and others have been trying to bolster the Kenyan-led mission. 'They've done miracles, I think, considering all the challenges that we've been facing,' he said. 'What we have to keep in mind is that it's still very much in deployment mode,' Giroux said. 'There are not even 400 on the ground right now.' A spokesperson for Haiti's new prime minister, Alix Didier Fils-Aimé, did not return messages for comment. In a statement Thursday, his administration said authorities were strengthening security along the capital's main roads and had formed a special security council. 'The prime minister renews his commitment to find lasting solutions to current problems,' it said. The statement was issued just days after gangs launched a pre-dawn attack Tuesday around an upper-class community in Haiti's capital, forcing residents armed with machetes and guns to fight side-by-side with police to repel gunmen. At least 28 gang members were killed, but not before some reached an area near an upscale hotel long considered safe. 'It tells you that there is no functioning authority in Haiti,' Fatton said. Dwindling aid and growing isolation A main concern in the ongoing crisis is the temporary closure of the main international airport in Port-au-Prince. It means critical aid is not reaching those who need it the most in a country where nearly 6,000 people are starving and nearly half of the more than 11 million inhabitants are experiencing crisis levels of hunger or worse. Gang violence also has left more than 700,000 people homeless in recent years. 'We are deeply concerned about the isolation of Port-au-Prince from the rest of Haiti and the world,' said Laurent Uwumuremyi, Mercy Corps' country director for Haiti. The aid group helps people including more than 15,000 living in makeshift shelters, but persistent gang violence has prevented workers from reaching a growing number of them in the capital and beyond. Basic goods also are dwindling as the suspension of flights has delayed imports of critical supplies. 'Before, there were some neighborhoods in Port-au-Prince that we considered safe that the gangs had never reached, but now they are threatening to take over the control of the entire capital,' Uwumuremyi said. At least 150 people were reported killed in the capital and 20,000 forced to flee their homes in the second week of November alone. Overall, more than 4,500 people were reported killed in Haiti so far this year, the U.N. said. Jimmy Chérizier, a former elite police officer who became a gang leader known as Barbecue, warned that a gang coalition known as Viv Ansanm will keep attacking as they demand the resignation of a transitional presidential council tasked with leading the country along with the new prime minister. The council also is supposed to organize general elections for the first time in nearly a decade so voters can choose a president, a position left empty since President Jovenel Moïse was killed at his private residence in July 2021. 'What else are you left with?' The U.S. and other countries pushed for a U.N. peacekeeping mission in Haiti at a U.N. Security Council meeting this week. Only about 400 officers from Kenya have arrived, along with a handful of police and soldiers from other countries — way short of the 2,500 personnel slated for the mission. 'This is not just another wave of insecurity; it is a dramatic escalation that shows no signs of abating,' Miroslav Jenča, U.N. assistant secretary general for Europe, Central Asia and the Americas, said Wednesday at the meeting. But Russia and China oppose a U.N. peacekeeping mission, leaving many to wonder what other options are left for Haiti. Giroux, the Canadian ambassador, said his country supports a peacekeeping operation 'when the time is right.' 'Everybody is looking at a peacekeeping mission as a silver bullet,' he said, adding that even if that were to happen, it wouldn't be able to deploy for another six to 12 months. 'We need to be realistic.' Giroux said he is hopeful that some 600 Kenyans will arrive in Haiti in upcoming weeks, but added that 'none of this matters if the political elite doesn't get its act together.' The nine-member transitional presidential council has been marred by accusations of corruption and infighting and was criticized for firing the previous prime minister. 'I'm at a loss for any short-term solution for Haiti, let alone any long-term solutions,' Fatton said. 'The gangs have seen that they shouldn't be afraid of the Kenyan mission.' He said one option may be for the government to negotiate with the gangs. 'At the moment, it is perceived as utterly unacceptable,' he said. 'But if the situation deteriorates even more, what else are you left with?'	https://www.voanews.com/a/haiti-wonders-what-s-next-as-gang-violence-surges-and-un-peacekeeping-mission-flops/7874998.html	2024-11-23T23:59:25-08:00	
Iran's vast collection of Western art, much long hidden, reemerges	TEHRAN, Iran — As Iran faces increasing tensions with the West and turmoil at home, a new exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art is displaying Western artwork including pieces not seen by the public in at least a decade. The unveiling of the exhibition Eye to Eye has drawn numerous women, their hair uncovered, to the underground galleries of the museum in Tehran's Laleh Park. Their presence, while unacknowledged by authorities, shows the way life has changed inside Iran just in the last few years even as the country's theocracy presses forward with enriching uranium to near-weapons grade levels and launching attacks on Israel during the ongoing Mideast wars. 'The first feeling that came to me, and I told my parents, was that I can't believe I'm seeing these works, which have always been kept far from our eyes,' said Aida Zarrin, a young woman at the museum. 'If such events are held here and we can see artworks like the rest of the world, it's enough. They are really precious.' The government of Iran's Western-backed shah, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the former Empress Farah Pahlavi, built the museum and acquired the vast collection in the late 1970s, when oil boomed and Western economies stagnated. Upon opening, it showed sensational works by Pablo Picasso, Mark Rothko, Claude Monet, Jackson Pollock and other heavyweights, enhancing Iran's cultural standing on the world stage. But just two years later, in 1979, Shiite clerics ousted the shah and packed away the art in the museum's vault. Some paintings — cubist, surrealist, impressionist and even pop art — sat untouched for decades to avoid offending Islamic values and the appearance of catering to Western sensibilities. Nearly everything is believed still to be there, though an Andy Warhol print of the empress was slashed during the revolution. Today, the collection is likely worth billions of dollars. Even with Iran now cash-strapped under Western sanctions, officials with the museum have been able to advocate for keeping the collection, though there have been occasional trades in the past for items from Persian history. Those sanctions may increase under the next administration of U.S. President-elect Donald Trump. As Iranian politics have thawed, re-frozen and thawed again, the collection resurfaces along with those changes. Among the over 120 works being shown are ones from Picasso, Andy Warhol and Francis Bacon, along with celebrated Iranian artists. One of the Warhols, Jacqueline Kennedy II, is a silkscreen double image of the former U.S. first lady in mourning after the 1963 assassination of her husband, President John Kennedy. Another Warhol portrait of Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger also garnered attention from the cellphone photo snappers. 'A lot of these works are important works in the history of art, and that's why this show distinguishes itself from others,' said Jamal Arabzadeh, the exhibition's curator. 'A lot of people with less exposure to art have discovered the museum for the first time. ... We are seeing a part of the community that are discovering art and the museum and see the potential of this place, and this is something to be proud of.' The presence of Western art comes as Iran's government has long fought against items like Barbie dolls and depictions of cartoon characters from The Simpsons. Such Western influences have been deemed un-Islamic in the past and have been seen as part of a 'soft' cultural war against the Islamic Republic. With a ticket costing the equivalent of 14 U.S. cents, the exhibition offers a rare government-sanctioned event not involving the country's politics or Shiite religion. Among the visitors were many women defying the country's mandatory headscarf, or hijab, law. Crackdowns over the hijab have slowed down after Iran's presidential election in July that elected reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian, though individual cases of arrest continue to draw anger. And for many, the cost of tickets to travel abroad given Iran's collapsing rial currency keep foreign museums out of reach. 'This is very attractive for art enthusiasts because not everyone can go and see museums abroad. It's extremely exciting to see the works here,' said a woman who only gave her last name, Dolatshahi. 'I had no idea I could see works by van Gogh and Picasso here.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-s-vast-collection-of-western-art-much-long-hidden-reemerges-despite-high-tensions-with-us/7874989.html	2024-11-23T22:34:21-08:00	
As fast fashion's waste pollutes environment, Ghana designers find a solution	ACCRA, Ghana — In a sprawling secondhand clothing market in Ghana's capital, early morning shoppers jostle as they search through piles of garments, eager to pluck a bargain or a designer find from the stalls selling used and low-quality apparel imported from the West. At the other end of the street, an upcycled fashion and thrifting festival unfolds with glamour and glitz. Models parade along a makeshift runway in outfits that designers created out of discarded materials from the Kantamanto market, ranging from floral blouses and denim jeans to leather bags, caps and socks. The festival is called Obroni Wawu October, using a phrase that in the local Akan language means 'dead white man's clothes.' Organizers see the event as a small way to disrupt a destructive cycle that has made Western overconsumption into an environmental problem in Africa, where some of the worn-out clothes end up in waterways and garbage dumps. 'Instead of allowing (textile waste) to choke our gutters or beaches or landfills, I decided to use it to create something ... for us to use again,' said Richard Asante Palmer, one of the designers at the annual festival organized by the Or Foundation, a nonprofit that works at the intersection of environmental justice and fashion development. Ghana is one of Africa's leading importers of used clothing. It also ships some of what it gets from the United Kingdom, Canada, China and elsewhere to other West African nations, the United States and the U.K., according to the Ghana Used Clothing Dealers Association. Some of the imported clothes arrive in such poor shape, however, that vendors dispose of them to make room for the next shipments. On average, 40% of the millions of garments exported weekly to Ghana end up as waste, according to Neesha-Ann Longdon, the business manager for the Or Foundation's executive director. The clothing dealers association, in a report published earlier this year on the socioeconomic and environmental impact of the nation's secondhand clothing trade said only 5% of the items that reach Ghana in bulk are immediately thrown out because they cannot be sold or reused. In many African countries, citizens typically buy preowned clothes — as well as used cars, phones and other necessities — because they cost less than new ones. Secondhand shopping also gives them a chance to score designer goods that most people in the region can only dream of. But neither Ghana's fast-growing population of 34 million people nor its overtaxed infrastructure is equipped to absorb the amount of cast-off attire entering the country. Mounds of textile waste litter beaches across the capital, Accra, and the lagoon which serves as the main outlet through which the city's major drainage channels empty into the Gulf of Guinea. 'Fast fashion has taken over as the dominant mode of production, which is characterized here as higher volumes of lower-quality goods,' Longdon said. Jonathan Abbey, a fisherman in the area, said his nets often capture textile waste from the sea. Unsold used clothes 'aren't even burned but are thrown into the Korle Lagoon, which then goes into the sea,' Abbey said. The ease of online shopping has sped up this waste cycle, according to Andrew Brooks, a King's College London researcher and the author of Clothing Poverty: The Hidden World of Fast Fashion and Second-hand Clothes. In countries like the U.K., unwanted purchases often end up as charity donations, but clothes are sometimes stolen from street donation bins and exported to places where the consumer demand is perceived to be higher, Brooks said. Authorities rarely investigate such theft because the clothes are 'seen as low-value items,' he said. Donors, meanwhile, think their castoffs are 'going to be recycled rather than reused, or given away rather than sold, or sold in the U.K. rather than exported overseas,' Brooks said. The volume of secondhand clothing sent to Africa has led to complaints of the continent being used as a dumping ground. In 2018, Rwanda raised tariffs on such imports in defiance of U.S. pressure, citing concerns the West's refuse undermined efforts to strengthen the domestic textile industry. Last year, Ugandan President Yoweri Museveni said he would ban imports of clothing 'from dead people.' Trade restrictions might not go far in either reducing textile pollution or encouraging clothing production in Africa, where profits are low and incentives for designers are few, experts say. In the absence of adequate measures to stop the pollution, organizations like the Or Foundation are trying to make a difference by rallying young people and fashion creators to find a good use for scrapped materials. Ghana's beaches had hardly any discarded clothes on them before the country's waste management problems worsened in recent years, foundation co-founder Liz Ricketts said. 'Fast forward to today, 2024, there are mountains of textile waste on the beaches,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-fast-fashion-s-waste-pollutes-environment-ghana-designers-find-a-solution/7874987.html	2024-11-23T22:21:09-08:00	
Will a winter storm hit the US over Thanksgiving week? Here's what forecasts show	WINDSOR, CALIFORNIA — Forecasters warned over the weekend that another round of winter weather could complicate travel leading up to Thanksgiving in parts of the U.S. In California, where a person was found dead in a vehicle submerged in floodwaters on Saturday, authorities braced for more precipitation while still grappling with flooding and small landslides from a previous storm. And thousands in the Pacific Northwest remained without power after multiple days in the dark. A winter storm warning in California's Sierra Nevada on Saturday was in effect through Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service's Sacramento office, with heavy snow expected at higher elevations and wind gusts potentially reaching 88 kph. Total snowfall of roughly 1.2 meters was forecast, with the heaviest accumulations coming Monday and Tuesday. Forecasters said the Midwest and Great Lakes regions will see rain and snow Monday, and the East Coast will be the most impacted on Thanksgiving and Black Friday. A low-pressure system will bring rain to the Southeast early Thursday before heading to the Northeast, where areas from Boston to New York could see rain and strong winds. Parts of northern New Hampshire, northern Maine and the Adirondacks could get snow. If the system tracks further inland, the forecast would call for less snow for the mountains and more rain. Deadly 'bomb cyclone' on West Coast The storm on the West Coast arrived in the Pacific Northwest earlier this week, killing two people and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands, mostly in the Seattle area, before its strong winds moved through Northern California. The system roared ashore on the West Coast on Tuesday as a ' bomb cyclone,' which occurs when a cyclone intensifies rapidly. It unleashed fierce winds that toppled trees onto roads, vehicles and homes. Santa Rosa, California, saw its wettest three-day period on record with about 32 centimeters of rain falling by Friday evening, according to the National Weather Service in the Bay Area. On Saturday vineyards in Windsor, about 16 kilometers to the north, were flooded. To the west, rescue crews in Guerneville recovered a body inside a vehicle bobbing in floodwaters around 11:30 a.m. Saturday, according to Rob Dillion, a Sonoma County sheriff's deputy and spokesperson. The deceased was presumed to be a victim of the storm, but an autopsy had not yet been conducted. Dominick Conti, a 19-year-old volunteer firefighter, and a friend drove around the Santa Rosa area Friday helping people whose vehicles were swamped. With his 2006 Dodge Ram pickup truck and a set of ropes, they were able to rescue the driver of a sedan that stalled out in water, a truck stuck in a giant mudhole and a farmer stranded on a dirt road. Tens of thousands remain without power in Seattle area Some 80,000 people in the Seattle area were still without electricity after this season's strongest atmospheric river — a long plume of moisture that forms over an ocean and flows over land. Crews worked to clear streets of downed lines, branches and other debris, while cities opened warming centers so people heading into their fourth day without power could get warm food and plug in their cellphones and other devices. The power came back in the afternoon at Katie Skipper's home in North Bend, about 50 kilometers east of the city in the foothills of the Cascades, after being out since Tuesday. It was tiring to take cold showers, rely on a wood stove for warmth and use a generator to keep the refrigerator cold, Skipper said, but those inconveniences paled in comparison to the damage other people suffered, such as from fallen trees. 'That's really sad and scary,' she said. Northeast gets much-needed precipitation Another storm brought rain to New York and New Jersey, where rare wildfires have raged in recent weeks, and heavy snow to northeastern Pennsylvania. Parts of West Virginia were under a blizzard warning through Saturday morning, with up to 61 centimeters of snow and high winds making travel treacherous. Despite the mess, the precipitation was expected to help ease drought conditions after an exceptionally dry fall. 'It's not going to be a drought buster, but it's definitely going to help when all this melts,' said Bryan Greenblatt, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Binghamton, New York. Heavy snow fell in northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Pocono Mountains. Higher elevations reported up to 43 centimeters, with lesser accumulations in valley cities like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. Fewer than 80,000 customers in 10 counties lost power, and the state transportation department-imposed speed restrictions on some highways. Parts of West Virginia also experienced their first significant snowfall of the season Friday and overnight Saturday, with up to 25.4 centimeters in the higher elevations of the Allegheny Mountains. Some areas were under a blizzard warning. The precipitation helped put a dent in the state's worst drought in at least two decades. It also was a boost for West Virginia ski resorts preparing to open their slopes in the weeks ahead.	https://www.voanews.com/a/will-a-winter-storm-hit-the-us-over-thanksgiving-week-here-s-what-forecasts-show/7874985.html	2024-11-23T22:02:40-08:00	
People on breathing machines struggle without power after weather disasters	HOUSTON — Kimberly Rubit had one priority in mind as Hurricane Beryl ripped through Houston this summer: her severely disabled daughter. The 63-year-old worked nonstop to prevent Mary, 42, from overheating without air conditioning, water or lights after Beryl knocked out power to their home for 10 days. At least three dozen other people suffered heat-related deaths during the extended outage. 'It was miserable,' Rubit said. 'I'm sick of it.' Electric grids have buckled more frequently and outages have become longer across the U.S. as the warming atmosphere carries more water and stirs up more destructive storms, according to an AP analysis of government data. In the Pacific Northwest this week, a 'bomb cyclone' caused roughly half a million outages. People with disabilities and chronic health conditions are particularly at risk when the power goes out, and many live in homes that lack the weatherizing and backup power supplies needed to better handle high temperatures and cold freezes, or can't pay their electricity bills, said Columbia University sociomedical sciences professor Diana Hernandez, who studies energy instability in U.S. homes. At any given time, 1 in 3 households in the U.S. is 'actively trying to avoid a disconnection or contending with the aftermath of it,' Hernandez said. In Texas, as another winter approaches, people can't shake fears of another blackout like the one during a cold freeze in 2021 that left millions without power for days and killed more than 200 people. Despite efforts to create more resilience, a winter storm that powerful could still lead to rolling blackouts, according to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which manages most of the state's power grid. Beryl also knocked out power to millions for days, sickening many in the sweltering July heat. Local and state officials showered criticism on CenterPoint Energy, Houston's power utility, saying it should have communicated more clearly, taken more preventive measures such as tree trimming before the storm hit and repaired downed power lines more quickly. The utility's response remains under investigation by the Texas attorney general. CenterPoint says it is focused now on improving resiliency, customer communications and community partnerships with the one defining goal: 'to build the most resilient coastal grid in the country that can better withstand the extreme weather of the future.' Texas lawmakers, meanwhile, are debating whether assisted living facilities need more regulation. One suggestion: requiring them to have enough emergency generator fuel to power lifesaving equipment and keep indoor temperatures safe during an extended blackout, as Florida did after a scandal over hurricane-related nursing home deaths. The legislative panel also reviewed emergency responses this month. Regulated facilities and nursing centers fared better than places such as senior communities that aren't subject to strict oversight, according to city and state officials. This meant hundreds of apartment complexes catering to older adults, as well as private homes, were likely more susceptible to losing power and going without food. 'We've got to find a way to mark these facilities or get it entered into the computer dispatch systems,' said Nim Kidd, chief of the Texas Division of Emergency Management. 'There are so many places in our own city that we have no idea until that 911 call comes into that facility,' he said. Texas energy companies have been required since 2003 to provide advance notice of scheduled outages to medically vulnerable households that submit a form with physician approval. But that law didn't require the utilities to share these lists with state or local emergency management agencies. Numerous states have similar regulatory requirements and 38 have policies aimed at preventing disconnections during extreme weather, according to the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program. In Colorado, medically vulnerable residents are protected from disconnection for up to 90 days. In Arkansas, utilities can't disconnect power to people who are 65 or older if temperatures are forecast to reach above 34 degrees Celsius. In Houston, Rubit and her daughter share one of the roughly 3,000 households where unreliable power can quickly spiral into a life-and-death issue because at least one person requires a medical device powered by electricity, according to public filings from CenterPoint. The utility offers such households payment plans to keep the electricity on when they fall behind on their bills. The utility's efforts bring little solace to community members at a Houston living center for seniors, Commons of Grace, where outages have become a haunting facet of life for more than 100 residents, said Belinda Taylor, who runs a nonprofit partnered with the managing company. 'I'm just frustrated that we didn't get the services that we needed,' Taylor said. 'It's ridiculous that we have had to suffer.' Sharon Burks, who lives at Commons of Grace, said it became unbearable when the power went out. She is 63 and uses a breathing machine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which causes shortness of breath. She had to resort to her battery-powered breathing pump, which isn't meant to be used for long periods. 'I didn't expect anything from CenterPoint,' Burks said. 'We're always the last to get it.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/people-on-breathing-machines-struggle-without-power-after-weather-disasters/7874983.html	2024-11-23T21:41:01-08:00	
Japan holds Sado mines memorial despite South Korean boycott	SADO, Japan — Japan held a memorial ceremony on Sunday near the Sado Island Gold Mines despite a last-minute boycott of the event by South Korea that highlighted tensions between the neighbors over the issue of Korean forced laborers at the site before and during World War II. South Korea's absence at Sunday's memorial, to which Seoul government officials and Korean victims' families were invited, is a major setback in the rapidly improving ties between the two countries, which since last year have set aside their historical disputes to prioritize U.S.-led security cooperation. The Sado mines were listed in July as a UNESCO World Heritage site after Japan moved past years of disputes with South Korea and reluctantly acknowledged the mines' dark history, promising to hold an annual memorial service for all victims, including hundreds of Koreans who were mobilized to work in the mines. On Saturday, South Korea announced it would not attend the event, saying it was impossible to settle unspecified disagreements between the two governments in time. Families of Korean victims of the mine accidents were expected to separately hold their own ceremony near the mine at a later date. Masashi Mizobuchi, an assistant press secretary in Japan's Foreign Ministry, said Japan has been in communication with Seoul and called the South Korean decision 'disappointing.' The ceremony was held as planned on Sunday at a facility near the mines, where more than 20 seats for Korean attendees remained vacant. The 16th century mines on the island of Sado, off Japan's north-central coast, operated for nearly 400 years before closing in 1989 and were once the world's largest gold producer. Historians say about 1,500 Koreans were mobilized to Sado as part of Japan's use of hundreds of thousands of Korean laborers, including those forcibly brought from the Korean Peninsula, at Japanese mines and factories to make up for labor shortages because most working-age Japanese men had been sent to battlefronts across Asia and the Pacific. Japan's government has maintained that all wartime compensation issues between the two countries were resolved under a 1965 normalization treaty. South Korea had long opposed the listing of the site as World Heritage on the grounds that the Korean forced laborers, despite their key role in the wartime mine production, were missing from the exhibition. Seoul's backing for Sado came as South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol prioritized improving relations with Japan. The Japanese government said Sunday's ceremony was to pay tribute to 'all workers' who died at the mines but would not spell out inclusion of Korean laborers — part of what critics call a persistent policy of whitewashing Japan's history of sexual and labor exploitation before and during the war. Preparation for the event by local organizers remained unclear until the last minute, which was seen as a sign of Japan's reluctance to face its wartime brutality. Japan's government said on Friday that Akiko Ikuina — a parliamentary vice minister who reportedly visited Tokyo's controversial Yasukuni Shrine in August 2022, weeks after she was elected as a lawmaker — would attend the ceremony. Japan's neighbors view Yasukuni, which commemorates 2.5 million war dead including war criminals, as a symbol of Japan's past militarism. Ikuina belonged to a Japanese ruling party faction of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, who led the whitewashing of Japan's wartime atrocities in the 2010s during his leadership. For instance, Japan says the terms 'sex slavery' and 'forced labor' are inaccurate and insists on the use of highly euphemistic terms such as 'comfort women' and 'civilian workers' instead. South Korean Foreign Minister Cho Tae-yul said Saturday that Ikuina's Yasukuni visit was an issue of contention between the countries' diplomats. 'That issue and various other disagreements between diplomatic officials remain unresolved, and with only a few hours remaining until the event, we concluded that there wasn't sufficient time to resolve these differences,' Cho said in an interview with MBN television. Some South Koreans had criticized Yoon's government for supporting the event without securing a clear Japanese commitment to highlight the plight of Korean laborers. There were also complaints over South Korea agreeing to pay for the travel expenses of Korean victims' family members to Sado.	https://www.voanews.com/a/japan-holds-sado-mines-memorial-despite-south-korean-boycott/7874982.html	2024-11-23T21:21:06-08:00	
Philippine vice president publicly threatens to have the president assassinated	MANILA, Philippines — Philippine Vice President Sara Duterte said Saturday she has contracted an assassin to kill the president, his wife and the House of Representatives speaker if she herself is killed, in a brazen public threat that she warned was not a joke. Executive Secretary Lucas Bersamin referred the 'active threat' against President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. to an elite presidential guards force 'for immediate proper action.' It was not immediately clear what actions would be taken against the vice president. The Presidential Security Command boosted Marcos' security and said it considered the vice president's threat, which was 'made so brazenly in public,' a national security issue. The presidential security force said it was 'coordinating with law enforcement agencies to detect, deter, and defend against any and all threats to the president and the first family.' Duterte, a lawyer, later tried to walk back her remarks and said they were not an actual threat but only an expression of concern over an unspecified threat to her own life. 'If I expressed the concern, they will say that's a threat to the life of the president?' she said. 'Why would I kill him if not for revenge from the grave? There is no reason for me to kill him. What's the benefit for me?' Duterte told journalists. Under the Philippine penal code, such public remarks may constitute a crime of threatening to inflict a wrong on a person or his family and is punishable by a jail term and fine. The Philippine Constitution says that if a president dies, sustains a permanent disability, is removed from office or resigns, the vice president takes over and serves the rest of the term. Marcos ran with Duterte as his vice-presidential running mate in the May 2022 elections and both won with landslide victories on a campaign call of national unity. The two leaders and their camps, however, rapidly had a bitter falling-out over key differences, including in their approaches to China's aggressive actions in the disputed South China Sea. Duterte resigned from the Marcos Cabinet in June as education secretary and head of an anti-insurgency body. Like her equally outspoken father, former President Rodrigo Duterte, the vice president became a vocal critic of Marcos, his wife Liza Araneta-Marcos and House Speaker Martin Romualdez, the president's ally and cousin, accusing them of corruption, incompetence and politically persecuting the Duterte family and its close supporters. Her latest tirade was set off by the decision by House members allied with Romualdez and Marcos to detain her chief of staff, Zuleika Lopez, who was accused of hampering a congressional inquiry into the possible misuse of her budget as vice president and education secretary. Lopez was later transferred to a hospital after falling ill and wept when she heard of a plan to temporarily lock her up in a women's prison. In a pre-dawn online news conference, an angry Sara Duterte accused Marcos of incompetence as a president and of being a liar, along with his wife and the House speaker in expletives-laden remarks. When asked about concerns over her security, the 46-year-old suggested there was an unspecified plot to kill her. 'Don't worry about my security because I've talked with somebody. I said, 'If I'm killed, you'll kill BBM, Liza Araneta and Martin Romualdez. No joke, no joke,'' the vice president said without elaborating and using the initials that many use to call the president. 'I've given my order, 'If I die, don't stop until you've killed them.' And he said, 'Yes,'' the vice president said. Amid the political divisions, military chief Gen. Romeo Brawner issued a statement with an assurance that the 160,000-member Armed Forces of the Philippines would remain nonpartisan 'with utmost respect for our democratic institutions and civilian authority.' 'We call for calm and resolve,' Brawner said. 'We reiterate our need to stand together against those who will try to break our bonds as Filipinos.' The vice president is the daughter of Marcos' predecessor, Rodrigo Duterte, whose police-enforced anti-drugs crackdown when he was a city mayor and later as president left thousands of mostly petty drug suspects dead in killings that the International Criminal Court has been investigating as a possible crime against humanity. The former president denied authorizing extrajudicial killings under his crackdown but has given conflicting statements. He told a public Philippine Senate inquiry last month that he had maintained a 'death squad' of gangsters to kill other criminals when he was mayor of southern Davao city.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippine-vice-president-publicly-threatens-to-have-the-president-assassinated/7874981.html	2024-11-23T21:01:15-08:00	
Gunman shot dead in shooting near Israeli Embassy in Jordan	AMMAN, JORDAN — A gunman was dead and three policemen injured after a shooting near the Israeli Embassy in neighboring Jordan, a security source and state media said Sunday. Police shot a gunman who had fired at a police patrol in the Rabiah neighborhood of Amman, state news agency Petra reported, citing public security, adding investigations were ongoing. Jordanian police had earlier cordoned off an area near the heavily policed embassy after gunshots were heard, witnesses said. Two witnesses said police and ambulances rushed to the Rabiah neighborhood, where the embassy is located. The area is a flashpoint for frequent demonstrations against Israel. The kingdom has witnessed some of the biggest peaceful rallies across the region as anti-Israel sentiment runs high over the war in Gaza. Police had called on residents to stay in their homes as security personnel searched for the culprits, a security source said. Many of Jordan’s 12 million citizens are of Palestinian origin, they or their parents having been expelled or fled to Jordan in the fighting that accompanied the creation of Israel in 1948. Many have family ties on the Israeli side of the Jordan River. Jordan's peace treaty with Israel is unpopular among many citizens who see normalization of relations as betraying the rights of their Palestinian compatriots.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunman-shot-dead-in-shooting-near-israeli-embassy-in-jordan/7874971.html	2024-11-23T19:12:27-08:00	
Has a waltz written by composer Frederic Chopin been discovered in an NYC museum?	NEW YORK — The brooding waltz was carefully composed on a sheet of music roughly the size of an index card. The brief, moody number also bore an intriguing name, written at the top in cursive: 'Chopin.' A previously unknown work of music penned by the European master Frederic Chopin appears to have been found at the Morgan Library & Museum in Manhattan. The untitled and unsigned piece is on display this month at the opulently appointed institution, which had once been the private library of financier J. P. Morgan. Robinson McClellan, the museum curator who uncovered the manuscript, said it's the first new work associated with the Romantic era composer to be discovered in nearly a century. But McClellan concedes that it may never be known whether it is an original Chopin work or merely one written in his hand. The piece, set in the key of A minor, stands out for its 'very stormy, brooding opening section' before transitioning to a melancholy melody more characteristic of Chopin, McClellan explained. 'This is his style. This is his essence,' he said during a recent visit to the museum. 'It really feels like him.' Curator finds composition in collection McClellan said he came across the work in May as he was going through a collection from the late Arthur Satz, a former president of the New York School of Interior Design. Satz had acquired it from A. Sherrill Whiton Jr., an avid autograph collector who had been director of the school. McClellan then worked with experts to verify its authenticity. The paper was found to be consistent with what Chopin favored for manuscripts, and the ink matched a kind typical in the early 19th century when Chopin lived, according to the museum. But a handwriting analysis determined the name 'Chopin' written at the top of the sheet was penned by someone else. Born in Poland, Chopin was considered a musical genius from an early age. He lived in Warsaw and Vienna before settling in Paris, where he died in 1849 at the age of 39, likely of tuberculosis. He's buried among a pantheon of artists at the city's famed Pere Lachaise Cemetery, but his heart, pickled in a jar of alcohol, is housed in a church in Warsaw, in keeping with his deathbed wish for the organ to return to his homeland. Artur Szklener, director of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute in Warsaw, the Polish capital city where the composer grew up, agreed that the document is consistent with the kinds of ink and paper Chopin used during his early years in Paris. Chopin expert calls piece 'little gem' Musically, the piece evokes the 'brilliant style' that made Chopin a luminary in his time, but it also has features unusual for his compositions, Szklener said. 'First of all, it is not a complete work, but rather a certain musical gesture, a theme laced with rather simple piano tricks alluding to a virtuoso style,' Szklener explained in a lengthy statement released after the document was revealed last month. He and other experts conjecture the piece could have been a work in progress. It may have also been a copy of another's work, or even co-written with someone else, perhaps a student for a musical exercise. Jeffrey Kallberg, a University of Pennsylvania music professor and Chopin expert who helped authenticate the document, called the piece a 'little gem' that Chopin likely intended as a gift for a friend or wealthy acquaintance. 'Many of the pieces that he gave as gifts were short – kind of like 'appetizers' to a full-blown work,' Kallberg said in an email. 'And we don't know for sure whether he intended the piece to see the light of day because he often wrote out the same waltz more than once as a gift.' David Ludwig, dean of music at The Juilliard School, a performing arts conservatory in Manhattan, agreed the piece has many of the hallmarks of the composer's style. 'It has the Chopin character of something very lyrical and it has a little bit of darkness as well,' said Ludwig, who was not involved in authenticating the document. But Ludwig noted that, if it's authentic, the tightly composed score would be one of Chopin's shortest known pieces. The waltz clocks in at under a minute long when played on piano, as many of Chopin's works were intended. 'In terms of the authenticity of it, in a way it doesn't matter because it sparks our imaginations,' Ludwig said. 'A discovery like this highlights the fact that classical music is very much a living art form.' The Chopin reveal comes after the Leipzig Municipal Libraries in Germany announced in September that it had uncovered a previously unknown piece likely composed by a young Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in its collections.	https://www.voanews.com/a/has-a-waltz-written-by-composer-frederic-chopin-been-discovered-in-an-nyc-museum-/7871701.html	2024-11-23T18:33:54-08:00	
Canada apologizes to Inuit communities for mass killing of sled dogs decades ago	The government of Canada on Saturday apologized to the Inuit of northern Quebec for the mass killing of sled dogs in the 1950s and 1960s, which devastated communities by depriving them of the ability to hunt and travel. Federal Minister of Crown-Indigenous Relations Gary Anandasangaree traveled to Kangiqsujuaq in the Nunavik region to deliver the apology and promised C$45 million ($32.19 million) in compensation. It follows another government apology in 2019 to the Inuit of the Qikiqtani region, which includes Baffin Island, for the effects of traumatic federal policies including family separation and the slaughter of sled dogs, known as qimmiit. 'Today, the Government of Canada accepted responsibility for its role in a terrible historic injustice and expressed its deep regret and sincere apology for the harms inflicted by the slaughter of qimmiit in Nunavik,' Anandasangaree said. Thousands of sled dogs were shot by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) and other authorities in Inuit settlements from the mid-1950s onwards, said Pita Aatami, president of Makivvik, the organization representing Quebec's Inuit. Sled dog teams were an integral part of Inuit culture and hunting traditions, providing quick travel across the vast frozen landscapes of Canada's far north. They were also instrumental in the hunting of seals and caribou. The unjustified killing of the sled dogs led to food and economic insecurity for the Nunavik Inuit and the loss of traditional ways of accessing land, and caused deep and lasting emotional wounds, the government said in a statement. 'Their independence was taken away, they could not go out on the land anymore and there was no means of hunting,' Aatami told Reuters in a phone interview, adding the apology and compensation are long overdue. 'It's been an intergenerational trauma and has taken 25 years of my life to get here,' he said. The RCMP launched an internal investigation into the slaughter of sled dogs in 2006 and cleared themselves of any wrongdoing, stating that the killings were done in the interest of public safety. But Aatami and other Inuit leaders say the dogs were shot to keep the largely nomadic Inuit in settled communities, and they compared the killings to other major impacts of colonization including the relocation of families in other parts of Canada and being forced to send children to residential schools. In 2011 the Quebec Government apologized for the dog slaughter that took place in Nunavik by police and government in the 1950s and 1960s.	https://www.voanews.com/a/canada-apologizes-to-inuit-communities-for-mass-killing-of-sled-dogs-decades-ago/7874957.html	2024-11-23T18:06:30-08:00	
Hard right's Simion in with a chance as Romanians vote for president	BUCHAREST — Romanians vote on Sunday in the first round of a presidential election that may give a shot at victory to hard-right politician George Simion, who opposes military aid to Ukraine, admires Donald Trump and wants to emulate Giorgia Meloni's Italy. Outgoing two-term president Klaus Iohannis, 65, had cemented Romania's strong pro-western stance but was accused of not doing enough to fight corruption. Voting starts at 0500 GMT and ends at 1900 GMT with exit polls to follow immediately. The second round is scheduled for December 8 while a parliamentary election is also due next Sunday. Voting by Romanians abroad, who can influence the result and where Simion is popular, began on Friday. Simion voted in Rome. Opinion surveys show leftist Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, 56, leader of Romania's largest party, the Social Democrats, will make it into the run-off vote with Simion, 38, of the Alliance for Uniting Romanians the likely runner-up. Analysts expect Ciolacu to win the second round against Simion, appealing to moderates and touting his experience running Romania during a war next door, but do not rule out a switch-up amid frustration with the high cost of living. They also say the prospects of a Ciolacu-Simion run-off vote could mobilize center-right voters in favor of Elena Lasconi, leader of center-right opposition Save Romania Union. Simion has cast the election as a choice between an entrenched political class beholden to foreign interests in Brussels and himself, an outsider who will defend Romania's economy and sovereignty. Romania has the EU's largest share of people at risk of poverty. 'We take as a model the right-wing government formed in Italy,' Simion told foreign media earlier this week. Since Russia attacked Ukraine in 2022, Romania has enabled the export of millions of tons of grain through its Black Sea port of Constanta and provided military aid, including the donation of a Patriot air defense battery. 'Romania has been for Ukraine unconditionally and it will remain so,' Ciolacu told television channel Antena3. Senate speaker Nicolae Ciuca, leader of the Liberal Party that is currently in a strained ruling coalition with Ciolacu's party was trailing behind Lasconi, surveys showed. 'The outcome is still very difficult to predict due to the high concentration of candidates and the splitting of the center-right vote,' said Sergiu Miscoiu, a political science professor at Babes-Bolyai University. Most candidates, he said, have campaigned on conservative messages such as protecting family values. 'Mainstream party candidates have a very catch-all message, on the one hand the nation, the army, religion and so on. On the other hand, we see a commitment to Europe, although it is seen more as a revenue source than an inspiration for values.' Romania's president, limited to two five-year terms, has a semi-executive role which includes heading the armed forces and chairing the supreme defense council that decides on military aid. The president represents the country at EU and NATO summits and appoints the prime minister, chief judges, prosecutors and secret service heads.	https://www.voanews.com/a/hard-right-s-simion-in-with-a-chance-as-romanians-vote-for-president/7874956.html	2024-11-23T17:50:22-08:00	
Nations at UN climate talks agree on $300B a year for poor countries	BAKU, AZERBAIJAN — United Nations climate talks adopted a deal to inject at least $300 billion annually in humanity’s fight against climate change, aimed at helping poor nations cope with the ravages of global warming in tense negotiations in the city where industry first tapped oil. The $300 billion will go to developing countries who need the cash to wean themselves off the coal, oil and gas that causes the globe to overheat, adapt to future warming, and pay for the damage caused by climate change’s extreme weather. It’s not near the full amount of $1.3 trillion that developing countries were asking for, but it’s three times a deal of $100 billion a year from 2009 that is expiring. Some delegations said this deal is headed in the right direction, with hopes that more money flows in the future. It was not quite the agreement by consensus that these meetings usually operate with and developing nations were livid about being ignored. COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev gaveled the deal into acceptance before any nation had a chance to speak. When they did, they blasted him for being unfair to them, the deal for not being enough, and the world's rich nations for being too stingy. 'It’s a paltry sum,' India negotiator Chandni Raina said, repeatedly saying how India objected to rousing cheers. 'I’m sorry to say we cannot accept it.' She told The Associated Press that she has lost faith in the United Nations system. Nations express discontent A long line of nations agreed with India and piled on, with Nigeria's Nkiruka Maduekwe, CEO of the National Council on Climate Change, calling the deal an insult and a joke. 'I’m disappointed. It’s definitely below the benchmark that we have been fighting for for so long,' said Juan Carlos Monterrey, of the Panama delegation. He noted that a few changes, including the inclusion of the words 'at least' before the number $300 billion and an opportunity for revision by 2030, helped push them to the finish line. 'Our heart goes out to all those nations that feel like they were walked over,' he said. The final package pushed through 'does not speak or reflect or inspire confidence and trust that we will come out of this grave problem of climate change,' India's Raina said. 'We absolutely object to the unfair means followed for adoption,' Raina said. 'We are extremely hurt by this action by the president and the secretariat.' Speaking for nearly 50 of the poorest nations of the world, Evans Davie Njewa of Malawi was more mild, expressing what he called reservations with the deal. U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said in a post on X that he hoped for a 'more ambitious outcome.' But he said the agreement 'provides a base on which to build.' Some see deal as relief There were somewhat satisfied parties, with European Union's Wopke Hoekstra calling it a new era of climate funding, working hard to help the most vulnerable. But activists in the plenary hall could be heard coughing over Hoekstra's speech in an attempt to disrupt it. Eamon Ryan, Ireland’s environment minister, called the agreement 'a huge relief.' 'It was not certain. This was tough,' he said. 'Because it’s a time of division, of war, of (a) multilateral system having real difficulties, the fact that we could get it through in these difficult circumstances is really important.' U.N. Climate Change's Executive Secretary Simon Stiell called the deal an 'insurance policy for humanity,' adding that like insurance, 'it only works if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.' The deal is seen as a step toward helping countries on the receiving end create more ambitious targets to limit or cut emissions of heat-trapping gases that are due early next year. It’s part of the plan to keep cutting pollution with new targets every five years, which the world agreed to at the U.N. talks in Paris in 2015. The Paris agreement set the system of regular ratcheting up climate fighting ambition as away to keep warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above pre-industrial levels. The world is already at 1.3 degrees Celsius (2.3 degrees Fahrenheit) and carbon emissions keep rising. Hope more cash will follow Countries also anticipate that this deal will send signals that help drive funding from other sources, like multilateral development banks and private sources. That was always part of the discussion at these talks — rich countries didn’t think it was realistic to only rely on public funding sources — but poor countries worried that if the money came in loans instead of grants, it would send them sliding further backward into debt that they already struggle with. 'The $300 billion goal is not enough, but is an important down payment toward a safer, more equitable future,' said World Resources Institute President Ani Dasgupta. 'This deal gets us off the starting block. Now the race is on to raise much more climate finance from a range of public and private sources, putting the whole financial system to work behind developing countries’ transitions.' And even though it's far from the needed $1.3 trillion, it's more than the $250 billion that was on the table in an earlier draft of the text, which outraged many countries and led to a period of frustration and stalling over the final hours of the summit. Other deals agreed at COP29 The several different texts adopted early Sunday morning included a vague but not specific reference to last year's Global Stocktake approved in Dubai. Last year there was a battle about first-of-its-kind language on getting rid of the oil, coal and natural gas, but instead it called for a transition away from fossil fuels. The latest talks only referred to the Dubai deal, but did not explicitly repeat the call for a transition away from fossil fuels. Countries also agreed on the adoption of Article 6, creating markets to trade carbon pollution rights, an idea that was set up as part of the Paris Agreement to help nations work together to reduce climate-causing pollution. Part of that was a system of carbon credits, allowing nations to put planet-warming gasses in the air if they offset emissions elsewhere. Backers said a U.N.-backed market could generate up to an additional $250 billion a year in climate financial aid. Despite its approval, carbon markets remain a contentious plan because many experts say the new rules adopted don’t prevent misuse, don’t work and give big polluters an excuse to continue spewing emissions. 'What they’ve done essentially is undermine the mandate to try to reach 1.5,' said Tamara Gilbertson, climate justice program coordinator with the Indigenous Environmental Network. Greenpeace’s An Lambrechts, called it a 'climate scam' with many loopholes. With this deal wrapped up as crews dismantle the temporary venue, many have eyes on next year’s climate talks in Belem, Brazil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nations-at-un-climate-talks-agree-on-300b-a-year-for-poor-countries-in-a-compromise-deal/7874947.html	2024-11-23T16:49:14-08:00	
Sectarian clashes claim nearly 80 lives in Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Officials in northwestern Pakistan reported on Saturday that a government delegation has begun efforts to negotiate a ceasefire between rival Sunni and Shiite Muslim tribes following armed clashes that resulted in nearly 80 deaths this week. The sectarian conflict in Kurram district, which borders Afghanistan, flared up Thursday when heavily armed men from the Sunni tribe ambushed multiple passenger vehicles and killed at least 45 Shi'ites, including men, women, and children. On Friday, Shi'ite community members conducted revenge attacks against the Sunni-dominated village where the ambush had taken place, killing at least 33 people and wounding dozens of others. The attackers set petrol stations on fire and damaged markets as well as homes. A spokesman for the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Kurram is located, announced Saturday that a high-powered government delegation had flown into the turbulent district center, Parachinar, and met with Shi'ite community leaders there. Muhammad Ali Saif said in a late-night video statement that the meetings were 'positive' and efforts were being made to 'resolve all disputes amicably to end the tension.' He added that the delegation plans to talk with Sunni community leaders in the next stage. 'Our top priority is to broker a cease-fire and establish a lasting peace in the district,' said Saif, also part of the government delegation. The Pakistani border district is known for deadly Shi'ite-Sunni sectarian violence, which stems from long-running land disputes. A land dispute sparked weeks of clashes in Kurram earlier this year, killing more than 100 people between August and October this year. The fighting had compelled provincial authorities to halt all traffic to and from the district until earlier this month when tribal elders brokered a temporary cease-fire between the opposing factions. Violence stops traffic This week's clashes have once again halted traffic on the sole road connecting the district — which has a population of approximately 800,000 — to the provincial capital of Peshawar. The violence in Kurram comes amid a marked increase in militant attacks against Pakistani security forces in multiple districts near or along the Afghan border. Officials say the violence this month in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southwestern Balochistan province, which borders Afghanistan, has resulted in the deaths of dozens of security personnel, including troops.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sectarian-clashes-claim-nearly-80-lives-in-pakistan/7874765.html	2024-11-23T15:11:24-08:00	
Trump picks Brooke Rollins to be agriculture secretary	WASHINGTON — U.S. President-elect Donald Trump has chosen Brooke Rollins, president of the America First Policy Institute, to be agriculture secretary. 'As our next Secretary of Agriculture, Brooke will spearhead the effort to protect American Farmers, who are truly the backbone of our Country,' Trump said in a statement. If confirmed by the Senate, Rollins would lead a 100,000-person agency with offices in every county in the country, whose scope includes farm and nutrition programs, forestry, home and farm lending, food safety, rural development, agricultural research, trade and more. It had a budget of $437.2 billion in 2024. The nominee's agenda would carry implications for American diets and wallets, both urban and rural. Department of Agriculture officials and staff negotiate trade deals, guide dietary recommendations, inspect meat, fight wildfires and support rural broadband, among other activities. 'Brooke's commitment to support the American Farmer, defense of American Food Self-Sufficiency, and the restoration of Agriculture-dependent American Small Towns is second to none,' Trump said in the statement. The America First Policy Institute is a right-leaning think tank whose personnel have worked closely with Trump's campaign to help shape policy for his incoming administration. She chaired the Domestic Policy Council during Trump's first term. As agriculture secretary, Rollins would advise the administration on how and whether to implement clean fuel tax credits for biofuels at a time when the sector is hoping to grow through the production of sustainable aviation fuel. The nominee would also guide next year's renegotiation of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade deal, in the shadow of disputes over Mexico's attempt to bar imports of genetically modified corn and Canada's dairy import quotas. Trump has said he again plans to institute sweeping tariffs that are likely to affect the farm sector. He was considering offering the role to former U.S. Senator Kelly Loeffler, a staunch ally whom he chose to co-chair his inaugural committee, CNN reported on Friday.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-picks-brooke-rollins-to-be-agriculture-secretary-/7874762.html	2024-11-23T14:46:27-08:00	
Islamic State figure arrested in Iraqi Kurdistan	Iraqi national security officials on Saturday said they arrested the top-ranking Islamic State figure in Iraqi Kurdistan. Azad Shakhi, the so-called emir of the Kurdistan faction of Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIS or ISIL, was detained in Kirkuk province alongside six other suspected terrorists, one of whom blew himself up amid the siege on their hideout. 'The detainees were working underground and were found and arrested after a thorough investigation and gathering information,' Colonel Salam Abdulkhaliq, spokesman for the Kurdistan Regional Security Agency, told VOA's Kurdish Service. Regional security officials with knowledge of the investigation said the group had been planning to target security figures and government institutions, according to regional news outlets. 'The ISIS network that was arrested had links to the ISIS in Karadag and other parts of the region, they have committed terrorist acts in the past,' a senior security source in Kirkuk, who did not want to be named, told VOA. The source also said other members of the Kirkuk sleeper cell had been detained in recent days, and that 'another group of ISIS fighters were killed in an air strike in Rashad district of western Kirkuk last night.' Officials said Shakhi, a resident of the Latif area of Shorjay village in Kirkuk, had previously been listed as an active member of ISIS. This story originated in VOA's Kurdish Service.	https://www.voanews.com/a/islamic-state-figure-arrested-in-iraqi-kurdistan/7874742.html	2024-11-23T14:12:40-08:00	
What to know about Scott Turner, Trump's pick for housing secretary	Scott Turner, President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development, is a former NFL player who ran the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump’s first term. Turner, 52, is the first Black person selected to be a member of the Republican's Cabinet. Here are some things to know about him: From professional football to politics Turner grew up in a Dallas suburb, Richardson, and graduated from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. He was a defensive back and spent nine seasons in the NFL beginning in 1995, playing for the Washington Redskins, San Diego Chargers and Denver Broncos. During offseasons, he worked as an intern for then-Representative Duncan Hunter, a Republican from California. After Turner retired in 2004, he worked full time for the congressman. In 2006, Turner ran unsuccessfully as a Republican in California’s 50th Congressional District. Turner joined the Texas House in 2013 as part of a large crop of tea party-supported lawmakers. He tried unsuccessfully to become speaker before he finished his second term in 2016. He did not seek a third term. Motivational speaker and pastor Turner also worked for a software company in a position called 'chief inspiration officer' and said he acted as a professional mentor, pastor and councilor for the employees and executive team. He has also been a motivational speaker. He and his wife, Robin Turner, founded a nonprofit promoting initiatives to improve childhood literacy. His church, Prestonwood Baptist Church, lists him as an associate pastor. He is also chair of the center for education opportunity at America First Policy Institute, a think tank set up by former Trump administration staffers to lay the groundwork if he won a second term. Headed council in Trump's first term Trump introduced Turner in April 2019 as the head of the new White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. Trump credited Turner with 'helping to lead an Unprecedented Effort that Transformed our Country’s most distressed communities.' The mission of the council was to coordinate with various federal agencies to attract investment to so-called 'Opportunity Zones,' which were economically depressed areas eligible to be used for the federal tax incentives. Role of HUD The Housing and Urban Development Department is responsible for addressing the nation’s housing needs. It also is charged with fair housing laws and oversees housing for the poorest Americans, sheltering more than 4.3 million low-income families through public housing, rental subsidy and voucher programs. The agency, with a budget of tens of billions of dollars, runs a multitude of programs that cover a range of responsibilities, from reducing homelessness to promoting homeownership. It also finances the construction of affordable housing and provides vouchers that allow low-income families to pay for housing in the private market. During the campaign, Trump focused mostly on the prices of housing, not public housing. He railed against the high cost of housing and said he could make it more affordable by cracking down on illegal immigration and reducing inflation. Trump also said he would work to reduce regulations on home construction and make some federal land available for residential construction.	https://www.voanews.com/a/7874660.html	2024-11-23T10:15:28-08:00	
UN talks in disarray as developing nations reject climate cash rough draft	BAKU, AZERBAIJAN — As nerves frayed and the clock ticked, negotiators from rich and poor nations were huddled in one room Saturday during overtime United Nations climate talks to try to hash out an elusive deal on money for developing countries to curb and adapt to climate change. But the rough draft of a proposal circulating in that room was getting soundly rejected, especially by African nations and small island states, according to messages relayed from inside. Then a group of negotiators from the Least Developed Countries bloc and the Alliance of Small Island States walked out because they didn't want to engage with the rough draft. The 'current deal is unacceptable for us. We need to speak to other developing countries and decide what to do,' said Evans Njewa, chair of the LDC group. When asked if the walkout was a protest, Colombia Environment Minister Susana Mohamed told The Associated Press: 'I would call this dissatisfaction, [we are] highly dissatisfied.' With tensions high, climate activists heckled United States climate envoy John Podesta as he left the meeting room. They accused the U.S. of not paying its fair share and having 'a legacy of burning up the planet.' The last official draft on Friday pledged $250 billion annually by 2035, more than double the previous goal of $100 billion set 15 years ago but far short of the annual $1 trillion-plus that experts say is needed. The rough draft discussed on Saturday was for $300 billion in climate finance, sources told AP. Accusations of a war of attrition Developing countries accused the rich of trying to get their way — and a small financial aid package — via a war of attrition. And small island nations, particularly vulnerable to climate change's worsening impacts, accused the host country presidency of ignoring them for the entire two weeks. After bidding one of his suitcase-lugging delegation colleagues goodbye and watching the contingent of about 20 enter the meeting room for the European Union, Panama chief negotiator Juan Carlos Monterrey Gomez had enough. 'Every minute that passes we are going to just keep getting weaker and weaker and weaker. They don’t have that issue. They have massive delegations,' Gomez said. 'This is what they always do. They break us at the last minute. You know, they push it and push it and push it until our negotiators leave. Until we’re tired, until we’re delusional from not eating, from not sleeping.' With developing nations' ministers and delegation chiefs having to catch flights home, desperation sets in, according to Power Shift Africa's Mohamed Adow. 'The risk is if developing countries don’t hold the line, they will likely be forced to compromise and accept a goal that doesn’t add up to get the job done,' he said. Teresa Anderson, the global lead on climate justice at Action Aid, said that to get a deal, 'the presidency has to put something far better on the table.' 'The U.S. in particular, and rich countries, need to do far more to show that they’re willing for real money to come forward,' she said. 'And if they don’t, then LDCs [Least Developed Countries] are unlikely to find that there’s anything here for them.' Climate cash deal is still elusive Developing nations are seeking $1.3 trillion to help adapt to droughts, floods, rising seas and extreme heat, pay for losses and damages caused by extreme weather, and transition their energy systems away from planet-warming fossil fuels and toward clean energy. Wealthy nations are obligated to pay vulnerable countries under an agreement reached at these talks in Paris in 2015. Panama's Monterrey Gomez said even the higher $300 billion figure that was discussed on Saturday is 'still crumbs.' 'Is that even half of what we put forth?' he asked. Monterrey Gomez said the developing world has since asked for a finance deal of $500 billion up to 2030 — a shortened timeframe than the 2035 date. 'We’re still yet to hear reaction from the developed side,' he said. On Saturday morning, Irish Environment Minister Eamon Ryan said it's not just about the number in the final deal, but 'how do you get to $1.3 trillion.' Ryan said that any number reached at the COP will have to be supplemented with other sources of finance, for example through a market for carbon emissions where polluters would pay to offset the carbon they spew. The amount in any deal reached at COP negotiations — often considered a 'core' — will then be mobilized or leveraged for greater climate spending. But much of that means loans for countries already drowning in debt. Anger and frustration over state of negotiations Alden Meyer of the climate think tank E3G said it’s still up in the air whether a deal on finance will come out of Baku at all. 'It is still not out of the question that there could be an inability to close the gap on the finance issue,' he said. Ali Mohamed, chair of the African Group of Negotiators, said the bloc is 'prepared to reach agreement here in Baku ... but we are not prepared to accept things that cross our red lines.' Despite the fractures between nations, several still held out hopes for the talks. 'We remain optimistic,' said Nabeel Munir of Pakistan, who chairs one of the talks' standing negotiating committees. The Alliance of Small Island States said in a statement that it wants to continue to engage in the talks, as long as the process is inclusive. 'If this cannot be the case, it becomes very difficult for us to continue our involvement,' the statement said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-talks-in-disarray-as-developing-nations-reject-climate-cash-rough-draft/7874542.html	2024-11-23T07:50:11-08:00

Ukraine has lost 40% of Russia's Kursk region, military source says	KYIV, UKRAINE — Ukraine has lost more than 40% of the territory in Russia's Kursk region that it rapidly seized in a surprise incursion in August as Russian forces have mounted waves of counterassaults, a senior Ukrainian military source said. The source, who is on Ukraine's General Staff, said Russia had deployed some 59,000 troops to the Kursk region since Kyiv's forces swept in and advanced swiftly, catching Moscow unprepared 2½ years into its full-scale invasion of Ukraine. 'At most, we controlled about 1,376 square kilometers; now, of course, this territory is smaller. The enemy is increasing its counterattacks,' the source said. 'Now we control approximately 800 square kilometers. We will hold this territory for as long as is militarily appropriate.' The Kursk offensive was the first ground invasion of Russia by a foreign power since World War II and caught Moscow unprepared. With the thrust into Kursk, Kyiv aimed to stem Russian attacks in eastern and northeastern Ukraine, force Russia to pull back forces gradually advancing in the east and give Kyiv extra leverage in any peace negotiations. But Russian forces are still steadily advancing in Ukraine's eastern Donetsk region. The Ukrainian General Staff source reiterated that about 11,000 North Korean troops had arrived in the Kursk region in support of Russia, but that the bulk of their forces was still finalizing their training. The Russian Defense Ministry did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Kyiv's freshest assessment of the state of play in the Kursk region. Reuters could not independently verify the figures or descriptions given. Moscow has neither confirmed nor denied the presence of North Korean forces in Kursk. Ukraine's armed forces chief said on November 11 that its beleaguered forces were not just battling crack Russian reinforcements in Kursk but also scrambling to reinforce two besieged fronts in eastern Ukraine and bracing for an infantry assault in the south. Threatening Russian advance The General Staff source said the Kurakhove region was the most threatening for Kyiv now as Russian forces were advancing there at 200 to 300 meters a day and had managed to break through in some areas with armored vehicles backed by anti-drone defenses. The town of Kurakhove is a stepping stone toward the critical logistical hub of Pokrovsk in the Donetsk region. Overall Russia has about 575,000 troops fighting in Ukraine, the Ukrainian General Staff source said, and is aiming to increase its forces up to around 690,000. Russia does not disclose numbers involved in its fighting, and Reuters could not independently verify those figures. Ukraine’s strategy As Ukraine fights a bigger and better-equipped enemy, Kyiv has sought to disrupt Russian logistics and supply chains by hitting Russian weapons and ammunition depots, airfields and other military targets well inside Russia. Ukraine gained a freer hand to do so earlier this month after, according to sources familiar with the matter, U.S. President Joe Biden dropped his opposition to Kyiv firing U.S.-supplied missiles at targets deep inside Russia in response to North Korea's entry into the war. Last week Ukraine fired U.S. ATACMS and British Storm Shadow cruise missiles into Russia. One of the ATACMS targets was an arms depot about 110 kilometers inside Russia. Moscow vowed to respond to what it sees as an escalation by Ukraine's Western supporters. On Thursday, Russia launched a new medium-range ballistic missile into the Ukrainian city of Dnipro, in a likely warning to NATO. Ukrainian officials are holding talks with the United States and Britain regarding new air defense systems capable of protecting Ukrainian cities and civilians from the new longer-range aerial threats. The Ukrainian General Staff source said the military had also implemented measures to bolster air defenses over the capital, Kyiv, and planned similar steps for the city of Sumy in the north and Kharkiv in the northeast, both near front lines. Russia now occupies a fifth of Ukraine, and President Vladimir Putin has said he wants Kyiv to drop ambitions to join the NATO military alliance and retreat from four Ukrainian regions that he partially holds, demands Kyiv has rejected as tantamount to capitulation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukraine-has-lost-40-of-russia-s-kursk-region-military-source-says/7874414.html	2024-11-23T04:35:30-08:00	
Russia's claim of emissions in Ukraine regions draws protests at COP29	BAKU, AZERBAIJAN — Russia has included the territories it occupies in Ukraine in its recent greenhouse gas inventory report to the United Nations, drawing protests from Ukrainian officials and activists at the COP29 climate summit this week. The move by Moscow comes as Russian President Vladimir Putin eyes potential peace negotiations with incoming U.S. President Donald Trump that could decide the fate of vast swathes of territory. 'We see that Russia is using international platforms to legalize their actions, to legalize their occupation of our territory,' Ukrainian Deputy Environment Minister Olga Yukhymchuk told Reuters. She said Ukraine is in touch with officials from the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, or UNFCCC, the U.N.'s main climate body, to ask it to resolve the dispute. Officials representing the Russian Foreign Ministry and the UNFCCC did not respond to requests for comment sent on Thursday. At issue is Russia's National Inventory Report of greenhouse gas emissions for 2022, which Moscow submitted to the UNFCCC on November 8. In the submission, reviewed by Reuters, Russia said it could provide data for only 85 out of 89 of its territories 'due to the absence of baseline data on land use for the territories of the Donetsk People's Republic, Luhansk People's Republic, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson regions, annexed in September 2022.' Russia had already included emissions from Ukraine's Crimea region, annexed in 2014, in its last few reporting submissions to the UNFCCC. It also included Crimea's land development plans in a report to the U.N. Global Biodiversity Framework in 2020. Ukrainian Environment Minister Svitlana Grynchuk raised the issue in a speech to delegates at the COP29 summit earlier this week, saying Russia's reporting on Ukraine territories undermines the integrity of global climate efforts. Yukhymchuk told Reuters this concern is based on the risk of double-counting of emissions over territories that together exceed the size of Portugal and Azerbaijan. 'It will bring us to a point that we do not achieve any of our goals if we don't have proper reporting under the Paris Agreement,' she said. Nikki Reisch, director of the Center for International Environmental Law's Climate and Energy Program, said the dispute reflected how geopolitical turmoil was diverting the world's attention from the work of fighting global warming. 'I think that is a sign of the times,' Reisch said. 'We're living amidst rampant conflicts, and that is certainly infecting these talks.' Christina Voigt, a law professor at the University of Oslo, said Russia's reporting on Ukraine emissions violated Ukraine's sovereignty and could be illegal. 'Claiming emissions is perhaps not illegal — but claiming emissions as if they were from their own territory, while they are in fact generated on another country's territory, is a unilateral declaration in violation of the international legal status of that territory,' Voigt said. She said Russia's claim of the annexed lands' emissions could become even more problematic if Moscow eventually claims emissions reductions on these lands and offers them as offset credits to carbon markets. 'This would indeed be an illegal appropriation of a good belonging to the other state,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-claim-of-emissions-in-annexed-ukraine-regions-draws-protests-at-cop29/7874397.html	2024-11-23T03:38:58-08:00	
Iran protests 'violent' arrest of students in Russia	TEHRAN, IRAN — Iran has lodged a protest with Moscow regarding what it described as the 'violent' arrest of Iranian students at a university in the Russian city of Kazan, state media reported Saturday. Two Iranian students who visited a visa extension center at Kazan Federal University on Friday were arrested after being subjected to 'inhumane and unprofessional beating' by the police, according to the IRNA state news agency, which cited a statement from Iran's consulate in the city. In response, Iran submitted 'a protest note' to the Russian Foreign Ministry condemning the 'violent treatment of the Iranian students by the police,' IRNA said. Iran, a close ally of Russia, has requested 'explanations' for the incident. The two students were released late on Friday following interventions by the consulate. The press service of the Kazan police said via Telegram on Friday that a conflict among students had turned physical, and that officers had 'detained the instigators' of the fight. The statement did not give the nationality of those arrested. The regional Investigative Committee in Kazan also reported on Friday that two foreign nationals were arrested for allegedly 'using violence against a representative of the authority.' Iran's top diplomat, Abbas Araghchi, has 'repeatedly' followed up on the incident, said a post on X from Kazem Jalali, Tehran's ambassador to Moscow. Jalali, in another post on Friday, condemned 'any sort of misbehavior with Iranian students,' asking for 'the responsible Russian authorities' to be held accountable.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iran-protests-violent-arrest-of-students-in-russia/7874395.html	2024-11-23T03:23:54-08:00	
Lawsuit challenges Hawaii law banning young adults from owning guns	HONOLULU, HAWAII — The latest lawsuit to take aim at Hawaii's gun laws challenges the state's ban on gun ownership for young adults 18 to 20 years old, which Second Amendment advocates say is an unconstitutional restriction on Americans' right to bear arms. Elijah Pinales, 19, and Juda Roache, who turns 18 next month, want to own guns for self-defense, according to their lawsuit filed Wednesday night in U.S. District Court in Honolulu. Their lawyers assert that Hawaii is the only state with a complete ban on acquiring and owning firearms and ammunition by those who are 18 to 20. Some states allow 18-year-olds to purchase a long gun and some allow for private party transfer of handguns, said Alan Beck, one of the lawyers who filed the lawsuit and has lodged numerous other challenges to Hawaii weapons laws. Roache's mother wants to give him a firearm and ammunition, the lawsuit says. Federal law requires a person to be 21 to purchase a handgun from a licensed firearm dealer and 18 to buy a long gun from a dealer, according to Everytown for Gun Safety. There's an 18-year-old minimum for handgun purchases from unlicensed sellers and no minimum age for long guns, according to the group's research. Chris Marvin, a Hawaii resident with Everytown, said states are raising the age for purchasing firearms and ammunition, noting a federal appeals court ruled earlier this month that a Colorado law raising the age to purchase a gun from 18 to 21 can take effect while the legal battle over it continues. New York and Illinois also have broad laws limiting people under 21 from possessing firearms, said David Pucino, legal director and deputy chief counsel for the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. 'Hawai'i has some of the strongest gun laws in the country and it has among the very lowest gun death rates,' he said in a statement Thursday. 'That's not an accident, but it hasn't stopped extremists from attacking Hawai'i's gun laws at every turn.' Firearm suicide rate jumps According to Everytown, firearms are the leading cause of death for young people ages 18 to 20, the firearm suicide rate in that age group has jumped 41% in the last decade, and 18- to 20-year-olds commit gun homicides at triple the rate of those 21 and older. The Hawaii attorney general's office said it had not been served with the complaint and declined to comment. 'There can be no real argument that adults under 21 are not part of the national community,' the lawsuit said, noting that 18-to-20-year-olds have the right to vote. 'They have the right to serve in the military and are otherwise full-fledged members of society and the People.' Court decision upends laws The quest for a preliminary injunction against enforcing a prohibition on gun ownership for young adults comes as Hawaii continues to contend with a 2022 U.S. Supreme Court decision that said Americans have a right to carry firearms in public for self-defense. The so-called Bruen decision upended gun laws nationwide and set a new standard for interpreting gun laws, such that modern firearm laws must be consistent with the nation's historical tradition of firearm regulation. There's no historical tradition of prohibiting the purchase and ownership of firearms and ammunition by adults under 21, according to the lawsuit, which describes some of the nation's founding figures such as Aaron Burr, who at 19 enlisted in the Continental Army with his own arms and ammunition, and James Monroe who did the same at 18. Hawaii's gun ownership ban for young adults dates to 1994, the lawsuit said. The state 'doubled down' this year by prohibiting the possession of ammunition by those under 21, the lawsuit said. Danger Close Tactical in Honolulu and JGB Arms on Kauai are federally licensed firearms dealers who are plaintiffs in the case because they want to do business with customers who are 18 to 20 years old, the lawsuit said. Another plaintiff is the Second Amendment Foundation, a nonprofit in Bellevue, Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lawsuit-challenges-hawaii-s-gun-ownership-ban-for-young-adults-/7874305.html	2024-11-23T00:13:25-08:00	
Trump repeats pledge on JFK files; don't expect big revelations, experts say	dallas — More than 60 years after President John F. Kennedy was assassinated, conspiracy theories still swirl and any new glimpse into the fateful day of Nov. 22, 1963, in Dallas continues to fascinate. President-elect Donald Trump promised during his reelection campaign that he would declassify all of the remaining government records surrounding the assassination if he returned to office. He made a similar pledge during his first term, but ultimately bent to appeals from the CIA and FBI to keep some documents withheld. At this point, only a few thousand of the millions of governmental records related to the assassination have yet to be fully released, and those who have studied the records released so far say that even if the remaining files are declassified, the public shouldn't anticipate any earth-shattering revelations. 'Anybody waiting for a smoking gun that's going to turn this case upside down will be sorely disappointed,' said Gerald Posner, author of Case Closed, which concludes that assassin Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone. November 22, 1963 When Air Force One carrying Kennedy and first lady Jacqueline Kennedy touched down in Dallas, they were greeted by a clear sky and enthusiastic crowds. With a reelection campaign on the horizon the next year, they had gone to Texas on political fence-mending trip. But as the motorcade was finishing its parade route downtown, shots rang out from the Texas School Book Depository building. Police arrested Oswald, 24, and, two days later, nightclub owner Jack Ruby fatally shot Oswald during a jail transfer. A year after the assassination, the Warren Commission, which President Lyndon B. Johnson established to investigate the assassination, concluded that Oswald acted alone and there was no evidence of a conspiracy. But that hasn't quelled a web of alternative theories over the decades. The collection In the early 1990s, the federal government mandated that all assassination-related documents be housed in a single collection in the National Archives and Records Administration. The collection of over 5 million records was required to be opened by 2017, barring any exemptions designated by the president. Trump, who took office for his first term in 2017, had said that he'd allow the release of all of the remaining records but ended up holding some back because of what he called the potential harm to national security. And while files have continued to be released during President Joe Biden's administration, some still remain unseen. The documents released over the last few years offer details on the way intelligence services operated at the time, and include CIA cables and memos discussing visits by Oswald to the Soviet and Cuban embassies during a trip to Mexico City just weeks before the assassination. The former Marine had previously defected to the Soviet Union before returning home to Texas. Mark S. Zaid, a national security attorney in Washington, said what's been released so far has contributed to the understanding of the time period, giving 'a great picture' of what was happening during the Cold War and the activities of the CIA. Withheld files Posner estimates that there are still about 3,000 to 4,000 documents in the collection that haven't yet been fully released. Of those documents, some are still completely redacted while others just have small redactions, like someone's Social Security number. 'If you have been following it, as I have and others have, you sort of are zeroed in on the pages you think might provide some additional information for history,' Posner said. There are about 500 documents that have been completely withheld, Posner said, and those include Oswald's and Ruby's tax returns. Those files, the National Archives says on its website, weren't subject to the 2017 disclosure requirement. Trump's transition team hasn't responded to questions this week about his plans when he takes office. A continued fascination From the start, there were those who believed there had to be more to the story than just Oswald acting alone, said Stephen Fagin, curator of the Sixth Floor Museum at Dealey Plaza, which tells the story of the assassination from the building where Oswald made his sniper's perch. 'People want to make sense of this and they want to find the solution that fits the crime,' said Fagin, who said that while there are lingering questions, law enforcement made 'a pretty compelling case' against Oswald. Larry J. Sabato, director of the University of Virginia Center for Politics, said his interest in the assassination dates to the event itself, when he was a child. 'It just seemed so fantastical that one very disturbed individual could end up pulling off the crime of the century,' Sabato said. 'But the more I studied it, the more I realized that is a very possible, maybe even probable in my view, hypothesis.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-repeats-pledge-on-jfk-files-don-t-expect-big-revelations-experts-say/7874306.html	2024-11-23T00:12:50-08:00	
Many in Gaza eat just once a day as hunger spreads amid aid issues	DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip — Yasmin Eid coughs and covers her face, cooking a small pot of lentils over a fire fed with twigs and scrap paper in the tent she shares with her husband and four young daughters in the Gaza Strip. It was their only meal Wednesday — it was all they could afford. 'My girls suck on their thumbs because of how hungry they are, and I pat their backs until they sleep,' she said. After being displaced five times, the Eids reside in central Gaza, where aid groups have relatively more access than in the north, which has been largely isolated and heavily destroyed since Israel began waging a renewed offensive against the militant group Hamas in early October. But nearly everyone in Gaza is going hungry these days. In the north experts say a full-blown famine may be under way. On Thursday, the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister, accusing them of using 'starvation as a method of warfare' — charges Israel adamantly denies. In Deir al-Balah, the Eids are among hundreds of thousands sheltering in squalid tent camps. The local bakeries shut down for five days this week. The price of a bag of bread climbed above $13 by Wednesday, as bread and flour vanished from shelves before more supplies arrived. The United Nations humanitarian office warned of a 'stark increase' in the number of households experiencing severe hunger in central and southern Gaza. The amount of food Israel has let into Gaza the past seven weeks has plummeted, now at nearly the lowest levels of the entire war. Even less than that is reaching the territory's 2.3 million Palestinians because of the many obstacles to distribution, aid groups and the U.N. say – including restrictions on movement by the Israeli military, ongoing fighting, damage to roads, and theft. Armed men robbed nearly 100 aid trucks last weekend in southern Gaza, close to Israeli military positions. Israel blamed Hamas but appears to have taken no action to stop the looting, while Hamas said it was the work of local bandits. For the Eids, hunger is the daily routine For months, Yasmin and her family have gone to bed hungry. 'Everything has increased in price, and we cannot buy anything,' she said. 'We always go to sleep without having dinner.' She misses coffee, but a single packet of Nescafe goes for around $1.30. A kilogram of onions goes for $10, a medium bottle of cooking oil for $15 — if available. Meat and chicken all but vanished from the markets months ago, but there are still some local vegetables. Such sums are astronomical in an impoverished territory where few people earn regular incomes. Crowds of hundreds wait hours to get food from charities, which are also struggling. Hani Almadhoun, co-founder of the Gaza Soup Kitchen, said his teams can offer only small bowls of rice or pasta once a day. He said they 'can go to the market on one day and buy something for $5, and then go back in the afternoon to find it doubled or tripled in price.' Its kitchen in the central town of Zuweida operated on a daily budget of around $500 for much of the war. When the amount of aid entering Gaza plummeted in October, its costs climbed to around $1,300 a day. It can feed about half of the 1,000 families who line up each day. The sharp decline in aid, and a U.S. ultimatum Israel says it places no limits on the amount of aid entering Gaza and has announced a number of measures it says are aimed at increasing the flow in recent weeks, including the opening of a new crossing. But the military's own figures show that the amount of aid entering Gaza plunged to around 1,800 trucks in October, down from over 4,200 the previous month. At the current rate of entry, around 2,400 trucks would come into Gaza in November. Around 500 trucks entered each day before the war. Israel blames U.N. agencies for not retrieving the aid, pointing to hundreds of truckloads languishing on the Gaza side of the border. The U.N. says it often cannot reach the border to pick up aid cargos because the Israeli military denies requests for movement and because of ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order. As a result, it says, only about half the incoming aid is distributed. The war started October 7, 2023, when Hamas-led fighters stormed into Israel, killing 1,200 people and capturing about 250 hostages. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,000 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas has been designated as a terror group by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. The United States warned Israel in October that it might be forced to curtail some of its crucial military support if Israel did not rapidly ramp up the amount of aid entering Gaza. But after the 30-day ultimatum expired, the Biden administration declined to take any action, saying there had been some progress. Israel, meanwhile, passed legislation severing ties with UNRWA. Israel accuses the agency of allowing itself to be infiltrated by Hamas — allegations denied by the U.N. Israeli news outlets have reported that officials are considering plans for the military to take over aid distribution or contract it out to private security companies. Asked about such plans Wednesday, government spokesperson David Mercer said 'Israel is looking at many creative solutions to ensure a better future for Gaza.' Yoav Gallant, the former defense minister who was seen as a voice of moderation in the far-right government before being fired this month, warned on X that handing over aid distribution to a private firm was a 'euphemism for the beginning of military rule.' As that debate plays out in Jerusalem, less than 100 kilometers away from central Gaza, most Palestinians in the territory are focused on staying alive in a war with no end in sight. 'I find it difficult to talk about the suffering we are experiencing. I am ashamed to talk about it,' said Yasmin's husband, Hani. 'What can I tell you? I'm a person who has 21 family members and is unable to provide them with a bag of flour.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/many-in-gaza-eat-just-once-a-day-as-hunger-spreads-amid-aid-issues-/7874294.html	2024-11-23T00:12:13-08:00	
At UN climate talks, ‘sewage’ beer from Singapore highlights water scarcity and innovations	BAKU, AZERBAIJAN — In the sprawling pavilion section of the United Nations climate talks, where countries, nonprofits and tech companies use big, flashy signs to get the attention of the thousands of people walking through, small aqua and purple beverage cans sit conspicuously on a counter at the Singapore display. Those who approach learn that the cans are beer — a brand call NEWBrew — and free for anybody who asks. But there is something not everybody who cracks one open finds out right away, if at all: the beer is made with treated wastewater. 'I didn't know. I was really surprised,' said Ignace Urchil Lokouako Mbouamboua, an international relations student from Congo, who recently sipped one while taking a break from the conference. 'I can even suggest that they make more and more of this kind of beer,' added Mbouamboua with a smile, sharing it was his third day in a row he stopped for a can. NEWBrew is made in Singapore with NEWater, the name of treated wastewater that's part of a national campaign to conserve every drop in one of the world's most water-starved places. The drink, which some attendees jokingly call 'sewage beer,' is one of many examples of climate- and environment-related innovations on display during this year's climate talks, COP29, taking place in Azerbaijan. Highlighting the use of treated wastewater underscores one of the world's most pressing problems as climate change accelerates: providing drinking water to a growing population. For years, Singapore has been a leader in water management and innovations. The city-state island of 6 million people in Southeast Asia, one of the most densely populated countries, has no natural water sources. In addition to water imports from Malaysia, the other pillars of its national strategy are catchment, desalination and recycling. Authorities have said they need to ramp up all water sources, as demand is expected to double by 2065. While drinking treated wastewater is a novelty for many at the climate conference, for Singaporeans it's nothing new. National campaigns — from water conservation pleas to showing the wastewater recycling process — go back decades. In 2002, then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong was famously photographed drinking a bottle of NEWater after a tennis match, done to normalize its use. Ong Tze-Ch'in, chief executive of the Public Utilities Board, Singapore's national water agency, said NEWBrew was developed by a local brewery in 2018. The idea was to showcase treated wastewater at the country's biennial International Water Week. The beer was next produced in 2022, 2023, then again this year. 'It's part of the acceptance of the use of recycled water, which in general is a difficult topic,' said Ong. 'We did many things to drive it.' And is he happy with how it turned out? 'I chose this flavor,' said Ong, adding that he was part of the group that worked with the brewery for this year's version, a 'modern pilsner.' 'You know, beer is always very subjective,' he added with a laugh. After attending a panel on water management at the Singapore pavilion, Peter Rummel, director of infrastructure policy advancement at Bentley Systems, which creates infrastructure engineering software, stepped up to the counter and got a beer. Rummel told onlookers he was in a good position to judge beer, as he hailed from Munich, Germany, home to the Oktoberfest beer festival. 'It's fresh, light, cool. It has a nice flavor,' said Rummel, while looking at the can. Wee-Tuck Tan, managing director of the local brewery, The Brewerkz Group, said they have made about 5,000 liters, or roughly 15,000 cans, for each edition of NewBrew. He said they use the same process as with other beers, and the cost is also similar, about 7 Singaporean dollars (around $5 U.S.) per can when bought in a supermarket. Wee-Tuck said he believes the beer has shifted how some in Singapore view NEWater. 'They think it tastes funny,' he said. 'When put into a beer, it changes the mindset. Most people can't tell the difference.' As problems with water scarcity grow, there is increasing embrace of the use of treated wastewater, said Saroj Kumar Jha, the World Bank Group's global water department director, who participated in the water management panel in the Singapore pavilion. Traveling to over 50 countries in the last two years, he said leaders have frequently told him it's important not to use the term 'wastewater,' and instead call it 'used water.' After the panel concluded, Jha and the other panelists opened NEWBrews and toasted. 'It's really good,' said Jha. 'It's the fourth time I've had it.' 'This year,' he added with a laugh. 'Not today.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/at-un-climate-talks-sewage-beer-from-singapore-highlights-water-scarcity-and-innovations-/7873037.html	2024-11-23T00:11:05-08:00	
Rice-loving Sierra Leone wants to free itself from imports. But how?	FREETOWN, Sierra Leone — Rice borders on the sacred in Sierra Leone. Unless a meal includes rice, people say, you haven't eaten at all. But as prices soar, consumers in the West African nation are giving up other food to buy it. That's a major reason why 83% of the population is food insecure, according to the U.N.'s World Food Program. In the capital, Freetown, 28-year-old nail technician Anima Mangola dug into rice with stewed cassava leaves. 'I'd eat rice five times a day if I had me the money,' she said — even as its price has more than doubled this year. Not everyone can keep up, and 'people are suffering,' she said. Experts blame soaring prices on a heavy reliance on imports, which supply 35% of Sierra Leone's rice and eat up $200 million annually in foreign currency. Even though West Africa has a long tradition of growing rice and often excellent places to do it, experts said the import dependency is due to a lack of investment in agriculture, booming population growth and cheap rice imports from Asia. Sierra Leone's agriculture minister, Henry Kpaka Musa, accused the International Monetary Fund of pressuring Sierra Leone in the 1980s to stop investing in agriculture and open its markets to imports as a condition for receiving loans. 'We used to export rice,' Kpaka said in an interview. Now he and President Julius Bio plan to do it again. The government has raised over $620 million from global development banks this year to work towards food self-sufficiency, notably in rice, although Kpaka estimated the plan will cost $1.8 billion in all. Experts from the Ivory Coast-based research center Africa Rice have commended the plan as 'ambitious and forward-looking.' But NGOs and academics warn it will favor international agribusiness and large-scale farms, to the detriment of the nation's 5 million smallholder farms. They point to similar, failed attempts at food self-sufficiency in places such as Burkina Faso and Ghana. Self-sufficiency challenges and potential West Africa has an ancient rice tradition dating back an estimated 3,500 years. Historian Judith Carney said its farmers were taken as slaves to work plantations in the U.S. South, giving birth to a booming rice economy. Sierra Leone has the region's best climate and land for growing rice, with abundant annual rainfall in coastal regions. But Kpaka, the minister, highlighted obstacles to rice self-sufficiency: poor roads to connect rice-growing areas with markets, unreliable electricity for processing, climate change and poor access to finance. With the financial backing from development banks, he has approved plans to improve roads to the country's three main 'rice bowls,' create large areas of irrigated land and provide fertilizers, seeds and pesticides to smallholder farms. 'The plan starts with the infrastructure to attract the private sector to come,' he said. He has promoted the plan to unspecified international investors, offering them thousands of hectares of irrigated land. But some believe smallholders, who make up 70% of the country's population of 8 million, will be an afterthought. The view from the field Aboubacar Kowa, a farming leader in Bo district, gathered others to discuss their rice challenges, which also included access to land and a lack of storage, training and processing capacity. They were united in their lack of optimism about government help. They've heard these ambitious plans before. 'We don't get support from the government,' said one smallholder and village chief, Eric Amara Manyeh. The most common concern was the lack of labor to create irrigated fields. Eliminating vegetation and digging channels is laborious, and an exodus of young people to urban areas means farmers have to employ laborers — a cost out of reach for many. Although unemployment is high in towns, Manyeh said young people prefer easier jobs such as driving motorbike taxis. Some farmers have formed collectives to share labor, but poor tools slow progress. In one government-backed project in Bo, digging 60 hectares of channels took three months by 82 people. A cautionary tale Sierra Leone's goal to get chemical fertilizer, seeds and pesticides into the hands of smallholders is meant to replicate the Green Revolution in Asia, which increased rice production by over 100% in two decades. But Klara Fischer, a rural development professor at the Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences specializing in sub-Saharan Africa, warned that the approach exposes farmers to agribusiness giants such as Bayer Crop Science and Syngenta. An initiative called A Green Revolution for Africa. backed by the Gates Foundation, the Rockefeller Foundation and others, has spent over $1 billion since 2006 to increase access to fertilizers and seeds for smallholders, but its own evaluation in 2022 said it hasn't increased food security. The initiative is supporting Sierra Leone's efforts. One recent assessment by the German development ministry in Ghana and Burkina Faso found no evidence that providing fertilizer and seeds increased yield or profit for smallholders and found that 41% of rice farmers struggled to pay off their debts. 'These fertilizer and seed packages are entangled with private interests,' Fischer said. She also highlighted differences between Asia in the 1970s and the current situation in Africa. One is the cheap and available family labor in Asia compared to the rural exodus in Sierra Leone. Kpaka, a former employee in the Gates Foundation's agricultural department, acknowledged concerns but was convinced his plan has the missing ingredient to unlock growth: the critical infrastructure to help farmers process and sell their rice, incentivizing them to grow more. 'If we don't make the road, (farmers) will forever remain subsistence,' he said. A different way Others believe that Sierra Leone should spend its funding on measures that empower smallholder farms rather than big business. Joseph Randall, director of an environmental NGO in Sierra Leone, Green Scenery, said the government should support sustainable practices such as organic compost instead of becoming dependent on imported chemical fertilizer, usually from Europe or North America, which contributes heavily to global warming. Randall opposes the distribution of modern seeds, even though they are higher yielding. The hybrid varieties of rice can't be saved and replanted each year because they are bred by agribusinesses and have patents. Meanwhile, in Manyeh's village, thunder echoed through the chief's rice fields. He pointed to a swamp that might be cultivated as part of the self-sufficiency goal. 'The willingness is there, the potential is there,' he said. But he knows it takes more than potential to feed a nation.	https://www.voanews.com/a/rice-loving-sierra-leone-wants-to-free-itself-from-imports-but-how-/7873018.html	2024-11-23T00:10:25-08:00	
New law blocks New Zealanders from displaying gang symbols	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — A ban on New Zealanders wearing or displaying symbols of gang affiliation in public took effect on Thursday, with police officers making their first arrest for a breach of the law three minutes later. The man was driving with gang insignia displayed on the dashboard of his car, Police Commissioner Richard Chambers told 1News. The prohibition on displaying gang insignia anywhere outside private homes, including on clothing or in vehicles, is among a suite of new measures intended to bolster police powers to disrupt the groups. Wearing or displaying the insignia of 35 listed gangs will now prompt a fine of up to 5,000 New Zealand dollars ($2,940) or up to six months in jail. New Zealand's center-right government, which pledged ahead of last October's election to tackle gang crime, says the measures will reduce the membership of groups responsible for violence and drug offenses. But detractors say the law breaches civil liberties and could drive gang activities underground. 'Gangs aren't community groups. They're not a Rotary club,' Prime Minister Christopher Luxon wrote on social media Thursday. 'They thrive on destroying the lives of other New Zealanders, whether that's by peddling drugs or through brutal acts of violence that leave communities in fear.' Under the new law, officers can also disperse public gatherings of three or more members, bar some gang affiliates from associating with each other, and enter homes of those who keep breaking the law to search for banned items. Gang membership will now be considered by the courts when sentencing offenders. Police Minister Mark Mitchell told reporters Thursday that two people were arrested hours after the law took effect for wearing gang 'patches,' which are large insignia often worn by gang members on the backs of leather jackets or vests. The government says the patches are intimidating because members are required to earn them through violent acts. The measures shift New Zealand's response to gangs closer to that of neighboring Australia, which also uses a law to suppress the public visibility of gangs, and away from jurisdictions like the U.S. and Britain, which use criminal law to respond to specific activities carried out by organized crime groups, according to a report published by Treasury officials in February. Facial tattoos that display gang insignia are exempt from the ban, as is the wearing of gang colors. The government was criticized by some for not including white supremacist groups in its list of 35 organizations targeted by the new law. That means displaying swastikas and making Nazi salutes remains legal in New Zealand -– unlike in Australia, which banned both in a law that took effect January. There are nearly 9,400 people on a New Zealand police list of known gang members. New Zealand's population is 5 million. Successive governments have vowed to tackle criminal gangs, which often are linked to poverty and other deprivation. The previous center-left government was decried by Luxon's administration for working with gangs on social initiatives, including COVID-19 vaccination efforts, while the current government has been denounced for advancing policies that are likely to ensnare some of New Zealand's most marginalized groups, including Indigenous Māori. Official reports say three-quarters of those on the national gang list are Māori, who make up less than 20% of New Zealanders, and that 80% to 90% of those in two of the most notorious gangs are former wards of the state. Luxon made a formal apology this month for the widespread abuse of children and vulnerable adults in state care over the past seven decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-law-blocks-new-zealanders-from-displaying-gang-symbols/7871700.html	2024-11-23T00:09:41-08:00	
New Zealand's founding treaty is at a flashpoint. Why are thousands protesting for Māori rights?	WELLINGTON, New Zealand — A proposed law that would redefine New Zealand's founding treaty between the British Crown and Māori chiefs has triggered political turmoil and prompted tens of thousands of people to show up in protest at the country's Parliament on Tuesday. The bill is never expected to become law. But it has become a flashpoint on race relations and a critical moment in the fraught 180-year-old conversation about how New Zealand should honor its promises to Indigenous people when the country was colonized – and what those promises are. A huge crowd gathered in the capital, Wellington, on Tuesday morning for the final stretch of a weeklong protest that has spanned the length of the country — a march through the city streets to Parliament. It follows a Māori tradition of hīkoi, or walking, to bring attention to breaches of the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi — and is likely to be the largest treaty rights demonstration in the history of modern New Zealand. Why is a 180-year-old treaty being debated? Considered New Zealand's founding document, the treaty was signed between representatives of the British Crown and 500 Māori chiefs during colonization. It laid out principles guiding the relationship between the Crown and Māori, in two versions – one in English and the other in Māori. It promised Māori the rights and privileges of British citizens, but the English and Māori versions differed on what power the chiefs were ceding over their affairs, lands and autonomy. Over decades, the Crown breached both versions. By the mid-20th century, Māori language and culture had dwindled – Indigenous people were often barred from practicing it — tribal land was confiscated and Māori were disadvantaged in many metrics. How were treaty rights revived? Prompted by a surging Māori protest movement, for the past 50 years the courts of New Zealand, lawmakers and the Waitangi Tribunal – a permanent body set up to adjudicate treaty matters – have navigated the differences in the treaty's versions and tried to redress breaches by constructing the meaning of the treaty's principles in their decisions. Those principles are intended to be flexible but are commonly described as partnership with the Crown, protection of Māori interests and participation in decision-making. While Māori remain disenfranchised in many ways, the weaving of treaty recognition through law and attempts at redress have changed the fabric of society since then. Māori language has experienced a renaissance, and everyday words are now commonplace – even among non-Māori. Policies have been enacted to target disparities Māori commonly face. Billions of dollars in settlements have been negotiated between the Crown and tribes for breaches of the treaty, particularly the widespread expropriation of Māori land and natural resources. Why is there fresh debate? Some New Zealanders, however, are unhappy with redress. They have found a champion in lawmaker David Seymour, the leader of a minor libertarian political party that won less than 9% of the vote in last year's election – but scored outsized influence for its agenda as part of a governing agreement. Seymour's proposed law would set specific definitions of the treaty's principles, and would apply them to all New Zealanders, not only to Māori. He says piecemeal construction of the treaty's meaning has left a vacuum and has given Māori special treatment. His bill is widely opposed — by left- and right-wing former prime ministers, 40 of the country's most senior lawyers, and thousands of Māori and non-Māori New Zealanders who are walking the length of the country in protest. Seymour's bill is not expected to pass its final reading. It cleared a first vote on Thursday due to a political deal, but most of those who endorsed it are not expected to do so again. Detractors say the bill threatens constitutional upheaval and would remove rights promised in the treaty that are now enshrined in law. Critics have also lambasted Seymour – who is Māori – for provoking backlash against Indigenous people. Why are protesters marching? Peaceful walking protests are a Māori tradition and have occurred before at crucial times during the national conversation about treaty rights. Police in the country of 5 million estimated that more than 40,000 people thronged Parliament's grounds on Tuesday after a march through the central city that shut down streets and drew thousands more onlookers, many holding signs in support of the protesters. As those outside Parliament waved flags, sang Māori songs and listened to speeches, crowds who could not squeeze onto the grounds spilled onto the surrounding streets, which remained closed to traffic. Many are marching to oppose Seymour's bill. But others are protesting a range of policies from the center-right government on Māori affairs – including an order, prompted by Seymour, that public agencies should no longer target policies to specifically redress Māori inequities.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-zealand-s-founding-treaty-is-at-a-flashpoint-why-are-thousands-protesting-for-m%c4%81ori-rights-/7871618.html	2024-11-23T00:08:30-08:00	
Blinken to attend G7 meeting in Italy, US State Department says	WASHINGTON — U.S. Secretary of State Anthony Blinken will travel to Italy over the weekend to attend a meeting of the Group of Seven major democracies next week, the State Department said on Friday, amid rising tensions in the war in Ukraine. G7 leaders last Saturday reiterated a pledge to keep imposing severe costs on Russia for its invasion of Ukraine through sanctions, export controls and other measures, and vowed to support Kyiv for as long as it takes. The State Department said Blinken would discuss issues including 'conflicts in the Middle East, Russia’s war against Ukraine, Indo-Pacific security, and the ongoing crises in both Haiti and Sudan' at the gathering in Italy. During his November 23-27 trip, Blinken also plans to meet Pope Francis at the Vatican following the G7 talks, it said in a statement. Italy holds the 2024 rotating presidency of the G7, which also includes the United States, Canada, Japan, France, Germany and Britain.	https://www.voanews.com/a/blinken-to-attend-g7-meeting-in-italy-us-state-department-says/7874351.html	2024-11-22T23:35:38-08:00	
North Korean troops massed in Russia to enter Ukraine war 'soon,’ Pentagon chief says	Sydney — The United States expects that thousands of North Korean troops massing in Russia will 'soon' enter combat against Ukraine, Pentagon chief Lloyd Austin said Saturday. About 10,000 North Korean soldiers were believed to be based in the Russian border region of Kursk, Austin said, where they were being 'integrated into the Russian formations.' 'Based upon what they've been trained on, the way they've been integrated into the Russian formations, I fully expect to see them engaged in combat soon,' Austin told reporters during a stopover in the Pacific nation of Fiji. Austin said he had 'not seen significant reporting' of North Korean troops being 'actively engaged in combat' to date. South Korean government officials and a research group on Thursday said Russia has provided Pyongyang with oil, anti-air missiles and economic help in exchange for the troops Washington and Seoul have accused it of sending. Kyiv has warned that Moscow, alongside the North Korean soldiers, has now amassed a 50,000-strong force to wrest back parts of the border region seized by Ukrainian forces. Ukraine claimed swathes of Kursk in August during a lightning offensive even as its troops were thinly stretched in the Donetsk region, which has borne the brunt of nearly three years of fighting.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korean-troops-massed-in-russia-to-enter-ukraine-war-soon-pentagon-chief-says/7874350.html	2024-11-22T23:25:50-08:00	
Israeli airstrike hits central Beirut, security sources say	BEIRUT — A powerful Israeli airstrike targeted central Beirut on Saturday, security sources said, shaking the Lebanese capital as Israel pressed its offensive against the Iran-backed Hezbollah group. At least four people were killed and 23 wounded in the attack in Beirut's Basta neighborhood, Hezbollah's al-Manar broadcaster reported, citing the health ministry. Lebanon's National News Agency said early on Saturday that the attack resulted in a large number of fatalities and injuries and destroyed an eight-story building. Footage broadcast by Lebanon's Al Jadeed station showed at least one destroyed building and several others badly damaged around it. Israel used bunker buster bombs in the strike, leaving a deep crater, said the agency. Beirut smelled strongly of explosives hours after the attack. The blasts shook the capital around 4 a.m. (0200 GMT), Reuters witnesses said. Security sources said at least four bombs were dropped in the attack. It marked the fourth Israeli airstrike this week targeting a central area of Beirut, where the bulk of Israel's attacks have targeted the Hezbollah-controlled southern suburbs. On Sunday an Israeli airstrike killed a Hezbollah media official in the Ras al-Nabaa district of central Beirut. Israel has killed several leaders of its longtime foe Hezbollah, Tehran's most important ally in the region, in air strikes on Beirut's southern suburbs. Israel launched a major offensive against Hezbollah in Lebanon in September, following nearly a year of cross-border hostilities ignited by the Gaza war, pounding wide areas of Lebanon with airstrikes and sending troops into the south. The conflict began when Hezbollah opened fire in solidarity with its Palestinian ally Hamas after it launched the October 7, 2023, attack on southern Israel. In that attack, Hamas militants killed 1,200 people and captured about 250 hostages, sparking the war in Gaza. Israel says it believes Hamas is still holding 101 hostages, including 35 the military says are dead. Israel’s counteroffensive in Gaza has killed more than 44,000 people, according to the territory's health ministry, which does not distinguish between combatants and civilians in its count. Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. A U.S. mediator traveled to Lebanon and Israel this week in an effort to secure a cease-fire. The envoy, Amos Hochstein, indicated progress had been made after meetings in Beirut on Tuesday and Wednesday, before going to meet Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Israel Katz.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israeli-airstrike-hits-central-beirut-security-sources-say/7874347.html	2024-11-22T23:03:45-08:00	
Alice Brock, who helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's classic 'Alice's Restaurant,' dies at 83	NEW YORK — Alice Brock, whose Massachusetts-based eatery helped inspire Arlo Guthrie's deadpan Thanksgiving standard, Alice's Restaurant Massacree, has died at age 83. Her death, just a week before Thanksgiving, was announced Friday by Guthrie on the Facebook page of his own Rising Son Records. Guthrie wrote that she died in Provincetown, Massachusetts, her residence for some 40 years, and referred to her being in failing health. Other details were not immediately available. 'This coming Thanksgiving will be the first without her,' Guthrie wrote. 'Alice and I spoke by phone a couple of weeks ago, and she sounded like her old self. We joked around and had a couple of good laughs even though we knew we'd never have another chance to talk together.' Born Alice May Pelkey in New York City, Brock was a lifelong rebel who was a member of Students for a Democratic Society among other organizations. In the early 1960s, she dropped out of Sarah Lawrence College, moved to Greenwich Village and married Ray Brock, a woodworker who encouraged her to leave New York and resettle in Massachusetts. Guthrie, son of the celebrated folk musician Woody Guthrie, first met Brock around 1962 when he was attending the Stockbridge School in Massachusetts and she was the librarian. They became friends and stayed in touch after he left school, when he would stay with her and her husband at the converted Stockbridge church that became the Brocks' main residence. On Thanksgiving Day, 1965, a simple chore led to Guthrie's arrest, his eventual avoidance of military service during the Vietnam War and a song that has endured as a protest classic and holiday favorite. Guthrie and his friend Richard Robbins were helping the Brocks throw out trash but ended up tossing it down a hill because they couldn't find an open dumpster. Police charged them with illegal dumping, briefly jailed them and fined them $50, a seemingly minor offense with major repercussions. By 1966, Alice Brock was running The Back Room restaurant in Stockbridge, Guthrie was a rising star and his breakout song was an 18-minute talking blues that recounted his arrest and how it made him ineligible for the draft. The chorus was a tribute to Alice — whose restaurant, Guthrie pointed out, was not actually called Alice's Restaurant — that countless fans have since memorized: You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant / Walk right in it's around the back / Just a half a mile from the railroad track / You can get anything you want at Alice's Restaurant. Guthrie assumed his song was too long to catch on commercially, but it soon became a radio perennial and part of the popular culture. Alice's Restaurant was the title of his million-selling debut album, and the basis of a movie and cookbook of the same name. Alice Brock would write a memoir, My Life as a Restaurant, and collaborate with Guthrie on a children's book, Mooses Come Walking. At the time of her death, they had been discussing an exhibit dedicated to her at her former Stockton home, now the Guthrie Center, which serves free dinners every Thanksgiving. Brock ran three different restaurants at various times, although she would later acknowledge she initially didn't care much for cooking or for business. She would also cite her professional life as a cause of her marriage breaking up, while disputing rumors that she had been unfaithful to her husband. Her honor was immortalized by Guthrie, who late in Alice's Restaurant advised: 'You can get anything you want' at Alice's Restaurant, 'excepting Alice.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/alice-brock-who-helped-inspire-arlo-guthrie-s-classic-alice-s-restaurant-dies-at-83/7874346.html	2024-11-22T22:49:40-08:00	
South Sudan’s army say gunfire incident at former spy chief's residence is resolved	JUBA, SOUTH SUDAN — South Sudanese authorities say a confrontation between the People’s Defense Forces and personnel protecting former spy chief General Akol Koor has been resolved peacefully, with both sides reaching an agreement to prevent further conflict. Heavy gunfire echoed for about an hour Thursday night around Koor’s residence in the Thongpiny neighborhood of Juba, creating panic and raising concerns the confrontation between the two sides might escalate. Major General Lul Ruai Koang, a spokesperson for South Sudan People’s Defense Force, told journalists that the gunfire resulted from a misunderstanding during an operation to relocate Koor to his secondary residence, as directed by President Salva Kiir. 'Let me make it very clear that he was not being effectively placed under house arrest,' Koang said. 'He was simply being told to relocate from Thongpiny to Jabal because of the presence of the security forces.' News agencies report that Koor has been under house arrest since early October when he was fired from the intelligence service. Government officials deny he has been under house arrest. The gunfire left two servicemen dead, while two civilians were crushed by an armored vehicle, according to Koang. Two others, including a university student, sustained injuries and are receiving medical care. Koor has since been moved to his residence in Jebel, accompanied by his wife, a single bodyguard, and a cook, under the protection of a senior officer. Authorities say the situation could have been much worse. Army spokesperson Koang reiterated that Thursday’s gunfire was not planned. 'Nobody had ordered for it,' he said. 'It was a misunderstanding, and as a result we are able to successfully resolve it without unnecessary more bloodshed.' 'As South Sudanese, I don’t like this kind of things, I heard too much shooting, and they told me it is next to my residence,' said Steve (not his real name), a Juba resident. Steve echoed the sentiments of many in Juba who were shaken by Thursday’s events. Concerns over public safety have heightened, especially given the use of heavy weaponry in a residential area. Investigations into the incident are ongoing, particularly surrounding the decisions leading to the confrontation and the broader implications for governance and security. For now, the People's Defense Forces assures the public of its readiness to maintain stability.	https://www.voanews.com/a/south-sudan-s-army-say-gunfire-incident-at-former-spy-chief-s-residence-is-resolved/7874341.html	2024-11-22T22:19:57-08:00	
Mozambique presidential runner-up lays out conditions for talks	MAPUTO, MOZAMBIQUE — Mozambique’s presidential election runner-up, Venâncio Mondlane, has placed conditions on his participation in a meeting with the country’s president to end weeks of political unrest over disputed elections. Mondlane delivered his proposal along with a proposed agenda and wants to meet Tuesday with President Filipe Nyusi and the three other presidential candidates. Among his demands, Mondlane requests that the legal proceedings against him be dropped and that his participation be virtual. He also wants the release of all those arrested as part of the violent protests that he had called for and 'guarantees of political and legal security for the actors and players in the dialogue.' Among the items on the agenda, Mondlane proposed 20 points, including 're-establishment of the electoral truth' and criminal and civil liability for what he says are those involved in falsifying the electoral process. The document was delivered by Diniz Tivane, a representative of the Podemos party, which backed Mondlane in the presidential race. Tivane revealed some of the contents of the letter, saying that the electoral truth was exactly what Venancio himself said. Votes are not negotiated, they are counted. Mondlane also demanded that certain institutions and individuals participate in the talks. Political analyst Dercio Alfazema said Mondlane accepted Nyusi’s invitation, but the conditions showed otherwise. He said that if it were up to Mondlane, he would not participate in this meeting. And depending on that, the meeting could be held with other candidates or not take place at all. And it will be very difficult for all who are worried and want a solution to this problem. And, Alfazema added, we all believe that the best way out of this problem is dialogue. Preliminary results showed the Frelimo candidate, Daniel Chapo, won the presidential with 71%, and Mondlane, who ran as an independent, came in second with 20%. A political and social crisis marked by fraud allegations and disputed results has engulfed Mozambique since the October 9 elections. Mozambique immediately fell into a climate of uncertainty that has affected daily life and the economy. At least 60 people have died in protests, and several regions of Mozambique have seen blockades, looting, riots and violence, with emphasis on border areas and economic centers.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mozambique-presidential-runner-up-lays-out-conditions-for-talks/7874337.html	2024-11-22T22:04:12-08:00	
UN expert: Myanmar's military ramps up attacks including beheadings, rapes and torture	UNITED NATIONS — Myanmar's desperate military junta is ramping up attacks on villages that have fallen to opposition groups, carrying out beheadings, gang rapes and torture, with women, children and the elderly among the victims, the U.N. independent human rights investigator for Myanmar said in a new report. Thomas Andrews, a former U.S. congressman from Maine, said in the report to the U.N. General Assembly circulated Friday that the junta has responded to military defeats and the loss of territory by using sophisticated weapons against civilians and seeking to destroy towns that it cannot control. Calling Myanmar 'an invisible crisis' because the world's attention is focused elsewhere, he said, 'Escalating atrocities against the people of Myanmar are being enabled by governments that allow, or actively support, the transfer of weapons, weapons materials, and jet fuel to junta forces.' Andrews didn't name the governments. But he praised Singapore for cracking down on weapons transfers that has led to a 90% reduction by Singapore-registered companies, and said sanctions imposed by the United States on junta-controlled, state-owned banks have disrupted military supply chains. The U.N. special rapporteur on human rights in Myanmar lamented, however, that their actions remain an exception. He called on all countries to address Myanmar's 'devastating human rights and humanitarian crisis' by stopping the flow of weapons to the junta, stepping up humanitarian aid to millions in need, and supporting efforts to hold perpetrators accountable for human rights violations. Myanmar is racked by violence that began when the army ousted the elected government of Aung San Suu Kyi in February 2021 and brutally suppressed nonviolent protests. That triggered armed resistance and combat across the country, with the military increasingly using airstrikes to counter the opposition and secure territory. The army is on the defensive against ethnic militias in much of Myanmar as well as hundreds of armed guerrilla groups collectively called the People's Defense Forces, formed to fight to restore democracy. The military has said in the past that it only attacks legitimate targets of war and has accused the resistance forces of being terrorists. Andrews called the military junta's plan to hold an election in late 2025 'a farcical parody' and 'thinly veiled attempt to create an impression of legitimacy and relieve international pressure.' He warned, 'Not only is this fraudulent attempt outrageous, it is dangerous, as it could lead to even greater levels of instability and violence.' He ticked off grim statistics: More than 3.1 million people are displaced by conflict and the junta's human rights violations, and 18.6 million people need humanitarian assistance, including 13.3 million facing emergency levels of food insecurity. He said the junta's military forces have killed more than 5,800 civilians, destroyed over 100,000 homes and other civilian structures, and have kept more than 21,000 political prisoners languishing behind bars. 'Junta troops have killed civilians in ground assaults, including the mass killing of individuals already in the custody of junta forces,' Andrews said. 'Victims have been tortured, raped and beheaded, and their bodies burned.' Andrews, a human rights fellow at Yale Law School who was appointed by the Geneva-based Human Rights Council, said the situation was most 'desperate and dangerous' in Rakhine state in western Myanmar. Last November, the Arakan Army, which is seeking autonomy from Myanmar's central government, began an offensive against the military in Rakhine and has gained control of more than half of its townships. The Arakan Army, which is the well-armed wing of the Rakhine ethnic minority movement, is also a member of the armed ethnic group alliance trying to topple the military. In the report, Andrews said: 'The Arakan Army has been implicated in grave human rights abuses, including indiscriminate attacks, killings, sexual violence and arbitrary arrests.' He also said the military has responded to the Arakan Army's steady losses in Rakhine by attacking civilians and raising tensions between the ethnic Rakhine and Rohingya communities. Buddhist-majority Myanmar has long considered the Rohingya Muslim minority to be 'Bengalis' from Bangladesh even though their families have lived in the country for generations. Nearly all have been denied citizenship since 1982. In August 2017, attacks by a Rohingya insurgent group on Myanmar security personnel triggered a brutal campaign by the military, which drove at least 740,000 Rohingya to Bangladesh. The military is accused of mass rape, killings and burning thousands of homes. Meanwhile, the military junta has conscripted thousands of Rohingya men and deployed them to the front lines to fight the Arakan Army, he said. And Rohingya militant groups have 'cynically aligned with the junta' and committed human rights abuses against the ethnic Rakhine population. 'Hundreds of thousands of people in Rakhine State are completely cut off from humanitarian assistance and threatened by exposure, starvation and disease,' Andrews warned. 'Failure to act immediately to provide emergency humanitarian aid will be a death sentence for untold numbers of innocent men, women and children.' A month ago, he said, Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, the interim leader of Bangladesh where 1 million Rohingya refugees live, called on U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres to convene a conference with all key players in the Rohingya crisis. Yunus has pressed for their repatriation to Myanmar. Andrews urged Guterres to call a conference that could help 'seize the attention of a distracted world and mobilize the resources and action necessary to save the many lives that hang in the balance.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/un-expert-myanmar-s-military-ramps-up-attacks-including-beheadings-rapes-and-torture/7874328.html	2024-11-22T21:33:51-08:00	
US top court to decide legality of Federal Communications Commission fund	WASHINGTON — The U.S. Supreme Court agreed on Friday to decide the legality of a congressionally authorized fund operated by the Federal Communications Commission to expand access to telecommunications services in a challenge accusing Congress of unlawfully delegating its authority to an independent federal agency. The justices took up an appeal by the FCC and a coalition of interest groups and telecommunications firms of a lower court's decision that found Congress violated the U.S. Constitution by empowering the FCC to manage the fund. The court is expected to hear arguments in the case and issue a ruling by the end of June. Congress in a federal law called the Telecommunications Act of 1996 authorized the FCC to operate the Universal Service Fund to promote broad access to services such as phone and broadband internet. All telecommunications carriers contribute to the fund, which draws around $9 billion annually. The fund helps to extend service to people in rural areas, provides subsidies for low-income Americans, expands service in Native American tribal lands and assists schools and libraries. A group of challengers including the conservative group Consumers' Research filed lawsuits against the FCC and the U.S. government, arguing that Congress delegated its revenue-raising function to the FCC in violation of the Constitution. The challengers also argued that the FCC unlawfully transferred its authority to the Universal Service Administrative Company, a private nonprofit that helps the agency administer the fund. The case involves the non-delegation doctrine, a legal concept that embraces the view that Congress cannot delegate the legislative powers given to it under the Constitution to other entities. The legality of the FCC's handoff of power involves a similar concept known as the private non-delegation doctrine. The FCC was established as an independent federal agency by the Communications Act of 1934 and is overseen by Congress. Federal appellate courts have reached different conclusions on the legal question at issue in the case. The Supreme Court on Friday agreed to review a ruling by the New Orleans-based 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals that found the funding arrangement unconstitutional, granting an appeal by the FCC and various interest groups. FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel hailed the court's decision to hear the agency's appeal. 'For decades, there has been broad, bipartisan support for the Universal Service Fund and the FCC programs that help communications reach the most rural and least-connected households in the United States, as well as hospitals, schools, and libraries nationwide,' she said. 'I am hopeful that the Supreme Court will overturn the decision that put this vital system at risk.' Three industry groups representing telecommunications companies said in a joint statement they were pleased the high court will review the lower court ruling. 'It threatens to undermine universal service programs that, for many decades, have served to promote the availability and affordability of critical communications services for millions of rural and low-income consumers, rural health care facilities, and schools and libraries across the nation,' said the Rural Broadband Association, Competitive Carriers Association and USTelecom, which represent AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile, and other major companies. The justices have not acted on separate appeals by Consumers' Research and other interested parties of lower court rulings that found the funding arrangement constitutional. The Supreme Court, which has a 6-3 conservative majority, has reined in the actions of federal regulatory agencies in a series of rulings in recent years, though those cases did not involve the non-delegation doctrine.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-top-court-to-decide-legality-of-federal-communications-commission-fund/7874303.html	2024-11-22T18:37:26-08:00	
Storm inundates Northern California; thousands without power in Seattle	HEALDSBURG, California — Heavy downpours fell over much of Northern California on Friday, causing small landslides and flooding a river and some streets, including in parts of San Francisco. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of people were still without power in the Seattle area after several days in the dark. The storm arrived in the Pacific Northwest earlier this week, killing two people and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands, mostly in the Seattle area, before moving through Northern California, where several roads were closed because of flooding and strong winds toppled trees. Forecasters warned about the risk of flash flooding and rock slides in areas north of San Francisco from this season's strongest atmospheric river — a long plume of moisture that forms over an ocean and flows through the sky over land. On the East Coast, another storm brought much-needed rain to New York and New Jersey, where rare wildfires have raged in recent weeks. The rain eased the fire danger for the rest of the year and was a boost for ski resorts preparing to open in the weeks ahead. Parts of West Virginia were under a blizzard warning through Saturday morning, with up to 61 centimeters of snow and high winds making travel treacherous. In California's Humboldt County, the sheriff's office downgraded evacuation orders to warnings for people near the Eel River after forecasters said the waterway would see moderate but not major flooding. Officials urged residents to prepare for storm impacts throughout the week. Flooding closed scenic Highway 1, also known as the Pacific Coast Highway, in neighboring Mendocino County north of Point Arena near the Garcia River, and there was no estimate for when it would reopen, according to the California Department of Transportation. Santa Rosa saw its wettest three-day period on record with about 32 centimeters of rain, according to the National Weather Service in the Bay Area. Mudslide danger A small mudslide threatened a home in the community of Fitch Mountain, near Healdsburg, nestled in hills along the Russian River in Sonoma County. Moderate rain was falling, and officials worried the slide could grow and hit several homes downhill. 'Our concern is while this property may be OK, the earth between it and the road below is slipping, and the mudslide is affecting downhill properties,' said Tennis Wick, permits and resource director for Sonoma County. Dana Eaton, who lives in one of the downhill properties and was clad in a yellow rain slicker and hat, said she was worried, too. In 2019, mud cascaded into a neighbor's garage. Asked what the past few days have been like, she laughed: 'Wet. Constant rain. It's like everywhere else in the county, but so far nothing major, just concerns.' Power outages In Washington state, nearly 127,000 people were still without electricity, mostly in the Seattle area's King County, as crews worked to clear streets of downed lines, branches and other debris. Utility officials said the outages, which began Tuesday, could last into Saturday. People flocked to a suburban senior center in Issaquah to get warm food and plug in their cellphones and other devices. One of them, Melissa Tryon, said she had been unable to charge her electric motorized wheelchair and had to throw out all the food in her refrigerator after it went bad. 'Today I kind of had a little bit of a meltdown,' Tyron said. 'It's hard to be cut off for that long.' Gale warnings were issued off Washington, Oregon and California, and high wind warnings were in effect across parts of Northern California and Oregon. There were winter storm warnings for parts of the California Cascades and the Sierra Nevada. The National Weather Service in Reno, Nevada, reported a 206-kph (128-mph) gust of wind in the morning at the top of Palisades Tahoe ski resort, about 10 miles northwest of Lake Tahoe, where some runs were open. Gusts up to 138 kph (86 mph) were recorded at Mount Rose, which closed because of the weather. The system roared ashore on the West Coast on Tuesday as a 'bomb cyclone,' which occurs when a cyclone intensifies rapidly. It unleashed fierce winds that toppled trees onto roads, vehicles and homes. Northeast welcomes rain In the Northeast, which has been hit by drought, more than 5 centimeters (2 inches) of rain was expected by Saturday morning north of New York City, with snow mixed in at higher elevations. Despite the mess, the precipitation was expected to help ease drought conditions in a state that has seen an exceptionally dry fall. 'It's not going to be a drought buster, but it's definitely going to help when all this melts,' said Bryan Greenblatt, a National Weather Service meteorologist in Binghamton, New York. Heavy snow fell in northeastern Pennsylvania, including the Pocono Mountains, prompting a raft of school closures. Higher elevations reported up to 43 centimeters (17 inches), with lesser accumulations in valley cities like Scranton and Wilkes-Barre. More than 100,000 customers in 10 counties lost power, and the state transportation department imposed speed restrictions on some highways.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-inundates-northern-california-thousands-without-power-in-seattle/7874298.html	2024-11-22T18:24:02-08:00	
Trump picks hedge fund manager for treasury secretary	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said he would nominate Scott Bessent as secretary of the treasury, according to a statement released Friday night. Bessent, 62, is the founder of Key Square Capital Management, a hedge fund, and has worked on and off for Soros Fund Managment since 1991. If confirmed, Bessent will be the nation's first openly gay treasury secretary. He is a deficit hawk and has said he would work to lower the U.S. national debt. 'This election cycle is the last chance for the U.S. to grow our way out of this mountain of debt without becoming a sort of European-style socialist democracy,' he told Bloomberg in August. Trump followed the Bessent announcement with two more: The president-elect said he would nominate Russell Thurlow Vought as director of the Office of Management and Budget. Vought served in the same role in the first Trump administration. 'Russ has spent many years working in Public Policy in Washington, D.C., and is an aggressive cost cutter and deregulator who will help us implement our America First Agenda across all Agencies,' Trump said in his statement. He also chose Oregon Representative Lori Chavez-DeRemer, who lost her re-election bid in the state's 5th Congressional District, to become secretary of labor. On Thursday, Trump said he would nominate Pam Bondi, as attorney general. Bondi was Trump's second choice after former U.S. Republican Representative Matt Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration in the face of widespread scrutiny of his alleged sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Gaetz, a four-term archconservative congressman from Florida, said in a social media statement that he felt he had strong momentum toward Senate confirmation as the country's top law enforcement officer. But, he said, 'it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work' of Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance's taking the reins of running the U.S. government at their inauguration on January 20. Bondi, 59, has established herself as a staunch conservative, Trump loyalist and outspoken defender of the president-elect, both personally and professionally. She was one of the lawyers on Trump's defense team during his first impeachment trial, and she played a leading role in his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Bondi was born and raised in Florida. She received a bachelor of arts degree from the University of Florida and a law degree from the Stetson University College of Law in DeLand, Florida. Early in her law career, Bondi worked as prosecutor and spokeswoman in Hillsborough County, where she was assistant state's attorney. In 2010, she became the first female attorney general elected to the state of Florida. Several other Trump appointees also are facing intense scrutiny, including defense secretary pick Pete Hegseth, a Fox News talk show host and decorated military veteran; health and human services chief pick Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a vaccine skeptic; and director of national intelligence pick Tulsi Gabbard, a Democratic congresswoman-turned-Republican supporter of Trump. With Republicans holding at most a 53-47 edge in the Senate next year, and unified Democratic opposition to any candidate, it would have taken only four Republicans to doom a nomination. But recent U.S. political history stands in their favor. The Senate has not voted against a presidential Cabinet nominee since 1989, with members of both political parties giving wide deference to new presidents to fill top-level jobs with appointees of their choosing. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-picks-hedge-fund-manager-for-treasury-secretary/7874282.html	2024-11-22T18:00:24-08:00	
Chinese vessel suspected in severing of Baltic submarine cables	European allies in the Baltic region are investigating how two fiber optic data cables were severed earlier this week — with suspicion falling on a Chinese vessel in the area.

Chinese hackers preparing for conflict with US, cyber official says	Chinese hackers are positioning themselves in U.S. critical infrastructure IT networks for a potential clash with the United States, a top American cybersecurity official said Friday. Morgan Adamski, executive director of U.S. Cyber Command, said Chinese-linked cyber operations are aimed at gaining an advantage in case of a major conflict with the United States. Officials have warned that China-linked hackers have compromised IT networks and taken steps to carry out disruptive attacks in the event of a conflict. Their activities include gaining access to key networks to enable potential disruptions such as manipulating heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems in server rooms, or disrupting critical energy and water controls, U.S. officials said earlier this year. Beijing routinely denies cyber operations targeting U.S. entities. The Chinese Embassy in Washington did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Adamski was speaking to researchers at the Cyberwarcon security conference in Arlington, Virginia. On Thursday, U.S. Senator Mark Warner told The Washington Post a suspected China-linked hack on U.S. telecommunications firms was the worst telecom hack in U.S. history. That cyber espionage operation, dubbed 'Salt Typhoon,' has included stolen call records data, compromised communications of top officials of both major U.S. presidential campaigns before the November 5 election, and telecommunications information related to U.S. law enforcement requests, the FBI said recently. The FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency are providing technical assistance and information to potential targets, the bureau said. Adamski said Friday that the U.S. government has 'executed globally synchronized activities, both offensively and defensively minded, that are laser-focused on degrading and disrupting PRC cyber operations worldwide.' Public examples include exposing operations, sanctions, indictments, law enforcement actions and cybersecurity advisories, with input from multiple countries, Adamski said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-hackers-preparing-for-conflict-with-us-cyber-official-says-/7874252.html	2024-11-22T17:52:53-08:00	
Calls to revoke China's trade status widen in Washington	Influential members of Congress, including the senator poised to become secretary of state in the incoming Trump administration, are pressing hard to revoke China’s Permanent Normal Trade Relations with the U.S. Commonly known as 'Most Favored Nation' status, PNTR means that Chinese goods being imported into the United States are granted the most advantageous terms that the country offers when it applies tariffs and other restrictions. China was granted PNTR in 2000, as it prepared for entry into the World Trade Organization. Since then, some of the advantages the status confers have been stripped away by sanctions applied by the first Trump administration and increased during the presidency of Joe Biden. Few non-PNTR countries Completely removing PNTR would expose all of China’s vast array of exports to the U.S. — $427.2 billion worth in 2023 — to even higher levies. The tariffs imposed by the U.S. on goods from countries without PNTR range from a minimum of 35% to as high as 100%. Currently, there are only four countries in the world that do not have PNTR status with the U.S.: Russia, Belarus, North Korea and Cuba. North Korea and Cuba have never held PNTR status, while the PNTR status of Russia and Belarus was revoked after Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, which Belarus helped enable. If normal non-PNTR tariffs were levied on goods from China, and the increased tariffs applied by the Trump and Biden administrations under Section 301 of the Trade Act of 1974 were left in place, the average tax on Chinese imports could approach 60%. During his campaign this year, President-elect Donald Trump had suggested levying a 60% tariff on Chinese goods, though it is not clear how he arrived at that number. More assertive policy This week, the congressionally chartered U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission issued its annual report to Congress. Among its recommendations for changing U.S. relations with China was PNTR revocation. The bipartisan panel, which has been issuing annual reports since 2002, had not previously made a unanimous call for PNTR revocation. The report accused China of 'engaging in practices such as intellectual property theft and market manipulation.' It said that PNTR repeal would improve U.S. leverage in trade negotiations and 'would signal a shift toward a more assertive trade policy aimed at protecting U.S. industries and workers from economic coercion.' Asked for comment on this story, Liu Pengyu, the spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, emailed VOA a statement criticizing the commission. '[The] U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission has long been issuing so-called reports about China, which are full of disinformation and smear, based on its entrenched bias about China,' Liu said. 'On PNTR, following the agreement between China and the US on China’s accession to the WTO, the US announced in 2001 to grant permanent normal trade relations status to China. Attempts to pull the China-US trade and economic relations back to the Cold War era violates WTO rules, and will only harm the common interests of both countries, and disrupt the global economy.' Legislative efforts The U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission report followed the introduction of a bill on November 14 by Representative John Moolenaar, chairman of the House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, that would officially end China’s PNTR status. Moolenaar described granting China PNTR as an experiment that has failed, saying in a statement that repeal would 'protect our national security, support supply chain resilience, and return manufacturing jobs to the U.S. and our allies.' In September, similar legislation was introduced in the Senate. One of the key sponsors was Florida Senator Marco Rubio, whom President-elect Donald Trump has nominated to serve as secretary of state in his incoming administration. Both bills include language that would specify that 100% tariffs be applied to a wide range of products imported from China, including consumer electronics, machinery, solar energy equipment and much more. Forecasting economic growth Supporters of eliminating China’s PNTR status claim that doing so would lead to a boost in manufacturing in the United States, economic growth and an increase in well-paid jobs. When the Senate bill to strip China of PNTR was released in September, Senator Tom Cotton said, 'This comprehensive repeal of China’s PNTR status and reform of the U.S.-China trade relationship will protect American workers, enhance our national security and end the Chinese Communists’ leverage over our economy.' In a statement released when the Moolenaar bill was introduced, Michael Stumo, CEO of the advocacy organization Coalition for a Prosperous America, said, 'Strengthening America’s domestic industrial capacity is paramount to growing the economy, creating good-paying jobs and safeguarding our nation’s future. ... Congress’s focus on revoking China’s [PNTR] status is a necessary step to ensure America’s prosperity and independence.' Forecasting disaster On the other side of the argument, many economists and trade advocacy organizations say that huge spikes in tariffs on Chinese goods would be economically disastrous for the U.S. Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told VOA that when he and his colleagues modeled the results of PNTR revocation, the findings were precisely the reverse of what the policy’s advocates expect. They found slower economic growth, higher prices and a negative impact on manufacturing. 'Taking away Permanent Normal Trade Relation status from China does the opposite of what the proponents would like,' Noland said. 'It actually does not contribute to an industrial revival in the United States. Just the opposite. What happens is that by raising the tariffs on China … you make industrial inputs into the United States much more expensive. 'And so, the United States becomes a high-cost location of production for many manufacturers, and loses competitiveness in that sector,' he said. Over time, economic growth and manufacturing levels would begin to rise again, and price increases would fall somewhat, but they never return to the same long-term trajectory, the findings showed. 'You do permanent damage,' Noland said. The U.S. China Business Council, or USCBC, which works to deepen trading ties between the world’s two largest economies, also opposes the plan. '[R]evoking Permanent Normal Trade Relations status for China would significantly harm the U.S. economy, consumers and businesses by driving up prices, eliminating hundreds of thousands of jobs, and making it harder for American companies to compete globally,' USCBC President Craig Allen said in a statement emailed to VOA. 'Any policy impacting the U.S.-China relationship should be targeted to achieve specific objectives, address unfair Chinese market practices, and be coordinated with U.S. allies and partners, rather than create a unilateral framework that accomplishes none of these goals,' Allen added.	https://www.voanews.com/a/calls-to-revoke-china-s-trade-status-widen-in-washington-/7874228.html	2024-11-22T17:25:33-08:00

From VOA Mandarin: Pro-Beijing media call for dissolution of Hong Kong’s Democratic Party	Four years after the implementation of the Hong Kong National Security Law, pro-democracy political parties in Hong Kong are facing unprecedented political pressure. Following the sentencing of 45 pro-democracy figures to severe penalties for conspiring to subvert state power, two major pro-Beijing newspapers on Thursday issued strong condemnations of Hong Kong's largest pro-democracy party, the Democratic Party. Analysts believe this signals that Beijing is issuing a final ultimatum to the Democratic Party, a mainstay of Hong Kong’s pro-democracy politics since its founding in 1994.

Harassment of Balkan female reporters underscores global threat, say analysts	washington — Menacing incidents aimed at two female journalists in Europe within one week underscore the threatening environment for media, say analysts. In the first incident, in North Macedonia, journalist Miroslava Simonovska received threats online from a fake Facebook profile bearing her name and image. The threats included messages that read 'We are following you' and 'We are taking pictures of you,' according to the Coalition for Women in Journalism, or CFWIJ. The second incident was more violent. Montenegrin journalist Ana Raickovic was physically attacked by a local businessman. Raickovic, editor of the crime section for the daily newspaper Pobjeda, was threatened outside a restaurant and then verbally and physically assaulted. She suffered injuries to her neck, head and arms. Her son and fiance were also attacked. Physical attacks against female journalists have increased in recent years, according to the director and founder of the CFWIJ, Kiran Nazish. 'Women journalists used to get targeted with verbal threats, which was obviously always concerning,' Nazish told VOA in a call. 'But a lack of accountability and impunity is what allows people to go a step further.' Three people have been arrested in connection with the Raickovic assault, which the Montenegrin prime minister condemned on social media. In the case in Macedonia, the online threats came after secretly recorded footage that appeared to show Simonovska receiving documents circulated on national television, according to the CFWIJ. The incident was an abuse of power and an invasion of the journalist's privacy, analysts say. Internet-based attacks have become increasingly popular 'among those who want to silence the press,' Nazish said. Three in four female journalists globally have experienced online harassment, according to a joint 2022 study on violence against women journalists. 'This is not just virtual; it's not just online,' said Julie Posetti, of the International Center for Journalists, who was a lead editor on the joint report with ICFJ and UNESCO. 'Through our research, we've established there's a trajectory from online to offline attacks.' Family attacks are not uncommon either; the survey found that 13% of women respondents experienced threats against their families, including their children. 'They are targeted because they are women,' Posetti told VOA by phone. Female journalists often experience highly sexualized abuse, which is tied to their gender identity, she said. In her research, Posetti examined the disproportionate abuse women received compared with that experienced by their colleagues. She found that when sharing bylines with men, women journalists often experience immense harassment while their male colleagues, who reported on the same subject, do not suffer any backlash. 'That anecdote really does reinforce what we already knew, which is that women journalists are much more likely to be targeted,' Posetti told VOA. 'The reason for that is that they are dealing not just with the kinds of attacks associated often with disinformation campaigns … but because they are women. That, in and of itself, exposes them to more risk online.' Threats against female journalists have been effective, Posetti told VOA. Because of these increased threats, Posetti has seen women begin to withdraw from journalism. The real harm in that, she said, is that women’s stories are less likely to be told. 'Everywhere where women withdraw from journalism, women’s stories are less represented,' Posetti said. 'With women being pushed out and bullied out of the profession, we risk further entrenching inequalities and suppressing those voices which are really vital to hear in an open society.' The two cases in Europe happened in countries with relatively strong records for media freedom. Montenegro ranks 40th out of 180 on the Press Freedom Index, where 1 represents the best environment. This position is good among West Balkan countries, according to Pavol Szalai of Reporters Without Borders, which compiles the annual index. However, the recent attack shows 'how fragile this process is,' he said via email. North Macedonia ranks 36th out of 180 on the same index.

Mozambique's president, election runner-up agree to meet for talks	Maputo, Mozambique — The runner-up in Mozambique's October 9 presidential elections, Venancio Mondlane, has accepted President Filipe Nyusi's offer to join discussions with him and three other candidates in hopes of ending weeks of postelection protests and violence that have left at least 30 people dead in the southeast African country. Nyusi called for dialogue during a state-of-the-nation address Tuesday, saying the demonstrations were limiting the activities of companies, stalling shipments from ports and putting people out of work, among other issues that are negatively affecting the nation’s economy. From his Facebook page, Mondlane said that he had accepted the dialogue offer and that he would submit his proposal on Saturday for an agenda for the talks, which are proposed for Tuesday. There was no indication the other candidates responded to Nyusi’s call. Nyusi, who will hand over his office in January to Daniel Chapo if the Constitutional Council confirms the election results, appealed for dialogue with Mondlane along with ruling party candidate Chapo and the two other presidential hopefuls, Ossufo Momade from Renamo and Lutero Simango of the Democratic Movement of Mozambique. The demonstrations broke out October 24 when the nation’s election commission declared ruling Frelimo party candidate Chapo the winner with nearly 71% of the vote. Mondlane and his Podemos party, who the commission said came in second with 20% of the vote, challenged the vote and called for protests. The advocacy group Human Rights Watch has reported that while many of the protests have been peaceful, some demonstrators have burned tires and blocked roads. Mozambique security personnel have responded with tear gas, dogs, rubber bullets and, in some cases, live ammunition. Along with the deaths, Nyusi said, more than 800 people, including 66 security officers, have been injured. Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and other groups have condemned the violent response by the security personnel, as well retaliatory violence by protesters. They have called for the release of those illegally and arbitrarily detained and have called on regional authorities to press the Mozambique government and security forces to respect fundamental human rights.

Polish foreign minister: Europe must be ready as US rethinks Ukraine strategy	Europe must be ready to fill the potential gaps in funding and weapons for Ukraine that may arise when U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office, Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski said Friday. In an exclusive sit-down interview with VOA Eastern European Bureau chief Myroslava Gongadze, Sikorski noted that Trump and fellow Republicans appear reluctant to continue robust U.S. support for Ukraine, and he said it would be crucial to leverage frozen Russian assets to sustain Ukraine's defense. Sikorski also called on EU nations to increase defense spending to meet the challenges posed by Russia’s aggression. Sikorski said solidarity between the EU and the U.S. remains vital to sustaining Ukraine’s fight, deterring further Russian aggression and safeguarding democratic values on the continent. The interview has been edited for brevity and clarity. VOA: We start with the latest development, specifically on Russia using ballistic missiles in Ukraine, basically testing ballistic missiles on the civilian population. Do you see this as a new escalation of the war, and what should the West’s response be? Polish Foreign Minister Radosław Sikorski: There's a lot of noise, as you know, as to what exactly hit Ukraine. Russia has been using ballistic missiles throughout this war, but this is alleged to have been an intercontinental ballistic missile — which normally has a different use, which, if it is the case, is on the one hand an escalation and a signal, but on the other hand also an act of desperation that Putin is unable to win in this war, and we see signs of the Russian economy in real stress. We have reports of Russian soldiers deserting. And of course, inviting mercenaries from North Korea is not exactly a sign of strength. VOA: Still, what would be Poland’s response, and how are you concerned about this latest development? You advocated for extending the air defense over part of Ukraine, western Ukraine. NATO and Brussels didn't agree. Do you think it's time to reconsider? Sikorski: Maybe, let's be precise about what the stakes are. Poland is a victim of Russian missiles and drones. We assume that they lost control, and we've had several drones, as has Lithuania and Romania, and also cruise missiles. One of them traveled two-thirds of Poland and fell 10 kilometers from my house in western Poland. There was another incident in which a Russian missile launched at western Ukraine was shot down and the debris killed two Polish citizens, obviously, on our side of the border. We also had Russian cruise missiles breaching our airspace briefly in order to hit Lviv from the west, and there is no legal or operational doubt that once this stuff is in our airspace, we have the right to shoot it down, but when we do that over our territory, the debris damages something or can kill someone. So, the debate is about whether the right of self-defense extends only to one's own airspace or to the immediate area of a neighboring country, particularly when that neighboring country is asking us to shoot Russian missiles over its territory. And you can have a genuine difference of opinion as to this issue. I personally think that when the Russians send missiles or drones into another country, the least they can expect is that they'll lose the missile or the drone. VOA: So, would you be lobbying NATO on this idea of extending protection of airspace over Ukraine? Sikorski: We've had this discussion in the summer, and no decisions were taken by the alliance. And we do want to act as an alliance, because we have an integrated radar system and integrated anti-aircraft system, and we want our allies to be able to react to any further Russian escalations jointly. VOA: Recently, you opened a new military base near Kaliningrad. This base was planned for a long time. You signed the agreement with Americans a long, long, long time ago. However, now Russia is saying that this base will be a target. How significant is the opening of this base for Poland, and how do you respond to threats from Russia? Sikorski: Well, here we are in Warsaw. I mean, that was also a target. But the base would be capable of shooting down such Russian missiles as the one that hit Ukraine a couple of days ago because it is Aegis on shore — it's essentially an American destroyer built on land, and it could handle all types of missiles, not only ones aimed at the United States but also ones aimed at Europe. Transatlantic tensions VOA: Recently, you hosted five ministers of foreign affairs of European countries here in Warsaw, and you talked about boosting defense spending, U.S.-EU collaboration and supporting Ukraine. What are the biggest challenges you see in all those three areas? Sikorski: Well, we don't know what the new administration will do in regards to supporting Ukraine. If they wanted to threaten Putin with escalation, they would have to be ready to pass another package of support for Ukraine in Congress, and so far, we see no willingness to do that. If they don't pass another package, then it's up to Europe to step in, and it would be expensive. But the war is costing us about half a percent of GDP. We are a 15 trillion-euro economy. My view is that if we allowed Putin to win, the cost of deterring him then would be much higher. So, it's better to help Ukraine, particularly as we have resources and ready finance that only requires political will to take action — namely, the frozen Russian assets, and not only the loan, but the capital itself. So, $45 billion Ukraine is getting already. We could use the remaining $250 billion. My personal judgment is that by the end of next year, the Russian economy will be really in trouble, and therefore the challenge is to sustain Ukraine for one more year, and we have the money, so that's as regards support for Ukraine. Europe also needs to do more for its own sake, but also, if we are to gain respect in Washington, we need to show Donald Trump that we listened when he was right when he demanded that European countries spend more [on defense]. Poland has done more than its fair share. We are spending 4.7% of our GDP on defense next year, more than double, almost triple, of what some richer countries are doing. But we know the realities in Germany, and constitutional court judgments in Italy and France. We also have a high budget deficit, but we've had the success of euro bonds secured on the joint credibility of the entire European Union. And it turns out that the European Commission can raise money very cheaply in the financial markets for the COVID recovery plan, hundreds of billions of euros. VOA: Experts say that Europe needs $720 billion to invest in defense and military modernization in general. Do you feel that European countries are ready to spend, that they understand the needs and are now ready to move ahead with this? Sikorski: At the Warsaw meeting, we discussed this idea. It didn't find its way into the communique, but in our conversations, there seems to be general receptiveness to such a plan. VOA: President-elect Trump is promising to achieve peace. How do you see your relationship with the U.S. now, with the old administration going and the new administration coming? Sikorski: Everybody wants peace. If Ukraine capitulated, there would be peace. So, Putin also wants peace. The question is, on what conditions? You know, under communism, we had peace, but it was like the peace of a prison. So, the question is, will the U.N. Charter be respected, and will the security and border guarantees that Ukraine already had, including from Russia, be respected? And the question is how to achieve it. The war will end, not when Ukraine stops fighting. In that case, there would simply be no Ukraine. The war will end when Putin stops fighting. So, what needs to happen is for Putin to come to the judgment that the war was a mistake and that it cannot be won at an acceptable price. And I think he's actually closer to it than he pretends. He is all braggadocio. In fact, it's a catastrophic outcome so far, and he's in trouble. He's just trying to position himself into hypothetical negotiations. But the United States, Europe and Ukraine have stronger cards than he thinks. VOA: Were you able, or will you be planning to deliver this understanding to the newly elected U.S. president? Sikorski: I'm in touch with his former officials and the people who are being talked of as future officials. Our president has been in touch with Donald Trump all along. He calls him his friend, an American hero. We hope that that personal relationship will also be effective. VOA: He [Trump] pushed Europe to put more in defense, and Europe may have to stand alone. He said that Europe has to take responsibility for its security. Sikorski: Given that America cannot handle two conflicts at the same time, and given that successive U.S. presidents have told us frankly that for them, their competition with China is the number one issue, we should take greater responsibility for our security. VOA: And Europe is ready? Sikorski: Europe is always a little tardy, because we are democracies, because you always have to make choices between guns and butter, and our societies prefer butter. But I think the scale of Russian atrocities, the pictures of civilian targets being hit, the threat of what Putin is trying to cause, which is another wave of millions of refugees — this should be a wake-up call to all Europeans.	https://www.voanews.com/a/polish-foreign-minister-europe-must-be-ready-as-us-rethinks-ukraine-strategy-/7873989.html	2024-11-22T14:19:21-08:00	
Xi Jinping wraps up G20 summit, state visit to Brazil amid growing US-China competition	RIO DE JANEIRO — As the world’s two largest economies vie for influence in South America, Brazil sits at the heart of the global power struggle. The choices the country makes in the coming years could reshape the region’s economic and political trajectory, according to analysts. Chinese President Xi Jinping’s recent visit to Brazil for a state visit and the G20 Summit marked the 50th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries and underscored Beijing's expanding influence in South America amid intensifying U.S.–China competition. Xi’s visit resulted in 37 trade and diplomatic agreements with Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. These agreements spanned agriculture, renewable energy and infrastructure development, signaling a closer partnership between the world’s second-largest economy and Latin America’s largest nation. 'Brazil has the biggest Chinese investment in the Global South. Lots of Chinese money here,' said Mauricio Santoro, political scientist and international relations expert, and author of Brazil-China Relations in the 21st Century, in an interview with VOA. 'And the Chinese and Brazilians are backing a lot of the development of green technologies, wind power, solar power. So, there’s huge potential in that.' During the visit, Xi and Lula discussed strengthening economic cooperation between China and Brazil, as well as addressing key global issues, including trade, sustainable development and geopolitical challenges. Despite the sheer volume of agreements, experts suggest that many were largely symbolic, focusing on reaffirming commitments rather than enacting concrete policies. 'Signing 37 agreements is huge. It’s likely they won’t have practical effects in the near term,' Livio Ribeiro, an expert on Sino-Brazilian trade, told VOA. 'Most of them are very broad and unspecific. Though, linkages are being tied up. They are getting stronger. I think that’s the point.' China’s expanding influence China has cemented itself as Brazil’s largest trading partner, with bilateral trade valued at close to $160 billion in 2023. Trade between the two countries has increased by nearly 10% in the first 10 months of 2024, reported China’s state news agency, Xinhua. Over the past decade, Chinese investments in Brazil, particularly in energy and infrastructure, have surged. As China deepens its footprint in South America, the United States has emphasized soft power strategies, particularly in combating climate change — a central element of Lula’s international agenda. The Biden administration increased its climate finance to $11 billion annually and contributed $50 million to Brazil’s Amazon Fund. However, analysts say China’s rise poses challenges to U.S. influence in South America. Bilateral currency agreements between Beijing and countries such as Brazil and Chile enable trade in Chinese currency, the renminbi, gradually undermining the dollar’s dominance in the region. 'Most American administrations look at Latin America as a problem. As a source of instability, of undesirable immigration, organized crime, border troubles and so on,' said Santoro. 'But when China looks to Latin America, it basically sees opportunities.' The Trump factor The incoming Trump administration may shift the dynamics of U.S.–China competition in the region, and Trump’s proposals, including a possible sweeping tariff on Chinese imports, could alienate South American nations and draw them closer to Beijing, according to experts. 'As we have Trump coming into office in January 2025, the balance of power will change,' Ribeiro told VOA. 'And for me the great question is whether Trump, knowing and understanding that he’s losing Latin America, if he will try to regain it or he’ll just let it go.' He said higher interest rates in the U.S. and a stronger dollar may exacerbate economic challenges in South America, devaluing local currencies and increasing borrowing costs. Such volatility could make Chinese partnerships more appealing. Chinese officials 'don’t believe that Trump will be able to build good relationships with the leaders of these countries,' Santoro said. Brazil’s balancing act President Lula has maintained a careful approach, strengthening ties with China without alienating the United States. His decision not to join China’s global infrastructure project, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) reflects a strategy to preserve Brazil’s diplomatic flexibility, experts said. 'That’s the precise way Brazil should deal with it,' Ribeiro told VOA. 'Because he [Lula] did not sign the Belt and Road Initiative. Therefore, the U.S. can’t say that we are going into the opposition.' Analysts note Brazil can potentially still benefit from the BRI project — for example through a proposed Brazil-Peru transcontinental railway that remains in the planning stage — while balancing diplomacy between the global rivals, analysts said. 'We are trading more and more [with China]. We are using infrastructure. We are receiving Chinese money. So, the integration that comes along with the Belt and Road is reaching us,' said Ribeiro. Some experts see opportunities for Brazil in the U.S.–China rivalry. 'If China is suffering economically with the imposition of U.S. tariffs, it could quite possibly make a deal with Brazil to bring the trade to us, using our established trade partnership,' said Brazilian writer Sergio Farias in an interview with VOA. 'I think there’s a great possibility of Brazil benefiting from this.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/xi-jinping-wraps-up-g20-summit-and-state-visit-to-brazil-amid-growing-us-china-competition-/7873982.html	2024-11-22T14:14:08-08:00

Nigeria hopes for extradition of separatist leader, but analysts are skeptical	ABUJA, NIGERIA — Nigerian military authorities are praising the arrest of separatist leader Simon Ekpa in Finland on Thursday. Ekpa was arrested along with four others for alleged terror-related activities, including incitement to violence and terrorism financing in Nigeria. In two separate statements late Thursday, Nigerian defense authorities lauded Ekpa’s arrest as a step toward his extradition to Nigeria and a validation of Nigeria's bilateral relations with the international community. Police in Finland arrested Ekpa along with four others on Thursday for suspected terrorism financing and inciting deadly violence in Nigeria's southeast region using social media. Finnish police are seeking a court order to extend their detention. The arrest comes eight months after Nigerian authorities declared Ekpa a wanted man, and three months after they appealed to a visiting European Union delegation to extradite him. Beacon Security and Intelligence analyst Kabiru Adamu said the authorities’ negotiations paid off. 'When such a bilateral conversation is held at that level, then you would've done the documentation that in most times would give you a good result,' Adamu said. Ekpa was a leader of the separatist Indigenous People of Biafra, or IPOB, a group that advocates the southeast region’s split from the rest of Nigeria but has long since politically fragmented. He rose to prominence following the arrest and incarceration of fellow IPOB leader, Nnamdi Kanu, by Nigerian authorities in June 2021. Using social media posts and broadcasts, Ekpa has been calling for a 'no work day' in Biafra every Monday to demand Kanu's release — a measure that some factions of IPOB have criticized. Following Ekpa’s arrest, Kanu’s supporters within IPOB released a statement disassociating themselves from the Ekpa. Security analyst Ebenezer Oyetakin said Ekpa's extradition can't come soon enough. 'One would've expected that when the sovereignty of a nation is being threatened by individuals or a group of individuals, that should be a wake-up call to that country's leadership, particularly the security leadership,' Oyetakin said. 'But we did not pursue this in a constructive and strategic diplomatic approach that it should be. But it is better late than never.' The secessionist campaign in Nigeria's southeast led to a civil war in 1967 that killed an estimated 1 million people, mostly from starvation. In recent years, hundreds of people including security operatives have been killed there in renewed separatist agitation. Adamu said it won't be easy for Finnish authorities to extradite Ekpa to Nigeria. 'I doubt if we have an extradition agreement between Nigeria and Finland,' Adamu said. 'And the fact that he has dual citizenship — in my understanding of international relations, it will be next to impossible for Finland to extradite him knowing that he's likely to be tried for treason and terrorism. These are offenses that could even fetch a death penalty.' Finland had previously investigated Ekpa for alleged financial crimes, including receiving money through questionable means. It's unclear if his arrest will spark more tensions in the region, but analysts say authorities must be on the lookout for a possible new Biafra separatist leader.	https://www.voanews.com/a/nigeria-hopes-for-extradition-of-separatist-leader-but-analysts-are-skeptical-/7873920.html	2024-11-22T13:20:01-08:00	
Afghan girls turn to online learning, defying Taliban education ban	washington — Saliha began taking online classes after she lost hope of returning to school to pursue her dream of becoming a doctor in Afghanistan. She was in ninth grade when U.S.-led forces withdrew from the country and the Taliban seized power in August 2021, banning girls' secondary education. 'I used to dream of finishing school and going to university,' said Saliha, 18, who did not want her family name to be revealed for security reasons. 'But now, considering all the limitations, my hope is just to have any kind of education, whether via online courses or underground school.' With the Taliban's ban on secondary education in its fourth year, some Afghan girls and young women like Saliha are looking for an alternative source of education. According to the United Nations, more than 1.4 million girls in Afghanistan have been affected by the ban. Under the Taliban, women are barred from receiving a university education, working with government and nongovernmental organizations, and going to public places, such as parks, gyms and beauty salons. Like other Afghan girls and young women, Saliha and her four sisters must remain at home, but, she said, she is determined to continue her education. 'I saved every penny to purchase a computer and pay for the internet,' she said, to continue learning online. But not all Afghan girls and women can afford to take online courses. In 2022, only 6% of women had internet access in Afghanistan, compared with 25% of men, according to Gallup. Flexibility required Pashtana Durrani, founder of LEARN Afghanistan, a digital school network in the country, told VOA that because of Afghans' varying degrees of access, her organization provides different education models. 'A one-size-fits-all approach does not work in Afghanistan. The key is being flexible and responsive to each community,' said Durrani. In addition to offering online classes, Durrani's organization runs underground schools in six provinces, educating some 700 girls. But, she said, there is a need to work with local elders to ensure more girls attend these classes. Meetra Alokozay, executive director of Sahar Education, a nonprofit working to empower women in Afghanistan, told VOA it was essential that men support female family members to attend either online or underground classes. 'We want men to support their daughters and sisters in pursuing an education,' said Alokozay. But, she said, the Taliban's return to power affected the education system in Afghanistan. UNESCO reported that the number of girls and boys enrolled in primary school dropped from 6.8 million in 2019 to 5.7 million in 2022. The ban has already taken a toll on girls and women. A primary school teacher in Kabul, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisals, told VOA that after the Taliban's takeover in 2021, parents withdrew some of her students from school even before they finished the sixth grade. 'Shortly after, they were both married off. I don't remember their exact age, but I do know they were no older than 13 years,' added the teacher. Mental health problems A report by exiled Afghan human rights watchdog Rawadari this month said that girls in Afghanistan are experiencing a deterioration in mental health and an increase in suicide attempts, in addition to being forced into marriage. 'As a result of the ban on women's education, violence against women increased, which has made life difficult for girls and women' in Afghanistan, the report said. Sahar Education's Alokozay said, 'Raising awareness about what's going on in Afghanistan is crucial. Many people, even in the U.S., are unaware of the situation.' Saliha urged the international community 'not to leave Afghan girls alone.' 'Think about us, write about us, give us opportunities to learn, and help us fight this system,' she said. 'If one door closes, help us find another.'

Trump names Pam Bondi as new nominee for US attorney general	U.S. President-elect Donald Trump's latest nominee for U.S. attorney general has established herself as a staunch conservative, Trump loyalist and outspoken defender of the president-elect, both personally and professionally. Trump announced his selection of former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi on Thursday, just hours after former Florida U.S. Congressman Matt Gaetz withdrew his name from consideration for the post. From his Truth Social media account, Trump praised Bondi and what she will bring to the office. 'For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans — Not anymore,' Trump wrote. 'Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting crime and making America safe again.' The 59-year-old Bondi was one of the lawyers on Trump's defense team during his first impeachment trial, and she played a leading role in his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Raised, educated in Florida Bondi was born and raised in Florida, received a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Florida, and a law degree from the Stetson University College of Law in DeLand, Florida. Early in her law career, Bondi worked as prosecutor and spokeswoman in Hillsborough County, where she was assistant state's attorney. In 2010, she became the first female attorney general elected to the state of Florida. In that role, 'she pioneered impactful anti-trafficking initiatives, hosted groundbreaking conferences to combat sexual exploitation, and championed innovative solutions that other states have since followed,' said the non-profit National Center on Sexual Exploitation, which welcomed her appointment in a statement Friday. While in office, Bondi defended a 2008 amendment to the state constitution that would ban same sex marriages. In 2018, she joined other Republican state attorney generals in an unsuccessful lawsuit attempting to overturn the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, more commonly known as Obamacare. Bondi received widespread criticism in 2013 when, following a $25,000 donation to a political action committee supporting her re-election campaign from the Donald J. Trump Foundation, she chose not to join a lawsuit initiated by the attorney general of New York against Trump University for 'persistent fraudulent, illegal and deceptive conduct.' Prior to the donation, Bondi had said she was considering joining the lawsuit, as her office had received at least 22 complaints about Trump University. She endorsed Trump in the Florida primary during the 2016 presidential campaign. Organization founded to advance Trump's agenda Bondi serves as chair for the Center for Litigation and co-chair of the Center for Law and Justice at the America First Policy Institute, a conservative organization that was founded in 2021 to advance Trump's agenda. Bondi is also a partner at the Washington-based Ballard Partners lobbying firm, where she chairs the firm's Corporate Regulatory Compliance practice. Some information for this report was provided by The Associated Press, Reuters and Agence France-Presse.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-names-pam-bondi-as-new-us-attorney-general-nominee/7873870.html	2024-11-22T12:57:59-08:00	
Chinese vessel suspected of severing submarine cables still anchored in Baltic Sea	London — European allies in the Baltic region are investigating how two fiber-optic data cables were severed earlier this week, with suspicion falling on a Chinese vessel in the area. Germany has said the incident was clearly sabotage. The Danish navy said this week it is following the Yi Peng 3, a Chinese bulk carrier, as it moves through the Baltic Sea. As of Friday, marine tracking systems showed the vessel anchored east of the Danish city of Aarhus. Denmark did not elaborate on why it was tracking the ship. However, there's widespread speculation the vessel may have been involved in the severing of two fiber-optic cables on the seabed, one connecting Finland and Germany and the other running between Sweden and Lithuania. Speaking Tuesday, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius was adamant it was no accident. 'I also don't like to believe in the version that these were anchors that accidentally caused — how shall I put it — damage to these cables. So, we have to conclude, without knowing exactly who did it, that it was a hybrid action. And we also have to assume, without knowing it, of course, that it is sabotage,' Pistorius told reporters in Brussels. European allies in the Baltic are collaborating on an investigation, according to defense analyst Charly Salonius-Pasternak of the Finnish Institute of International Affairs. 'There's the camp that I would say sees hybrid operations in absolutely everything. And it is one of the things I've cautioned against — that if you're in a hall of mirrors, everything looks a certain way. We don't know that,' he told VOA. 'But as we've already seen in the Baltic Sea, but [also] elsewhere, the incidents of, as it were, 'perfect timing' in terms of anchors dragging or other things — at some point you have to start drawing conclusions that this cannot be just an accident,' Salonius-Pasternak added. Several similar incidents There have been numerous similar incidents in the Baltic Sea in recent years. In October 2023, the Balticconnector gas pipeline linking Estonia and Finland was badly damaged. Ten months later, China said a Hong Kong-registered vessel, the Newnew Polar Bear, had caused the damage accidentally in a storm. Finland remains skeptical of the admission, saying there were no storms in the area on the day the damage was detected. 'At least for some countries, it may be politically convenient to label them as kind of unsolved mysteries,' Salonius-Pasternak told VOA. 'Because if you identify them — saying, in this case, definitely someone in the Chinese political establishment directed the captain to do this — what are you going to do then?' Questioned Thursday on Denmark's tracking of the Yi Peng 3 in the Baltic, Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson Li Jiang denied any knowledge. 'I do not have specific information on the Chinese vessel,' Li said. 'We are willing to maintain communication with the parties concerned in accordance with international law and jointly safeguard the safety of international seabed infrastructure. At the same time, we also hope that the normal navigational rights and legitimate interests of Chinese vessels will be effectively protected.' Baltic needs better monitoring, says leader Speaking on Friday, Estonian Prime Minister Kristen Michal said better monitoring of maritime traffic was required in the Baltic. 'What are the surveillance systems and systems acknowledging what is happening and where? Who is moving where? And, where is the fault located?' Michal asked. 'Because there can be also quite natural reasons.' In 2022, the Nord Stream pipeline carrying gas from Russia to Germany under the Baltic Sea was blown up. The perpetrator is still unknown. Western nations and Russia blame each other, while others have suggested that Ukraine carried out the attack. All deny responsibility.	https://www.voanews.com/a/chinese-vessel-suspected-of-severing-submarine-cables-still-anchored-in-baltic-sea-/7873826.html	2024-11-22T12:26:36-08:00	
Mixed martial arts star McGregor sexually assaulted woman in 2018, jury finds	dublin — Irish mixed martial arts fighter Conor McGregor sexually assaulted a woman at a party in Dublin in 2018 and must pay her nearly 250,000 euros ($259,950) in damages, a jury decided on Friday. The jury of eight women and four men reached its verdict in the civil trial at Ireland's high court after six hours and 10 minutes of deliberation. The plaintiff, Nikita Hand, alleged that McGregor sexually assaulted her on Dec. 9, 2018, and that another man, James Lawrence, did the same, the court heard during two weeks of evidence. The jury found that Lawrence did not assault Hand. McGregor left the court without commenting. McGregor, 36, denied the allegation and said he had 'fully consensual sex' with Hand. He also denied causing bruising to the plaintiff. Hand's lawyer told the jury that when she was referred to a sexual assault treatment unit the day after the alleged assault, a doctor was so concerned that he directed that photographs be taken of her injuries. Hand said that she and a friend made contact with McGregor, whom she knew, after a work Christmas party. She said they were driven by McGregor to a party in a penthouse room of a south Dublin hotel where drugs and alcohol were consumed. She said McGregor took her to a bedroom in the penthouse and sexually assaulted her. Hand's lawyer, John Gordon, said Hand was on anti-depressants, and 'full of drugs' at the time of the alleged assault. Speaking outside the court, Hand said she was overwhelmed by the support she had received and that she felt vindicated. 'I hope my story is a reminder that no matter how afraid you might be, speak up,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/mixed-martial-arts-star-mcgregor-sexually-assaulted-woman-in-2018-jury-finds-/7873696.html	2024-11-22T10:40:26-08:00	
Sixth tourist dies in tainted alcohol case in Laos	VANG VIENG, LAOS — A second Australian teenager who fell critically ill after drinking tainted alcohol in Laos has died in a hospital in Bangkok, her family said Friday, bringing the death toll in the mass poisoning of foreign tourists to six. Holly Bowles, 19, had been in critical condition on life support following the poisoning in Laos more than a week ago. 'We are so sad to say that our beautiful girl Holly is now at peace,' her family said in a statement sent to Australian Network 10 and other Australian media. 'We find comfort and solace in knowing that Holly brought so much joy and happiness to so many people.' An officer at Vang Vieng's Tourism Police office, who refused to give his name, told The Associated Press on Friday that a 'number of people' had been detained in the case but that no charges have been filed. Staff at the Nana Backpacker Hostel, which was still operating but not accepting new guests, confirmed that the manager and owner were among those taken in for questioning. Tourist police offices are common in Southeast Asia and are set up specifically to help with incidents involving tourists and other foreigners. The U.S. State Department on Friday issued a health alert for citizens traveling in Laos, warning of 'suspected methanol poisoning in Vang Vieng, possibly through the consumption of methanol-laced alcoholic drinks,' following similar alerts from other countries whose citizens were involved. Australia's prime minister announced Thursday that a 19-year-old citizen, Bianca Jones, had died in a Thai hospital where she had been evacuated for emergency treatment, and that her friend — Bowles — remained in a hospital 'fighting for her life.' A 28-year-old British woman, Simone White, also died in the suspected poisoning, the British Foreign Office said. An American and two Danish tourists also died, although specifics about the causes of death have not been released. New Zealand's Foreign Ministry said one of its citizens was sickened in Laos and was a possible victim of methanol poisoning. White's family said they were 'devastated by the loss of our beautiful, kind and loving daughter Simone,' who had 'the most wonderful energy and spark for life.' 'Our hearts go out to all other families who have been affected by this terrible tragedy,' the family said in a statement issued by law firm Squire Patton Boggs, where White worked as a lawyer. Laos is a one-party communist state with no organized opposition, and the government keeps a tight lid on information. In this case, officials have released almost no details. The Foreign Ministry has refused to comment, and in Vang Vieng the small hospital where some of the victims are believed to have been treated initially referred all questions to the town's health office on the hospital grounds. The town health officials refused to comment, saying they lacked proper permission. Methanol is sometimes added to mixed drinks at disreputable bars as a cheaper alternative to ethanol but can cause severe poisoning or death. It is also a byproduct of poorly distilled homebrew liquor and could have found its way into bar drinks inadvertently. Landlocked Laos is one of Southeast Asia's poorest nations and a popular tourist destination. Vang Vieng is particularly popular among backpackers seeking partying and adventure sports. Neil Farmiloe, a New Zealander who owns the Kiwi Kitchen restaurant in town, said many of his customers were worried about the incident. 'I think it's never happened before, so it is hopefully just a one-off incident,' said Farmiloe, who has lived in Vang Vieng for 20 years. 'It's very sad all around. I'm sure nobody intended to cause injury, but it's happened.' The two 19-year-old Australian women who have both now died fell ill on November 13 following a night out drinking with a group. They failed to check out from the Nana Backpacker Hostel as planned and were found sick in their room and then taken to Thailand for emergency treatment. Thai authorities confirmed that Jones died by 'brain swelling due to high levels of methanol found in her system.' Duong Duc Toan, the manager of the Nana Backpacker Hostel, told the AP the day before he was detained that the two women had joined other guests for free shots of Laotian vodka before heading elsewhere and returning in the early hours of the morning.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sixth-tourist-dies-in-tainted-alcohol-case-in-laos/7873675.html	2024-11-22T10:38:37-08:00	
Trump gets permission to seek dismissal of hush money case	NEW YORK — A New York judge on Friday granted Donald Trump permission to seek dismissal of the criminal case in which he was convicted in May of 34 felony counts involving hush money paid to a porn star in light of his victory in the November 5 U.S. presidential election. New York State Supreme Court Justice Juan Merchan formally delayed the sentencing of Trump, which had been scheduled to take place Tuesday. Prosecutors with Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office this week asked Merchan to consider deferring all proceedings in the case until after Trump, 78, finishes his four-year presidential term, which begins on January 20. Lawyers for Trump, a Republican, have argued that the case must be dismissed because having it loom over him while he is president would cause 'unconstitutional impediments' to his ability to govern. Bragg's office said it would argue against dismissal, but he agreed that Trump deserves time to make his case through written motions. Merchan on Friday set a December 2 deadline for Trump to file his motion to dismiss and gave prosecutors until December 9 to respond. The judge did not set a new date for sentencing or indicate how long proceedings would remain on hold. Merchan also did not indicate when he would rule on Trump's motion to dismiss. Representatives for Trump's campaign and for Bragg's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The case stemmed from a $130,000 payment Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen made to adult film actress Stormy Daniels for her silence before the 2016 election about a sexual encounter she has said she had a decade earlier with Trump, who denies it. A Manhattan jury found Trump guilty of falsifying business records to cover up his reimbursement of Cohen. It was the first time a U.S. president — former or sitting — had been convicted of or charged with a criminal offense. Trump pleaded not guilty in the case, which he has sought to portray as a politically motivated attempt by Bragg, a Democrat, to interfere with his campaign.	https://www.voanews.com/a/trump-gets-permission-to-seek-dismissal-of-hush-money-case/7873550.html	2024-11-22T09:24:12-08:00	
Violent attacks test China’s measures to address social grievances	TAIPEI, TAIWAN — Violent attacks in China this month have killed 43 people and injured more than 70, raising questions about why the tragic incidents occurred and sparking discussion and debate online. VOA spoke with observers who see a link between the incidents and a lack of effective measures to address the underlying social and mental health issues caused, in part, by the country’s current economic challenges. 'These violent attacks happen quite frequently, and one cause of the attacks is China’s sluggish economy and the direct grievances that it creates for average people across several industries and social classes,' said Kevin Slaten, the research lead of the China Dissent Monitor project under Washington-based Freedom House. In Slaten’s view, widespread grievances caused by China’s economic downturn not only caused worker protests in China but may also have forced some people to adopt more extreme measures to express their feeling of desperation. While some violent acts seem to be random, others are directed at a person or people known to the suspect. 'There are more incidents of unpaid wages toward the end of the year, and these things not only drive protests but also drive individual frustration, anger and hopelessness that leads some people to take it out through senseless violence,' Slaten said in a phone interview. In one of the most recent attacks, a 21-year-old student in the city of Wuxi, in eastern China, was reportedly so dissatisfied with his pay at an internship that he killed eight people and injured 17 more with a knife at a vocational school on November 16. In another case, a 29-year-old man rammed a car into a group of people at a factory in southeastern China’s Guangdong Province in August due to labor disputes. He injured at least eight people. Slaten said there are mechanisms designed to address grievances over pay and other issues in China, but Chinese people often are unable to resolve their problems through these channels. 'It’s difficult to bring collective cases under China’s court system, and court cases often take a long time, so for vulnerable communities that don’t have the time or resources to deal with the court system, they can’t rely on it,' Slaten said. In his view, while some Chinese citizens will try to highlight their cases through public advocacy, 'anger and desperation could motivate mass violence too.' Some experts say working-class people are often the group affected the most by China’s ongoing economic downturn. 'For hundreds of millions of migrant workers, there is not an adequate social safety net, and things like unemployment insurance are not really in place,' Eli Friedman, a professor at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, told VOA by phone. An existing trend VOA researched online reports of violent attacks in China between February and November of this year in which more than one person was killed or injured. Combined, some 120 people were killed and more than 213 were injured in those attacks. November marks the deadliest month in China. VOA’s data analysis shows knives were used in most of the attacks. Vehicles directed at people were also used. Since information about the attacks is often instantly removed from social media platforms by Chinese authorities, it can be difficult to understand the motives of the attackers or the scale and frequency of the incidents. Experts say Chinese authorities want to prevent information about violent attacks from spreading in society. Soon after each event, the government will try to censor discussions on social media platforms related to the incidents, said Dali Yang, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Chicago. 'They don’t want other people to think this is something to resort to if they can’t express their grievances, but such actions also make it very difficult for authorities to understand the underlying causes of such cases, resulting in their failure to address these causes,' Yang told VOA by phone. When VOA tried to search for posts about the car-ramming incident in Zhuhai on China’s microblogging site Weibo, which is similar to social media platform X, no relevant results were found. Despite Chinese authorities’ efforts to limit the spread of information about these attacks, Yang said, Chinese citizens are still expressing concerns about the surge of random acts of violence. 'Even without much information, I do get a sense in chat rooms on messaging apps that there is anxiety about these attacks in China. Part of the reason is because these are indiscriminate attacks happening in places with a lot of people,' he told VOA. Chinese government’s response Following the attack in Zhuhai, President Xi Jinping urged relevant authorities to 'strengthen their prevention and control of risks at the source' and 'emphasized the importance of resolving disputes in time.' China’s top prosecutorial office also pledged 'stern, strict and swift punishment for major vicious crimes to maintain social stability' and reiterated its 'zero-tolerance approach toward crimes targeting students and compromising school safety.' Local media reports revealed that some local authorities in China have started to identify specific types of high-risk individuals who might carry out indiscriminate violent attacks against the public. These include the unemployed, people who have recently ended relationships, people with low incomes and those with no channels to express their feelings. China’s basic medical insurance for city dwellers and guaranteed minimum living standards for rural residents usually provide subsidies to individuals who fit the high-risk criteria, analysts said. However, the economic downturn and lack of financial resources may make it difficult for the Chinese government to maintain these social programs. 'Their measures to identify individuals who are at risk of carrying out violent attacks against the public may be a short-term strategy to deal with social discontent, and it remains to be seen whether they resort to more repressive measures, such as using centralized ways to manage these individuals,' Lin Thung-Hong, a research fellow at the Academia Sinica in Taiwan, told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/violent-attacks-test-china-s-measures-to-address-social-grievances/7873442.html	2024-11-22T08:53:38-08:00	
‘We have taken risks to tell the stories,’ says press freedom awardee	WASHINGTON — This time last year, American journalist Alsu Kurmasheva was in a Russian prison, jailed on bogus charges. On Thursday night, free from her ordeal, she accepted a prestigious press freedom award from the Committee to Protect Journalists, or CPJ, in New York. 'This is a very emotional moment for me. It means so much,' Kurmasheva told VOA shortly before receiving her award. 'I will take this opportunity to address the whole world to repeat again that journalism is not a crime and all journalists who are behind bars today should be released at once.' A dual U.S.-Russian national who works at VOA’s sister outlet Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty in Prague, Kurmasheva was jailed in Russia for more than nine months on charges widely viewed as politically motivated. During her acceptance speech, Kurmasheva recounted her experience in prison. 'I tried not to look up as the snow was falling because I couldn’t bear seeing the many layers of barbed wire between me and the sky,' she said. Kurmasheva, American Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich and other political prisoners were released from Russia this August in a historic prisoner swap between Moscow and Washington. 'It’s an awesome responsibility to be a beacon of light, and my story is an example of the price that can be paid for reporting the truth,' Kurmasheva said Thursday night. Kurmasheva is among four journalists CPJ honored with its annual International Press Freedom Awards. The others are Quimy de Leon from Guatemala, Samira Sabou from Niger and Shrouq Al Aila from Gaza. The awardees come from different parts of the globe, but a common thread is how they have encountered efforts to criminalize journalism, said CPJ CEO Jodie Ginsberg. 'That’s something that we see increasingly across the world, is the use and abuse of laws to punish journalists for speaking truth to power,' Ginsberg told VOA. During her acceptance speech, Kurmasheva highlighted her RFE/RL colleagues who are still jailed on charges that are widely viewed as retaliatory. Journalists Ihar Losik and Andrey Kuznechyk are jailed in Belarus; Vladyslav Yesypenko is jailed in Russia-occupied Crimea; and Farid Mehralizada is jailed in Azerbaijan. RFE/RL rejects the charges against all of them as false. 'My colleagues are not just statistics. Like me, they’re real human beings with families who miss and love them,' Kurmasheva said. Like Kurmasheva, de Leon and Sabou know all too well the costs that can come with doing their jobs. Sabou, an investigative journalist, has faced years of legal harassment over her coverage of governance issues in Niger. The reporter has been jailed on multiple occasions, but she still reports. 'What would the world be without the microphones, cameras and pens of journalists?' Sabou said during her acceptance speech. Late last month, Sabou told VOA that she plans to use the platform from the award to help improve conditions for journalists in her home country. 'It’s a prize for press freedom, so what we plan to do with it is to work justly to improve the press freedom environment,' she said. De Leon has also faced legal threats and other forms of harassment over her reporting, which focuses on environmental issues and human rights in Guatemala. 'We have taken risks to tell the stories emerging from our realities and to seek truth, even when it means challenging power,' she said Thursday night. The black-tie gala was hosted this year by John Oliver, who hosts the Emmy-winning satirical news show 'Last Week Tonight.' During his opening remarks, Oliver noted that press freedom experts predict the First Amendment will be under threat in the United States during President-elect Donald Trump’s administration. 'It looks like we are going to be called on to defend journalists and media freedom right here in the United States,' Oliver said. In Ginsberg’s remarks, she said CPJ will defend journalists wherever they are under threat. 'In this moment, we will not be bullied. We will not deviate from our mission, not shrink from the challenges we face, including and especially here in the U.S.,' she said. Not all of the awardees were able to attend. Al Aila, the Palestinian journalist, was unable to leave Gaza because of the Israel-Hamas war. The war is the deadliest conflict on record for journalists, according to CPJ data. As of Thursday, at least 137 journalists and media workers were killed in the conflict, including 129 Palestinians, two Israelis and six Lebanese. 'Not only has it been impossible for international journalists to get into Gaza, but increasingly, almost impossible for journalists or anyone else to get out of Gaza,' Ginsberg told VOA. 'We are thinking of [Al Aila] and all journalists who are working under unimaginable conditions currently in Gaza.' Al Aila took charge of the independent production company Ain Media after her husband Roshdi Sarraj, who co-founded the company, was killed in the war. On Thursday night, CPJ also honored the late Christophe Deloire, former head of Reporters Without Borders, with its annual Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award. A longtime press freedom advocate, Deloire died in June from cancer. 'To everyone who carries on this legacy — here in the room tonight, and around the world — thank you. This award is for Christophe, for it is also for you,' Deloire’s wife, Perrine Daubas, said in her speech. 'Because this fight, now more than ever, is ours.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/we-have-taken-risks-to-tell-the-stories-says-press-freedom-awardee/7873482.html	2024-11-22T08:52:27-08:00	
China is expanding visa-free entry to more countries in bid to boost economy	BEIJING — China announced Friday that it would expand visa-free entry to nine more countries as it seeks to boost tourism and business travel to help revive a sluggish economy. Starting November 30, travelers from Bulgaria, Romania, Malta, Croatia, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Estonia, Latvia and Japan will be able to enter China for up to 30 days without a visa, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said. That will bring to 38 the number of countries that have been granted visa-free access since last year. Only three countries had visa-free access previously, and theirs had been eliminated during the COVID-19 pandemic. The addition of Japan appears to reflect a recent willingness on China's part to improve ties, which have soured in part over more strident talk from Tokyo on the Taiwan issue. The two countries reached a deal in September in their dispute over the release into the sea of treated but still radioactive water from the destroyed Fukushima nuclear power plant. Japan was one of the three countries with visa-free entry before the pandemic, and the government repeatedly had requested an early resumption, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi told reporters in Tokyo. 'We hope the visa exemption measure announced by the Chinese side will contribute to further smooth our exchanges between Japan and China,' he said. The permitted length of stay for visa-free entry is being increased from the previous 15 days, Lin said, and people participating in exchanges will be eligible for the first time. China has been pushing people-to-people exchange between students, academics and others to try to improve its sometimes strained relations with other countries. China strictly restricted entry during the pandemic and ended its restrictions much later than most other countries. It restored the previous visa-free access for citizens of Brunei and Singapore in July 2023, and then expanded visa-free entry to six more countries — France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain and Malaysia — on December 1 of last year. The program has since been expanded in tranches. Some countries have announced visa-free entry for Chinese citizens, notably Thailand, which wants to bring back Chinese tourists. For the three months from July through September this year, China recorded 8.2 million entries by foreigners, of which 4.9 million were visa-free, the official Xinhua News Agency said, quoting a Foreign Ministry consular official.	https://www.voanews.com/a/china-is-expanding-visa-free-entry-to-more-countries-in-bid-to-boost-economy/7873447.html	2024-11-22T07:59:14-08:00

Over 2 million children in South Sudan at risk of acute malnutrition	Juba, South Sudan — The international community warns that as many as 2 million children and 1 million pregnant or lactating mothers in South Sudan are facing acute malnutrition. Poor access to safe drinking water, sanitation and the spread of disease continue to fuel the crisis. The latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification report shows that nearly 8 million of South Sudan’s 12 million people will face acute food insecurity during the 2025 lean season, which begins in April. The country is still reeling from decades of war and intercommunal violence, UNICEF says, and the world needs to come together to save more than 2 million children and more than 1 million pregnant or lactating mothers from malnutrition. 'The number of children and pregnant and breastfeeding women in need of urgent assistance has actually increased as expected. This is not only due to the current situation but a persistent issue of malnutrition affecting many counties,' said Hamida Lasseko, UNICEF representative in South Sudan. An influx of 800,000 refugees and returnees fleeing conflict in neighboring Sudan is further straining South Sudan's food security, stretching already limited resources. In Bor, 70 kilometers north of Juba, Nyantuor Adoor Riak, a pregnant mother of five, has returned home to rebuild her life. She said when they left during the conflict in 2013, her children were malnourished. Riak hopes her unborn child will have a healthier future. A small kitchen garden, fenced with old bamboo near her compound, offers a glimmer of hope. Riak says with the Right to Grow project, her children are now not malnourished. She has learned to plant ground nuts, which, she says, are like the palm nuts given to children in nutrition centers for malnourished children. For another mother, Anyieth Anyang Deng, insecurity and flooding have turned survival into a daily struggle. She says at home, insecurity has taken everything, even her cows. When she goes to the forest to farm, it’s not safe. Insecurity is everywhere, she says. She and others used to dig and grow food, but now, that’s no longer possible. Bor County Health Officer Jacob Ajak sees the effects of malnutrition firsthand. Ajak says the challenge is the lack of food in the community. If we admit a child today and treat them, they recover, he says. But when they return home, there’s no food. He says there are health centers, but drugs are lacking. The little they have comes from partners like UNICEF. He says when a child gets sick, families can’t afford private clinics. Save the Children is setting up centers to provide food supplements for malnourished children. But UNICEF says more is needed to prevent and treat malnutrition. 'By 2025, over half a million children will face severe malnutrition, with a high risk of death, if critical services aren’t provided. Another 1.4 million will be moderately malnourished,' said Lasseko. UNICEF representative in South Sudan. The U.K. government, through its Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, has challenged South Sudan and the international community to find long-term solutions. Peggitty Pollard-Davey represents the office. 'This IPC analysis is invaluable in ensuring aid reaches those who need it most. But we must also help people support themselves and move away from reliance on humanitarian aid,' she said. Pollard Davey also emphasized the need for collaboration. 'International assistance can save lives, but this level of food insecurity and malnutrition is not inevitable. We must address the root causes to reduce reliance on aid,' she added. South Sudan's malnutrition crisis stems from multiple factors, including poverty, food insecurity, and poor hygiene. Diseases like cholera make the situation worse. Addressing these root causes is crucial to preventing malnutrition and saving lives.	https://www.voanews.com/a/over-2-million-children-in-south-sudan-at-risk-of-acute-malnutrition-/7873310.html	2024-11-22T06:02:45-08:00	
Israel strikes Gaza after ICC issues arrest warrants	JERUSALEM — Israel's military said on Friday it had killed two commanders involved in Hamas' October 7, 2023, attack, pressing its north Gaza offensive a day after the International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants over the war. With Israel also fighting Hamas ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, live AFPTV footage showed several strikes early Friday on Beirut's southern suburbs, where the Iran-backed group holds sway. The International Criminal Court (ICC) on Thursday said that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant may bear 'criminal responsibility' for the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare and other crimes against humanity against Palestinians in the besieged Gaza Strip. The Hague-based court's decision drew mixed reactions from world leaders, with some vowing to arrest the Israelis if they entered their country's territory. Other leaders, including U.S. President Joe Biden, have condemned the court's decision which Netanyahu dismissed as 'absurd' and 'driven by anti-Semitic hatred of Israel.' Israel has similarly pushed back against accusations of genocide in its war against Hamas, with a case brought before the International Court of Justice in December and, more recently, a report issued by a U.N. special committee last week. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated a terrorist organization by the United States, Britain, European Union and others. On the ground in Gaza, the military said an air strike on the territory's north killed five Hamas militants including two company commanders 'who participated in the October 7 massacre' last year. Medics said dozens were killed or missing after an overnight Israeli raid on Beit Lahia and nearby Jabalia, which are among the targets of a sweeping Israeli assault on north Gaza. The civil defense agency was not immediately able to provide an exact toll. Biden vows support Biden, in a statement responding to the ICC's arrest warrants, called them 'outrageous,' vowing to 'always stand with Israel against threats to its security.' China, which like Israel and the United States is not a member of the ICC, urged the court to 'uphold an objective and just position.' Foreign ministry spokesperson Lin Jian said that Beijing 'supports any efforts... that are conducive to achieving fairness and justice.' The ICC also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas's military chief Mohammed Deif, accusing him of responsibility for war crimes and crimes against humanity over the attack on Israel that sparked the war, as well as 'sexual and gender-based violence' against hostages. Israel said it killed Deif in July, but Hamas has not confirmed his death. The Palestinian Authority and Hamas both welcomed the warrants -- though without mentioning Deif. Iran, which backs Hamas, Hezbollah and other armed groups in the region, praised the arrest warrants against the Israeli leaders. 'This means the end and political death of the Zionist regime,' said Revolutionary Guards chief General Hossein Salami. The ICC's move theoretically limits the movement of Netanyahu, as any of the court's 124 national members would be obliged to arrest him on their territory. But on Friday, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban said he would invite Netanyahu to visit and defy the 'cynical' and 'political' ICC warrant. The Israeli prime minister, in a video statement, said that 'no outrageous anti-Israel decision will prevent us... from continuing to defend our country in every way.' 'Enough' Vowing to stop Hamas from regrouping in the already devastated north of the Gaza Strip, Israel launched a sweeping assault on the area in early October. In Gaza City, one man who said he took his cousins to hospital after a strike urged 'the world... to put an end' to the war. 'We've had enough,' said Belal, who only gave his first name. 'I've lost my entire family -- 10 family members gone, and I'm the only one left... All we want is an end to this injustice we're living. We want nothing else.' At least 44,056 people have been killed in Gaza in more than 13 months of war, most of them civilians, according to figures from the Hamas-ruled territory's health ministry which the United Nations considers reliable. It was triggered by the deadliest attack in Israeli history, which resulted in the deaths of 1,206 people, mostly civilians, according to an AFP tally of Israeli official figures. In Lebanon, AFPTV footage showed plumes of smoke rising over south Beirut after the Israeli military called for the evacuation of three locations, warning on social media of imminent attacks. The military later said in a statement its 'fighter jets completed a new round of strikes' on Beirut's southern suburbs. The latest raids follow intense Israeli attacks on south Beirut as well as other areas in Lebanon's south and east, where Israel says it has been targeting Hezbollah militants. More than 11 months of cross-border fire between Israel and Hezbollah over the Gaza conflict escalated into all-out war in September, with Israel conducting an extensive bombing campaign and sending ground troops into southern Lebanon. The Lebanese health ministry said at least 52 people were killed on Thursday in Israeli strikes, including some 40 dead in Lebanon's east, taking its overall death toll since October 2023 to 3,583 people.	https://www.voanews.com/a/israel-strikes-gaza-after-icc-issues-arrest-warrants/7873145.html	2024-11-22T02:49:12-08:00	
Russian drone attack on Sumy kills 2, injures 12, local authorities say	KYIV, UKRAINE — A Russian drone attack on the northeastern Ukrainian city of Sumy killed two people and injured 12 on Friday morning, regional authorities said. Twelve apartment buildings, five private residences, a store and three cars were damaged after three drones attacked the city around 5 a.m. (0300 GMT), the national police said. Volodymyr Artiukh, Sumy regional governor, said Russian forces had equipped drones with shrapnel for the attack on a densely populated area of the city. 'This weapon is used... exclusively (to kill) people,' Artiukh said, pointing to scars on a damaged building. 'Not for a facility, but in order to destroy more people.' The video posted by Sumy regional military administration following the attack showed damaged cars and buildings with blown-out windows. Russia has pummeled the region and its critical infrastructure in deadly attacks over the past weeks. An overnight drone attack on Tuesday on the small town of Hlukhiv in the region killed 12 people, including a child. On Sunday evening, a missile attack on Sumy killed 11 and injured 89 more people, in addition to leaving the region's administrative center without power.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russian-drone-attack-on-sumy-kills-2-injures-12-local-authorities-say/7873121.html	2024-11-22T01:48:42-08:00	
Russia gave North Korea anti-air missiles in exchange for troops, Seoul says	SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Russia gave North Korea anti-air missiles in exchange for deploying troops to support Moscow's war in Ukraine, Seoul's top security adviser said Friday. The United States and South Korea have accused the nuclear-armed North of sending more than 10,000 soldiers to help Russia fight Ukraine, with experts saying Kim Jong Un was eager to gain advanced technology, and battle experience for his troops, in return. Asked what Seoul believes Pyongyang has received for the troops, top security advisor Shin Won-sik said: 'It has been identified that equipment and anti-aircraft missiles aimed at reinforcing Pyonyang's vulnerable air defense system have been delivered to North Korea.' Speaking to local broadcaster SBS, Shin added that North Korea has received 'various forms of economic support' and 'following the failure (launch) on May 27, North Korea has been working on satellite-related technology.' Experts have previously said that in return for the troops, North Korea was likely aiming to acquire military technology, ranging from surveillance satellites to submarines, as well as possible security guarantees from Moscow. North Korean leader Kim and Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a strategic partnership treaty in June, during the Kremlin chief's visit. It obligates both states to provide military assistance 'without delay' in the case of an attack on the other and to cooperate internationally to oppose Western sanctions. Putin hailed the deal as a 'breakthrough document.' Experts say Pyongyang could be using Ukraine as a means of realigning foreign policy. By sending soldiers, North Korea is positioning itself within the Russian war economy as a supplier of weapons, military support and labor -- potentially bypassing its traditional ally, neighbor and main trading partner, China, according to analysts. Russia can also provide North Korea access to its vast natural resources, such as oil and gas, they say. North Korean Foreign Minister Choe Son Hui recently visited Moscow and said her country would 'stand firmly by our Russian comrades until victory day.' She called Moscow's offensive against Ukraine a 'sacred struggle' and said Pyongyang believed in Putin's 'wise leadership.' North Korea and Russia are under rafts of UN sanctions -- Kim for his nuclear weapons program, and Moscow for the Ukraine war. When asked publicly about the deployment of North Korean troops last month, Putin deflected the question to criticize the West's support of Ukraine. North Korea said last month that any troop deployment to Russia would be 'an act conforming with the regulations of international law,' but stopped short of confirming that it had sent soldiers. North Korea's deployment of troops has led to a shift in tone from Seoul, which has resisted calls to send lethal weapons to Kyiv but recently indicated it might change its long-standing policy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-gave-north-korea-anti-air-missiles-in-exchange-for-troops-seoul-says/7873098.html	2024-11-22T00:13:00-08:00	
Storm dumps record rain and heavy snow on Northern California	FORESTVILLE, CALIFORNIA — A major storm moving through Northern California on Thursday dropped heavy snow and record rain, flooding some areas, after killing two people and knocking out power to hundreds of thousands in the Pacific Northwest. Forecasters warned that the risk of flash flooding and rockslides would continue, and scores of flights were canceled at San Francisco's airport. In Washington, nearly 223,000 people — mostly in the Seattle area — remained without power as crews worked to clear streets of electrical lines, fallen branches and debris. Utility officials said the outages, which began Tuesday, could last into Saturday. Meanwhile on the East Coast, where rare wildfires have raged, New York and New Jersey welcomed much-needed rain that could ease the fire danger for the rest of the year. The National Weather Service extended a flood watch into Saturday for areas north of San Francisco as the region was inundated by this season's strongest atmospheric river — a long plume of moisture that forms over an ocean and flows through the sky over land. The system roared ashore Tuesday as a ' bomb cyclone,' which occurs when a cyclone intensifies rapidly. It unleashed fierce winds that toppled trees onto roads, vehicles and homes, killing at least two people in the Washington cities of Lynnwood and Bellevue. Communities in Washington opened warming centers offering free internet and device charging. Some medical clinics closed because of power outages. 'I’ve been here since the mid-’80s. I haven’t seen anything like this,' said Trish Bloor, who serves on the city of Issaquah’s Human Resources Commission, as she surveyed damaged homes. Up to 41 centimeters of rain was forecast in southwestern Oregon and California's northern counties through Friday. Santa Rosa saw 16.5 centimeters of rain in the last 24 hours, marking the wettest day on record since 1998, according to Joe Wegman, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service. The Sonoma County Airport, in the wine country north of San Francisco, got more than 28 centimeters within the last 48 hours. The Ukiah Municipal Airport recorded about 7.6 centimeters Wednesday, and the unincorporated town of Venado had about 32.3 centimeters in 48 hours. In nearby Forestville, one person was hurt when a tree fell on a house. Small landslides were reported across the North Bay, including one on State Route 281 on Wednesday that caused a car crash, according to Marc Chenard, a weather service meteorologist. Daniela Alvarado said calls to her and her father’s Sonoma County-based tree business have nearly tripled in the last few days, with people reaching out about trimming or removing trees. 'We feel sad, scared, but also ready for action,' Alvarado said. Rain slowed somewhat, but 'persistent heavy rain will enter the picture again by Friday morning,' the weather service's San Francisco office said on the social platform X. 'We are not done!' Dangerous flash flooding, rockslides and debris flows were possible, especially where hillsides were loosened by recent wildfires, officials warned. Scott Rowe, a hydrologist with the weather service in Sacramento, said that so far the ground has been able to absorb the rain in Butte and Tehama counties, where the Park Fire burned this summer. 'It’s not necessarily how much rain falls; it’s how fast the rain falls,' Rowe said. Santa Rosa Division Chief Fire Marshal Paul Lowenthal said 100 vehicles were stuck for hours in the parking lot of a hotel and medical center after being swamped by thigh-high waters from a flooded creek. A winter storm watch was in place for the northern Sierra Nevada above 1,070 meters, with 38 centimeters of snow possible over two days. Wind gusts could top 121 kph in mountain areas, forecasters said. Sugar Bowl Resort, north of Lake Tahoe near Donner Summit, picked up 30 centimeters of snow overnight, marketing manager Maggie Eshbaugh said Thursday. She said the resort will welcome skiers and boarders on Friday, the earliest opening date in 20 years, 'and then we’re going to get another whopping of another foot or so on Saturday, so this is fantastic.' Another popular resort, Palisades Tahoe, said it is also opening Friday, five days ahead of schedule. The storm already dumped more than 30 centimeters of snow along the Cascades in Oregon by Wednesday night, according to the weather service. More than a dozen schools closed in the Seattle area Wednesday, and some opted to extend the closures through Thursday. Covington Medical Center southeast of Seattle postponed elective surgeries and diverted ambulances after losing power and having to rely on generators Tuesday night into Wednesday, according to Scott Thompson, spokesperson for MultiCare Health System. Nearby, MultiCare clinics closed Wednesday and Thursday after losing power. In Enumclaw, also southeast of Seattle, residents were cleaning up after their town clocked the highest winds in the state Tuesday night: 119 kph. Ben Gibbard, lead singer of the indie rock bands Death Cab for Cutie and Postal Service, drove from his Seattle neighborhood Thursday morning to the woods of Tiger Mountain for his regular weekday run, but trees were blocking the trail. 'We didn’t get hit that hard in the city,' he said. 'I just didn’t assume it would be this kind of situation out here. Obviously you feel the most for people who had their homes partially destroyed by this.' Washington Gov. Jay Inslee thanked utility crews for toiling around the clock. It could take weeks to assess the scope of the damage and put a dollar figure on it, he said in a statement, and after that 'we’ll know whether we will be able to seek federal assistance.' In California, there were reports of nearly 13,000 power outages. Authorities limited vehicle traffic on part of northbound Interstate 5 between Redding and Yreka due to snow, according to California's Department of Transportation. Officials also shut down a 3.2-kilometer stretch of the scenic Avenue of the Giants, named for its towering coast redwoods, due to flooding. About 550 flights were delayed and dozens were canceled Thursday at San Francisco International Airport, according to tracking service FlightAware. Parched areas of the Northeast got a much-needed shot of precipitation, providing a bit of respite in a region plagued by wildfires and dwindling water supplies. More than 5 centimeters was expected by Saturday morning north of New York City, with snow mixed in at higher elevations. Weather service meteorologist Brian Ciemnecki in New York City, which this week saw its first drought warning in 22 years, said 'any rainfall is going to be significant' but the storm will not be enough to end the drought.	https://www.voanews.com/a/storm-dumps-record-rain-and-heavy-snow-on-northern-california/7873095.html	2024-11-21T23:56:52-08:00	
US agency votes to launch review, update undersea telecommunications cable rules	WASHINGTON — The Federal Communications Commission voted on Thursday to propose new rules governing undersea internet cables in the face of growing security concerns, as part of a review of regulations on the links that handle nearly all the world's online traffic. The FCC voted 5-0 on proposed updates to address the national security concerns over the global network of more than 400 subsea cables that handle more than 98% of international internet traffic. 'With the expansion of data centers, rise of cloud computing, and increasing bandwidth demands of new large language models, these facilities are poised to grow even more critical,' FCC Chair Jessica Rosenworcel said. Baltic nations said this week they are investigating whether the cutting of two fiber-optic undersea telecommunication cables in the Baltic Sea was sabotage. Rosenworcel noted that in 2023 Taiwan accused two Chinese vessels of cutting the only two cables that support internet access on the Matsu Islands and Houthi attacks in the Red Sea may have been responsible for the cutting of three cables providing internet service to Europe and Asia. 'While the details of these incidents remain in dispute, what is clear is that these facilities -- with locations that are openly published to prevent damage -- are becoming a target,' Rosenworcel said. The Chinese Embassy in Washington said 'turning undersea cables into a political and security issue severely disrupts international market rules, threatens global digital connectivity and cybersecurity, and denies other countries, especially developing countries, the right to develop their undersea cable industry.' The FCC is conducting its first major review since 2001 and proposing to bar foreign companies that have been denied telecommunications licenses on national security grounds from obtaining submarine cable landing licenses. It also proposes to bar the use of equipment or services in those undersea cable facilities from companies on an FCC list of companies deemed to pose threats to U.S national security including Huawei, ZTE 000063.SZ 601728.SS, China Telecom 0728.HK and China Mobile 600941.SS. FCC Commissioner Geoffrey Starks said the commission is considering whether to bar companies from getting undersea cable licenses that are on other lists like the Commerce Department's Consolidated Screening List. 'China has made no secret of its goal to control the market, and therefore the data that flows throughout the world,' Starks said. Last month, a bipartisan group of eight U.S. senators called on President Joe Biden to undertake 'a review of existing vulnerabilities to global undersea cable infrastructure, including the threat of sabotage by Russia and China.' The United States has for years expressed concerns about China’s role in handling network traffic and potential for espionage. Since 2020, U.S. regulators have been instrumental in the cancellation of four cables whose backers had wanted to link the United States with Hong Kong. In June, the FCC advanced a proposal to boost the security of information transmitted across the internet after government agencies said a Chinese carrier misrouted traffic.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-agency-votes-to-launch-review-update-undersea-telecommunications-cable-rules/7873090.html	2024-11-21T23:28:52-08:00

Feds outline 'necessary steps' for Colorado River agreement by 2026	LAS VEGAS — Federal water officials made public on Wednesday what they called 'necessary steps' for seven states and multiple tribes that use Colorado River water and hydropower to meet an August 2026 deadline for deciding how to manage the waterway in the future. 'Today, we show our collective work,' Bureau of Reclamation Commissioner Camille Calimlim Touton said as she outlined four proposals for action and one 'no action' alternative that she and Biden's government will leave for the incoming Trump Administration — with formal environmental assessments still to come and just 20 months to act. The announcement offered no recommendation or decision about how to divvy up water from the river, which provides electricity to millions of homes and businesses, irrigates vast stretches of desert farmland and reaches kitchen faucets in cities including Denver, Salt Lake City, Albuquerque, Las Vegas, Phoenix and Los Angeles. Instead it provided a bullet-point sample of elements from competing proposals submitted last March by three key river stakeholders: Upper Basin states Colorado, Utah, New Mexico and Wyoming, where most of the water originates; Lower Basin states California, Arizona and Nevada, which rely most on water captured by dams at lakes Powell and Mead; and more than two dozen Native American tribes with rights to river water. 'They're not going to take the any of the proposals,' said Sarah Porter, director of the Kyl Center for Water Policy at Arizona State University. 'The federal government put the components together in a different way ... and modeled them to provide near-maximum flexibility for negotiations to continue.' One alternative would have the government act to 'protect critical infrastructure' including dams and oversee how much river water is delivered, relying on existing agreements during periods when demand outstrips supply. 'But there would be no new delivery and storage mechanisms,' the announcement said. A second option would add delivery and storage for Lake Powell and Lake Mead, along with 'federal and non-federal storage' to boost system sustainability and flexibility 'through a new approach to distributing' water during shortages. The third, dubbed 'cooperative conservation,' cited a proposal from advocates aimed at managing and gauging water releases from Lake Powell amid 'shared contributions to sustain system integrity.' And a fourth, hybrid proposal includes parts of Upper and Lower Basin and Tribal Nations plans, the announcement said. It would add delivery and storage for Powell and Mead, encourage conservation and agreements for water use among customers and 'afford the Tribal and non-Tribal entities the same ability to use these mechanisms.' The 'no action' option does not meet the purpose of study but was included because it is required under the National Environmental Policy Act, the announcement said. In 2026, legal agreements that apportion the river will expire. That means that amid the effects of climate change and more than 20 years of drought, river stakeholders and the federal government have just months to agree what to do. 'We still have a pretty wide gap between us,' Tom Buschatzke, Arizona's main negotiator on the Colorado River, said in a conference call with reporters. He referred to positions of Upper Basin and Lower Basin states. Tribes including the Gila River Indian Community in Arizona have also been flexing their long-held water rights. Buschatzke said he saw 'some really positive elements' in the alternatives but needed time to review them in detail. 'I think anything that could be done to move things forward on a faster track is a good thing,' he said. Democratic U.S. Sen. John Hickenlooper of Colorado said in a statement the alternatives 'underscore how serious a situation we're facing on the Colorado River.' 'The only path forward is a collaborative, seven-state plan to solve the Colorado River crisis without taking this to court,' he said. 'Otherwise, we'll watch the river run dry while we sue each other.' Wednesday's announcement came two weeks after Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris lost the election to Republican former President Donald Trump, and two weeks ahead of a key meeting of the involved parties at Colorado River Water Users Association meetings in Las Vegas. Kyle Roerink, executive director of the Great Basin Water Network advocacy group, said 'snapshots' offered in the announcement 'underscore the uncertainty that is swirling around future river management as a new administration prepares to take office.' 'The river needs basin-wide curtailments, agreements to make tribes whole, a moratorium on new dams and diversions, commitments for endangered species and new thinking about outdated infrastructure,' he said. Buschatzke declined to speculate about whether Trump administration officials will pick up where Biden's leaves off. But Porter, at the Kyl Center, said the announcement 'shows an expectation of continuity.' 'The leadership is going to change, but there are a lot of people who have been working on this for a long time who will still be involved in the negotiations and modeling,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/feds-outline-necessary-steps-for-colorado-river-agreement-by-2026/7873043.html	2024-11-21T19:50:17-08:00	
Democrat Casey concedes to Republican McCormick in Pennsylvania Senate contest	HARRISBURG, PENNSYLVANIA — Democratic Senator Bob Casey of Pennsylvania conceded his reelection bid to Republican David McCormick on Thursday, as a statewide recount showed no signs of closing the gap, and his campaign suffered repeated blows in court in its effort to get potentially favorable ballots counted. Casey's concession comes more than two weeks after Election Day, as a grindingly slow ballot-counting process became a spectacle of hourslong election board meetings, social media outrage, lawsuits and accusations that some county officials were openly flouting the law. Republicans had been claiming that Democrats were trying to steal McCormick's seat by counting 'illegal votes.' Casey's campaign had accused Republicans of trying to block enough votes to prevent him from pulling ahead and winning. In a statement, Casey said he had just called McCormick to congratulate him. 'As the first count of ballots is completed, Pennsylvanians can move forward with the knowledge that their voices were heard, whether their vote was the first to be counted or the last,' Casey said. The Associated Press called the race for McCormick on November 7, concluding that not enough ballots remained to be counted in areas Casey was winning for him to take the lead. As of Thursday, McCormick led by about 16,000 votes out of almost 7 million ballots counted. That was well within the 0.5% margin threshold to trigger an automatic statewide recount under Pennsylvania law. But no election official expected a recount to change more than a couple hundred votes or so, and Pennsylvania's highest court dealt Casey a blow when it refused entreaties to allow counties to count mail-in ballots that lacked a correct handwritten date on the return envelope. Republicans will have a 53-47 majority next year in the U.S. Senate.	https://www.voanews.com/a/democrat-casey-concedes-to-republican-mccormick-in-pennsylvania-senate-contest-/7873040.html	2024-11-21T19:31:19-08:00	
Dr. Oz nominated to oversee Medicare, Medicaid	WASHINGTON — Mehmet Oz, a renowned heart surgeon and television host best known for 'The Dr. Oz Show,' has been nominated by President-elect Donald Trump to serve as administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS. If confirmed by the Senate, Oz will oversee two of the nation's most vital health insurance programs, which provide coverage for elderly and low-income Americans. Born in Cleveland, Ohio, in 1960, Oz is the son of Turkish immigrants — Dr. Mustafa Oz, a thoracic cardiovascular surgeon, and Suna Oz. Raised in Wilmington, Delaware, Oz graduated from Harvard University in 1982 with a degree in biology before earning joint medical and master of business administration degrees from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine and Penn's Wharton School in 1986. Oz built his medical career as a prominent cardiac surgeon in New York City, where he developed innovative medical devices and authored bestselling health books that have been translated into many languages, including Turkish. His rise to national fame began after he appeared as a regular guest on 'The Oprah Winfrey Show.' He launched 'The Dr. Oz Show' in 2009, which ran for 13 seasons, dealing with topics on health and wellness, and won nine Emmy Awards. Trump also noted Oz's multiple TV awards in a written statement after he nominated him for the CMS position, adding Oz 'taught millions of Americans how to make healthier lifestyle choices.' Meeting Trump In a statement in 2022 to The Associated Press, Oz said he first met Trump in 2004 or 2005, when he asked the future president for permission to use his golf course to organize an event for his children's charity. Although the two later met at social events, the most well-known public moment was during the 2016 presidential campaign when Oz interviewed Trump on his television show, in which Trump revealed his medical records. In 2018 — during his first term as president — Trump appointed Oz to the President's Council on Sports, Fitness and Nutrition. While praised for his ability to communicate complex medical issues, Oz faced criticism for promoting unproven health products and for alleged conflicts of interest in endorsing commercial products. The controversy peaked in 2014, when he was called to testify before a Senate subcommittee about his promotion of weight loss products with questionable scientific backing. While Oz has not been found to be involved in medical weight loss fraud, his remarks on his television program have been used in campaigns to market weight loss products and sell them online in many countries. Political aspirations Oz entered the political arena in late 2021 because of what he saw as a failure of the U.S. to manage the COVID-19 pandemic. He announced his candidacy for a U.S. Senate seat in the eastern state of Pennsylvania as a Republican. Despite receiving Trump's endorsement, his campaign was scrutinized over his dual U.S.-Turkish citizenship. Opponents, including President Joe Biden, also criticized Oz for running for a Senate seat in Pennsylvania when his longtime home was in New Jersey. Opponents have criticized Oz for showing a lack of loyalty to the U.S. after a photo of him voting in the 2018 Turkish presidential election was posted on the official Facebook account of the Turkish Consulate General in New York. Oz also starred in Turkish Airlines' multimillion-dollar Super Bowl commercial in 2018. As a brand ambassador in 2021, he appeared in a 4-minute, in-flight briefing video, featuring the airline's COVID-19 safety protocols. Oz has often said that he maintains dual U.S.-Turkish citizenship to care for his mother, who lives in Turkey and has Alzheimer's disease. He served in the Turkish army in the early 1980s to retain his Turkish citizenship. Sixty days of training was mandatory for citizens who reside in foreign countries. Facing such criticism when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 2022, Oz said he would renounce his Turkish citizenship if elected. He lost the race to Democrat John Fetterman. Despite retreating from the public eye after his Senate loss, Oz's nomination to lead the CMS marks a return to national prominence. If confirmed, he will oversee a $1.1 trillion budget and programs that provide health care to nearly half of the U.S. population. As the Senate considers his nomination, Oz faces the challenge of transitioning from media personality to federal administrator, taking on a pivotal role in shaping the future of American health care. Some information for this report came from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/dr-oz-nominated-to-oversee-medicare-medicaid/7873017.html	2024-11-21T18:53:05-08:00	
IAEA board orders Iran to cooperate more; West pushes Tehran toward talks	VIENNA — The United Nations atomic watchdog's 35-nation Board of Governors passed a resolution on Thursday again ordering Iran to urgently improve cooperation with the agency and requesting a 'comprehensive' report aimed at pressuring Iran into fresh nuclear talks. Britain, France, Germany and the United States, which proposed the resolution, dismissed as insufficient and insincere a last-minute Iranian move to cap its stock of uranium that is close to weapons-grade. Diplomats said Iran's move was conditional on scrapping the resolution. Iran tends to bristle at such resolutions and has said it would respond in kind to this one. After previous criticism at the International Atomic Energy Agency's Board, it has stepped up its nuclear activities and reduced IAEA oversight. China, Russia and Burkina Faso voted against the text, diplomats in the meeting said. Nineteen countries voted in favor and 12 abstained. Standoffs The IAEA and Iran have long been locked in standoffs on a range of issues, including Tehran's failure to explain uranium traces found at undeclared sites, its barring last year of most of the agency's top uranium-enrichment experts on the Iran inspection team, and its refusal to expand IAEA monitoring. The resolution seen by Reuters repeated wording from a November 2022 resolution that it was 'essential and urgent' for Iran to explain the uranium traces and let the IAEA take samples as necessary. The resolution in June of this year did the same. The new text asked the IAEA to issue 'a comprehensive and updated assessment on the possible presence or use of undeclared nuclear material in connection with past and present outstanding issues regarding Iran's nuclear program, including a full account of Iran's cooperation with the IAEA on these issues.' Western powers hope that report, due by spring 2025, will pressure Iran into negotiations on fresh restrictions on its nuclear activities, albeit less far-reaching ones than in a 2015 deal with major powers that unraveled after then-President Donald Trump withdrew the United States from it in 2018. With Trump set to return to office in January and Iran having taken its uranium enrichment far beyond the deal's limits, it is far from clear whether Trump would back negotiations aimed at setting new limits before those of the 2015 deal are lifted on 'termination day' in October of next year. If no new limits are agreed before then, the report could be used to strengthen the case for so-called 'snapback,' a process under the 2015 deal where the issue is sent to the U.N. Security Council and sanctions lifted under the deal can be re-imposed. Iranian reaction Last week IAEA chief Rafael Grossi visited Tehran, hoping to persuade new Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, who is seen as relatively moderate, to improve Iran's cooperation with the agency. Grossi formally reported to member states on Tuesday that 'the possibility of Iran not further expanding its stockpile of uranium enriched up to 60% U-235 was discussed' in his meetings with Iranian officials, and that the IAEA had verified Iran had 'begun implementation of preparatory measures.' Iran already has enough material enriched to that level — close to the roughly 90% purity that is weapons grade — for four nuclear weapons if enriched further, according to an IAEA yardstick. It has enough material enriched to lower levels for more bombs, but Iran denies seeking nuclear weapons. Grossi said on Wednesday he had asked Iran to cap that stock of 60% material and Iran had accepted his request. He said at a news conference that day that it was 'a concrete step in the right direction,' suggesting that he felt a resolution could undermine that progress. With the resolution passed, Iran is likely to respond. Moments after the vote, Iranian state media cited a joint statement by the foreign ministry and the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran saying Iran's nuclear chief Mohammad Eslami has issued orders for measures like activating various new and advanced centrifuges, machines that enrich uranium. 'If there is a resolution, it [Iran] will either increase its activities or reduce the agency's access,' a senior diplomat said before the vote.	https://www.voanews.com/a/iaea-board-orders-iran-to-cooperate-more-west-pushes-tehran-toward-talks/7872720.html	2024-11-21T16:35:58-08:00

Human rights violations escalate in Iran: 133 executions in one month	A human rights organization, in a detailed report, highlighted the Islamic Republic of Iran's practice of issuing and carrying out death sentences. The report revealed that during the month of Aban (October 23–November 21), at least 133 executions took place, including one public execution. Additionally, 24 new death sentences were issued, and seven previously issued sentences were reaffirmed by the courts during that period.

New EU diplomat vows tough stance on China, strong alliance with US	VIENNA, AUSTRIA — Kaja Kallas, the European Union's next foreign policy chief, is already sending signals that she will take a tough stance on Russia and China and be an advocate for a strong alliance between Europe and America. Kallas spoke to the European Parliament for the first time in her new role at a hearing on November 12, where she stressed that the EU will be steadfast in its commitment to support Ukraine against Russian aggression. She begins her five-year term as the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy on December 1. The former Estonian prime minister warned that Russia, Iran, North Korea and — more covertly — China want to change the rules-based world order. She called on the EU to respond to this threat alongside its closest allies and partners 'without losing an inch of who we are.' Elze Pinelyte, an expert at the European Economic and Social Committee (EESC) with a focus on Sino-EU relations, told VOA Mandarin that Kallas' policies 'remain firmly supporting Ukraine's victory.' In response to worries that the incoming Trump administration may reduce U.S. support for Ukraine, Kallas stressed that the United States' strategic interests in China are inseparable from the outcome of the war on Ukraine. 'If the U.S. is worried about China and other actors, they should also be worried about how we respond to Russia against Ukraine,' Kallas said during the November 12 hearing. Ivan U. Kłyszcz, a researcher at the Estonian International Defense and Security Center, told VOA Mandarin, that Kallas 'reflects the view that Europe needs to do more for its own defense and security, and this is not inconsistent with NATO and the European and American alliance.' As for whether the second Trump administration will change Brussels' considerations, he said, 'there are still too many unknowns.' Tougher policy toward China Kallas' tough stance toward China was first seen during her tenure as prime minister of Estonia, when her government advocated that Estonia's China policy should be promoted within the framework of EU-China relations. In 2022, Estonia announced its withdrawal from the Beijing-led 'Cooperation between China and Central and Eastern European Countries,' the so-called '16+1' mechanism. After the European Parliament elections this year, Kallas was nominated as the candidate for new foreign policy chief. She then resigned as prime minister of Estonia. Some experts say Kallas will take a tougher policy toward China than her predecessor Josep Borrell. Pinelyte agreed and added that Kallas likely will 'seek support to limit China's ability to fight Russia's war.' Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the EU has condemned Beijing's support for Moscow. Kallas said that without China's support, 'Russia cannot maintain the war with the same intensity.' China should face 'a higher cost' for supporting Russia in the war against Ukraine, Kallas said, hinting at more deterrent sanctions. In October, Kallas wrote to the European Parliament that during her tenure as EU high representative on foreign policy, she would be committed to countering Russia's 'imperialist dream' and China's 'unfair competition.' A trade dispute between the EU and China over products such as electric vehicles has lasted for more than a year, and negotiations are still ongoing. The EU said China's large subsidies for electric vehicles constitute unfair competition. Unpredictable alliance It is not clear whether the Trump administration will continue to provide security guarantees and support to Ukraine, and whether it will impose higher tariffs on the European Union. Given the United States' greater focus on the Indo-Pacific region and its strategic competition with China, many European leaders are calling on the EU to reduce its security dependence on the United States. Pinelyte at EESC said 'Kallas seems to have taken office at a time when the idea of an alliance with the United States is outdated.' Abigael Vasselier, director of policy and European affairs at the German Mercator Institute for China Studies, told VOA that the EU needs to avoid the state of panic it fell into with the first Trump administration. Instead, she said, it must seek to coordinate with the second Trump administration, including 'making recommendations' on China issues. 'The EU needs to be prepared because the Trump and Biden administrations will have completely different approaches to China,' she said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/new-top-eu-diplomat-vows-tougher-stance-on-china-strong-alliance-with-us-/7872696.html	2024-11-21T15:34:05-08:00	
Heavy gunfire erupts in South Sudan's capital Juba	NAIROBI — Heavy gunfire erupted in South Sudan's capital Juba on Thursday evening after security forces moved to arrest the former head of the intelligence service, according to Reuters reporters and an alert sent to United Nations staff. The gunfire began about 7 p.m. local time (1700 GMT) and continued sporadically for more than an hour before dying down, Reuters reporters said. A U.N. safety alert to staff members in Juba, seen by Reuters, said the shooting was related to the arrest of the former head of the National Security Service, or NSS. It urged U.N. staff to shelter in place. In early October, President Salva Kiir dismissed Akol Koor Kuc, who had led the NSS since the country's independence from Sudan in 2011, and he appointed a close ally to replace him. Reached by telephone, a military spokesperson said he was trying to establish what was going on. Analysts said the sacking of Akol Koor reflected a power struggle at the highest levels of government. It came weeks after the transitional government that Kiir leads announced that elections expected in December would be postponed for a second time.	https://www.voanews.com/a/heavy-gunfire-erupts-in-south-sudan-s-capital-juba-/7872699.html	2024-11-21T15:18:14-08:00	
North Korea's troop deployment to Russia jeopardizes China's balancing act	Washington — Several of Beijing’s leading trading partners are urging Chinese President Xi Jinping to do more to pressure North Korea to stop or reverse its deployment of troops to Russia, where more than 10,000 North Korean soldiers have joined the front lines in the war against Ukraine. The appeals at the past week’s twin summits in Brazil and Peru reflect the awkward position in which the Chinese leader finds himself as he attempts a delicate balancing act between Russia and the West. At a joint press conference with Brazilian President Luis Inacio Lula da Silva in Brasilia on Thursday, Xi called for bringing together 'more voices of peace' in Ukraine. He pushed for a six-point consensus on Ukraine first put forward by China and Brazil in May that stresses dialogue and negotiations leading to a political settlement. Before his bilateral meeting in the Brazilian capital, Xi was told by world leaders on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro and the APEC summit in Lima, Peru, that Beijing needs to persuade North Korea to stop sending more troops to fight for Russia. German Chancellor Olaf Scholtz warned Xi on Tuesday at the G20 that the deployment of North Korea troops to fight against Ukraine amounted to an escalation of the war. South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol asked Xi last week at APEC to play a 'constructive' role on North Korea’s deepening ties with Russia. Yoon used the global gatherings as an opportunity to consolidate the West’s condemnation of Pyongyang-Moscow military ties. U.S. President Joe Biden also told Xi at APEC that Beijing has influence and capacity to prevent the conflict in Ukraine from expanding through the presence of more North Korean troops, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said at a press briefing Sunday. Biden pointed out China’s position calling for the de-escalation of the conflict and said the presence of North Korean troops runs counter to that stance. Balancing act China has been reluctant to call out North Korean leader Kim Jong Un for providing troops and munitions to help Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned Tuesday that North Korea could deploy up to 100,000 soldiers, and the U.S. estimates that about 11,000 North Korean troops have been mobilized in the Russian border region of Kursk. 'Beijing currently finds itself in a tricky situation,' said Patricia Kim, a fellow at Brookings Institution where she leads the Global China Project. 'It is uncomfortable with North Korea’s growing military cooperation with Russia that has extended into the Ukrainian battlefield. Putin is now indebted to Kim, and this may embolden Pyongyang to engage in risky behavior at home that can have blowback effects on China,' she told VOA. 'At the same time, Beijing believes it cannot afford to alienate Pyongyang or Moscow, especially as the potential for a U.S.-China confrontation grows with [President-elect Donald Trump’s] return to office,' she said. Despite the discomfort, it is unlikely that Xi will confront Moscow or Pyongyang about sending more North Korean troops, said Bonnie Glaser, managing director of the Indo-Pacific program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States. Glaser suggested that China is less concerned about the North Korean troops in Russia than about responses by the U.S., Japan and South Korea that could 'negatively impact Chinese interests.' Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington, told VOA on Wednesday that China’s position on both Ukraine and the Korean Peninsula remains 'consistent,' and that Beijing has been 'making efforts toward de-escalation of the situation' in Ukraine. While being silent on North Korean troops, China is accused of providing dual-use goods that Russia needs to produce weapons. The European Union has also warned Beijing that the attack drones that Russia is producing in China’s Xinjiang Province would have consequences. China has been trying to support Russia’s war in Ukraine without angering the West out of concern over any economic backlash it could trigger — including trade restrictions and sanctions that could further cripple its struggling economy, analysts said. 'China is skilled at playing this role' of ambiguity, 'given its history of nonalignment, while knowing its economy relies on good trade relations with the U.S. and the EU,' said Joseph DeTrani, who served as the special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks that included North Korea and China, from 2003 to 2006. 'China appears reluctant to use its limited leverage with North Korea due, in part, to the tension in the U.S.-China relations,' he said. At the same time, DeTrani said, the Chinese president will not openly support Russia’s war for fear that would undermine his government’s credibility with the Global South, where Xi is trying 'to prove that China’s system of governance is far superior to the liberal democracy in the U.S.' In October, the U.S. sanctioned Chinese companies for directly helping Russia build long-range attack drones. In response, China’s Foreign Ministry urged the U.S. to stop using the Ukraine issue to 'smear or put pressure' on China. Aligned against US Richard Weitz, senior fellow and director at the Center for Political-Military Analysis at the Hudson Institute, said China views its partnership with Russia as more important than any differences it has over North Korea. China does not 'want to antagonize Russia' over North Korea,' he said. 'Despite their differences on particular issues,' including North Korea, 'they are fundamentally aligned globally against the U.S. and the Western order. So, they’re not going to let these specific differences over narrower issues interfere with that global alignment,' said Weitz. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said at a meeting with his Russian counterpart Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil on Monday that Beijing is ready to cooperate closely with Russia within the Shanghai Cooperation Organization, according to Russian news agency TASS. They also stressed the importance of strengthening foreign policy coordination between Moscow and Beijing at international venues, including the U.N., BRICS and the G20, the Russian Foreign Ministry said on Tuesday. 'By failing to condemn Russian aggression, China threw away any claim to neutrality,' said John Erath, senior policy director at the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation. 'It is unlikely, however, that Beijing believes Russia-DPRK [North Korea] military cooperation to be in its interest. If China has objected to the partnership, it does not seem to have produced much of an effect on Putin or Kim,' said Erath.	https://www.voanews.com/a/north-korea-s-troop-deployment-to-russia-jeopardizes-china-s-balancing-act-/7872662.html	2024-11-21T15:11:19-08:00

Serbia arrests 12 in connection with railway station roof collapse	Twelve people have been arrested in connection with a roof collapse at a railway station earlier this month that killed at least 15 people in the city of Novi Sad, Serbian prosecutors said Thursday. Novi Sad’s Higher Prosecutor’s Office said the suspects, who were not identified, were arrested on suspicion of committing criminal acts against public safety. One suspect remains at large. If convicted, they face up to 12 years in prison. Fourteen people were killed on the day of the November 1 incident and three were injured, one of whom died Sunday. Former Novi Sad Mayor Borislav Novakovic said the arrests should have happened sooner. 'For the past 20 days, all suspects could influence witnesses, tamper with evidence and alter documentation,' he told The Associated Press. The deadly collapse sparked several rounds of protests, with demonstrators, joined by opposition leaders, taking to the streets with claims that government corruption and nepotism led to the roof’s shabby construction. Opposition politicians have called for prosecutors of organized crime to handle the case, according to AP. Other news outlets reported that ministers of transport, construction, infrastructure and trade, along with the head of state-run Serbian Railways, have resigned because of the incident. Goran Vesic, the former construction minister, was reported by Serbian media to be among those detained. Vesic, however, posted on the X social media platform that he reported to authorities voluntarily. The protesters who have clashed with police are calling for indictments in connection with the roof collapse and for the release of activists who were arrested in earlier demonstrations. Serbia’s populist president, Aleksandar Vucic, has characterized the activists as 'thugs and bullies,' and he has described the protests as 'terror' and 'brutal violence by certain political factors.' Some information for this report came from The Associated Press and Reuters.	https://www.voanews.com/a/serbia-arrests-12-in-connection-with-railway-station-roof-collapse-/7872638.html	2024-11-21T14:05:16-08:00	
Emboldened North Korea awaits second Trump administration	WASHINGTON — In his first message aimed at Washington since the U.S. presidential election, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un has expressed his unwavering determination to hold onto nuclear weapons, U.S. analysts say. At a conference with army officials last Friday, Kim vowed to bolster his country's nuclear capabilities 'without limit,' while condemning Washington for its nuclear deterrence strategies with Seoul. 'The U.S., Japan and South Korea will never get away from the responsibility as the culprits of destroying the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and the region,' Kim said, according to the Korean Central News Agency. 'The most important and critical task for our armed forces is preparations for a war.' Nuclear rhetoric Evans Revere, former acting U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific affairs, interpreted Kim's remarks, which were made 10 days after the election, as a message directed to President-elect Donald Trump, whom he met with face-to-face three times from 2018 to 2019. 'Kim Jong Un is making clear to President-elect Trump that everything has changed since their previous meetings,' Revere told VOA Korean via email Tuesday. 'Pyongyang has become a de facto nuclear weapons state and will not give up its treasured sword, as it once called its nuclear deterrent.' Nuclear talks between then-President Trump and North Korea's supreme leader collapsed during their Hanoi summit in February 2019, after Trump rejected the lifting of sanctions in exchange for Kim's offer to dismantle one major nuclear facility. Since then, Pyongyang has not slowed the ramp-up of its nuclear capabilities. In one of its latest moves, just five days before the U.S. election, the regime tested a new intercontinental ballistic missile called Hwasong-19 that could potentially reach most of the United States mainland. 'Having already developed a credible deterrent, complete with sophisticated medium- and long-range delivery systems, North Korea wants to be accepted, or at least acknowledged, as a nuclear power,' Revere said. Kim is trying to remind the incoming U.S. president that 'the door to denuclearization has now been firmly closed and he will be dealing with a DPRK that intends to keep its nuclear arsenal,' said Revere. DPRK stands for Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the official name of North Korea. Joseph DeTrani, former U.S. special envoy for six-party denuclearization talks with North Korea, said Kim would still want to meet with Trump, but the terms this time would be drastically different. 'I think Kim Jong Un is open to a dialogue with President-elect Trump's administration, once it is in place,' DeTrani told VOA Korean via email Tuesday. DeTrani said Kim would come to another potential summit with Trump 'from a position of strength,' given his alliance and defense treaty with Russia. Russia and North Korea have committed to coming to the aid of the other if attacked. Other experts cautioned, however, against reading too deeply into what Kim said. New alliance Sydney Seiler, former national intelligence officer for North Korea on the U.S. National Intelligence Council, said that Kim's latest remarks provide little insight into how Kim may handle the incoming Trump administration. 'Kim Jong Un is exploring the benefits available in being an active member of the axis of upheaval: states such as Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran who seek to overturn the existing rules-based order and justify using force to achieve their objectives,' Seiler told VOA Korean via email Tuesday. Seiler said that Kim has begun to enjoy benefits in his cooperation with Russia — cash, food and fuel aid, assistance with weapons of mass destruction, and conventional capabilities, and diplomatic recognition and acceptance of North Korea's nuclear status. 'Why would he reach out to Donald Trump when he has friends like Vladimir Putin?' he asked. In June, Kim and Russia's President Vladimir Putin signed a comprehensive strategic partnership treaty, which calls for Russia and North Korea to immediately assist each other militarily if either of them is attacked by a third country. Russia and North Korea respectively ratified the treaty into law earlier this month. Gary Samore, former White House coordinator for arms control and weapons of mass destruction, told VOA Korean via email Tuesday that Kim does not need Trump for assistance and sanctions relief as he used to because of his new alliance with Putin. Samore said another Trump-Kim meeting won't be very high on Trump's agenda. 'Trump's top foreign policy issues will be ending the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East and imposing tariffs on China,' he said. 'In contrast, the Korean situation is pretty stable and quiet, and nobody thinks another Trump-Kim summit will produce big results.' VOA Korean Service asked the U.S. State Department about Kim's latest message toward the U.S. but did not receive a reply by the time this article was published. In a response to an inquiry made by VOA Korean earlier this month, the State Department spokesperson reiterated the U.S. commitment to protect South Korea from any North Korean nuclear attack. 'President Biden reaffirmed the U.S. extended deterrence commitment to the ROK using the full range of U.S. defense capabilities, including nuclear, conventional, and missile defense capabilities, and that any nuclear attack by the DPRK against the ROK will be met with a swift, overwhelming and decisive response,' the spokesperson said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/emboldened-north-korea-awaits-second-trump-administration/7872606.html	2024-11-21T14:02:17-08:00

Who’s to blame for climate change: Fossil fuel producers or purchasers?	BAKU, AZERBAIJAN — The role of Azerbaijan as a growing exporter of fossil fuels has forced a debate at this month’s climate conference in Baku over which countries are most responsible for worsening climate change — the producers or the countries that buy and burn those fuels. Climate activists have cited a slew of new contracts signed by Azerbaijan’s state oil company in the past year, a development that President Ilham Aliyev has defended as a 'gift from God' and a realistic response to market demand. Oil and gas account for more than 90% of the southern Caucasus country’s exports, boosted by the discovery of the Shah Deniz gas field in the early 2000s, according to the International Energy Agency. The main buyers of its petroleum are Croatia, Germany, Israel, Italy, Portugal, Spain, Turkey and Ukraine, among others. After imposing sanctions on Russian gas in response to Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine, the European Union turned to other sources, including Azerbaijan. This prompted Baku to begin planning a major expansion of its oil and gas production, according to Ufuk Alparslan, regional lead for Turkey and the surrounding regions at energy research group Ember. 'Azerbaijan’s expectations are that the EU will have higher fossil fuel demand,' Alparslan told VOA. 'Their target market will always be the EU, especially after the Ukraine war.' Asked whether the buyer or the seller of fossil fuel should take the blame, Alparslan said both share the same responsibility. 'It’s not fair to blame the producers. There’s demand for it [fossil fuels]. … I think they should share the blame together,' he said. Myrto Tilianaki, senior advocate of environment and human rights at Human Rights Watch, said all countries should double down on their transition from fossil fuels to clean energy sources. Tilianaki said Azerbaijan has not set a good example as the host of this year’s U.N. climate change conference, COP29. 'As a COP president, you are meant to be galvanizing and gathering countries around higher [climate] ambitions for this COP,' Tilianaki told VOA. She said Baku’s stark support for fossil fuel expansion while calling for more ambitious climate goals is 'contradictory.' But Fadhel Kaboub, senior adviser with Kenya-based research group Power Shift Africa, told VOA it is 'hypocritical' to place the blame for rising carbon emissions on producers like Azerbaijan. 'The problem is the countries of Global North that caused climate change and exceeded their carbon budget by far. And they are in a situation where they owe climate debt they need to pay to the Global South,' he said. Azerbaijan has set a goal of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40% from 1990 levels in the next 25 years, provided it receives international support. The country has several planned solar and wind projects that would generate 2 gigawatts of renewable energy. It is said to own 'considerable' potential to develop renewable energy from solar, wind, hydropower, biomass and geothermal resources. As the EU seeks to reduce its own demand for fossil fuels, Alparslan said Baku’s current strategy to boost oil and gas production might not be ideal. He said discussions on how to diversify its energy sources will be inevitable. 'The EU won’t be a good market in the future, and demand reduction will affect it. They are already at maximum capacity, and if they need to produce more, they have to develop more gas fields, which need financing,' he said. Other developing nations in the fossil fuel-rich region will also need to develop alternatives both for domestic use and export, Alparslan added. He cited the case of Uzbekistan, which exported more than $2 billion worth of gas in 2019 but has seen its production dry up and now is a net gas importer, according to local media reports. While it relies on gas from Russia and other countries for now, Uzbekistan has shifted its energy investment into developing renewable sources with an eye to future exports. President Shavkat Mirziyoyev said at the COP29 talks this month that he expects to sign a multilateral deal to that effect with the EU 'in the coming days.' Kaboub said developing nations with huge renewable potential like those in Africa have been denied manufacturing technology from the Global North due to perceived 'geopolitical risk.' 'It’s a question of power. The Global North is not interested in disrupting the colonial geopolitical hierarchy,' he argued. Climate finance to Africa reached $44 billion in 2021-2022, but more than one-third of that was in the form of loans to already debt-ridden nations, according to a report from the Climate Policy Initiative. Alparslan suggested that developing countries that are highly reliant on generating and exporting fossil fuels should begin their transition by seeking to boost regional cooperation and share renewable energy through improved grid connectivity. 'These projects can attract international and external funding,' he said. 'Green energy projects are more appealing than fossil fuel.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/who-s-to-blame-for-climate-change-fossil-fuel-producers-or-purchasers-/7872616.html	2024-11-21T13:37:12-08:00	
Journalist Pham Chi Dung marks 5 years in prison in Vietnam	Washington — Vietnamese journalist Pham Chi Dung marked a grim milestone this week: five years in a prison cell. The journalist, blogger and VOA contributor is now one-third of the way through a 15-year term after being convicted of 'propaganda against the state.' He was arrested for promoting media freedom, for cooperating with foreign media to deliver 'distorted information,' and for his criticism of the Communist Party’s control of the media. The journalist’s lawyers and supporters are pushing the international community to help free him. For Pham, life in Xuan Loc Prison, in Vietnam’s Dong Nai province, is tough. Prison authorities allow a one-hour visit every month, when visitors can bring in essential food items that have to be screened. And he is allowed an unannounced 10-minute home phone call every month, according to a family member who asked not to be named for fear of retaliation. Despite his situation, Pham remains resolute, the family member said. 'Maybe because the time spent in prison was quite long, his spirit seemed full of endurance and acceptance of fate as he is going to mark five years in jail, out of 15 years of the difficult and challenging journey that he has to go through,' the family member told VOA. Pham is experiencing health issues that are worsened by prison. He has insomnia, tinnitus and knee pain. The family asked for private medical care but prison authorities denied the request. Because he is classified as a political prisoner, Pham is restricted within the prison. 'Pham is not allowed to use common areas or write letters home. Any note he writes to family is screened by the prison authorities before being handed over to family during prison visits,' the relative said. Authorities in Ho Chi Minh City arrested Pham on Nov. 21, 2019, days after he sent a petition to the European Union urging it to postpone a signed but not-yet-ratified EU-Vietnam free trade agreement. The petition recommended the deal be delayed until Vietnam improves its press freedom and human rights records. Grace Bui, an American activist in Thailand who met Pham before his arrest, remembers the journalist as a 'nice, placid and calm man.' 'He was arrested just because he raised his voice over human rights violations and social issues,' Bui told VOA. Bui was in Geneva lobbying the EU over the trade deal when Pham was detained. At the time, Pham was already under a travel ban so the petition was the only way he could raise his concerns, Bui said. Bui said she believes the case against him is 'ridiculous.' 'Pham is a person who dares to stand up for press freedom and tell the truth. The government of Vietnam fears such a free press and they arrested him and his group members to shut down people’s voice and any independent outlets,' Bui said. Pham is the founder and president of the Independent Journalists Association of Vietnam, IJAVN. Established in July 2014, the group of independent bloggers, journalists and authors promotes a free press. Vietnam’s government has said that the organization is 'illegal' and that Pham’s role in it was one of the reasons for his arrest. Two other members of the IJAVN — Radio Free Asia contributor Nguyen Tuong Thuy and freelancer Le Huu Minh Tuan — are also serving 11 years each on anti-state charges. All three are accused of creating the IJAVN to 'fight and change the current political institutions of Vietnam.' Pham’s work with the association and his writing for foreign outlets including VOA were cited in the indictment. Pham also reported for independent websites including Dan Luan and Dan Lam Bao, covering economics, social stories, human rights violations, and government corruption. He promoted democracy, freedom of the press, political pluralism, the rule of law, and the development of an independent civil society. Vietnam's Ministry of Public Security has accused Pham of 'dangerous' anti-state actions, including 'fabricating, storing, and disseminating information, as well as other materials opposing the Vietnamese government.' State media said that he carried out 'anti-regime activities such as producing anti-state articles [and] cooperating with foreign media.' But others see the case as part of Vietnam’s control over media. 'There are three main reasons for Pham's arrest,' Annie Nguyen, a member of the IJAVN who is based in the Netherlands, told VOA. 'His articles touched many people and many walks of life, including the articles he wrote on VOA Vietnamese; he is the president of a journalist association, a professional association,' she said, and he 'wrote a letter to the EU to postpone the ratification of the EU-Vietnam Free Trade Agreement.' Vietnam’s National Assembly ratified the deal on June 8, 2020, following ratification by the European Parliament on Feb. 12, 2020. The deal entered into force in August 2020. Manh Dinh Dang, a lawyer who represented Pham before going into exile in the United States, said the journalist decided not to appeal his prison term 'because he wouldn’t believe in any positive change in his verdict.' 'The authorities did not allow any visit to Pham during his long investigation period. They only gave me limited time to counsel my client because the authorities claimed this was a national security case,' Manh said. Manh added that the journalist denied the charges and said he did not violate any laws. Vietnam has one of the worst records globally for jailing journalists. The country ranks 174th out of 180th on the World Press Freedom Index, where 1 signifies a good media environment.	https://www.voanews.com/a/journalist-pham-chi-dung-marks-5-years-in-prison-in-vietnam/7872558.html	2024-11-21T12:39:20-08:00	
Senegal's ruling party wins majority in parliament, paving way for reforms	DAKAR, Senegal — Senegal's ruling party, PASTEF, secured a resounding victory in the country's legislative elections, winning 130 of 165 seats, according to provisional results announced Thursday by the national vote counting commission. The win grants newly elected President Bassirou Diomaye Faye a clear mandate to carry out ambitious reforms promised during the campaign, which include fighting corruption, revamping the fishing industry and maximizing the country's natural resource benefits. The main opposition coalition led by former President Macky Sall won 16 seats. Sall congratulated PASTEF in a post on X on election day, and two other major opposition leaders conceded defeat hours after the polls closed on Sunday. The results will now have to be confirmed by the constitutional council, which is expected to do so in the coming week. Before Sunday's legislative election, PASTEF held 56 seats in the National Assembly while Sall's coalition had a slim majority of 83 seats. Faye, who was elected in March on an anti-establishment platform, said the lack of a majority had prevented him from executing reforms he pledged during his presidential campaign. In September, he dissolved the opposition-led parliament, paving the way for an early legislative election. Voting in the West African nation known for its stability was calm and peaceful despite an electoral campaign that was marked by sporadic clashes between rival groups of supporters. Observers from the international community, including the African Union and ECOWAS, praised the smooth voting process and the maturity of Senegalese democracy. Faye, 44, became Africa's youngest elected leader in March, less than two weeks after he was released from prison. The former tax inspector's rise has reflected widespread frustration among Senegal's youth with the country's direction — a common sentiment across Africa, which has the world's youngest population and a number of leaders accused of clinging to power for decades.	https://www.voanews.com/a/senegal-s-ruling-party-wins-majority-in-parliament-paving-way-for-reforms/7872565.html	2024-11-21T12:38:58-08:00	
Brazil indicts Bolsonaro, aides over alleged 2022 coup attempt	SAO PAULO, brazil — Brazil's federal police said Thursday that they had indicted former President Jair Bolsonaro and 36 other people for allegedly attempting a coup to keep him in office after his defeat in the 2022 elections. Police said their findings were being delivered Thursday to Brazil's Supreme Court, which must decide whether to refer them to Prosecutor-General Paulo Gonet, who will either formally charge Bolsonaro and put him on trial or toss the investigation. The former right-wing president has denied that he tried to stay in office after his narrow electoral defeat in 2022 to his rival, leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva. Bolsonaro has faced a series of legal threats since then. Police said in a brief statement that the Supreme Court had agreed to reveal the names of all 37 people who were indicted 'to avoid the dissemination of incorrect news.' The 700-page police document likely will take several days for the court to review, Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes said. The others indicted included General Walter Braga Netto, who was Bolsonaro's running mate in the 2022 campaign; former Army commander General Paulo Sergio Nogueira de Oliveira; Valdemar Costa Neto, the chairman of Bolsonaro's Liberal Party; and his veteran former adviser, General Augusto Heleno. The investigation started last year. On Tuesday, four military officers and a federal police officer were arrested as part of the same probe. They were accused of plotting to overthrow the government following the 2022 elections, including alleged plans to kill Lula and other top officials. Other investigations focus on Bolsonaro's potential roles in smuggling diamond jewelry into Brazil without properly declaring it, and in directing a subordinate to falsify his and others' COVID-19 vaccination statuses. Bolsonaro has denied any involvement in either. Another probe found that he had abused his authority to cast doubt on the country's voting system, and judges barred him from running again until 2030. The far-reaching investigations have weakened Bolsonaro's status as a leader of Brazil's right wing, said Carlos Melo, a political science professor at Insper University in Sao Paulo. 'Bolsonaro is already barred from running in the 2026 elections,' Melo told The Associated Press. 'And if he is convicted, he could also be jailed by then. To avoid being behind bars, he will have to convince Supreme Court justices that he has nothing to do with a plot that involves dozens of his aides. That's a very tall order.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/brazil-indicts-bolsonaro-aides-over-alleged-2022-coup-attempt/7872536.html	2024-11-21T12:22:14-08:00	
Russia’s use of advanced missile sends signal to West, analysts say	Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy condemned Russia's use of a fast, powerful new missile to attack the city of Dnipro on Thursday, calling it a 'nuclear adventure' and a stark escalation in the war. The attack has ignited fears of a dangerous new phase in the war. In a nationwide address, Russian President Vladimir Putin later confirmed the use of a medium-range ballistic missile in the strike. Zelenskyy pointed to the strike as a sign of Moscow’s broader strategy, stating, 'It is obvious that Putin is using Ukraine as a testing ground for weapons that threaten the world.' His remarks underscored the growing alarm in Kyiv over the deployment of advanced Russian missile systems against civilian targets. In his address, Putin framed the use of the nuclear-capable Oreshnik missile as a routine test within the conflict. 'The Russian Federation tested a medium-range ballistic missile, known as Oreshnik, during its operation in Ukraine,' he said. While he offered few technical details, analysts said the use of the missile and Putin’s acknowledgment appears intended to showcase Russia’s military capabilities to NATO and the United States. Putin’s announcement marks the first time Russia has openly acknowledged using such a missile during the war. In Washington, Deputy Pentagon Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said the missile used was based on Russia's RS 26 rubes intercontinental ballistic missile model.' In terms of notifications to the United States, the United States was pre notified briefly before the launch through Nuclear Risk Reduction channels,' she said. Strategic escalation Valeriy Chaly, Ukraine’s former ambassador to the U.S., described the attack as a 'new stage' in Russia’s aggression. Speaking to VOA, he emphasized that the strike was not just a challenge to Ukraine but also to its Western allies. 'This isn’t just about Ukraine,' Chaly said. 'It’s a challenge to the European security system and the United States. Moscow is signaling its readiness to escalate dramatically to influence the West.' He said that the response to the attack 'must be clear, united, and decisive — anything less risks emboldening Russia and jeopardizing global security.' Western leaders quickly condemned the strike. British Prime Minister Keir Starmer labeled it 'reckless and dangerous,' while EU foreign affairs spokesperson Peter Stano described it as a 'qualitative escalation' in Russia’s tactics. Dnipro attack The missile targeted industrial facilities in Dnipro, injuring two people and causing significant damage. Ukrainian officials initially suggested the use of an ICBM, or intercontinental ballistic missile, citing the weapon’s speed and trajectory. Some analysts, including those in the U.S., believed it was more likely a medium- or intermediate-range ballistic missile, consistent with Putin’s confirmation. Dnipro residents, accustomed to regular air-raid sirens and missile attacks, reported that this strike felt uniquely different. Oleksiy Poltorazky, a local resident, recounted: 'We’ve learned to recognize the sounds of different missile types. This one was different — it hit almost immediately after the siren. Many here believe it was a ballistic missile because there was no usual warning sound.' The speed and power of the strike left many shaken. Poltorazky, however, remained resolute. 'There’s no panic, no apocalypse as everyone says. We have to live through this, raise our kids, protect our families and work. We have to fight and do everything possible for our country,' he told VOA. George Barros, an expert on the Russia team at the Institute for the Study of War, told VOA that Ukrainians should try not to overreact to the attack. 'It seems that the Russians targeted the city with an R-26 IRBM,' Barros said, referring to a Soviet-era intermediate-range missile. 'The main thing is to not panic. There's no reason to think that Putin’s likelihood to use a nuclear weapon or a weapon of mass destruction is any higher than at other points in the war. 'This is not the first time that Russia has used nuclear-capable weapon systems against Ukraine,' he said. 'Russia regularly uses Iskander nuclear-capable weapons, and this appears to be a signaling effort designed to deter further Western support for Ukraine.' Strategic ambiguity While Putin confirmed the missile test, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov and Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova provided limited details about the strike. Zakharova was reportedly instructed not to address the attack at all during a Thursday press conference. The calculated reticence deepens global unease, as Moscow oscillates between overt warnings and veiled threats, said some analysts, suggesting the ambiguity is part of a broader strategy to keep Western nations uncertain about Russia’s next moves.	https://www.voanews.com/a/russia-s-use-of-advanced-missile-sends-signal-to-west-analysts-say/7872528.html	2024-11-21T12:21:39-08:00	
Malawi refugees receive first-ever insurance payout	BLANTYRE, MALAWI — Refugees at Malawi's only refugee camp, Dzaleka, have started receiving their first-ever insurance payouts to mitigate the impact of the El Nino weather pattern, which has destroyed their crops. The payouts, amounting to nearly $408,000 in total, were facilitated by the African Risk Capacity Group and KfW Development Bank, after the U.N. refugee agency office in Malawi leveraged the group's innovative Replica program. This program enables humanitarian actors to purchase insurance on behalf of countries to address climate-related disasters. Officials of the U.N. refugee agency, the UNHCR, say the beneficiaries will receive approximately $33 per household per month for three months to enhance food security. 'The payout that has come from this is targeting those that are taking part in agricultural activities and have suffered effects of El Nino or drought that came last year,' said Precious Mkoka, development officer for the UNHCR in Malawi. 'We have 4,000 households that are benefiting from this.' Some of the money will go to refugee communities, with the rest going to Malawians that are hosting them. In August, the Malawi government received an insurance payout of $11.2 million to support the country’s recovery from a devastating drought largely blamed on El Nino. The African Risk Capacity Group said the Replica program ensures that more people in need, including refugees, can be reached with critical assistance. Evaristo Sikasunda, country engagement manager at African Risk Capacity Group, said the aim 'is to help countries prepare and respond to adverse conditions like El Nino.' Some beneficiaries of the payouts say they will use the money to buy seeds. However, others say the payment is too little to compensate for crops they lost to the drought. The Dzaleka camp is home to refugees and asylum-seekers from Burundi, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Rwanda and Somalia. The camp originally was intended to accommodate about 12,000 refugees, but is home to more than 50,000.	https://www.voanews.com/a/malawi-refugees-receive-first-ever-insurance-payout-/7872490.html	2024-11-21T12:11:55-08:00	
How beekeeping is helps communities cope with climate change in Kenya	The U.N. Environment Program says communities living in drylands are the most affected by global warming, with frequent droughts and subsequent floods rendering traditional livelihoods like farming and livestock keeping nearly impossible. Conservation experts in Kenya are helping such communities develop climate-resilient alternative livelihoods like beekeeping to help them cope with the changing weather patterns. Juma Majanga reports from Garsen, Kenya.	https://www.voanews.com/a/how-beekeeping-is-helps-communities-cope-with-climate-change-in-kenya/7872336.html	2024-11-21T10:36:02-08:00	
Gaetz withdraws name as Trump’s attorney general nominee	Former Republican Representative Matt Gaetz is withdrawing his name from consideration as U.S. President-elect Donald Trump’s attorney general. 'I had excellent meetings with Senators yesterday. I appreciate their thoughtful feedback – and the incredible support of so many. While the momentum was strong, it is clear that my confirmation was unfairly becoming a distraction to the critical work of the Trump/Vance Transition,' Gaetz wrote on social media platform X. The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee failed Wednesday to reach agreement on whether to release findings from its nearly finished investigative report on Gaetz. The panel’s chair, Republican Representative Michael Guest, emerged from a lengthy committee meeting, saying, 'There was no agreement by the committee to release the report.' He declined further comment. Gaetz was accused of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use before he was picked by Trump to become the country’s top law enforcement official in the administration that takes office on January 20. ABC News and The Washington Post reported that the committee had obtained documents that showed Gaetz paid two women who appeared before the committee as witnesses a total of more than $10,000 between July 2017 and late January 2019. The women, who were over the age of 18 at the time of the payments, told the panel that some of the money was for sex. A Trump transition spokesperson defended Gaetz in a statement. 'The Justice Department received access to roughly every financial transaction Matt Gaetz ever undertook and came to the conclusion that he committed no crime. These leaks are meant to undermine the mandate from the people to reform the Justice Department,' with Gaetz at the head of the agency, the spokesperson said. Several U.S. senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, were demanding that the report be released so they could consider the scope of Gaetz’s background as they undertook their constitutionally mandated role of confirming or rejecting a new president’s Cabinet nominees. Hours after Trump named him as a nominee, Gaetz, 42, resigned from Congress, even though he had just been reelected to a fifth term. His resignation ended the House Ethics Committee’s investigation, which had been nearing a conclusion. Gaetz was in the Capitol on Wednesday to meet with some of the senators who would have voted on his nomination. The Senate has not voted to reject a presidential nominee for a Cabinet position since 1989, with members of both political parties giving wide deference to new presidents to fill top-level jobs with appointees of their choosing. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he met with Gaetz and Vice President-elect JD Vance, still a sitting senator, and told them there would be 'no rubber stamps, no lynch mobs' in the confirmation process. 'These allegations will be dealt with in committee, but [Gaetz] deserves a chance to confront his accusers,' Graham told reporters. The Justice Department investigated the allegations against him but last year declined to bring any charges. Gaetz, like other Trump nominees for top government jobs, has been a vocal supporter of the president and his Make America Great Again agenda. Gaetz, however, angered some fellow Republican lawmakers in the House in 2023 by spearheading the effort to oust then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gaetz-withdraws-name-as-trump-s-attorney-general-nominee/7872311.html	2024-11-21T10:09:57-08:00	
US imposes new sanctions on Russia's Gazprombank	The U.S. Treasury Department announced Thursday a new set of sanctions targeting Russia’s financial sector and its ability to fund its war with Ukraine, hitting Gazprombank as well as many other internationally connected financial institutions, entities and individuals. In a statement posted to its website, the Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control said the sanctions designate Gazprombank — Russia's largest remaining unsanctioned bank — plus more than 50 other Russian banks, more than 40 Russian securities registrars and 15 Russian finance officials. The Treasury department said Gazprombank is a conduit for Russia to purchase military equipment for its war against Ukraine and the Russian government also uses the bank to pay its soldiers. Australia, Canada, New Zealand and Britain have previously sanctioned Gazprombank. The sanctions mean that all property and interests of the institutions, entities or individuals targeted by the sanctions are blocked. In the statement, U.S. Treasury Secretary said the sanctions 'will further diminish and degrade Russia’s war machine. This sweeping action will make it harder for the Kremlin to evade U.S. sanctions and fund and equip its military.' In a statement posted to the White House website, U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the new sanctions are part of a pledge made by President Joe Biden in September to provide additional assistance and actions to 'help Ukraine as it continues to resist Russia’s aggression.' The Biden administration is expected to step up assistance to Ukraine before the president leaves office. President-elect Donald Trump and leading Republicans have suggested they will reduce funding for Ukraine once Trump takes office on January 20.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-imposes-new-sanctions-on-russia-s-gazprombank-/7872270.html	2024-11-21T09:52:50-08:00	
Jussie Smollett's conviction in 2019 attack on himself is overturned	SPRINGFIELD, Illinois — The Illinois Supreme Court on Thursday overturned actor Jussie Smollett's conviction on charges that he staged a racist and homophobic attack against himself in downtown Chicago in 2019 and lied to police. The state's highest court ruled that a special prosecutor should not have been allowed to intervene after the Cook County state's attorney initially dropped charges against Smollett in exchange for forfeiting his $10,000 bond and conducting community service. The ruling and the appeal did not address Smollett's continued claim of innocence. Smollett, who is Black and gay, claimed two men assaulted him, spouted racial and homophobic slurs and tossed a noose around his neck, leading to a massive search for suspects by Chicago police detectives and kicking up an international uproar. Smollett was on the television drama 'Empire,' which filmed in Chicago, and prosecutors alleged he staged the attack because he was unhappy with the studio's response to hate mail he received. 'We are aware that this case has generated significant public interest and that many people were dissatisfied with the resolution of the original case and believed it to be unjust,' Justice Elizabeth Rochford wrote in the 5-0 decision. 'Nevertheless, what would be more unjust than the resolution of any one criminal case would be a holding from this court that the state was not bound to honor agreements upon which people have detrimentally relied.' Smollett's attorneys have argued that the case was over when the Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx's office dropped an initial 16 counts of disorderly conduct. A grand jury restored charges after a special prosecutor took the case. A jury convicted Smollett of five counts of disorderly conduct in 2021. Emailed messages seeking comment were sent Thursday to Foxx's office and to Smollett's attorney, who have argued that Smollett has been victimized by a racist and politicized justice system. Testimony at his trial indicated Smollett paid $3,500 to two men whom he knew from 'Empire' to carry out the attack. Prosecutors said he told them what slurs to shout, and to yell that Smollett was in 'MAGA country,' an apparent reference to Donald Trump's presidential campaign slogan. Smollett testified that 'there was no hoax' and that he was the victim of a hate crime in his downtown Chicago neighborhood. He was sentenced to 150 days in jail — six of which he served before he was freed pending appeal — 30 months of probation and ordered to pay about $130,000 in restitution. A state appellate court ruling upheld Smollett's conviction, declaring that no one promised Smollett he wouldn't face a fresh prosecution after accepting the original deal. Illinois Supreme Court Chief Justice Mary Jane Theis and Justice Joy Cunningham took no part in Thursday's decision.	https://www.voanews.com/a/jussie-smollett-s-conviction-in-2019-attack-on-himself-is-overturned-/7872222.html	2024-11-21T09:19:21-08:00	
Burkina freezes assets of more than 100 people over 'financing of terrorism'	Abidjan, Ivory Coast — Military-led Burkina Faso has frozen the 'assets and resources' of more than 100 people, including ex-president Paul-Henri Sandaogo Damiba, and two jihadist groups over the 'financing of terrorism,' according to a decree sent to AFP Thursday. The decision affects 113 individuals and two 'terrorist organisations' — the Group for the Support of Islam and Muslims (JNIM) and Islamic State in the Greater Sahara (ISGS) — according to the document, dated Tuesday and signed by Finance Minister Aboubacar Nacanabo. Former president Lieutenant-Colonel Damiba, who is currently in exile in Togo, was among the individuals cited. Damiba was ousted after seizing power in a January 2022 coup against elected president Roch Marc Christian Kabore. Little more than eight months later, Damiba himself was overthrown by 34-year-old Captain Ibrahim Traore, who now heads the Sahel nation's regime. Damiba was expelled from the military at the end of October along with around 15 officers, for alleged acts of disclosing 'intelligence with a foreign power' and 'terrorist groups aimed at destabilising Burkina Faso.' The regime also froze the assets of the late former Burkinabe special forces commander Ahmed Kinda, whom the authorities previously described as the 'head' of 'destabilisation operations' allegedly involving expelled officers. Former intelligence services second-in-command Commander Sekou Ouedraogo, as well as exiled former ministers General Djibril Bassole, and Alpha Barry, who founded the press group Omega Media, were also named in the ministerial order. Dozens of others — all Burkinabe nationals — including some currently serving prison sentences also had their finances seized over accusations of 'terrorist criminal conspiracy,' 'terrorist murders' and 'illegal possession of firearms.' Burkina Faso also banned the 113 individuals from traveling while their assets and economic resources remain frozen, the minister wrote. Since 2015, violence attributed to armed groups affiliated with al-Qaida and the Islamic State group has claimed more than 26,000 lives in Burkina Faso, including more than 13,500 since the September 2022 coup. More than two million people have also been forced to flee their homes inside the country.	https://www.voanews.com/a/burkina-freezes-assets-of-more-than-100-people-over-financing-of-terrorism-/7872143.html	2024-11-21T08:20:33-08:00	
X's former policy chief takes job with Elon Musk rival Sam Altman	NEW YORK — Nick Pickles, the former head of global affairs at Elon Musk's social media platform X, is joining forces with one of Musk's rivals, his fellow OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman. Pickles, who resigned from X in September, told Reuters on Wednesday that he will serve as chief policy officer for Altman's Tools for Humanity, the company building the technology to support World Network, formerly known as Worldcoin. Pickles' old boss, Musk, and his new boss, Altman, founded ChatGPT creator OpenAI in 2015 but have since fallen out in a messy legal dispute. World Network, which has faced scrutiny over its data collection, is ramping up efforts to scan people's irises, using its 'orb' devices, to create World ID. The ID will serve as a digital passport to prove, in the online realm, that its holder is an actual human being as opposed to an AI bot. Pickles told Reuters that AI is 'on the cusp' of overtaking traditional online defenses to determine whether a user is a real person, such as Captcha puzzles. Once AI can blow through those barriers, trust on the Web will further disintegrate. 'It's imminent,' said Pickles. 'Throughout my time at X and at Twitter, one of the consistent issues that kept coming up is, 'Is this a real account or a bot?'' He added: 'I saw every day how this issue is going to be central to the future of online interaction.' During his 10 years at X, formerly known as Twitter, Pickles served most recently as the company's top ambassador to heads of state across the globe. In that capacity, he worked closely with policymakers and regulators to shape regulatory proposals, negotiate compliance and represent the company in global forums. He received a promotion at X in July. One month later, billionaire Musk sued OpenAI and Altman for allegedly violating contract provisions that would have put the public good ahead of profits. Pickles declined to comment on the litigation. Pickles said he was optimistic about the new regulatory framework likely to be ushered in by the administration of President-elect Donald Trump. His priority, he said, is hiring a lobbyist in Washington.	https://www.voanews.com/a/x-s-former-policy-chief-takes-job-with-elon-musk-rival-sam-altman/7872113.html	2024-11-21T08:07:19-08:00	
Gunmen massacre dozens of passengers in Pakistan	ISLAMABAD — Authorities in Pakistan reported Thursday that 'terrorists' sprayed multiple passenger vehicles with bullets in a turbulent northwestern district, killing at least 45 people and injuring 20 others. Pakistani Interior Minister Mohsin Naqvi confirmed to reporters the casualties from the attack in Kurram, which borders Afghanistan. District police and hospital officials reported that among the dead were security personnel, women and children, and that they expect the death toll to rise. They also stated that the police had launched an operation in the area to track down the assailants. No group immediately took responsibility for the massacre in a Pakistani district known for sectarian violence between heavily armed Shiite and Sunni Muslim tribes. Officials in Kurram blame a land dispute for the latest round of sectarian tensions, which led to weeks of armed clashes and killed more than 100 people between August and October. The fighting compelled authorities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where Kurram is situated, to halt all traffic to and from the district until earlier this month, when tribal leaders brokered a temporary cease-fire between the opposing factions. Thursday's violence occurred amid a series of militant attacks in several border districts of the province over the past week, resulting in the deaths of at least 20 Pakistani soldiers. More than 60 Pakistani security personnel have been killed by militant attacks nationwide this month alone, according to official data. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan, commonly called TTP, has been blamed or claimed responsibility for much of the violence in recent years. The militant outfit is listed as a global terrorist organization by the United Nations, and Islamabad says TTP is orchestrating terrorism against the country from Afghan 'sanctuaries.' Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mumtaz Baloch reiterated Thursday her government’s long-running complaints, again emphasizing the urgency for Taliban authorities in Afghanistan to act against 'terror groups' operating on their territory. 'We have, on several occasions, shared concrete evidence with the Afghan authorities with regards to these terror groups and their operations in Afghanistan, and their continued threat to the security of Pakistan,' Baloch said at her weekly news conference in Islamabad. 'We hope that the Afghan authorities will consider terrorism to be a serious threat, not just to the region, but also to their own security, and fulfill their obligations under various international agreements,' she said. Taliban leaders deny they harbor terrorist groups, including TTP, or allow anyone to threaten neighboring countries from Afghan soil.	https://www.voanews.com/a/gunmen-massacre-dozens-of-passengers-in-pakistan/7872050.html	2024-11-21T07:25:36-08:00	
Kenya cancels airport and energy deals with Adani group after US indicts tycoon	Nairobi, Kenya — Kenya's president said Thursday he has cancelled multimillion-dollar airport expansion and energy deals with Indian tycoon Gautam Adani after U.S. bribery and fraud indictments against one of Asia's richest men. President William Ruto in a state of the nation address said the decision was made 'based on new information provided by our investigative agencies and partner nations.' He didn't specify the United States. The Adani group had been in the process of signing an agreement that would modernize Kenya's main airport in the capital, Nairobi, with an additional runway and terminal constructed, in exchange for the group running the airport for 30 years. The widely criticized deal had sparked anti-Adani protests in Kenya and a strike by airport workers, who said it would lead to degraded working conditions and job losses in some cases. The Adani group had also been awarded a deal to construct power transmission lines in Kenya, East Africa's business hub. Also Thursday, Energy Minister Opiyo Wandayi told a parliamentary committee there had been no bribery or corruption involved on Kenya's part in signing that deal. U.S. prosecutors indicted Adani this week on charges he duped investors in a massive solar energy project in India by concealing that it was facilitated by an alleged bribery scheme. He was charged with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud.	https://www.voanews.com/a/kenya-cancels-airport-and-energy-deals-with-adani-group-after-us-indicts-tycoon/7872025.html	2024-11-21T06:53:35-08:00	
Southeast Asian defense chiefs talk regional security with US, China, others	VIENTIANE, LAOS — Southeast Asian defense chiefs met Thursday with their counterparts from China, the United States and other nations in Laos for security talks, which come as Beijing's increasingly assertive stance in its claim to most of the South China Sea is leading to more confrontations. The closed-door talks put U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin and Chinese Defense Minister Dong Jun in the same room, a day after Dong refused a request to meet with Austin one-on-one on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit of defense ministers. The U.S. and China have been working to improve frayed military-to-military communications, and Austin said he regretted Dong's decision, calling it 'a setback for the whole region.' A Chinese statement indicated that Beijing was unhappy with U.S. actions related to Taiwan, the self-governing island that China claims. The U.S. recently approved $2 billion in arms sales to Taiwan, including an advanced surface-to-air missile defense system. 'The U.S. side cannot undermine China's core interests on the Taiwan issue while conducting exchanges with the Chinese military as if nothing had happened,' Defense Ministry spokesperson Wu Qian said in a statement posted online Thursday. The ASEAN meetings come as member nations are looking warily toward the change in American administrations at a time of increasing maritime disputes with China. The U.S. has firmly pushed a 'free and open Indo-Pacific' policy under outgoing President Joe Biden, and it is not yet clear how the incoming administration of President-elect Donald Trump will address the South China Sea situation. Dong called for resolving issues through dialogue and not provoking disputes or introducing external forces, China's official Xinhua News Agency reported. South China Sea Beijing believes that U.S. backing has emboldened the Philippines to act more assertively in its South China Sea disputes with China. Other nations attending the ASEAN meeting from outside Southeast Asia include Japan, South Korea, India, Russia, Australia and New Zealand. The meetings with the ASEAN dialogue partners were also expected to address tensions in the Korean Peninsula, the Russia-Ukraine war and wars in the Middle East. Before heading to Laos, Austin concluded meetings in Australia with officials there and with Japan's defense minister. They pledged to support ASEAN and expressed their 'serious concern about destabilizing actions in the East and South China Seas, including dangerous conduct by the People's Republic of China against Philippines and other coastal state vessels.' Along with the Philippines, ASEAN members Vietnam, Malaysia and Brunei have competing claims with China in the South China Sea, which Beijing claims almost entirely as its own territory. Indonesia, Thailand, Singapore, Myanmar, Cambodia and Laos are the other members of ASEAN, which stands for Association of Southeast Asian Nations. As China has grown more assertive in pushing its territorial claims in recent years, it and ASEAN have been negotiating a code of conduct to govern behavior in the sea. Progress has been slow. Officials have agreed to try to complete the code by 2026, but talks have been hampered by thorny issues, including disagreements over whether the pact should be binding. Chinese and Philippine vessels have clashed repeatedly this year, and Vietnam in October charged that Chinese forces assaulted its fishermen in disputed areas in the South China Sea. China has also sent patrol vessels to areas that Indonesia and Malaysia claim as their exclusive economic zones. Myanmar crisis Another thorny regional issue is the civil war and humanitarian crisis in ASEAN member Myanmar. The group's credibility has been severely tested by the war in Myanmar, where the army ousted an elected government in 2021 and fighting has continued with pro-democracy guerillas and ethnic rebels. More than a year into an offensive initiated by three militias and joined by other resistance groups, observers estimate the military controls less than half the country. Myanmar military rulers have been barred from ASEAN meetings since late 2021, but this year the country has been represented by high-level bureaucrats, including at the summit in October. At the defense meetings, the country is represented by Zaw Naing Win, director of the Defense Ministry's International Affairs Department.	https://www.voanews.com/a/southeast-asian-defense-chiefs-talk-regional-security-with-us-china-others/7872007.html	2024-11-21T06:46:43-08:00	
ICC issues war crimes arrest warrants for Netanyahu, Gallant	The International Criminal Court issued arrest warrants Thursday for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and former defense minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in Israel’s war against Hamas militants in Gaza. In a statement on its website, the ICC said the warrants charge each man with the war crime of starvation as a method of warfare, along with crimes against humanity including murder, persecution and other inhumane acts. The warrants cover acts committed from 'at least 8 October 2023 until at least 20 May 2024, the day the Prosecution filed the applications for warrants of arrest.' Israel is not a member of the ICC, and Netanyahu and Gallant do not face any immediate risk of prosecution. But the threat of arrest could create issues if either man travels abroad. Netanyahu condemned the ICC arrest warrant. A statement from his office Thursday said Israel 'rejects with disgust the absurd and false actions.' The court also issued an arrest warrant for Hamas military chief Muhammad Deif for crimes against humanity, including murder, hostage taking and sexual violence. Those charges are drawn from Hamas’ October 7, 2023 attack on Israel that killed some 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens. Hamas also took roughly 250 hostages. Following the attack, Israel began a campaign to eliminate Hamas in Gaza that has killed about 44,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. The ministry does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count but says more than half of those killed were women and children. When the original charges were brought to the court in May by ICC chief prosecutor Karim Khan, Netanyahu issued a statement calling them 'a moral outrage of historic proportions. It will cast an everlasting mark of shame on the international court.' Netanyahu maintained that 'Israel is waging a just war against Hamas,' and the 'absurd' charges against him and Gallant 'are merely an attempt to deny Israel the basic right of self-defense.' Netanyahu fired Gallant earlier this month, saying the trust between the two men had evaporated over the course of Israel’s war on Gaza. Hamas has been designated a terrorist group by the United States, Britain. and other Western countries.	https://www.voanews.com/a/icc-issues-war-crimes-arrest-warrants-for-netanyahu-gallant/7871959.html	2024-11-21T06:14:48-08:00	
Finnish police arrest 5 suspects over separatist violence in Nigeria	HELSINKI — Police in Finland said Thursday they had detained five suspects in connection with deadly violence in southeastern Nigeria and were seeking a court extension of the detentions. The police did not identify the suspects, only saying that a dual Finnish-Nigerian citizen, born in the 1980s, was under criminal investigation. However, Simon Ekpa, a Nigerian linked to the Biafran separatist movement, lives in Lahti, where the Paijat-Hame District Court will consider a request from the Finnish National Bureau of Investigation to keep the suspects in custody. Ekpa is one of the leaders of the Indigenous People of Biafra separatist group that is demanding the creation of an independent Biafra state from the troubled southeast region of Nigeria. 'The police suspect that the man [under investigation] has furthered his efforts from Finland in such a way that has resulted in violence against civilians and public authorities and in other crimes in South-East Nigeria,' Detective Chief Inspector Otto Hiltunen said in a statement. The suspect 'carried out this activity by campaigning, for example, on his social media channels,' Hiltunen said. The secessionist campaign in southeastern Nigeria dates to the 1960s when the short-lived Republic of Biafra fought and lost a civil war from 1967 to 1970 to become independent from the West African country. An estimated 1 million people died in the conflict, many from starvation. Nigerian authorities have accused Ekpa of using social media to instigate violence by his followers in Nigeria, many of them young people. Police in Finland said the investigation involves international cooperation. Nigerian authorities have been contacted for comment. For many years Nigeria, Africa's most populous nation, with at least 210 million people, has been wracked by violence related to the activities of armed extremist groups. Most recently, social protests were held over a worsening cost-of-living crisis and alleged bad governance.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finnish-police-arrest-5-suspects-over-separatist-violence-in-nigeria/7871953.html	2024-11-21T06:12:02-08:00	
US envoy to meet Netanyahu in push for ceasefire with Hezbollah	A U.S. envoy was expected to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Thursday amid a push to secure a cease-fire in Israel’s war with the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah. Envoy Amos Hochstein reported progress in what he described as constructive talks this week with Lebanese officials, including Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri, a Hezbollah ally mediating for the militants. Israeli forces continued their military campaign that Netanyahu says is aimed at pushing Hezbollah back from border areas in southern Lebanon where the militants could pose a threat to northern Israel. Israel’s military issued new evacuation orders in southern Lebanon, in Beirut’s southern suburbs and in the Tyre area. Such calls for people to flee have frequently been followed by Israeli strikes that the military says target Hezbollah fighters. Israel has used the same tactic in the Gaza Strip in its fight against Hamas militants, while critics of the strategy say people often have no safe place to go and are given short notice to leave. 'They are trapped with no safe place to go,' Philippe Lazzarini, head of the United Nations agency for Palestinian refugees, said Thursday. 'In northern Gaza, people remain under a tight siege. They run for their lives in vicious circles and have been deprived of humanitarian aid for more than 40 days now.' Cease-fire resolution The United States blocked a U.N. Security Council resolution Wednesday, demanding a permanent cease-fire in Gaza and the release of Israeli hostages, saying the proposed language would have sent the wrong message to Hamas. 'The United States worked for weeks in good faith to avoid this outcome,' U.S. Deputy U.N. Ambassador Robert Wood said after the vote. 'We made clear throughout negotiations, we could not support an unconditional cease-fire that failed to release the hostages, because, as this council has previously called for, a durable end to the war must come with the release of the hostages. These two urgent goals are inextricably linked.' The U.S. veto was its fourth on Gaza since the war between Israel and Hamas started 14 months ago. The failed resolution 'demands an immediate, unconditional and permanent ceasefire to be respected by all parties; and further reiterates its demand for the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages.' The text was drafted and put forward by the 10 elected members of the Security Council, which have expressed growing frustration over the past months at the council’s inability to take decisive action to end the war and free the hostages held by Hamas. Wood said the proposed resolution 'would have sent a dangerous message to Hamas: there's no need to come back to the negotiating table.' 'This resolution is trying to restore life, to save lives. It's not a dangerous message,' the Palestinian deputy ambassador Majed Bamya told the council. 'The draft resolution is not a dangerous message. This veto is a dangerous message to Israel that it can continue executing its plans — the very plans you oppose — and the messages we send do matter, and that is the wrong message at the worst possible time. Israel is responsible for the Palestinian civilians it kills. It cannot be absolved of that responsibility.' The Palestinian envoy said that while the proposed cease-fire would not solve everything, it would be a first step and vetoing it is unjustifiable when atrocities are taking place. 'I truly do not understand, you're saying we cannot be for an unconditional cease-fire,' Bamya said, emotion rising in his voice. 'What that means, in effect now, is that we are for a war. You're saying we cannot be for an unconditional cease-fire that does not release the hostages. Is this war releasing the hostages? Is it? Is it even trying to release the hostages?' Israel’s ambassador said the proposed text would have sent the message that terrorists can act with impunity. 'The resolution brought before this chamber was not a path to peace, it was a road map to more terror, more suffering and more bloodshed,' Danny Danon said. 'Many of you attempted to pass this injustice. We thank the United States for exercising its veto, for standing on the side of morality and justice, for refusing to abandon the hostages and their families.' Council members expressed their disappointment that the resolution was not adopted, and Algeria, which represents the Arab group of nations on the 15-nation Security Council said it would return soon with an even stronger resolution. 'This war represents everything the U.N. Charter stands against. We regret the veto was cast,' said Slovenia’s deputy ambassador Ondina Blokar Drobic. 'Our collective efforts to end the hostilities will not stop,' Guyana’s Ambassador Carolyn Birkett, who led the elected members effort, told reporters after the vote, flanked by her colleagues. 'Once more, the E10 [elected 10 members] is underscoring to the international community, and more importantly to the hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians who continue to bear the cost of these hostilities, including those still held hostage and their loved ones, that we are deeply conscious that the Security Council bears the primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security,' she said. She said they would continue to try to facilitate council unity, adding 'too many lives have already been lost.' 'It is shameful that the United States has once again used the veto to block consensus on a life-saving cease-fire, while they continue to approve deadly arms transfers to fuel the violence and humanitarian catastrophe,' Brenda Moyfa, head of Oxfam’s New York office said in a statement. Hezbollah began its campaign after its ally Hamas launched its October 7, 2023, terror attack on Israel. About 1,200 Israelis were killed, and 250 were taken hostage. About 100 of the hostages have yet to be released, although a third of them are believed to be dead. Following the attack, Israel began a campaign to eliminate Hamas in Gaza that has killed about 44,000 people, according to the Gaza health ministry. Since the fighting with Hezbollah began, more than 3,500 people in Lebanon have been killed, according to authorities. Most of the fatalities have occurred since late September. Hamas and Hezbollah have been designated as terror groups by the United States, the U.K. and other Western countries. VOA United Nations Correspondent Margaret Besheer contributed to this report.

Ukrainian opinion survey tracks fluctuating opinion on quick end to war	Washington — A new survey of public opinion in Ukraine indicates that for the first time a slight majority of Ukrainians say they are ready to concede their lands for peace; however, other recent polls indicate opinions may be more complicated. The Gallup polls released Tuesday, conducted in August and October, found that 52 percent of Ukrainians want their country to negotiate a quick end to the war, while 38 percent want to keep fighting until victory. Although media reports about the survey said it reflects a shift in popular opinion from the outset of the war, when most Ukrainians wanted to fight until victory, other surveys have reported less support for a quick resolution. In September and October of this year, the International Republican Institute's (IRI) Center for Insights in Survey Research (CISR) found that 'strong majorities believe that Ukraine will defeat Russia in the current war and support recapturing all lost territory.' According to this survey, released November 12 and conducted by computer-assisted telephone interviews in the Kyiv-controlled territories in late September and early October, 88% of Ukrainians believe that Ukraine will win the war. This number is lower than 98% in June 2022 but has not changed since February 2024. Similar results came from surveys conducted by Ukrainian pollsters. A study from the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KIIS) conducted in September-October 2024 found that 81% of Ukrainians believe Ukraine can succeed if the West provides adequate support. Only 14% believe Russia is too strong (up from 7% in December 2023). Similarly, a national survey conducted by the Ilko Kucheriv Foundation 'Democratic Initiatives' with the sociological service of the Razumkov Center in August reported that Ukrainians are not ready to capitulate to Russia's territorial demands. Only 9% of Ukrainians said they would agree to recognize the occupied territories as part of the Russian Federation in exchange for peace (up from 5% in August 2023), and 81% consider it unacceptable (down from 90% in August 2023). Pollsters attribute the differences in their results to different methodologies. Benedict Vigers, the author of the Gallup report, says while they asked questions by phone, the Razumkov survey asked questions in person. There are also some differences in sample coverage. For instance, the IRI survey did not get data from in Donetsk or Kherson. In a written response to VOA, Vigers explained that a desire to end the war as soon as possible does not equal a willingness to give away territories. He points out that only half of those who want to negotiate peace are open to unspecified territorial concessions. 'Of the 52% who think Ukraine should seek to negotiate an ending to the war as soon as possible, around half (52%) are open to making some territorial concessions to achieve peace with Russia. Another 38% are not open to these concessions,' he wrote. That means that only a quarter of Ukraine's polled population is open to territorial concessions in exchange for peace. 'There is still a significant chunk of society that wants to keep fighting until victory, and for most of these people, victory means taking back all land lost since 2014, including Crimea,' Vigers said. Mykhailo Mishchenko, deputy director of the Ukrainian Razumkov Center Sociological Service, showed how a slight difference in the question's wording can alter the results. 'When you ask the question, ‘Do you agree that Ukraine should be open to making some territorial concessions as a part of a peace deal to end the war?’ you get a different answer. It does not mean that all 52% of those who said ‘yes’ in the Gallup poll agree to the territorial concessions. They may be open to considering this question,' Mishchenko told VOA. He said that Ukrainian society is tired of war after 2.5 years, and the number of people who support negotiations has grown. They also can observe the change of rhetoric from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who said that Russia should be invited to the next peace summit. But Mishchenko cautions against interpreting the polls' results as a desire of Ukrainians to surrender. In one of his previous interviews, Mishchenko pointed out that many Ukrainians do not believe that territorial concessions would end the war. 'Among those who are ready to make concessions, 26% answered that Russia's goal is genocide and the physical destruction of the majority of Ukrainians. Another 20% of this category indicated that Russia's goal is the destruction of the Ukrainian nation. In total, it is 46%. And only 15% of those who are ready to make concessions answered that Russia's goal is to keep the already occupied territory without claims to the rest of the territory of Ukraine,' he said in an interview with an independent Russian newspaper. Mishchenko points out that Russian polls indicate a greater willingness of Russian society to return lands they occupied to Ukrainians in order to end the war. One such poll was conducted in September 2024 by the Levada Center, a Russian independent pollster. 'They asked respondents if they thought ‘it was necessary to continue military operations or start peace negotiations,’ ' Michshenko said. 'The majority (54%) of the surveyed Russians were in favor of peace negotiations, and the minority (39%) were in favor of the continuation of hostilities. In September 2022, 48% of Russians supported negotiations, and 44% supported the continuation of hostilities,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/ukrainian-opinion-survey-tracks-fluctuating-opinion-on-quick-end-to-war/7871814.html	2024-11-21T04:18:15-08:00	
UK defense secretary to be quizzed on Ukraine’s firing of British missiles into Russia	London — British Defense Secretary John Healey is expected to face lawmakers’ questions Thursday on media reports Ukraine used British-donated Storm Shadow missiles on targets deep inside Russia for the first time Wednesday. Healey is to appear before the parliamentary Defense Committee Thursday morning. The hearing was scheduled before Wednesday’s reported attack. Both the British and Ukrainian governments have refused to confirm or deny reports that Ukrainian forces fired up to 10 Storm Shadow missiles at targets in Maryino, a village in Russia’s Kursk border region. Social media images purport to show Storm Shadow missile fragments in the vicinity. The reports follow U.S. President Joe Biden’s decision this week to approve the use of American ATACMS missiles on targets far inside Russia. Ukraine fired the American missiles into Russia within hours of Biden’s decision. Moscow earlier warned Western nations that allowing Ukraine to attack its territory with long-range missiles would prompt a ’tangible’ response. Kyiv reported Thursday that Russia had launched an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) carrying a conventional warhead at the central city of Dnipro. Authorities said two people were injured. Russia did not immediately respond to the Ukraine statement. ICBMs are also capable of carrying nuclear warheads thousands of kilometers. The attack follows Moscow’s lowering of its threshold for the use of nuclear weapons earlier this week. The British Storm Shadow missiles have already been used against Russian forces in occupied Ukraine, including in a September 2023 attack that destroyed Russia’s former Black Sea fleet headquarters in Crimea. France has also supplied Ukraine with its version of the Storm Shadow missiles, known as Scalp. The European missiles differ from the American-supplied ATACMS, said Patrick Bury, a defense analyst at Britain’s University of Bath. 'They are air launch missiles. Generally, depending on the export variant, they’ve usually got a range of 250 kilometers, or 155 miles. The ATACMS has a longer range than that and isn't air-launched - so therefore it's harder to intercept - in theory, at least,' Bury told VOA. Both weapons systems will open a range of new targets, according to James Nixey, who leads the Russia-Eurasia program at London’s Chatham House. 'The range of both missiles is enough to get behind Russian lines and into Russian infrastructure targets so that will cut their supplies to their front line. So, the actual range of each missile is not as significant as the fact that Ukraine needs them in great quantity - and very fast indeed.' The weapons are unlikely to change the course of the war, Nixey added. 'No single new innovation into the Ukrainian battlefield will do the trick, although they are hoping it will do. They're hoping that it will break the Russian spine and that the [Russian military] will fold, collapse and that will have a chain reaction back up into the Moscow. That seems relatively unlikely, I have to say. But the Ukrainians are desperate and they will do all that they possibly can with however little that they have,' Nixey told Reuters. Ukraine will have to select its targets carefully, said Bury. 'It will slow down the rate of advance, but will it have a strategic impact? Would it change the course of the war? If you're giving them clearance to fire inside Russia, are you going to allow them to actually up the ante and start hitting energy infrastructure, you know, military infrastructure, oil refineries, etcetera, stuff that would really start to hurt the Russian economy? That's the question,' Bury said. Meanwhile Germany, Ukraine’s second-biggest supplier of arms after the United States, this week again ruled out giving Kyiv its long-range Taurus cruise missiles, something Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has long desired. Berlin fears being dragged into the war. 'Nothing has changed for us, the situation, the circumstances are the same. And Taurus is Taurus - and not ATACMS or Storm Shadow - so our perspective on that issue is the same,' German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius told reporters Tuesday. Germany’s main opposition, the Christian Democrats, support giving Ukraine the Taurus missiles. The party is ahead in the polls, with a general election scheduled in February. However, the future of Western military aid to Kyiv remains uncertain following Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. presidential election. Trump has pledged to end the war on his first day in office, although he has not provided any details on how he would achieve that goal. Ukraine fears U.S. support may be cut under Donald Trump. Britain and France could opt to continue supplying Ukraine with missiles, Bury said. 'They're both nuclear powers, they can take that risk if they want to. I think you might find a divergence between European NATO and U.S. NATO on some policy issues around Ukraine,' he told VOA.	https://www.voanews.com/a/uk-defense-secretary-to-be-quizzed-on-ukraine-s-firing-of-british-missiles-into-russia/7871792.html	2024-11-21T03:58:37-08:00	
Volcano on Iceland's Reykjanes Peninsula erupts for the 7th time in a year	GRINDAVIK, Iceland — A volcano on the Reykjanes Peninsula in southwestern Iceland has erupted for the seventh time since December. The eruption started with little warning at 11:14 p.m. Wednesday and created a fissure around 3 kilometers (1.8 miles) long. The activity is estimated to be considerably smaller than the previous eruption in August, Iceland's meteorological office that monitors seismic activity said. 'In the big picture, this is a bit smaller than the last eruption, and the eruption that occurred in May,' Magnus Tumi Guomundsson, a professor of geophysics who flew over the scene with the Civil Protection agency to monitor the event, told the national RUV broadcaster. While the eruption poses no threat to air travel, authorities warned of gas emissions across parts of the peninsula, including the nearby town of Grindavik. Around 50 houses were evacuated after the Civil Protection agency issued the alert, along with guests at the famous Blue Lagoon resort, according to RUV. The repeated volcanic eruptions close to Grindavik, which is about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of the capital, Reykjavik, and has a population of 3,800 people, have damaged infrastructure and property and forced many residents to relocate to guarantee their safety. 'Grindavik is not in danger as it looks and it is unlikely that this crack will get any longer, although nothing can be ruled out,' Magnus Tumi said. Iceland, which sits above a volcanic hot spot in the North Atlantic, averages one eruption every four to five years. The most disruptive in recent times was the 2010 eruption of the Eyjafjallajokull volcano, which spewed clouds of ash into the atmosphere and disrupted trans-Atlantic air travel for months.	https://www.voanews.com/a/volcano-on-iceland-s-reykjanes-peninsula-erupts-for-the-7th-time-in-a-year/7871729.html	2024-11-21T01:11:35-08:00	
US regulators seek to break up Google, forcing Chrome sale	U.S. regulators want a federal judge to break up Google to prevent the company from continuing to squash competition through its dominant search engine after a court found it had maintained an abusive monopoly over the past decade. The proposed breakup floated in a 23-page document filed late Wednesday by the U.S. Department of Justice calls for sweeping punishments that would include a sale of Google's industry-leading Chrome web browser and impose restrictions to prevent Android from favoring its own search engine. A sale of Chrome 'will permanently stop Google's control of this critical search access point and allow rival search engines the ability to access the browser that for many users is a gateway to the internet,' Justice Department lawyers argued in their filing. Although regulators stopped short of demanding Google sell Android too, they asserted the judge should make it clear the company could still be required to divest its smartphone operating system if its oversight committee continues to see evidence of misconduct. The broad scope of the recommended penalties underscores how severely regulators operating under President Joe Biden's administration believe Google should be punished following an August ruling by U.S. District Judge Amit Mehta that branded the company as a monopolist. The Justice Department decision-makers who will inherit the case after President-elect Donald Trump takes office next year might not be as strident. The Washington, D.C., court hearings on Google's punishment are scheduled to begin in April and Mehta is aiming to issue his final decision before Labor Day. If Mehta embraces the government's recommendations, Google would be forced to sell its 16-year-old Chrome browser within six months of the final ruling. But the company certainly would appeal any punishment, potentially prolonging a legal tussle that has dragged on for more than four years. Besides seeking a Chrome spinoff and a corralling of the Android software, the Justice Department wants the judge to ban Google from forging multibillion-dollar deals to lock in its dominant search engine as the default option on Apple's iPhone and other devices. It would also ban Google from favoring its own services, such as YouTube or its recently launched artificial intelligence platform, Gemini. Regulators also want Google to license the search index data it collects from people's queries to its rivals, giving them a better chance at competing with the tech giant. On the commercial side of its search engine, Google would be required to provide more transparency into how it sets the prices that advertisers pay to be listed near the top of some targeted search results. Kent Walker, Google's chief legal officer, lashed out at the Justice Department for pursuing 'a radical interventionist agenda that would harm Americans and America's global technology.' In a blog post, Walker warned the 'overly broad proposal' would threaten personal privacy while undermining Google's early leadership in artificial intelligence, 'perhaps the most important innovation of our time.' Wary of Google's increasing use of artificial intelligence in its search results, regulators also advised Mehta to ensure websites will be able to shield their content from Google's AI training techniques. The measures, if they are ordered, threaten to upend a business expected to generate more than $300 billion in revenue this year. 'The playing field is not level because of Google's conduct, and Google's quality reflects the ill-gotten gains of an advantage illegally acquired,' the Justice Department asserted in its recommendations. 'The remedy must close this gap and deprive Google of these advantages.' It's still possible that the Justice Department could ease off attempts to break up Google, especially if Trump takes the widely expected step of replacing Assistant Attorney General Jonathan Kanter, who was appointed by Biden to oversee the agency's antitrust division. Although the case targeting Google was originally filed during the final months of Trump's first term in office, Kanter oversaw the high-profile trial that culminated in Mehta's ruling against Google. Working in tandem with Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, Kanter took a get-tough stance against Big Tech that triggered other attempted crackdowns on industry powerhouses such as Apple and discouraged many business deals from getting done during the past four years. Trump recently expressed concerns that a breakup might destroy Google but didn't elaborate on alternative penalties he might have in mind. 'What you can do without breaking it up is make sure it's more fair,' Trump said last month. Matt Gaetz, the former Republican congressman that Trump nominated to be the next U.S. Attorney General, has previously called for the breakup of Big Tech companies. Gaetz faces a tough confirmation hearing. This latest filing gave Kanter and his team a final chance to spell out measures that they believe are needed to restore competition in search. It comes six weeks after Justice first floated the idea of a breakup in a preliminary outline of potential penalties. But Kanter's proposal is already raising questions about whether regulators seek to impose controls that extend beyond the issues covered in last year's trial, and — by extension — Mehta's ruling. Banning the default search deals that Google now pays more than $26 billion annually to maintain was one of the main practices that troubled Mehta in his ruling. It's less clear whether the judge will embrace the Justice Department's contention that Chrome needs to be spun out of Google and or Android should be completely walled off from its search engine. 'It is probably going a little beyond,' Syracuse University law professor Shubha Ghosh said of the Chrome breakup. 'The remedies should match the harm, it should match the transgression. This does seem a little beyond that pale.' Google rival DuckDuckGo, whose executives testified during last year's trial, asserted the Justice Department is simply doing what needs to be done to rein in a brazen monopolist. 'Undoing Google's overlapping and widespread illegal conduct over more than a decade requires more than contract restrictions: it requires a range of remedies to create enduring competition,' Kamyl Bazbaz, DuckDuckGo's senior vice president of public affairs, said in a statement. Trying to break up Google harks back to a similar punishment initially imposed on Microsoft a quarter century ago following another major antitrust trial that culminated in a federal judge deciding the software maker had illegally used his Windows operating system for PCs to stifle competition. However, an appeals court overturned an order that would have broken up Microsoft, a precedent many experts believe will make Mehta reluctant to go down a similar road with the Google case.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-regulators-seek-to-break-up-google-forcing-chrome-sale/7871725.html	2024-11-21T01:03:09-08:00	
Philippines death toll rises to 12	MANILA, PHILIPPINES — The death toll from Super Typhoon Man-yi in the Philippines has risen to 12, the national disaster agency said Thursday as widespread flooding subsided. Man-yi submerged villages and smashed flimsy buildings in the archipelago nation over the weekend, packing maximum sustained wind speeds of 185 kilometres (115 miles) an hour. It was the sixth major storm in a month to strike the Philippines. Together they have killed at least 175 people and displaced thousands, as well as wiping out crops and livestock Most of the Man-yi deaths were in mountainous areas north of the capital Manila, including seven people killed after a landslide buried their house in Nueva Vizcaya province. A boulder also crushed a house, burying three people alive, in the coastal town of Dipaculao, where Man-yi had made a second landfall, Ariel Nepomuceno, a senior official with the government's civil defence office, told AFP. Four people remain missing, he added. 'We are now in the recovery period, people have started to fix their houses,' Nepomuceno said. 'Construction materials have been arriving in hard-hit provinces.' In the northern city of Tuguegarao, floodwaters induced by a dam release and a swollen Cagayan River have started to subside, after swamping thousands of houses in the days after the typhoon exited the country. 'The water level has subsided and is now just one foot (0.3 metres) high. Some evacuees have also gone back to their homes,' city disaster official Ian Valdepenas told AFP on Thursday. Schools and government offices have reopened. About 20 big storms and typhoons hit the Southeast Asian nation or its surrounding waters each year, killing scores of people, but it is rare for multiple such weather events to take place in a small window.	https://www.voanews.com/a/philippines-death-toll-rises-to-12/7871727.html	2024-11-21T01:01:48-08:00	
Russian attack causes damage in Ukraine’s Dnipropetrovsk region	Ukrainian officials reported damage Thursday to an industrial site in the Dnipropetrovsk region after a series of Russian attacks. Dnipropetrovsk Governor Serhiy Lysak said the attacks hit the city of Dnipro and also caused several fires. Volodymyr Artiukh, governor of Ukraine’s Sumy region, said on Telegram that Russian forces shelled areas along the border between the two countries and attacked with an aerial drone. Russia’s Defense Ministry said its air defenses destroyed two Ukrainian drones over the Rostov region and two drones over Volgograd. Yuri Slyusar, the acting governor of Rostov, said on Telegram there were no casualties and no damage as a result of the Ukrainian attack. US mines The U.S. is planning to send Ukraine antipersonnel land mines to help Kyiv’s forces fend off the advance of Russian ground troops, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said Wednesday. The decision is the second U.S. policy reversal in recent days after President Joe Biden, in the last two months of his White House tenure, switched his stance and said Ukraine is now free to launch Washington-supplied, long-range missiles deeper into Russia. Ukraine quickly targeted munitions warehouses with its first attack on Tuesday. Austin, speaking to reporters traveling with him on a trip to Laos, said allowing the shipment of the U.S. land mines to Ukraine became necessary because of changing battlefield tactics by Moscow’s forces. He said Russian ground troops are leading the movement on the battlefield, rather than forces protected by armored carriers, so Ukraine has 'a need for things that can help slow down that effort on the part of the Russians.' Russia has captured more territory in eastern Ukraine in recent weeks. Austin said the land mines that the U.S. will provide can be controlled for self-activation and self-detonation. Russia, like the United States, did not sign the United Nations convention on the prohibition of anti-personnel mines, but Ukraine had, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov noted on Wednesday. Russia has deployed at least 13 types of land mines in Ukraine, according to Human Rights Watch, and uses them extensively in territory it has captured from Ukraine, according to The Washington Post. The U.S. on Wednesday also said it is sending another $275 million package of munitions to Kyiv, including arms for rocket systems, artillery and antitank weapons. It is the 70th such shipment since August 2021. The changing policies and additional arms supply appear to be an effort by Biden and his defense team to shore up Ukraine’s war effort before U.S. President-elect Donald Trump takes office January 20. Trump has been a skeptic of continuing U.S. support for Ukraine, claiming he will have the war ended before he even takes office but not offering any details on how he would do so.

Australian teen dies after alcohol poisoning in Laos	An Australian teenager died Thursday in Laos, a week after drinking alcohol tainted with methanol. Nineteen-year-old Bianca Jones is the fourth person to die since a group became sick during a night out in the town of Vang Vieng. The other deaths include an American and two Danes. 'This is every parent's worst fear and a nightmare no one should have to endure,' Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told parliament on Thursday. 'All Australians offer them our deepest sympathy in this time of heartbreak.' Vang Vieng is an area popular with backpackers located about 100 kilometers north of Vientiane.

Daughter of jailed Eritrean journalist continues to fight for his release	Journalist Betlehem Isaak, the daughter of journalist Dawit Isaak — a dual Eritrean-Swedish citizen imprisoned without trial in Eritrea since 2001— accepted the 2024 Edelstam Prize on her father's behalf Tuesday during a ceremony at the House of Nobility in Stockholm. The prize honors Dawit for his 'outstanding courage' in championing freedom of expression. The judges noted his commitment to advocating for democracy in Eritrea despite harassment, threats and repeated interrogations. 'His punishment, his perpetual unlawful detention, never charged with a crime, defenseless and deprived of his basic rights without a trial, his de facto status of civil death, is untenable,' said Caroline Edelstam, chair of the Edelstam Prize jury and co-founder of the Edelstam Foundation. The loss of her father not only has brought pain but has also taught her resilience, Betlehem said. Speaking to VOA from Gothenburg, Sweden, ahead of the award ceremony, she said continuing her father's legacy is both a painful burden and a source of inspiration. 'Losing a parent as a 7-year-old little girl is, of course, very traumatic,' Betlehem said. 'But it's also the strength I get from it today, and I really value it, even though I don't wish this on my worst enemies.' Arrested during 2001 crackdown Dawit was arrested during a government crackdown on independent media in Eritrea in September 2001. Eritrea ranks among the most tightly controlled countries in the world. A country with no independent media, Eritrea subjects all citizens to indefinite national service and has never held national elections. Twenty-one journalists and politicians from the 2001 roundup remain in detention, according to Amnesty International. Betlehem said although her father's disappearance left a void in the family, she chose to follow in his footsteps and advocate for justice and freedom of expression. 'Freedom, in general, is actually something that we have to fight for almost every day,' she said. This personal battle has informed Betlehem's perspective as a journalist. In her work, she highlights the stories of those who face oppression. She said that her father's plight should not be taken 'for granted, especially when it comes to freedom.' 'I continue the work' In more than 23 years, Dawit's imprisonment has prompted international campaigns and requests from the Swedish government for his release. 'My father is actually a symbol,' Betlehem said, adding that his story and 'his colleagues with him' are 'a symbol of what's really happening and has happened in Eritrea for the last 25 years.' For her, continuing his legacy is both a privilege and a responsibility. Though she was just a little girl when he was taken away, she follows his principles. 'I continue the work that my father and his colleagues started,' she said. The Eritrean government 'will never silence their voice, because I am my father's voice, and I am also the voice of every Eritrean.' Several attempts by VOA to reach out to the government on Dawit's status went unanswered. Daughter calls for father's release Betlehem's advocacy extends beyond journalism. She frequently engages in campaigns calling for her father's release and raises awareness about press freedom. Despite challenges, Betlehem remains hopeful. Without going into details, she said, she has proof of life to keep her going. 'We know that my father is alive, and we know that that's the truth,' she said. 'We have sources that say that, and we believe those sources.' Freedom isn't just about writing or speaking as a journalist where there's censorship, she said. 'You cannot even exist as a free human being,' she said. 'You cannot even think.'

Biden negotiators hopeful of Mideast deal	President Joe Biden’s top Mideast envoy said Wednesday he’s hopeful about negotiations with Hezbollah to bring the conflict along Israel’s northern border to an end, although fighting continues, and an end appears nowhere in sight in Gaza.

US Senate blocks bid to halt some Israel military sales	washington — The U.S. Senate on Wednesday blocked legislation that would have halted the sale of some U.S. weapons to Israel. The measures had been introduced out of concern about the human rights catastrophe Palestinians face in Gaza. Seventy-nine of the 100 senators opposed a resolution that would have blocked sales of tank rounds to Israel, while 18 approved it and one voted present. Seventy-eight opposed a second measure, which would have stopped the shipment of mortar rounds, while 19 supported it and one voted present. The Senate was to vote later Wednesday on a third resolution that would stop shipments of a GPS guidance system for bombs. All of the votes in favor of the measures came from the Democratic caucus. Those against came from both Democrats and Republicans. The 'resolutions of disapproval' were filed by Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats, and co-sponsored by a handful of Democrats. Strong bipartisan support for Israel in Congress meant the resolutions were never likely to pass, but backers hoped significant support in the Senate would encourage Israel's government and President Joe Biden's administration to do more to protect civilians in Gaza. The Biden administration opposed the resolutions. Most of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people has been displaced and the enclave is at risk of famine, more than a year into Israel's war against Hamas in the Palestinian enclave. Gaza health officials say nearly 44,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive. Sanders, accusing Israel of blocking aid shipments, said providing military aid to Israel violates U.S. law barring weapons sales to human rights abusers. 'It is time to tell the [Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin] Netanyahu government that they cannot use U.S. taxpayer dollars and American weapons in violation of U.S. and international law and our moral values,' Sanders said in a Senate speech before the vote. Opponents said the resolutions were inappropriate as Israel faces threats from designated terror groups like Hamas and Hezbollah, and from archenemy Iran. 'Israel is surrounded by enemies dedicated to its annihilation,' the Senate's Democratic majority leader, Chuck Schumer, said in a Senate speech before the votes. Israel says that it has been working to address humanitarian needs and that the main problem with aid deliveries is U.N. distribution challenges. Its embassy in Washington did not respond this week to a request for comment on Sanders' resolutions. U.S. law gives Congress the right to stop major foreign weapons sales by passing resolutions of disapproval. Although no such resolution has passed Congress and survived a presidential veto, the law requires the Senate to vote if a resolution is filed. Such resolutions have at times led to angry debates embarrassing to past presidents.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-senate-blocks-bid-to-halt-some-israel-military-sales-/7871616.html	2024-11-20T18:15:22-08:00	
US charges Indian billionaire Gautam Adani with fraud, conspiracy	new york — An Indian businessman who is one of the world's richest people has been indicted in the United States on charges he duped investors by concealing that his company's huge solar energy project on the subcontinent was being facilitated by an alleged bribery scheme. Gautam Adani, 62, was charged in an indictment unsealed Wednesday with securities fraud and conspiracy to commit securities and wire fraud. The case involves a lucrative arrangement for Adani Green Energy Ltd. and another firm to sell 12 gigawatts of solar power to the Indian government — enough to light millions of homes and businesses. The indictment portrays Adani and his co-defendants as playing two sides of the deal. It accuses them of portraying the plan as rosy and aboveboard to Wall Street investors who poured several billion dollars into the project while, back in India, they were paying or planning to pay about $265 million in bribes to government officials in exchange for billions of dollars' worth of contracts and financing. Adani and his co-defendants allegedly sought to 'obtain and finance massive state energy supply contracts through corruption and fraud at the expense of U.S. investors,' Deputy Assistant Attorney General Lisa Miller said. In a parallel civil action, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission accused Adani and two co-defendants of violating anti-fraud provisions of U.S. securities laws. The regulator is seeking monetary penalties and other sanctions. Both cases were filed in federal court in Brooklyn. Adani's co-defendants include his nephew, Sagar Adani, the executive director of Adani Green Energy's board, and Vneet Jaain, who was the company's chief executive from 2020 to 2023 and remains managing director of its board. Online court records did not list lawyers who could speak on the defendants' behalf. An email message seeking comment was left with an arm of Adani's company, the Adani Group. Sanjay Wadhwa, acting director of the SEC's Enforcement Division, said Gautam and Sagar Adani are accused of persuading investors to buy their company's bonds by misrepresenting 'not only that Adani Green had a robust anti-bribery compliance program but also that the company's senior management had not and would not pay or promise to pay bribes.' Adani is a power player in the world's most populous nation. He built his fortune in the coal business in the 1990s. The Adani Group grew to involve many aspects of Indian life, from making defense equipment to building roads to selling cooking oil. In recent years, Adani has made big moves into renewable energy, embracing a philosophy of sustainable growth reflected in its slogan: 'Growth with Goodness.' Last year, a U.S.-based financial research firm accused Adani and his company of 'brazen stock manipulation' and 'accounting fraud.' The Adani Group called the claims 'a malicious combination of selective misinformation and stale, baseless and discredited allegations.' The firm in question is known as a short-seller, a Wall Street term for traders that essentially bet on the prices of certain stocks to fall, and it had made such investments in relation to the Adani Group.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-charges-indian-billionaire-gautam-adani-with-fraud-conspiracy-/7871576.html	2024-11-20T17:26:43-08:00	
Finnish authorities open probe into ruptured undersea cable between Finland, Germany	HELSINKI, Finland — Finnish authorities said Wednesday they have opened an investigation into the rupture of a data cable under the Baltic Sea, adding to a Swedish probe into the possible sabotage of that link and another cable. The C-Lion1 cable, which runs between Finland and Germany was damaged on Monday, the day after similar damage to a cable that crosses the Baltic between Lithuania and Sweden, with the incidents occurring off the Swedish islands of Oland and Gotland respectively. Germany's defense minister said Tuesday that the damage appeared to have been caused by sabotage, though there is no proof at present. Finland's National Bureau of Investigation said it opened a criminal investigation into the rupture of the C-Lion1 cable on suspicion of 'aggravated criminal mischief and aggravated interference with communications.' Swedish police already opened a preliminary investigation Tuesday into suspected sabotage regarding the two cable breaches, and said Wednesday that 'Swedish police and prosecutors are also interested in a ship that has been seen at the locations in question.' They didn't give any details or identify the vessel but said that 'it is not currently in Swedish waters.' The official investigations came as news reports said a Chinese-flagged vessel, the Yi Peng 3, had been in the area at the time of the ruptures. Vessel tracking information from the Marine Traffic website showed the 225-meter (738-foot) long bulk carrier not moving Wednesday afternoon off the coast of Denmark in the Baltic. The Royal Danish Navy did not immediately respond to an emailed request for comment from The Associated Press.	https://www.voanews.com/a/finnish-authorities-open-probe-into-ruptured-undersea-cable-between-finland-germany/7871578.html	2024-11-20T17:07:30-08:00	
Georgia election workers say Giuliani continues to defame them	Two former Georgia election workers who won a $148 million defamation judgment against Rudy Giuliani asked a judge Wednesday to penalize him even further for continuing to falsely accuse them of tampering with ballots during the 2020 presidential election. Attorneys for Ruby Freeman and her daughter, Wandrea 'Shaye' Moss, argued in a filing in a Washington federal court that Giuliani has violated an agreement he signed to stop repeating the falsehoods. The alleged violations came in statements he made during two recent broadcasts of his nightly show on the social media platform X. 'These statements repeat the exact same lies for which Mr. Giuliani has already been held liable, and which he agreed to be bound by court order to stop repeating,' read the filing, which asked the judge to hold Giuliani in contempt and impose sanctions against him. A lawyer for Giuliani, Joseph M. Cammarata, said he had not seen the court filing and could not respond to its specific claims, but accused the women's attorneys of trying to intimidate the former New York City mayor. In a statement, Giuliani's spokesperson, Ted Goodman, called the new legal filing an attempt to 'deprive Mayor Rudy Giuliani of his First Amendment right to freedom of speech.' Giuliani is barred from accusing the women of election wrongdoing. The longtime Donald Trump ally was found liable last year for defaming Freeman and Moss by accusing them of ballot tampering as he pushed then-President Trump's lies about election fraud. The women said they faced death threats after Giuliani falsely claimed they sneaked in ballots in suitcases, counted ballots multiple times and tampered with voting machines. The $148 million judgment led to a failed bankruptcy attempt by Giuliani. He has since been ordered to turn over many of his assets to Freeman and Moss, including his $5 million Upper East Side apartment. In December, the women sued Giuliani again for continuing to repeat his ballot-tampering claims, resulting in the court issuing a permanent injunction in May that barred the former mayor from making any statements that suggest the women engaged in any wrongdoing in connection with the 2020 presidential election. Lawyers for the two plaintiffs argued in Wednesday's court filing that Giuliani broke that agreement when he referred to the pair again on his recent video broadcasts on November 12 and 14, including baselessly claiming that he was not allowed to show tapes of 'quadruple counting' ballots during the trial. In his statement responding to the filing, Goodman argued that Giuliani 'has every right to defend himself.' Giuliani's lawyer says 90% to 95% of his possessions have been turned over to Freeman and Moss. Giuliani has been critical of a judge's ruling that ordered him to turn over many prized possessions, including the apartment, a Mercedes once owned by movie star Lauren Bacall and dozens of luxury watches. He said he should not have had to surrender his possessions until his appeal is decided.	https://www.voanews.com/a/georgia-election-workers-say-giuliani-continues-to-defame-them/7871577.html	2024-11-20T17:05:13-08:00	
Foreign fighters flocking to Islamic State in Somalia	washington — The Islamic State terror group's small but influential affiliate in Somalia is growing, thanks in part to what the United Nations describes as an 'influx of foreign fighters.' A new report this week by the U.N. Sanctions Monitoring Team for Somalia warns that fighters, including some from countries in the Middle East, have helped the Islamic State's Somali affiliate, also known as IS-Somalia, to more than double in size to between 600 and 700 fighters. 'Foreign fighters arrive in Puntland [Somalia] using both maritime and overland routes,' according to the report, which is based on intelligence estimates from U.N. member states. The foreign fighters 'have expanded and enhanced the group's capabilities,' the report said, strengthening IS's presence in Somalia's Puntland region while also helping it take territory from its key rival, al-Qaida-linked terror group al-Shabab. Intelligence sources described the IS-Somalia advance, especially in Puntland's Cal Miskaad mountains, as a 'drastic change,' crediting the foreign fighters for IS-Somalia's change in fortune. The U.N. report said the IS foreign fighters have come from at least six countries: Syria, Yemen, Ethiopia, Sudan, Morocco and Tanzania. It also said some captured foreign fighters have reported working with trainers who have come from parts of the Middle East. The new report builds on previous warnings from U.S. and Somali officials, including the commander of U.S. Africa Command, who told VOA last month that IS-Somalia had grown 'twofold' over the past year. Somali officials have likewise warned of hundreds of foreign fighters flocking to Somalia to join the ranks of the IS affiliate. 'This reporting on an influx of foreign terrorist fighters in Africa is concerning,' said Austin Doctor, the director of counterterrorism research initiatives at the National Counterterrorism Innovation, Technology and Education Center. And while the flow of foreign fighters to Somalia pales in comparison to the tens of thousands of fighters who flocked to join IS in Syria and Iraq during the height of the terror group's self-declared caliphate, Doctor told VOA the trend is likely to continue. 'A number of factors present in the Horn [of Africa] and other Africa regions as well will likely appeal to aspiring travelers looking to join the rank and file of an extremist militant organization,' he said. 'Global and local security forces should prepare to see more of this in the near term.' There are likewise concerns about IS-Somalia's growing prominence on the global stage. Since 2022, Somalia has been home to al-Karrar, one of nine regional Islamic State offices established to help sustain the terror group's global capabilities. The U.N. report cautions that despite some leadership losses, the al-Karrar office has become both more powerful and more decentralized, making it more difficult to disrupt its activities. And the report confirms that former IS-Somalia leader Abdulqadir Mumin, who escaped a U.S. airstrike this past June, has been elevated to head of the Islamic State's general directorate of provinces, 'placing him in a leadership role over [IS] affiliates in Africa.' IS-Somalia, according to the report, is now being led by Mumin's former deputy, Abdirahman Fahiye Isse, with Abdiwali Waran-Walac running IS-Somalia's finances. And the group's finances appear to be in good shape. 'Given the relatively small size of [IS]-Somalia, the group can sustain itself and generate additional revenue for other [IS] affiliates through the al-Karrar office,' the report said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/foreign-fighters-flocking-to-islamic-state-in-somalia/7871573.html	2024-11-20T17:01:44-08:00	
Maui Invitational returns to a Lahaina still struggling after deadly wildfire	Honolulu, hawaii — Three generations of TJ Rickard's family lost their homes in the deadly Maui wildfire more than a year ago, and he and his extended family still have not rebuilt. That leaves Rickard, a high school basketball coach, conflicted about next week's return of the storied Maui Invitational college tournament. Like many, Rickard is excited to have top-drawer basketball played in Lahaina's humble arena, but he worries people will think it's business as usual in his hometown. In truth, he said, Lahaina is still struggling after the fire killed at least 102 people and leveled thousands of homes. 'Not even a minute drive away from where they play, there's houses that are burned down that are still waiting to be rebuilt,' said Rickard, the boys head coach at Lahainaluna High School. Many residents are excited about the local exposure to high-caliber competition and the economic boost the Maui Invitational will bring. But there's also a fear that travelers might show disrespect by wandering into the Lahaina burn zone and taking photos of the devastation, or trigger unpleasant memories with questions about that catastrophic day. 'People are in a weird state right now over here because there's so much displacement and loss of community,' said Jon Conrad, Lahainaluna's athletic director. 'It's a highly sensitive and slightly charged environment.' Boosters coming to Lahaina should know 'it's been a year and more, but things are still a little raw,' Conrad said. 'It's our home' The Maui Invitational will bring eight of the NCAA's best men's teams — including two-time defending champion University of Connecticut — to Lahaina's 2,400-seat gymnasium for three days. Last year, organizers moved the tournament to Honolulu instead of intruding on Lahaina when many survivors were still living in hotels and charred rubble littered properties. This year, they decided to bring the 40-year-old event back after meeting with the governor's office, the Hawaii Tourism Authority and Maui's mayor, said Tom Valdiserri, executive vice president of KemperSports LIVE. 'It's our home and we want to be there. And Maui is our ohana, frankly,' Valdiserri said, using the Hawaiian word for family. Reconstruction is progressing slowly. The Army Corps of Engineers has fully cleared all residential lots and 91% of commercial lots of fire debris. Maui County has issued 133 building permits after receiving 291 applications. One property has been finished. Rickard's experience shows how challenging housing is even 15 months after the fire. The blaze burned down his grandparents' house and the in-law unit on their property where Rickard lived with his wife and dog. His parents' house a few lots away got torched. The blaze claimed a cousin's house across the street and another cousin's place the next street over. A great-aunt who lived down the road lost her house, too. Rickard now lives in an apartment a 45-minute drive away that's paid for by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. His relatives are living with friends or other family. Maui officials hope the tournament will help rebuild the tourism industry, which took a massive hit. In 2022, the last year the Maui Invitational was held in Lahaina, the competition brought 6,500 visitors and $24 million in spending to Maui, KemperSports LIVE said. University of Hawaii researchers said last month that fewer than half of those who had full-time jobs in Lahaina's tourism industry still do. Those with jobs are working fewer hours, their report said. Bringing life 'back to normal' Rebuilding helps Javier Barberi cope with the disaster. His company, Hana Hou Hospitality, reopened a popular beachfront restaurant that was spared by the flames — Mala Ocean Tavern — eight months after the fire. He and his partners overhauled another restaurant and launched it as a new establishment called Coco Deck. To him, the tournament's return is a sign of hope. 'Like, hey, we used to have this. It was gone. Now it's back,' Barberi said. 'That restaurant was gone. Now it's back. That house was gone, now it's being rebuilt. To see these things happen, it starts to bring things back to normal and bring Maui back.' Jason Donez, general manager of Leilani's restaurant, remembers his daughter Lola meeting Mike Krzyzewski, Duke's head coach at the time, at a free-throw contest in 2018. The Hall of Fame coach told the 12-year-old she had a nice shot, she should stick with it and he would see her in college one day, Donez said. Today, Lola Donez is a freshman guard at Cal. Being around the teams helped her 'dream big,' her father said. Organizers ask teams to show respect Tickets to the games this year range from $56 to $236 depending on the game and seat location, but local residents get about a 28% discount. Tournament organizers and teams will hold basketball clinics for local students. Organizers have reminded participating schools and their teams to be respectful, and the tournament website has the same message for fans. The athletes and their coaches say they understand. 'I think that's where you try to remind guys that we're very fortunate to be able to travel and do the things the way we do, and we're going to a community that had a huge devastation that none of us would want anyone go to through,' said North Carolina assistant coach Sean May. 'So, we've got to have some compassion.' 'But I think at the end, they're happy we're there, we're happy to be there, it's great for the community. And to me, it brings so much excitement.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/maui-invitational-returns-to-a-lahaina-still-struggling-after-deadly-wildfire/7871555.html	2024-11-20T17:00:28-08:00	
As international force struggles to stabilize Haiti, calls grow for UN force	united nations — A senior U.N. official urged the international community on Wednesday to make good on its commitments to fund and equip a multinational security force in Haiti, which is struggling to help the Haitian National Police subdue armed gangs who are terrorizing the population, while some nations want to transform the multinational force into a U.N. peacekeeping force. 'Without a substantial and sustained increase in voluntary contributions from member states, there is a real risk that the MSS will never be fully equipped, fully deployed or able to sustain its support for the Haitian National Police,' Miroslav Jenca, U.N. assistant secretary-general, told Security Council members, using the acronym for the Multinational Security Support mission. He said the mission requires a 'sizable increase' in weapons, equipment and specialized expertise that the Haitian National Police lack. 'This must be accompanied by efforts to build up national police capabilities to support the government in sustainably delivering security,' Jenca said. He said efforts must also be made to stem the illicit flow of drugs, weapons and ammunition and to curb corruption. He urged the council to utilize sanctions to their 'full potential' to address the root causes of gang violence. 'Any further delays or operational gaps in providing international security support to the Haitian National Police, whether through the MSS or bilateral assistance, present a catastrophic risk of collapse of national security institutions,' Jenca cautioned. 'This could lead to a complete breakdown of state authority, rendering international operations and the support to Haitians in need in the country untenable.' Jenca acknowledged that there are no ideal options for addressing the spiraling situation in Haiti. 'But as time passes and the situation deteriorates, we are left with less options, and the Haitian people are left with less hope,' he said. 'It is high time we turn commitments into action to prevent any further erosion of security and state authority in Haiti.' The MSS is led by Kenya, which has contributed most of the 416 police officers who have deployed to Haiti since June. The misson’s full strength has been set at 2,500 police, but equipment and funding challenges have tempered contributions. So far, only Kenya, Belize, the Bahamas and Jamaica have sent personnel. Monica Juma, Kenyan President William Ruto’s national security adviser, told the council in a remote briefing that her government has 617 more police who are trained and ready to deploy. She said they need equipment and logistics to support their rapid deployment. Calls for a UN force The United States and Ecuador, the co-leads on Haiti on the 15-nation Security Council, want the MSS to become a U.N. peacekeeping operation. The current mission is not a U.N. one, but it does have Security Council authorization. Haiti’s past experiences with U.N. peacekeeping missions have ended badly, and it was originally felt that a non-U.N. mission was a better idea. But a lack of funding, equipment and logistics has brought even Haiti’s struggling government around to the idea of a U.N. mission, which would benefit from sustainable funding and access to more resources. Haitian Ambassador Antonio Rodrigue expressed his government’s support for a U.N. peacekeeping force, saying the armed gangs are becoming increasingly violent and fearless. 'They are committing terrifying abuse, murders, abductions, rapes and burning of homes,' he said. 'Children, women and men are caught and entrapped in this indiscriminate violence.' The United Nations says more than 700,000 people are displaced across Haiti, most from the capital, Port-au-Prince, where armed groups control 80% of neighborhoods. The International Organization for Migration said Monday that more than 20,000 people had been displaced across the capital area in just four days. 'This alarming situation really shows us that we need to call for the MSS to be transformed into a U.N. peacekeeping mission,' Haiti’s ambassador said. 'We are not just talking about restoring public order, we are talking about preserving human lives,' Rodrigue emphasized, adding that without security, there would be no economic, social or political progress. 'Haiti is at a crossroads — either the international community lends significant support, or it leaves the country to plunge further into violence with consequences that are bound to spill over across our borders,' he said. Washington’s envoy said the U.S. and Ecuador are ready to move forward to take the initial step and ask the U.N. secretary-general to prepare recommendations on a peacekeeping mission to follow the MSS. But not all council members have embraced the idea. Russia and China, which called for Wednesday’s council meeting, both expressed serious reservations about sending peacekeepers to Haiti, where there is a lack of peace to keep. 'Deploying a peacekeeping operation at this time is nothing more than putting peacekeepers into the front lines of battles with gangs,' said China’s Deputy Ambassador Geng Shuang. 'This will expose peacekeepers to great security risks.' The U.N. secretary-general has also not generally favored the idea, saying last year that it is an option of last resort. Regional support Several regional countries back the idea of a U.N. peacekeeping mission. The Organization of American States adopted its own resolution of support last week, while regional bloc CARICOM has also endorsed the idea. Canada, one of the largest financial donors to the MSS, urged the council to move to create a mission that could succeed. 'We must act now,' Ambassador Bob Rae said. 'Time is not our friend. It is not our friend. There is not a moment to lose.' 'Haiti is out of control, and it is a danger to the Haitian people and a constant threat to the Dominican Republic and the region,' said Dominican Ambassador Jose Alfonso Blanco Conde. His country shares the island with Haiti and supports a U.N. deployment. Haiti has been rocked by instability since 2021, when President Jovenel Moise was assassinated. Prime Minister Ariel Henry then led the country until he announced his resignation in March. A transitional government is now in place with the goal of organizing free and fair elections, but it has been beset by internal and external challenges. Haiti has not held elections since 2016.	https://www.voanews.com/a/as-international-force-struggles-to-stabilize-haiti-calls-grow-for-un-force-/7871559.html	2024-11-20T16:40:08-08:00	
Susan Smith denied parole 30 years after drowning sons by rolling car into lake	columbia, south carolina — A parole board decided unanimously Wednesday that Susan Smith should remain in prison despite her plea that God has forgiven her for killing her two young sons 30 years ago by rolling her car into a South Carolina lake while they were strapped in their car seats. It was the first parole hearing for Smith, 53, who is serving a life sentence after a jury convicted her of murder but decided to spare her the death penalty. She is eligible for a parole hearing every two years now that she has spent 30 years behind bars. Smith made her case by video link from prison. She started by saying she was 'very sorry,' then broke down in tears and bowed her head. 'I know what I did was horrible,' Smith said, pausing and then continuing with a wavering voice. 'And I would give anything if I could go back and change it.' In her final statements, Smith said God has forgiven her. 'I ask that you show that same kind of mercy, as well,' she said. Smith made international headlines in 1994 when she insisted for nine days that a Black carjacker drove away with her sons. Prosecutors have long argued that Smith killed 3-year-old Michael and 14-month-old Alex because she believed they were the reason the wealthy son of the owner of the business where she worked broke off their affair. Her attorneys blame her mental health. A group of about 15 people urged against parole. They included her ex-husband and father of the boys, David Smith; his family members; prosecutors; and law enforcement officials. Along with a few others, David Smith had a photo of Michael and Alex pinned to his suit jacket. He struggled to get out words at first, pausing several times to compose himself. He said he has never seen Susan Smith express remorse toward him. 'She changed my life for the rest of my life that night,' he said. 'I'm asking that you please deny her parole today, and hopefully in the future, but specifically today,' he said, adding that he plans to attend each parole hearing to make sure Michael and Alex aren't forgotten. A decision to grant parole requires a two-thirds vote of board members present, according to the state. Parole in South Carolina is granted only about 8% of the time and is less likely with an inmate's first appearance before the board, in notorious cases, or when prosecutors and the families of victims are opposed. Before Smith testified, she listened stoically to a statement from her attorney, Tommy Thomas. He called her situation one about 'the dangers of untreated mental health.' He also noted she had no criminal history before her conviction, making her 'low risk' to the public. The board's decision was the one David Smith had hoped for, Smith said in a news conference following the hearing. 'In two more years, we'll go through this again,' he said. 'But at least I know, for now, she'll still be behind bars.' The family and prosecution had been 'cautiously optimistic,' former prosecutor Tommy Pope said, because Susan Smith has continually demonstrated that it's 'always been about Susan.' Mother pleas for children Smith had claimed in October 1994 that she was carjacked late at night near the city of Union and that a Black man wearing a toboggan hat drove away with her sons. The claims by Smith, who is white, played into a centuries-old racist trope of Black men being a danger to white women and stoked concerns about crime that were prevalent in 1990s America and remain so today. For nine days, Smith made numerous and sometimes tearful pleas asking that Michael and Alex be returned safely. The whole time, the boys were in Smith's car at the bottom of nearby John D. Long Lake, authorities said. Investigators said Smith's story didn't add up. Carjackers usually just want a vehicle, so investigators asked why they would let Smith out but not her kids. The traffic light where Smith said she had stopped when her car was taken would only be red if another car was waiting to cross, and Smith said no other cars were around. Other bits and pieces of the story did not make sense. Smith ultimately confessed to letting her car roll down a boat ramp and into the lake. A re-creation by investigators showed it took six minutes for the Mazda to dip below the surface, while cameras inside the vehicle showed water pouring in through the vents and steadily rising. The boys' bodies were found dangling upside-down in their car seats, one tiny hand pressed against a window. Smith says she was 'scared' The 1995 trial of the young mother became a national sensation and a true-crime touchstone. Smith's lawyers said she was remorseful, was suffering a mental breakdown and intended to die alongside her children but left the car at the last moment. They were successful at sparing her life. 'I just felt strongly that had the Black man with the toboggan committed the crime, people would expect the death penalty,' Pope said at Wednesday's hearing. 'If David Smith had committed the crime, people would have expected the death penalty.' The parole board asked Smith about the law enforcement resources used to try to locate her children. In reply, she told the board she was 'just scared' and 'didn't know how to tell them.' Smith's crime traumatized not only her family, prosecutor Kevin Brackett said, but also people in South Carolina and around the country who 'fixated' on this 'global sensation.' Her allegation that a Black man kidnapped her children also led to other Black men being wrongfully pulled over as police searched for a 'fictitious man,' he said. From prison, Smith can make phone calls and answer text messages, many from journalists and interested men. Those messages and phone calls were released under South Carolina's open records act, something Smith didn't initially realize could happen. She said the invasion of her privacy upset her, along with the public revelation that she was juggling conversations about the future with several men. Some men know why she is famous. Others are more coy. One told her he was going to use the dates of her birthday and those of her dead sons when he played the Powerball lottery. Others chatted about their lives and sports. Many promised her a home on the outside and a happy life. Smith also had sex with guards. And she violated prison policies by giving out contact information for friends, family members and her ex-husband to a documentary producer who discussed paying her for her help, according to Pope.	https://www.voanews.com/a/susan-smith-denied-parole-30-years-after-drowning-sons-by-rolling-car-into-lake-/7871304.html	2024-11-20T16:26:41-08:00

Development bloc concerned about Mozambique’s post-election violence	Mount Hampden, ZIMBABWE — The Southern African Development Community held an extraordinary summit of heads of state in Zimbabwe on Wednesday to discuss the post-election strife in Mozambique and the conflict in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo. Mozambique has been rocked by violence since last month’s elections, with police accused of killing at least 30 protesters, according to civil society organizations there. The opposition accuses the FRELIMO government, which was represented by Mozambican President Filipe Nyusi, of stealing the October 9 elections. 'Summit received an update of the Republic of Mozambique on the post-election political and security situation in the country and reaffirmed its unwavering commitment to work with the Republic of Mozambique in ensuring peace, security and stability through the relevant structures of the SADC organ on politics, defense and security cooperation,' said the group's executive secretary, Elias Magosi. 'Summit extended condolences to the government and people of the Republic of Mozambique for the lives lost during the post-election violence.' Earlier in the day, Magosi said those aggrieved in Mozambique should pursue legal solutions instead of resorting to violence. Zimbabwean President Emmerson Mnangagwa, who holds the rotating chairmanship of SADC, did not speak about the situation in Mozambique during his eight-minute closing remarks. He talked only about the conflict in eastern DRC. Since 2022, the Congolese army has been fighting a rebel army with the assistance of soldiers from some SADC countries. Speaking from Maputo via WhatsApp before Mnangagwa’s speech, Albino Forquilha of the Optimist Party for the Development of Mozambique (PODEMOS) — which is protesting together with supporters of Venancio Mondlane, the runner-up in last month's disputed presidential election — said they were not reading much into the SADC meeting. 'The PODEMOS party has mobilized people to protest the result that was announced by the electoral commission of Mozambique, which presented results which differ with those that were collected on the voting tables [polling stations],' Forquilha said. 'So, we are requesting fair elections. The constitutional court, which is the last institution to give results in a transparent manner — it’s important to call representatives of competing political parties when they validate the election. Everyone can accept them, because the [confirming] process of these two different numbers has been transparent. This is what we are requesting now.' Opposition parties in Mozambique disagree that FRELIMO’s candidate, Daniel Chapo, won the presidential election. In a state of the nation address on Tuesday, Nyusi invited the four presidential candidates for a dialogue as part of a bid to end post-election protests.	https://www.voanews.com/a/development-bloc-concerned-about-mozambique-s-post-election-violence-/7871296.html	2024-11-20T16:13:47-08:00

Sharing information 'is delivering freedom,' Jimmy Lai says at Hong Kong trial	washington — Wearing a gray jacket and flanked by prison officers, pro-democracy publisher Jimmy Lai smiled and waved to supporters Wednesday as he entered the Hong Kong courtroom. For his son, Sebastien, Lai's testimony at his national security trial hearing was a chance to see — from afar — how his 77-year-old father is doing. Sebastien Lai followed the hearing from Washington, where he has been advocating for his father's release. Lai's international legal team says the publisher has been denied access to specialized medical care for diabetes. Based on Wednesday's court appearance, Sebastien said it's clear that his father's physical health has worsened. 'It's incredibly heartbreaking that he spent the last almost four years in solitary confinement,' he said Wednesday during a press conference. After the press conference, Lai told VOA that it was 'bittersweet' to see that his father's mental health has remained strong, even as his physical health has worsened. 'His spirit is holding strong. His mind is holding strong,' Sebastien told VOA. Lai accused of sedition Jimmy Lai's court appearance on Wednesday marked the first time the former publisher provided testimony in a high-profile trial that started nearly one year ago. The case was initially expected to last about 80 days. His international legal team now expects the trial to continue into 2025. Lai is accused of collusion with foreign forces and sedition. The British national rejects the charges, but if convicted, he faces life in prison. Rights groups and foreign governments have condemned the case against Lai as politically motivated, which Hong Kong officials dispute. In a more than 700-word statement to VOA, a Hong Kong government spokesperson said it was 'inappropriate' to comment on the case because legal proceedings are ongoing. The spokesperson said that Hong Kong 'rejected any fact-twisting remarks and baseless smears against the legal system and safeguarding of rights and freedom in Hong Kong.' Publisher strived to deliver 'freedom' A one-time billionaire, Lai founded the Apple Daily newspaper in 1995. The newspaper closed in 2021 after authorities jailed its staff, raided its office, and froze millions of its assets. In court, Lai said he decided to get into the media business 'to participate in delivering information, which is delivering freedom.' 'The more information you have, the more you are in the know, the more you're free,' Lai said. 'The core values of Apple Daily are actually the core values of the people of Hong Kong,' Lai added. These values, he said, include the 'rule of law, freedom, pursuit of democracy, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom of assembly.' Lai told the court that he opposed violence and 'never allowed' his newspaper's staff to advocate for Hong Kong independence, which he characterized as a 'conspiracy' and 'too crazy to think about.' Earlier in the trial, prosecutors alleged that Lai had requested that foreign governments, including the United States, impose sanctions or 'engage in other hostile activities' aimed at the Hong Kong or Chinese governments. In court, Lai testified that he had 'never' used his foreign contacts to influence foreign policy on Hong Kong. Lai's plight illustrates how press freedom and broader civil liberties have declined in Hong Kong following the implementation of Beijing's national security law in 2020, according to Caoilfhionn Gallagher KC, the head of Lai's international legal team. 'Jimmy Lai is on trial in Hong Kong, but journalism is on trial in Hong Kong, too,' Gallagher said Wednesday at the Washington press conference. Earlier this year, Hong Kong introduced a new law known as Article 23 that rights experts say will erode civil liberties even more. In September, two journalists from Hong Kong's now-shuttered Stand News were sentenced to jail for sedition. And this week, 45 pro-democracy activists were sentenced to prison under the national security law. Lai's case symbolizes the broader assault on freedoms taking place in Hong Kong, according to Gallagher. 'His case was designed to send a chill down the spine of anyone who might want to wear a T-shirt or sing a song or post a Tweet or say anything which might stand up to Hong Kong or Beijing's leaders,' Gallagher told VOA at the press conference. Lai's son 'cautiously optimisic' There are currently more than 1,900 political prisoners jailed in Hong Kong, according to the Washington-based nonprofit Hong Kong Democracy Council. Diplomatic pressure will be the key to securing Lai's release, Gallagher said. She cited this past August's historic prisoner swap between Russia and the United States, which included the release of American journalists Alsu Kurmasheva and Evan Gershkovich, as an example of the kind of creative thinking that is needed to help Lai. 'With creativity and political will, you can do what might seem impossible,' Gallagher said. Lai's son Sebastien said he remains 'cautiously optimistic' about the prospect of his father's freedom. 'I'm incredibly proud of what he's doing, and I think he knows that he's also doing the right thing,' Sebastien said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/sharing-information-is-delivering-freedom-jimmy-lai-says-at-hong-kong-trial/7871272.html	2024-11-20T15:29:41-08:00	
Lower turkey costs set table for cheaper US Thanksgiving feast this year	Inflation-weary consumers should see the cost of their classic Thanksgiving dinner gobble less of their paychecks this year, largely because Americans are buying less of the meal's centerpiece dish, turkey. The price tag of the traditional holiday meal, which also includes cranberries, sweet potatoes and stuffing, has dropped for a second consecutive year, according to the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual survey released on Wednesday. Cooks can thank the bird. Turkey prices dropped 6% on cooling demand as some consumers opted to add beef and pork to the menu, the Farm Bureau and market analysts said. Still, the meal's price tag will cost families about 19% more than pre-pandemic times, the Farm Bureau said. Frustration over high prices was seen as a major factor in Donald Trump's presidential election victory over Kamala Harris, but the Farm Bureau data suggests some of the worst inflation has abated. 'We are seeing modest improvements in the cost of a Thanksgiving dinner for a second year, but America's families, including farm families, are still being hurt by high inflation,' said Farm Bureau President Zippy Duvall. Cheaper meal The average cost for a 10-person meal came to $58.08, down from $61.17 last year and a record $64.05 in 2022, Farm Bureau data showed. The price of a turkey, which represents the bulk of the bill, fell even as supplies dropped 6% in 2024 partly because of a bird-flu outbreak. Turkey demand of 13.9 pounds per person in 2024 is down nearly a pound from 2023, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. Like most grocery items, turkey prices rose alongside overall inflation in recent years, which may have spooked consumers in 2024, said Ashley Kohls, the Minnesota Turkey Growers Association's executive director. 'We're working on bringing folks back to purchasing turkey after a number of years of having elevated prices at the grocery store,' Kohls said. Indiana turkey farmer Greg Gunthorp said his customers appear to have plenty of supply to meet consumer demand this year. There have been far fewer frantic calls from buyers scrambling to restock, he said. 'We've had those outlier years when there just aren't enough turkeys to go around and our phones are just ringing off the hook. This is definitely not one of those years,' Gunthorp said. 'I think lots of people are adding items to the menu in addition to the turkey, things like brisket and ham.' The Farm Bureau survey found that the price of other ingredients in the Thanksgiving meal also fell, including the cost of fresh vegetables and whole milk, although the price of processed ingredients, such as dinner rolls and cubed stuffing, increased.	https://www.voanews.com/a/lower-turkey-costs-set-table-for-cheaper-us-thanksgiving-feast-this-year/7871291.html	2024-11-20T15:22:23-08:00	
About 1,500 migrants form US-bound caravan in Mexico	TAPACHULA, Mexico — About 1,500 migrants, mainly from Central and South America, formed a caravan Wednesday in southern Mexico, hoping to walk or catch rides to the U.S. border. Some say they are hoping to reach the United States before Donald Trump's inauguration in January, thinking it might be more difficult after that. They began walking from Tapachula, near the border with Guatemala, where thousands of migrants are stranded because they do not have permission to cross further into Mexico. What are migrant caravans? Migrant caravans began forming in 2018, and they became a final, desperate hope for poorer migrants who do not have the money to pay smugglers. If migrants try to cross Mexico alone or in small groups, they are often either detained by authorities and sent back to southern Mexico or, worse, deported to their home countries. In that sense, there is safety in numbers: It is hard or impossible for immigration agents to detain groups of hundreds of migrants. So, police and immigration agents often try to pick off smaller groups and wait for the main body of the caravan to tire itself out. Usually, the caravans stop or fall apart within 250 kilometers (150 miles). What are the obstacles? There is no safety in numbers against threats, extortion or abduction by drug cartels in Mexico, which have become heavily involved in migrant trafficking. The cartels charge migrants or their smugglers for permission to cross their territories along the border. In addition, the gangs often kidnap migrants, hold them in terrible conditions or torture them until they call relatives to send money for their release. The biggest obstacle, though, is the searing heat, dehydration and distance — it is over 1,770 kilometers (1,100 miles) from Tapachula to the nearest border crossing at Matamoros, across from Brownsville, Texas. And that is the shortest, but also one of the most dangerous routes. It would mean 16 days of walking, with no rest stops. And many of the migrants come with their children. Why do they set out? Since migrants usually cannot find work to support themselves in Tapachula, most of the foreigners trapped there are desperate to leave. Some feel a sense of urgency. 'It is going to be more difficult' after Trump's January 20 inauguration. 'That's why we are going — in hopes of getting an appointment quicker, so we are able to cross before he takes office,' said Yotzeli Peña, 23, a migrant from Venezuela. 'That would be easier.' Weren't there changes to keep caravans from forming? This year, in a bid to stop people from gathering at the border to claim asylum, the U.S. government expanded areas where migrants can apply online for appointments to enter the United States to a large swath of southern Mexico. The CBP One cellphone app was instituted to make asylum claims more orderly. About 1,450 appointments are made available daily, encouraging migrants to get an appointment before they show up at the border. But the service was available only in northern and central Mexico. By extending the app south to Tapachula, officials hoped it would stem the rush north. But some migrants still want to be close to the border so that if they do get one of the cherished appointments, they can get to it quickly and not risk missing it. Trump has promised to end the app, reduce legal pathways to the U.S. and organize mass deportations. Do caravans ever reach the border? The biggest caravans formed in 2018 and 2019, and back then Mexican officials helped some of the migrants by arranging buses to border cities. But that created a backlash in those communities. Groups from those original caravans eventually reached the border. In caravans since then, most participants have sought out as many hitchhiking or paid rides as they can and often swarm empty trucks to hitch a ride on empty freight platforms. But that has become much harder as Mexican authorities discouraged buses, taxis and trucks from stopping to pick up migrants. In recent years, authorities have eventually offered temporary transit permits to dissolve the caravans.	https://www.voanews.com/a/about-1-500-migrants-form-us-bound-caravan-in-mexico/7871284.html	2024-11-20T15:10:10-08:00	
Myanmar photojournalist goes free after two years of imprisonment, torture	washington — Photojournalist Kyaw Swa Tun, who was released last week from Yangon’s notorious Insein Prison after serving more than two years, has recounted the brutal treatment he endured at the hands of prison guards in an exclusive interview with VOA. 'When the authorities learned I was a journalist,' he said, 'I was isolated, tortured privately and subjected to threats of further harm if any news about the prison leaked out.' Having been accused of 'insulting the state,' Kyaw, 27, was sentenced to three years of hard labor in January 2023 under Section 505(a) of the penal code, one of several key amendments to Myanmar’s colonial-era penal code made after the 2021 coup. Section 505(a) is widely seen as one of the junta’s primary means for charging journalists, student leaders and civil servants seen as a threat to their military rule. As a photojournalist, Kyaw captured iconic images of protest as people nationwide demonstrated in the streets because of the military coup. Myanmar’s military junta has systematically targeted journalists, aiming to silence independent reporting and dissent. According to Reporters Without Borders (RSF), Myanmar has become one of the world’s largest jailers of journalists, with dozens arbitrarily detained under charges such as incitement or spreading 'fake news.' 2022 arrest Kyaw was arrested by military security forces at his home in Yangon on September 8, 2022. 'They found a message on my phone where I had contacted an ethnic armed group to verify some facts,' he told VOA. 'I always made sure to carefully delete all my messages and contact numbers, but on that day, I wasn’t able to delete that particular message.' At the time of his arrest, he was working with the VOA Burmese-affiliated news outlet, Mizzima, in their fact-checking department. Mizzima had been forced underground after the military junta revoked their operating license, along with several other popular media outlets, due to their coverage of anti-coup protests. Mizzima and DVB are now based in a neighboring country, broadcasting online. 'The authorities accused me of spreading false information as part of my work with Mizzima News Agency and other outlets,' he told VOA. After his arrest, Kyaw was taken to an interrogation center, where he was detained for more than a month before being sentenced and sent to Insein prison in November. He recalled being brutally beaten by the prison authorities upon arrival. 'When they found out I was a journalist, they beat me even more,' he said. Inside Insein Prison Arriving at Insein Prison, journalists like Kyaw were subjected to degrading treatment, 'including body and cavity searches upon arrival.' He was violently beaten at the prison entrance, where he was forced to kneel for 45 minutes. 'The conditions were appalling. Upwards of 30 prisoners were crammed into a cell designed for 10,' where some suffocated to death amid poor ventilation, he said. 'The food provided wasn’t enough to sustain even one person.' Several prominent figures associated with Myanmar’s ousted government and civil society have died while in detention or shortly after their release. Zaw Myint Maung, 72, a senior member of Myanmar’s former ruling party, the National League for Democracy, and a close ally of the ousted leader Aung San Suu Kyi, died last month while serving a prison sentence. He had been battling leukemia since 2019. Win Khaing, 73, a former minister in Aung San Suu Kyi’s government, died 10 days ago, shortly after being released from prison due to the poor treatment he endured during his incarceration. Similarly, award-winning documentary filmmaker Pe Maung Same, 50, died in August, just three days after his medical parole from a prison. According to his wife, Khin Suu Htay, he suffered severe complications from tuberculosis exacerbated by the torture he endured during his arrest in 2022 and the harsh conditions in detention. The military junta has not allowed the International Committee of the Red Cross, or ICRC, to visit prisons in Myanmar since the coup. 'We consistently urge the ICRC to take action,' said Ambassador Kyaw Moe Tun, Myanmar’s permanent representative to the United Nations, who spoke with VOA on Sunday. 'In the past, the ICRC has visited prisons, and during these visits, prisoners’ rights were upheld to some extent. We have observed that their presence helps ensure these rights are respected. We strongly call on the ICRC to protect political prisoners and prevent further violations of their rights.' Enduring impact Despite his release, Kyaw still suffers psychologically. 'I can no longer feel safe. At night, even the sound of a dog barking or the sight of a car can startle me,' said Kyaw. He added that imprisonment, poor living conditions and torture have taken a toll on his health. Myanmar ranks 171 out of 180 countries on the global Press Freedom Index, making it one of the world’s most oppressive environments for journalists. 'If not for China’s population size, Myanmar would lead in the number of journalists imprisoned relative to its population,' said Toe Zaw Latt, secretary-general of the Independent Press Council Myanmar, a group formed last year to help promote media freedom and safety for journalists reporting in the country. Research by the VOA Burmese Service indicates that approximately 40 journalists are imprisoned across Myanmar. Among them is VOA contributor Sithu Aung Myint, who was sentenced to 12 years in prison for 'sedition,' among other charges. He had been providing news analysis for a VOA Burmese weekly program until his arrest in August 2021. 'The junta has weaponized laws like Section 505(a) to suppress dissenting voices and control the narrative,' Toe Zaw Latt told VOA. 'This is a deliberate attempt to silence journalists and ensure that only the military’s version of the truth is disseminated.' Journalists and press freedom advocates are urging the international community to take stronger action. 'If the international community is serious about democracy and stability in Myanmar, they must support independent journalism,' Toe Zaw Latt said. 'Journalists are the messengers who expose atrocities and violence on the ground. Without them, the world would remain blind to the realities in Myanmar. Supporting them is not just about protecting individuals; it’s about safeguarding truth and democracy.'	https://www.voanews.com/a/myanmar-photojournalist-goes-free-after-two-years-of-imprisonment-torture/7871286.html	2024-11-20T15:08:05-08:00	
US House panel: No agreement on release of report on Trump's attorney general nominee	The U.S. House of Representatives Ethics Committee failed Wednesday to reach agreement on whether to release findings from its nearly finished investigative report on former Republican Representative Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump’s nominee for attorney general. The panel’s chair, Republican Representative Michael Guest, emerged from a lengthy committee meeting, saying, 'There was no agreement by the committee to release the report.' He declined further comment. The other nine committee members — four Republicans and five Democrats — also did not comment immediately. Gaetz was accused of sexual misconduct and illicit drug use before he was picked by Trump to become the country’s top law enforcement official in the new administration that takes office on January 20. Two news outlets, ABC News and The Washington Post, reported that the committee had obtained documents that showed Gaetz paid two women who appeared before the committee as witnesses a total of more than $10,000 between July 2017 and late January 2019. The women, who were over the age of 18 at the time of the payments, told the panel that some of the money was for sex. A Trump transition spokesman defended Gaetz in a statement. 'The Justice Department received access to roughly every financial transaction Matt Gaetz ever undertook and came to the conclusion that he committed no crime. These leaks are meant to undermine the mandate from the people to reform the Justice Department,' with Gaetz at the head of the agency, the spokesman said. Several U.S. senators, Democrats and Republicans alike, are demanding that the report be released so they can consider the scope of Gaetz’s background as they undertake their constitutionally mandated role of confirming or rejecting a new president’s Cabinet nominees. Hours after Trump named him as a nominee, Gaetz, 42, resigned from Congress, even though he had just been reelected to a fifth term. His resignation ended the House Ethics Committee’s investigation, which had been nearing a conclusion. It remained uncertain whether the panel would divulge what conclusions lawmakers had reached. With the allegations hovering over him, Gaetz quickly became Trump’s most controversial selection for his Cabinet, although the president-elect has continued to support him and has been making calls to lawmakers to bolster his chances of confirmation. Gaetz was in the Capitol Wednesday to meet with some of the senators who will decide his fate. The Senate has not voted to reject a presidential nominee for a Cabinet position since 1989, with members of both political parties giving wide deference to new presidents to fill top-level jobs with appointees of their choosing. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said he met with Gaetz and Vice President-elect JD Vance, still a sitting senator, and told them there would be 'no rubber stamps, no lynch mobs' in the confirmation process. 'These allegations will be dealt with in committee, but [Gaetz] deserves a chance to confront his accusers,' Graham told reporters. The Justice Department investigated the allegations against him but last year declined to bring any charges. Senate Democrats on the Judiciary Committee that will consider the Gaetz nomination asked the FBI to release the evidentiary file from its investigation. That material would include interviews with a woman who said she was paid to have sex with Gaetz when she was 17. Gaetz has denied the accusations. Representative Dean Phillips, a Democrat who previously served on the House Ethics Committee, said Gaetz's situation — a former member of Congress nominated for one of the most powerful jobs in the U.S. government — is an argument in favor of releasing the report. 'He's not just gone [from the House]. He's now been nominated for a very important position in this country, which is the chief legal officer, if you will, of the country. It would seem bizarre and incongruent with any ethical principle to not release it,' Phillips said. House Speaker Mike Johnson, who leads the narrow Republican majority in the House, has said he is opposed to the release of the as-yet unfinished report by the House Ethics Committee because Gaetz is no longer a member of Congress. But reports about wrongdoing by other former members of Congress have been released in a few instances in the past. Ultimately, the Senate, which Republicans will control by at least a 52-48 margin next year, will decide whether to confirm Gaetz, who has never worked at the Justice Department or served as a prosecutor at any level of government. But Gaetz, like other Trump nominees for top government jobs, has been a vocal supporter of the president and his Make America Great Again agenda. Gaetz, however, angered some fellow Republican lawmakers in the House in 2023 by spearheading the effort to oust then-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who eventually was replaced by Johnson.	https://www.voanews.com/a/us-house-panel-no-agreement-on-release-of-report-on-trump-s-attorney-general-nominee/7871276.html	2024-11-20T14:55:20-08:00	
Some US weapons may be delivered to Ukraine after Biden's term ends, Pentagon says	Some U.S. weapons deliveries to Ukraine may take place after President Joe Biden's term ends in January, Pentagon officials tell VOA, noting it will take time for certain capabilities to arrive in Ukraine. 'As you know, some equipment and some systems can get to Ukraine very quickly, and you've seen that happen within days or weeks. Sometimes, it does take longer … and that could be longer than weeks; that could be months,' Pentagon Deputy Press Secretary Sabrina Singh said November 14 in response to a question from VOA. Singh noted that under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, or USAI, weapon deliveries could take years. 'The long and short of it is, is that some equipment does get to Ukraine exceptionally quickly. But then there are some that take longer,' she said. The United States has remaining funds for two main programs supporting Ukraine’s defense — PDA, or Presidential Drawdown Authority, and USAI. The first program allows weapons to be provided from existing U.S. stockpiles, ensuring faster delivery. The second program involves purchasing weapons from industry, a process that can take longer. As of November, the U.S. has around $9 billion left for military assistance for Ukraine, the Pentagon has reported. Of this, approximately $7 billion is available under the PDA program, including around $4 billion approved by Congress in April and an additional $2.8 billion made available after accounting adjustments by the Department of Defense. Some $2.2 billion is available through the USAI program. On November 20, the U.S. announced an additional security assistance package for Ukraine valued at $275 million. It included munitions for rocket systems, artillery rounds and anti-tank weapons. Pentagon officials have confirmed to VOA that the Department of Defense is committed to allocating all remaining PDA funds authorized by Congress before January 20 and additional funds made available due to recalculations. The exact total will depend on ongoing assessments of Ukraine's defense needs and the logistics of assistance delivery. U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin has said that some weapons deliveries to Ukraine could take time. 'Everything won't be delivered immediately,' he told reporters during a visit to Italy in October. 'Things that we're purchasing now, for example, may wind up showing up a couple of months later.' The secretary added that some materiel from U.S. stocks is refurbished before being delivered to Ukraine. 'And again, it's not instantaneous, it may take weeks or in some cases, a couple of months,' he said. Austin underscored that the Pentagon has provided a plan to the Ukrainians and is confident that weapon deliveries will proceed according to the expected schedule. If the incoming Trump administration decided to stop some remaining deliveries, they could do so. In this case, however, they would have to de-obligate aid that was previously obligated by the Biden administration, Austin said last month in Italy. On November 12, Pentagon spokesperson Major General Pat Ryder said that between the passage of the supplemental funding by Congress in April and the middle of October, the U.S. has delivered 83% of committed munitions from its stockpiles, 67% of other critical air defense commitments and 60% of artillery and close air support capabilities. 'Since the passage of the supplemental, we've delivered hundreds of thousands of artillery rounds, thousands of armored vehicles, thousands of munitions for HIMARS and antitank weapons, dozens of artillery systems, significant air defense capabilities, including a Patriot battery, hundreds of interceptors and dozens of other systems,' Ryder said. 'And together with our allies and partners, the deliveries of the strategic air defense system we committed to providing at the NATO summit are nearly completed,' he said.	https://www.voanews.com/a/some-us-weapons-may-be-delivered-to-ukraine-after-biden-term-ends-pentagon-says/7871204.html	2024-11-20T13:31:48-08:00
